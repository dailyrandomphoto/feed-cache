										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, the tech and venture scene in Latin America has been </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/latin-americas-digital-transformation-is-making-up-for-lost-time/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">growing at an accelerated pace</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. More global investors are backing startups in the region and certain sectors in particular, such as fintech, are exploding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global investors are not only pouring money into companies. They’re also investing in funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Volpe Capital  announced the $80 million first close of its fund targeting high growth technology investments in Latin America. Notably, Japanese investment conglomerate SoftBank, BTG and Banco Inter affiliates are anchor investors in the new fund, which is targeting aggregate commitments of $100 million with a hard cap of $150 million. Volpe also received a &#8220;large anchor investment&#8221; from its management team.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andre Maciel, Gregory Reider and Milena Oliveira are the fund’s founding partners, and are based in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Notably, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maciel is the former managing partner at SoftBank’s $5 billion Latin America-focused innovation fund. He launched Volpe in 2019 primarily with SoftBank’s backing. Reider formerly invested at Warburg Pincus.</span></p>
<p>Maciel said the fund&#8217;s raise was &#8220;significantly oversubscribed with firm commitments&#8221; and believed to be &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">among the best capital raises for a first-time fund in its asset class in Latin America.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volpe Capital plans to invest in about 15 companies over a two and half year time span, according to Maciel, who expects its average check size to be around $5 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, it’s backed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uol Edtech, a subsidiary of Grupo Uol that aims to redefine the digital learning experience in Brazil. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are in no rush,” Maciel told TechCrunch. “We are happy with our first deal and will take capital preservation in consideration. We believe markets are hot now and plan on taking advantage of the cycle by being patient.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund’s strategy is to go after the companies that are not actively raising capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to invest in companies that are not necessarily raising capital when we approach them,” Maciel said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund views itself as agnostic regarding stage and primary versus secondary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is seeking to back early-stage companies with less than $50 million in valuation as well as some later stage, high growth companies. The fund’s first investment &#8212; Uol Edtech &#8212; falls in the latter category with EBITDA margins above 30%, according to Maciel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volpe plans to avoid capital intensive industries, even if related to tech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Those are more suitable to investors with deeper pockets than Volpe,” Maciel said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead it’s eyeing edtech, healthtech, software and fintech investments (that are not credit-related).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We like sectors that are prone for disruption in Latin America and that require local customization,” Maciel said. “Given the stage of the vc/growth industry in Latin America, we believe it is better to be a generalist.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoftBank International CEO Marcelo Claure describes Maciel as one of his “amazing founding partners for SoftBank in Latin America.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are very happy to be one of Volpe’s anchor investors and look forward to continuing our relationship with them,” he added in a written statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another anchor investor has a SoftBank tie. João Vitor Menin, CEO of Inter, a publicly traded fintech platform in Brazil with a market cap of over  $7 billion, points out that Maciel led an investment in Inter’s platform through SoftBank. He also “made valuable contributions” as a board member, according to Menin.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On January 6, America watched in horror as groups that recruited and organized on major social media sites violently attacked the seat of American democracy. Within a matter of hours, tech companies took actions they’d said we’re out of the question for years.</p>
<p>But real change requires thoughtful policy and a clear-eyed look at the choices that allowed dangerous extremism to thrive in the first place. We spoke with <a href="https://www.adl.org/">Anti-Defamation League</a> CEO Jonathan Greenblatt on proposed policy solutions and tech&#8217;s coming era of accountability at TechCrunch Sessions: Justice 2021.</p>
<hr />
<h3>On how the ADL ramped up its efforts in Silicon Valley:</h3>
<p>Given the rise of online hate, harassment and dangerous misinformation, tech companies are increasingly on the radar for civil rights organizations. It&#8217;s now common to see organizations like the ADL to participate in pressure campaigns aiming to change platforms&#8217; policies and sign onto legislation proposing regulations for the industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;So at the ADL, we&#8217;re the oldest anti hate organization in the world. But we deeply believe that today, the frontline and fighting hate is really on Facebook. I mean, there&#8217;s just no question that social media has become a breeding, breeding ground for kind of bigotry, that is offensive and ugly in all respects. Now, we&#8217;ve known this for years. But when I came on board, about five and a half years ago, I really wanted to focus on this, and try to get causal and right to the heart of the problem. So we could finally turn it around. So in 2017, we actually opened an office in Silicon Valley, our Center for Technology and Society, we were the first civil rights group with an actual presence in the valley. And for me, that was sort of second nature, because I had worked in the valley for years before taking this job, you know, both raising money on Sandhill road, managing teams of engineers building products.&#8221; (Timestamp: 0:53)</p></blockquote>

<h3>How algorithms make social media uniquely dangerous:</h3>
<p>Algorithms are what sets social networks apart from more traditional media sources. Rather than seeking it out, the average internet user has extreme ideas served directly to them through algorithms that decide what they see. This is particularly an issue with Facebook and YouTube&#8217;s way of keeping users engaged for as long as possible.</p>
<blockquote><p>Algorithmic amplification has a lot to do with the dilemma that we found ourselves in, and extremists are, if nothing else innovative, they exploit loopholes. And indeed, they have used the kind of libertarian laissez faire attitude of the companies to their own advantage for a number of years. And so from Facebook groups to YouTube channels to kind of accounts on Twitter, let alone all the other platforms, they&#8217;ve used them with tremendous depth, depth. So what&#8217;s interesting is, and many people that I know have seen this, I&#8217;ve seen this myself, you may have to I&#8217;m sure your audience has. It wasn&#8217;t too long ago that you might watch a YouTube video and one click or two clicks over, suddenly find yourself down the rabbit hole of some crazy QAnon or anti vaxxer you know, Boogaloo content. Same thing on Facebook.</p>
<p>When you search a piece of content, suddenly, you&#8217;re served up Facebook groups that may be from accelerationist, or white supremacists, or other racist and anti Semites. But the reality that we&#8217;ve got to confront is that algorithms aren&#8217;t our right, if you will, algorithmic amplification isn&#8217;t a privilege which should be accorded to everyone. It&#8217;s a responsibility that the companies have to make sure that their products give users what they want, but that they&#8217;re also not abused. And that the users themselves are not abused, to seeing the kind of things to which they might be very viable. Robots are susceptible. So we deeply believe that algorithmic amplification is very problematic. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve been supporting legislation on Capitol Hill that will finally address this&#8230; If you could basically turn off the algorithms for some of these worst elements, you could have curbed these issues a long time ago.

<h3>How social media companies failed before the Capitol attack:</h3>
<p>In the immediate aftermath of the attack on the Capitol, social media companies suddenly made a number of changed that belied how reluctant they&#8217;d been to address the hate and extremism brewing on their platforms all along.</p>
<blockquote><p>To those of us who&#8217;ve been tracking violent extremists for years. This was not a surprise at all, this was the most predictable terror attack in American history. Literally, these groups told us in advance what they were going to do. And the attack itself was sort of the culmination of years and in the last in the months prior intense campaigning by the President himself, to undermine the integrity of the election, to question the democratic process, to call on individuals to interrupt the certification of the election based on this big lie, this totally contrived idea that somehow the election was rigged. I mean, truly, it was bananas.</p>
<p>&#8230; The tech companies who for years have told us there was a political exemption, and they wouldn&#8217;t necessarily take action when presidents or other politicians said things that were outrageous, and committed slander or incited violence on the platform, suddenly, because of the public pressure from groups like Stop Hate for Profit and the ADL, from internal pressure from their own employees, and I believe, you know, their boards — suddenly they took action instantaneously, overnight. All their other concerns sort of fell by the wayside. I think it was really important that in order Facebook and Twitter and YouTube took down President Trump, that was critical, we called for them to do that. And I&#8217;m really pleased that they did. We called for them previously to take down armed militia groups, to take down QAnon content. And I&#8217;m really glad that they did and it had a huge impact.</p>
<p>You know, we&#8217;ve seen like on Twitter QAnon content drop 97% you know, just days after the attack, because the company actually took action. So I think it really laid bare the myth that somehow, some way the companies couldn&#8217;t do anything about this, clearly they could. And they did. And I think their services and society as a whole is better for it. (Timestamp: 7:53)</p></blockquote>

<h3>On Silicon Valley exceptionalism</h3>
<p>The tech industry doesn&#8217;t think of itself like other traditional sectors of business, instead often casting its own grand pursuits as for the greater good — not just for profits. Those attitudes can contribute to some extraordinary innovations, but they also permeate its products and cultures in ways that create some serious problems.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think Silicon Valley is almost like, rooted in this American tradition of like, Manifest Destiny, right? conquering the frontier. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s ironic, but altogether appropriate, that&#8217;s happening in California, right in the land where they have the Gold Rush, right again, where people went to make their fortunes. And now they&#8217;re doing it today in Silicon Valley, in tech, and even that&#8217;s continued to evolve, right? It was the internet 15 years ago, five years ago, with social media. Today, it&#8217;s Clubhouse, and I don&#8217;t know what comes next. But I do think that the whole industry does need to undergo a serious self examination.</p>
<p>And I think you&#8217;ve seen people like who&#8217;ve come out of the industry, I think about Chris Sacca, the former Googler, I think about Alexis Ohanian, the Redditor, and a few others start to grapple with these issues. You know, trust, my friend, Tristan Harris, at the Center for Humane Technology has also done this in his film — The Social Dilemma really plays this out. Whereas Silicon Valley often has a very short memory, the reality is that we there will be a long road ahead of us. And if we don&#8217;t wrestle with these demons, and if we don&#8217;t sort again, through the wreckage to what they&#8217;ve wrought, I think the future is very unclear.

</ul>
<hr />
<h3>On policy solutions to rein in big tech</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s a huge swath of policy proposals on the table that could put some real restrictions on how tech companies operate.  From proposed changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to federal and state antitrust suits, tech companies are on notice in 2021.</p>
<blockquote><p>So look, the ADL, I mean, we&#8217;ve been literally fighting for a more just country, we&#8217;ve been fighting for civil rights, we&#8217;ve been fighting hate for over 100 years. And we are fiercely, ferociously, defenders of the First Amendment. But freedom of speech isn&#8217;t the freedom to slander people, right to freedom of expression isn&#8217;t the freedom to incite violence against individuals or groups of people based on their immutable characteristics? And so I think what we&#8217;ve seen is the first amendment been warped and weaponized online in ways that are, you know, completely beyond the pale of what the founding fathers ever would have, you know, could have imagined.</p>
<p>Section 230 does need to be addressed. And I think that Warner Hirono bill that you pointed out is a step in the right direction, it is definitely not sufficient&#8230; It might actually not be the federal government, but the states that actually pushed the companies to do more, we&#8217;ve seen California, do some innovative stuff on privacy that&#8217;s pushed the companies and you may see, I think more state action.

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is our Wednesday show, where we niche down and focus on a single topic, or theme. This is our sweet spot: going beyond definitions and into the dirty and deep impact of how a phenomenon could impact startups and tech. We are hoping to explore more than answer, and debate more than agree.</p>
<p>NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, is this week&#8217;s topic! This is something that you have nearly certainly heard of in the past few weeks but probably don&#8217;t understand with perfect clarity. While we&#8217;ve all seen the Twitter threads of basic definitions, consider this episode the appetizer to your aperitif understanding.</p>
<p>The Equity team put on our research caps, dug in, and found quite a lot to like. But we did not tread alone: our EIC <a href="https://twitter.com/panzer">Matthew Panzarino</a> joined <a href="http://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> to help us out. Panzer was early to the NFT world and has contributed some of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/memes-for-sale/">TechCrunch’s reporting on the matter</a>.</p>
<p>So, what did we get into? More than a little:</p>
<p>We spent a few minutes on the NFT basics, including historical examples and how NFTs are minted, as well as some examples of how they have been used recently.</p>
<p>From there we riffed on use-cases more broadly, and where we might find NFTs in the wild. Sure, we talked about visual art, but also music, tickets and sports moments. The NFT world has the possibility of a large remit if it plays its, <em>ahem</em>, tokens correctly.</p>
<p>Then we talked culture. What could it mean that NFTs are in the market? Could residual incomes from the reselling of NFTs constitute a material revenue base for future artists, and how broad can the value-experiment go? Depending on which side of the NFT hype-cynicism divide you land, there’s plenty of room for discussion. A point made by Panzer:</p>
<blockquote><p>NFT&#8217;s and the architecture of smart contracts and the way that social tokens work, these are all opportunities for the creators and originators of culture, to finally take part and participate in their rewards of the platforms of that culture &#8212; you know, that hosts that culture. Because we&#8217;ve seen it over and over again: Artist blows up on TikTok, and you know, somebody does a dance to them, and then that video blows up. What does the artist get out of it? Sometimes they get a recording deal. Many times they get nothing. Right? In Vine, famously built on Black creators and brown creators and Latino creators and Latino creators. You know, TikTok, very much the same. Black Twitter one of the early driving forces of engagement on Twitter and culture on Twitter &#8212; how many of them were actually able to participate in the economic rewards of Twitter as a platform selling advertising and making millions of dollars and their stock going bonkers? Besides, of course, you know, maybe they were able to purchase stock, right? So the, the remapping of how creators can participate in that economy directly by saying, “Hey, I&#8217;ve created something of value, and I&#8217;d love to connect directly with the people that enjoy that and they can provide me value back” &#8212; that’s what’s so exciting about this.</p></blockquote>
<p>And we chatted just a minute about the <em>weight</em>, or carbon footprint, of different blockchains. There’s real nuance to this point of argument, but it was also something we couldn’t avoid. Panzer again:</p>
<blockquote><p>And this is probably the biggest negative blowback on Ethereum and NFTs is that Ethereum is by nature a very heavy chain, which means that it takes a lot of work to prove that a block has been written to the chain. Not quite as heavy as Bitcoin, but it&#8217;s up there. And that energy usage that was used to mine that Ethereum that&#8217;s being spent on the chain to confirm a new transaction is being sort of credited forwards in&#8211; for lack of a better term to the artists minting on it. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s absolutely fair. But it&#8217;s absolutely fair to acknowledge that it does have an ecological impact.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Japan is often under discussed as an expansion target for American startups, but in the past few years it has become a top market for companies like Slack, Salesforce, Twitter and, more recently, Clubhouse. Today <a href="https://sipgp.com/">SIP Global Partners</a> is announcing a new fund to invest in early-stage U.S. startups that have the potential to expand into Japan, and potentially other Asian markets, too. The fund has raised a $75 million first close of its $150 million target, and already invested in five companies.</p>
<p>SIP&#8217;s new fund will look at late seed to Series B-stage companies that have a product, or one about to come to market, that is ready to expand internationally. The team will work closely with portfolio companies, helping them launch operations in Japan and other Asian markets.</p>
<p>Managing partner Justin Turkat told TechCrunch that Japan is a promising market for foreign startups partly because an undercapitalized venture capital ecosystem means there is a smaller pool of entrepreneurs, with many of the country&#8217;s top tech talent opting to join conglomerates or the government instead.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While Japan&#8217;s startup market has a lot of potential, he added, it is still nascent. On the other hand, Japan is now the largest source of <a href="https://stats.unctad.org/handbook/EconomicTrends/Fdi.html">outward foreign direct investment in the world</a>, and with about 125 million consumers and large corporations in need of scalable solutions, it&#8217;s a ripe market for new tech.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you look at what&#8217;s happened in the last couple of years, I think Japan is open for business with U.S. startups with an urgency that I’ve never seen before, and we think there is a lot of tailwinds around it. You look at investments and partnerships with U.S. startups, it&#8217;s at record levels over the last five years and deal counts are increasing every year,&#8221; Turkat said.</p>
<p>The fund is being launched by four investors, based in the U.S. and Japan. Turkat and founder and managing partner Shigeki Saitoh, former director of the Japan Venture Capital Association, are in Tokyo, while general partner Jeffrey Smith and founder and managing partner Matthew Salloway are in Boston and New York, respectively.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason we started this really has to do with the team. We&#8217;ve all dedicated our careers to cross border, as both operators and investors, across the U.S. and Asia,&#8221; Turkat said. &#8220;All the four partners on average have about 20-plus years of experience doing this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the years, they&#8217;ve observed global expansion happening earlier in a startup&#8217;s life, he added. &#8220;I think it used to be an axiom that if you&#8217;re a U.S. startup and you&#8217;re venture-backed, you&#8217;re not thinking of expanding overseas until your Series D round,&#8221; but companies are now eyeing foreign markets as early as their seed rounds.</p>
<p>SIP&#8217;s new fund is looking for startups in three areas: creativity (augmented and extended reality, synthetic media and web-based platforms), productivity (artificial intelligence and machine learning, edge computing, the Internet of Things and semiconductors) and safety (digital health and information security).</p>
<p>Turkat said it is focusing on companies that provide core infrastructure or the economic layer for emerging technology.</p>
<p>For example, &#8220;on the infrastructure layer, we&#8217;re looking at 5G being rolled out globally simultaneously, then the edge computing, semiconductors, security and AI and machine learning, all around this infrastructure layer,&#8221; he said. Companies in the fund&#8217;s current portfolio that fit into this category include OpenRAN startup Parallel Wireless and Croquet, an ultra-low latency collaboration platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you have the economic layer with all of these advancements, the platforms and applications sitting on top of it,&#8221; Turkat added. These include the fund&#8217;s three other investments so far: Fable, a browser-based motion design platform, Tilt Five, an AR gaming platform, and Kinetic, an industrial IoT startup focused on workplace safety.</p>
<p>As a strategic investor, SIP works closely with startups as they expand into new countries. This includes hiring talent and finding initial business partners, including for distribution channels or potential joint ventures. After Japan, SIP also helps startups enter other Asian markets, especially in ASEAN, including Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://datagrail.io/">DataGrail</a>, a startup that helps customers understand where their data lives in order to help comply with a growing body of privacy regulations, announced a $30 million Series B today.</p>
<p>Felicis Ventures led the round with help from Basis Set Ventures, Operator Collective and previous investors. One of the interesting aspects of this round was the participation from several strategic investors including HubSpot, Okta and Next47, the venture firm backed by Siemens. The company has now raised over $39 million, according to Crunchbase data.</p>
<p>That investor interest could stem from the fact that DataGrail helps organizations find data by building connectors to popular applications and then helps ensure that they are in compliance with customer privacy regulations such as GDPR, CCPA and similar laws.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;DataGrail [is really] the first integrated solution with over 900 integrations (up from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/early-stage-privacy-startup-datagrail-gets-boost-from-okta-partnership/">180 in 2019</a>) to different apps and infrastructure platforms that allow the product to detect when new apps or new infrastructure platforms are added, and then also perform automated data discovery across those applications,&#8221; company CEO and co-founder Daniel Barber explained to me. This helps users find customer data wherever it lives and enables them to comply with legal requirements to manage and protect that data.</p>

<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;BigID keeps rolling with $70M Series D on $1B valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/bigid-keeps-rolling-with-70m-series-d-on-1b-valuation/embed/#?secret=m3OWXIRRzR" data-secret="m3OWXIRRzR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Victoria Treyger, general partner at lead investors Felicis Ventures says that one of the things that attracted her to DataGrail was that she had to help implement GDPR regulations at a previous venture and felt the pain first hand. She said that her firm tends to look for startups in large markets where the product or service being offered is a critical need, rather an option, and she believes that DataGrail is an example of that.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really liked the fact that privacy management is such a hard problem, and it is not optional. As a business, you have to manage privacy requests, which you may do manually or you may do it with a solution like DataGrail,&#8221; Treyger told me.</p>
<p>HubSpot&#8217;s Andrew Lindsay, who is SVP of corporate and business development, says his company is both a customer and an investor because DataGrail is helping HubSpot customers navigate the complexity of privacy regulation. &#8220;DataGrail&#8217;s unique ecosystem approach, where they are integrating with key Saas and business applications is an easy way for many of our joint customers to protect their customers&#8217; privacy,&#8221; Lindsay said.</p>
<p>The company has 40 employees today with plans to grow to 90 or 100 by the end of this year. It&#8217;s worth noting that Treyger is joining the Board, which already has 3 other women. That shows shows a commitment to gender diversity at the board level that is not typical for startups.</p>

They joined us at TC Sessions: Justice 2021 to talk about the deep origins and repercussions of bias in tech, and where to start when it comes to fixing them.</p>
<hr />
<h3>On bias in tech versus bias in people</h3>
<p>When it comes to identifying bias in tech, there are two ways of coming at it: the tech itself and the people who are putting it to work. A facial recognition system may be be racist itself (such as working poorly with dark skin) or used in furtherance of racist policies (like stop and frisk).</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Nkonde</strong>: There is the problem of technologies which are inherently racist, or sexist, or ableist, as Haben so beautifully pointed out. But there is another part&#8230; an imagination for technologies that could actually serve all people. And if the if the scientists who are creating those technologies don&#8217;t have experience outside of their own experiences, and we&#8217;re sitting in a moment where Google AI has got rid of [Margaret] Mitchell and Timnit Gebru, both of whom were technologists from, researchers from, minoritized communities who are thinking about new and different ways that tools could be designed&#8230; then you may not see them coming to products. I&#8217;d say that the two are definitely married. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 3:00)</strong></em></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

</ul>
<hr />
<h3>On the danger in &#8216;banal&#8217; technologies</h3>
<p>Bias does not only exist in controversial tech like facial recognition. Search engines, algorithmic news feeds, and other things we tend to take for granted also can contain harmful biases or contribute to them.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Noble</strong>: My concerns were with what we might think of as just banal technologies, things that we really don&#8217;t give a second thought to, and that also present themselves as widely neutral, and valuable. Of course this is where I became interested in looking at Google search, because Google&#8217;s own kind of declaration that they were interested in organizing all the world&#8217;s knowledge, I think was a pretty big claim. I&#8217;m coming out of the field of Library and Information Science and thinking about, I don&#8217;t know, thousands of years of librarians, for example, around the world, who have been indeed organizing the world&#8217;s knowledge, and what it means to have an advertising company, quite frankly, data mine our knowledge, but also commingle it with things like disinformation, propaganda, patently false information and ideas, and really flatten our ability to understand knowledge and good information. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 5:13)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h3>On how excluding groups harms them twice over</h3>
<p>Haben Girma, who is deaf and blind, has advocated for accessibility with the skills she learned at Harvard Law. But the lack of accessibility goes deeper than simply not captioning images properly and other small tasks.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Girma</strong>: So most of the technology that&#8217;s built was not imagined for disabled people, which is frustrating&#8230; and also absolutely ridiculous. Tech has so much potential to exist in visual forms, in auditory forms, in tactile forms, and even smell and taste. It&#8217;s up to the designers to create tools that everyone can use. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 0:56)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>A disturbing viral trend on TikTok recently questioned the story of deafblind icon Helen Keller. Doubt that she existed as described or did the things she did was widespread on the platform — and because TikTok is not designed for accessibility, others like Keller are excluded from the conversation and effectively erased from consideration in addition to being the subject of false claims.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Girma</strong>: Deafblind people have used technology for quite a while, and were early users of technology, including being designers and engineers. We are on many of the social media platforms, there are blind and deaf blind people on Twitter. TikTok was not designed with accessibility in mind.</p>
<p>When you have a space where there are few disabled people, ableism grows. People on TikTok have questioned the existence of Helen Keller, because the people on the platform can&#8217;t imagine how a deafblind person would write a book, or travel around the world. Things that are well documented that Helen Keller did. And there&#8217;s also lots of information on how blind and deaf blind people are doing these things today, writing books today, using technology today. So when you have these spaces where there are no disabled people, or very few disabled people, ableism and negative biases grow more rapidly. And that&#8217;s incredibly harmful, because the people there are missing out on talented, diverse voices.<em><strong> (Timestamp: 12:16)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h3>On tech deployed against black communities</h3>
<p>The flip side of racism within tech is ordinary tech being used by racist institutions. When law enforcement employs &#8220;objective&#8221; technology like license plate readers or biometric checks, they bring their own systematic biases and troubling objectives.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Nkonde</strong>: One of the things that that really brought me to was this whole host of technologies that when used by security forces, or police, reinforce these discriminatory impacts on black communities. So that could be the way license plate readers were used by ICE to identify cars, and when they pulled people over, they would do these additional biometric checks, whether it was fingerprinting or iris readers, and then use that to criminalize these people onto the road to deportation. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 17:16)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>And when the two forms of bias are combined, certain groups are put at serious disadvantage:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Nkonde</strong>: We&#8217;re seeing how all of these technologies on their own, are impacting black lives, but imagine when all of those technologies are together, imagine when, here in New York, I walked to the subway to take a train because I have to go to work. And my face is captured by a CCTV camera that could wrongly put me at the scene of a crime because it does not recognize my humanity, because black faces are not recognized by those systems. That&#8217;s a very old idea that really takes us back to this idea that black people aren&#8217;t human, they&#8217;re in fact three fifths of a human, which was at the founding of this country, right? But we&#8217;re reproducing that idea through technology. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 19:00)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h3>On the business consequences of failing to address bias and diversity</h3>
<p>While companies should be trying to do the right thing, it may help speed things up if there&#8217;s a financial incentive as well. And increasingly there is real liability resulting from failing to consider these problems. For instance, if your company produces an AI solution that&#8217;s found to be seriously biased, you not only lose business but may find yourself the subject of civil and government lawsuits.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Noble</strong>: I think that first of all, there&#8217;s a tremendous amount of risk by not taking up these issues. I&#8217;ve heard that the risk management profile, for example for a company like Facebook, in terms of harm, what they can&#8217;t solve with software and AI, that they use human beings, quite frankly to sort through, for example, the risk that they face is probably estimated around $2 billion, right?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re talking about a $2 billion risk, I think then this is a decision that exceeds the design desires and software engineers. <em><strong>(Timestamp 24:25)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Not just bias but unintended consequences need to be considered, such as how an app or service may be abused in ways the creators might not have thought of.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Noble</strong>: I think you have to think far beyond, you know, like, what you can do versus what you should do, or what&#8217;s ethical and responsible to do and I think these conversations now can no longer be avoided. This is a place where founders, venture capitalists, everything, every VC in the Valley on Sandhill road should have a person who is responsible for thinking about the adverse effects of the products that they might invest in. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 25:43)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h3>On getting people in the room before, not after the crisis</h3>
<p>The tendency to &#8220;ship it and fix it&#8221; rather than include accessibility from the ground up is increasingly being questioned by both advocates and developers. Turns out it&#8217;s better for everyone, and cheaper in the long run, to do it right the first time.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Girma</strong>: The answer to most of these questions is have the people involved. &#8216;Nothing about us without us&#8217; is the saying in the Disability Justice Movement, so if these seas and companies are thinking about investing in a solution that they think will be good for the world? Ask disability justice advocates, get us involved. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 29:25)</strong></em></p>
<p>We need the VCs to also connect with Disability Justice advocates, and really find someone who has knowledge and background in accessibility and tech. Same thing for any company. All the companies should have, technology existing and tech in the process of being built, should be consulting on accessibility. It&#8217;s easier to make something accessible if you design for accessibility, rather than trying to make it accessible afterwards. It&#8217;s like having an elevator in a physical building. You don&#8217;t build the structure, and then think about adding an elevator. You think about adding an elevator before you design it. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 30:55)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The wave of shared electric scooters that swept through cities several years ago helped Populus AI get its start. Now, surging demand for delivery — and the pressure it places on curb space — is helping the transportation data startup attract new capital and expand to more cities.</p>
<p>Populus, a San Francisco-based startup founded in 2017, has raised $5 million from new investors Storm Ventures and contract manufacturing and supplier company Magna along with existing backers<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Precursor, Relay Ventures and </span>Ulu Ventures. The company has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/14/populus-raises-3-1-million-to-help-cities-make-sense-of-shared-scooters-and-bikes/">raised nearly $9 million</a> to date.</p>
<p>Populus plans to use that capital to expand to more cities, growth that the company believes will be driven by demand for street and curb management. Populus has contracts with more than 80 cities, including Oakland, San Diego, and Tel Aviv, and works with more than 25 micromobility operators. Co-founder and CEO Regina Clewlow said their aim is to triple the number of cities over the next 18 months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Populus platform is a software as a service product that operates like a two-way street. The company pulls data from fleets of shared ebikes, scooters, mopeds and car-sharing and delivers that information to cities to help planners and regulators understand and manage how streets and curbs are used. Cities can also use the Populus API to share its rules of the road — restrictions on motorized vehicles, preferred scooter parking areas and information on bike lanes, for instance — to mapping platforms and any other third party.</p>
<p>&#8220;In recent years, there has been significant growth in venture-backed startups delivering software to cities, especially as transportation becomes increasingly connected and automated,&#8221; Frederik Groce, a partner at Storm Ventures and founder of BLCK VC said in a statement &#8220;Populus is uniquely positioned as the market leader to support cities&#8217; digital transformation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last year, Populus added a street manager to the platform to allow cities to communicate new policies such as slow or shared streets that prioritize bikes and pedestrians, areas designated for outdoor dining and construction closures.</p>
<p>The curb management feature, which was also added last year, will be the main driver of growth in 2021, Clewlow said. Cities can use that data to set dynamic pricing for curb space, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;What most cities really want to use our digital technology for is managing commercial fleets including delivery,&#8221; Clewlow said. Curb space is being used by both scheduled and on-demand vehicles, she said, adding that these areas are not designed for the volume of deliveries that occur today.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cities are continuing to see a boom in delivery; that&#8217;s a trend that predated COVID and obviously accelerated during COVID,&#8221; Clewlow said. &#8220;A real pain point for cities is managing how that space is used by commercial delivery vehicles.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Adobe has been moving quickly to update its imaging software to work natively on Apple&#8217;s new in-house processors for Macs, starting with the M1-based MacBook Pro and MacBook Air released late last year. After shipping native versions of Lightroom and Camera Raw, it&#8217;s now releasing an Apple Silicon-optimized version of Photoshop, which delivers big performance gain vs. the Intel version running on Apple&#8217;s Rosetta 2 software emulation layer.</p>
<p>How much better? Per internal testing, Adobe says that users should see improvements of up to 1.5x faster performance on a number of different features offered by Photoshop, vs. the same tasks being done on the emulated version. That&#8217;s just the start, however, since Adobe says it&#8217;s going to continue to coax additional performance improvements out of the software on Apple Silicon in collaboration with Apple over time. Some features are also still missing from the M1-friendly addition, including the &#8216;Invite to Edit Cloud Documents&#8217; and &#8216;Preset Syncing&#8217; options, but those will be ported over in future iterations as well.</p>
<p>In addition to the Apple Silicon version of Photoshop, Adobe is also releasing a new Super Resolution feature in the Camera Raw plugin (to be released for Lightroom later) that ships with the software. This is an image enlarging feature that uses machine learning trained on a massive image dataset to blow up pictures to larger sizes while still preserving details. Adobe has previously offered a super resolution option that combined multiple exposures to boost resolution, but this works from a single photo.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>It&#8217;s the classic &#8216;Computer, enhance&#8217; sci-fi feature made real, and it builds on work that Photoshop previously did to introduce its &#8216;Enhance details&#8217; feature. If you&#8217;re not a strict Adobe loyalist, you might also be familiar with Pixelmator Pro&#8217;s &#8216;ML Super Resolution&#8217; feature, which works in much the same way – albeit using a different ML model and training data set.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that Adobe&#8217;s Super Resolution will output an image with twice the horizontal and twice the vertical resolution – meaning in total, it has 4x the number of pixels. It&#8217;ll do that while preserving detail and sharpness, which adds up to allowing you to make larger prints from images that previously wouldn&#8217;t stand up to that kind of enlargement. It&#8217;s also great for cropping in on photos in your collection to capture tighter shots of elements that previously would&#8217;ve been rendered blurry and disappointing as a result.</p>
<p>This feature benefits greatly from GPUs that are optimized for machine learning jobs, including CoreML and Windows ML. That means that Apple&#8217;s M1 chip is a perfect fit, since it includes a dedicated ML processing region called the Neural Engine. Likewise, Nvidia&#8217;s RTX series of GPUs and their TensorCores are well-suited to the task.</p>
<p>Adobe also released some major updates for Photoshop for iPad, including version history for its Cloud Documents non-local storage. You can also now store versions of Cloud Documents offline and edit them locally on your device.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israel’s retrain.ai, which uses AI and Machine Learning to read job boards at scale and to gain insight into where the job market is going, has closed $9M Series A led by Square Peg. Since retrain.ai’s $4M seed round last year was unannounced (led by Hetz Ventures, with TechAviv and .406 Ventures participating) that means it’s raised a total of $13 million. It’s competitors include Pymetrics which has raised $56.6M and Eightfold.ai which has raised $176.8M.</p>
<p>As well as the funding, the company has secured a first deal with the Israeli Department of Labor to look at the changing nature of the Israeli job market in light of the pandemic.</p>
<p>With technology eating into the traditional labour market, retrain.ai says its  platform can look at what jobs are being advertised, which jobs are going down in popularity and see early-warning signals as to where new jobs are going to appear from. This can help form policy for large organiations and governments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>retrain.ai’s CEO is Dr. Shay David, who is best known for co-founding the video enterprise leader Kaltura, which first appeared at TehcCrunch’s first ever conference in 2007. Isabelle Bichler-Eliasaf is the company’s COO and Avi Simon, is retrain.ai’s CTO.</p>
<p>Dr. Shay David said: “What was once the regular tide of change in the workforce has evolved into a tsunami, especially pronounced by COVID-19 and its huge impact on the labor market– this has been a wake-up call. Unemployment and underemployment  is going to affect a billion people globally in the next few decades. Our vision is to help 10 million workers get the right jobs by 2025 and help organizations navigate efficiently through the wave of change.”<br />
 <br />
retrain.ai is the first investment by Square Peg’s new $450M fund. The VC previously invested in Canva, Stripe, Fiverr and Airwallex.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of last week&#8217;s launch of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/tiktok-launches-tiktok-qa-a-new-feature-for-creators-to-engage-with-users-questions/">new Q&amp;A format</a> for creators responding to viewer questions, TikTok today <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-tools-to-promote-kindness">announced</a> it&#8217;s rolling out new commenting features. Creators will now be able to control which comments can be posted on their content, before those comments go live. Another new addition, aimed at users who are commenting, will pop up a box that prompts the user to reconsider posting a comment that may be inappropriate or unkind.</p>
<p>TikTok says the goal with the new features is to maintain a supportive, positive environment where people can focus on being creative and finding community.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123517" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123517" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2123517" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Filter-All-Comments.png?w=383" alt="" width="383" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Filter-All-Comments.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Filter-All-Comments.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Filter-All-Comments.png?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Filter-All-Comments.png?resize=768,1365 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Filter-All-Comments.png?resize=383,680 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Filter-All-Comments.png?resize=864,1536 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Filter-All-Comments.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123517" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead of reactively removing offensive comments, creators who choose to use the new &#8220;Filter All Comments&#8221; feature will instead get to choose which comments appear on their videos. When enabled, they&#8217;ll need to go through each comment individually to approve them using a new comment management tool.</p>
<p>This feature builds on TikTok&#8217;s existing comment controls, which allow creators to filter spam and other offensive comments or filter by keywords, <a href="https://help.instagram.com/700284123459336?helpref=search&amp;sr=4&amp;query=comments%20approval&amp;search_session_id=dd63efbca742b7b604aa4fede671117e">similar to other social apps like Instagram</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123519" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123519" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2123519" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Reconsider.png?w=383" alt="" width="383" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Reconsider.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Reconsider.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Reconsider.png?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Reconsider.png?resize=768,1365 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Reconsider.png?resize=383,680 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Reconsider.png?resize=864,1536 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Reconsider.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123519" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>But Filter All Comments means comments won&#8217;t even go live at all unless the creator approves them. This gives creators full control over their presence on the platform and could prevent bullying and abuse. But it also could allow creators to get away with spreading false information without any pushback, or making it seem like they&#8217;re more well liked than they actually are. That could be troublesome &#8212; especially since brands making decisions about which creators to work with to promote their products could be getting the wrong impression about a user&#8217;s likability.</p>
<p>The other feature will instead push users to reconsider posting bad comments &#8212; meaning those that appear to be bullying or inappropriate. It will also remind users of TikTok&#8217;s <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang%3Den&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615416265819000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEXmfZjOY8NntYCjUhasmqUrHJs5Q">Community Guidelines</a> and allows users to edit their comments before sharing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123519" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123519" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2123519" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Reconsider.png?w=383" alt="" width="383" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Reconsider.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Reconsider.png?resize=84,150 84w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Reconsider.png?resize=169,300 169w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Reconsider.png?resize=768,1365 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Reconsider.png?resize=383,680 383w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Reconsider.png?resize=864,1536 864w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Reconsider.png?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123519" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>These sort of &#8220;nudges&#8221; help by slowing people down and giving them time to pause and think about what they&#8217;re saying, instead of being so quick to react. Already, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/tiktok-to-flag-and-downrank-unsubstantiated-claims-fact-checkers-cant-verify/">TikTok is using nudges</a> to ask users whether or not they want to share unsubstantiated claims that fact checkers can&#8217;t verify, in an attempt to slow the spread of misinformation.</p>
<p>It took other social networks years to add prompts that ask users to stop and think before posting. Instagram, for example, launched in 2010 but it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/08/instagram-anti-bullying-features/">was nearly a decade later before it decided to try a feature that prompted users</a> to reconsider before posting offensive comments. Twitter, meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/twitter-relaunches-test-that-asks-users-to-revise-harmful-replies/">just last month said</a> it was running another test that asks users to reconsider harmful replies. It&#8217;s been running variations of this same test for nearly a year.</p>
<p>Social networks have been hesitant to build in more prompts like this to their platforms, even though they&#8217;ve demonstrated a strong ability to influencer user actions. When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/twitter-read-before-retweet/">Twitter began prompting users</a> to read articles linked in a tweet before retweeting, for instance, users would open those articles 40% more often. But more often that not, networks choose to downrank or hide negative comments, like Instagram does with &#8220;<a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/national-bullying-prevention-month">View Hidden Comments</a>&#8221; or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/twitter-rolls-out-its-hide-replies-feature-to-all-users-worldwide/">Twitter with &#8220;Hide Replies.&#8221; </a></p>
<p>TikTok says it&#8217;s consulting with industry partners in developing its new policies and features, and today also announced a partnership with the <a href="https://cyberbullying.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cyberbullying.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615416265819000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFqtH57FmKwMF_4C5Jp_POJH27O7A">Cyberbullying Research Center</a> (CRC), which develops research around cyberbullying and online abuse and misuse. The company says it will collaborate with CRC to develop other initiatives going forward to help promote a positive environment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.tetrate.io/">Tetrate</a>, the company commercializing an open source networking project that allows for easier data sharing across different applications, has raised $40 million.</p>
<p>The round, led by <a href="https://sapphireventures.com/">Sapphire Ventures</a> underscores the importance of the Istio project and just how critical services that facilitate cross-platform data sharing have become.</p>
<p>Sapphire was joined by other new investors including <a href="https://www.scalevp.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.scalevp.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615466687742000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGtMlQ1g9Ta7R_lQcAs2EPc3crlRA">Scale Venture Partners</a> and <a href="https://nttvc.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://nttvc.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615466687742000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGuSAC0LQiQk6nfjp40K_COOYvnKQ">NTTVC</a>, along with existing investors, <a href="https://www.delltechnologiescapital.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id%3Dsmartlink%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.delltechcapital.com%26esheet%3D51953871%26newsitemid%3D20190313005213%26lan%3Den-US%26anchor%3DDell%2BTechnologies%2BCapital%26index%3D2%26md5%3Df840ab2ddc35ab4c1bce374f80f5a7a2&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615466687742000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH4UTzofX1JGDd6txdgzZdUFEJ7Dw">Dell Technologies Capital</a>,<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/intel-capital/overview.html"> Intel Capital</a>,<a href="https://8vc.com/"> 8VC</a>, and<a href="https://www.samsungnext.com/"> Samsung NEXT</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company said it would use the cash to further develop its hybrid cloud application networking platform and support a new product, based on Istio, that makes the application service mesh easier to use, according to a statement from the company. Geographic expansion to Latin America, Europe and Asia is also on the menu now that it has 40 million simoleons to play around with (personally I&#8217;d have converted all that money into bills and gone swimming in it like Scrooge McDuck).</p>
<p>“As the microservices revolution picks up steam, it’s indispensable to use Istio for managing applications built with microservices and deployed on containers. Both the product and background of the founding team lead us to believe that Tetrate is poised to bring Istio into the mainstream for enterprises by making it easy to manage and deploy on multi-cloud and hybrid cloud environments,&#8221; said Jai Das, the partner, president and co-founder of Sapphire&#8217;s multi-billion dollar firm, who&#8217;s joining the Tetrate board. &#8220;The applications we use daily require a lot of work in the background, and Tetrate helps make that happen with its Istio-based service mesh technology, which helps route traffic between microservices, add visibility and enhance security.”</p>
<p>Founded in 2018, Tetrate formally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/13/tetrate-nets-12-1-million-to-bring-microservices-to-the-corporate-masses/">launched in 2019</a> with a $12.5 million round that boosted the company&#8217;s profile and helped the company commercialize and professionalize services around the Istio and Envoy Proxy open source projects.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Tons of really big customers, including the U.S. Department of Defense use Tetrate&#8217;s services currently. In the military, Tetrate powers the DevSecOps platform called <a href="https://software.af.mil/dsop/services/">Platform One</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We partnered with Tetrate to help secure and smoothly operate Platform One with Istio. Platform One works with the most critical systems across the DoD. The Tetrate team has provided world class expertise, trained our team members, reviewed our platform architecture and configurations, and helped with debugging and upgrades,&#8221; said Nicolas Chaillan, the chief software officer for the US Air Force, in a statement. &#8220;We’re getting excellent production support for running our platform smoothly and we rely on them and their platform for a critical layer of our stack.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In its latest strike against online content it doesn&#8217;t control Russia is throttling Twitter. State agency Roskomnadzor <a href="https://vk.com/wall-76229642_235341">said today</a> it was taking the action in response to the social media not removing banned content, claiming it had identified more than 3,000 unlawful posts that have not been taken down &#8212; and warning it could implement a total block on the service.</p>
<p>However the action by the comms regulator to slow down all Twitter&#8217;s mobile traffic and 50% of desktop users in Russia appeared to have briefly taken down Roskomnadzor&#8217;s own website earlier today.</p>
<p>Reports also circulated on social media that Russian government websites, including kremlin.ru, had been affected. At the time of writing these sites were accessible but earlier we were unable to access Roskomnadzor&#8217;s site.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The stand-off between the state agency and Twitter comes at a time when Russia is trying to clamp down on anti-corruption protestors who are supporters of the jailed opposition leader, Alexei Navalny &#8212; who has, in recent weeks, called for demonstrators to take to the streets to ramp up pressure on the regime.</p>
<p>Roskomnadzor&#8217;s statement makes no mention of the state&#8217;s push to censor political opposition &#8212; claiming only that the content it&#8217;s throttling Twitter for failing to delete is material relating to minors committing suicide; child pornography; and drug use. Hence it also claims to be taking the action to &#8220;protect Russian citizens&#8221;. However a draconian application of speech-chilling laws to try to silence political opposition are nothing new in Putin&#8217;s Russia.</p>
<p>The Russian regime has sought to get content it doesn&#8217;t like removed from foreign-based social media services a number of times in recent years, including &#8212; as now &#8212; resorting to technical means to limit access.</p>

<p>Most notoriously, back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/17/russias-telegram-ban-that-knocked-out-15m-google-amazon-ip-addresses-had-a-precedent-in-zello/">2018</a>, an attempt by Russia to block access to the messaging service Telegram resulted in massive collateral damage to the local Internet as the block took down millions of (non-Telegram-related) IP addresses &#8212; disrupting those other services.</p>
<p>Also in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/15/under-russian-pressure-to-remove-content-instagram-complies-but-youtube-holds-off/">2018</a> Facebook-owned Instagram complied with a Russian request to remove content posted by Navalny &#8212; which earned it a shaming tweet from the now jailed politician.</p>

<p>Although now behind bars in Russia &#8212; Navalny was jailed in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55910974">February</a>, after Russia claimed he had violated the conditions of a suspended sentence &#8212; the prominent Putin critic has continued to use his official Twitter account as a megaphone to denounce corruption and draw attention to the injustice of his detention, following his attempted poisoning last year (which has been <a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2020/12/14/fsb-team-of-chemical-weapon-experts-implicated-in-alexey-navalny-novichok-poisoning/">linked to Russia&#8217;s FSB</a>).</p>

<p>However <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/">last month</a>, in a worrying development in India that&#8217;s also related to anti-government protests (in that case by farmers who are seeking to reverse moves to deregulate the market), Twitter caved in to pressure from the government &#8212; shuttering 500 accounts including some linked to the anti-government protests.</p>
<p>It also agreed to reduce the visibility of certain protest hashtags.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.clara.cc/">Clara</a>, a corporate spend-management startup focused on the Latin American market, announced its product launch and a $3.5 million pre-seed round led by <a href="https://www.generalcatalyst.com/">General Catalyst</a>.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s funding caught TechCrunch&#8217;s eye as there has been a flurry of funding for related companies serving the United States market. From <a href="https://getdivvy.com/">Divvy</a> to <a href="http://brex.com">Brex</a> to <a href="https://t.co/robCWKydUu?amp=1">Ramp</a> to <a href="https://www.airbase.com/">Airbase</a> to <a href="https://www.teampay.co/">Teampay</a>, investors have poured capital into startups working to help companies better track and manage their spend.</p>
<p>Companies working in the fintech niche tend to monetize in one of two ways, namely interchange revenues and software incomes. Or more simply, some in the corporate spend category generate revenues when users swipe cards, earning a slice of the transaction. And some also charge for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/corp-card-startup-ramp-launches-expense-management-software/">the software</a> that they have wrapped around their cards and other methods of payment.</p>
<p>Clara is in the first camp, making its revenues today from interchange incomes, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gerrygiacoman/">Gerry Giacomán Colyer</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/digaresc/">Diego Iván García Escobedo</a>, the company&#8217;s co-founders. Colyer is the company&#8217;s CEO, while García Escobedo heads its product and tech work.</p>
<p>The pair told TechCrunch that the Mexican interchange market is more akin to the United States&#8217; own (lucrative) than Europe&#8217;s own (<a href="https://www.valuepenguin.com/interchange-fees-na-vs-eu">less lucrative</a>), meaning that if the company can sign up a host of customers for its free service &#8212; <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5GCEA_enUS889US889&amp;ei=s_dHYKv7DdHs_Qbq3pCwCA&amp;q=google+translate&amp;oq=google+translate&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyCwgAELEDEIMBEJECMggIABCxAxCRAjICCAAyAggAMgUIABCxAzICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyBQgAELEDOgcIABBHELADOgUIABCRAjoICAAQsQMQgwE6CwguELEDEMcBEKMCOgoIABCxAxCDARBDOgcIABCxAxBDOgQIABBDUIMUWJcfYPQfaANwAngAgAGpAogB-ROSAQUxLjIuOZgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrIAQTAAQE&amp;sclient=gws-wiz&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjroOqaoqTvAhVRdt8KHWovBIYQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5"><em>empieza hoy &#8211; sin costo</em></a>, its website intones &#8212; it could post the same sort of revenue growth that has spurred some of its American comps to huge venture capital raises.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="NNwKgGkLsO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/ramp-raises-30m-as-the-battle-to-own-corporate-spend-heats-up/">Ramp raises $30M as the battle to own corporate spend heats up</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;Ramp raises $30M as the battle to own corporate spend heats up&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/ramp-raises-30m-as-the-battle-to-own-corporate-spend-heats-up/embed/#?secret=NNwKgGkLsO" data-secret="NNwKgGkLsO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The startup&#8217;s potential has caught the eye of more than General Catalyst, a well-known venture capital firm. The two co-founders of Ramp are also investors in Clara. The startup&#8217;s round also included funds from a host of smaller firms and angels, including Canary Ventures, Adapt Ventures and Picus Capital, among others.</p>
<p>The co-founders want to bridge the gap in technology-enabled financial services that they found in Mexico. Colyer worked for G2 after a stint at Stanford, eventually moving back to Mexico and working on a micromobility startup called Uva Scooters. He discovered during the process that Mexican and other Latin American firms lacked some digital tools, like low- and zero-cost corporate spend software, to which American companies had ample access.</p>
<p>So, the pair of founders, who met at Grin Scooters, which had acquired Uva, set out to build Clara, tuning a model with proven success in America to work in Mexico. What sort of tweaking was needed? Local compliance to ensure high-levels of card acceptance, support for local tax law and receipt management, the pair said.</p>
<p>Thus far the company has only worked with around 100 customers, with the co-founders telling TechCrunch they have seen traction with high-growth companies, some of which are startups. That echoes what Brex tapped into when it was a more youthful upstart itself.</p>

<p>Today the company operates in Mexico only, but intends to support other markets over time.</p>
<p>Regarding the company&#8217;s $3.5 million raise, like many pre-seed and seed deals, the funds were acquired in a few tranches, including one in May of 2020. The rest of the capital came later in the year.</p>
<p>Seeing successful startup models that are familiar in the United States pop up in Latin America is a regular trend. <a href="https://belvo.com/">Belvo</a>, for example, is following in the tracks that Plaid laid down, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/meet-belvo-a-yc-backed-startup-building-a-financial-api-for-latin-america/">bringing fintech APIs to the LatAm market</a>. Given rising smartphone penetration, and rising card usage, perhaps Clara will find a good fit in its home market.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, TechCrunch is curious how quickly Clara can accrete new customer companies now that it has formally launched. If it can, and the interchange game proves successful, expect to hear from it again soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mass transportation is a critical part of how metropolitan areas keep moving, and today a startup that has built an AI-based platform to help mass transportation work more efficiently is announcing a huge round of funding to grow its business and tackle a new set of opportunities and challenges in the modern city.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.optibus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Optibus</a> &#8212; a Tel Aviv-based startup that provides a platform to analyze how vehicles and people move around in cities and then provides navigation, scheduling, driver rostering and other guidance for mass transportation providers to service those cities better &#8212; has picked up $107 million, a Series C that it will be using to continue expanding the kinds of services that it provides to customers.</p>
<p>The company is not disclosing its valuation but CEO and co-founder Amos Haggiag confirmed to me that it&#8217;s gone up 4X since its last round in 2018. Sources close to the deal tell me that the valuation is between $400 million and $500 million, in part because of the company&#8217;s tech and in part because of its customer base and the fact that it has &#8220;zero churn&#8221; within that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is interesting in the context of valuations, and fates, of other mapping startups focused on planning and optimising what is happening in urban areas. Remix, another mapping company focused on mass transit, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/via-buys-mapping-startup-remix-for-100-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just acquired by Via for $100 million</a>; another company with a strong focus on public transit mapping, Moovit, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/confirmed-intel-is-buying-urban-mobility-platform-moovit-in-a-900m-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Intel in last year in a $900 million deal</a>.</p>
<p>This Series C is coming at the same time that the startup is launching a new Geospatial Suite that is part of that platform expansion. It provides tools to visualize and predict movement alongside different transportation options, fitting in with the shift that many cities are making to encouraging multi-modal travel covering buses, trains, bikes, scooters and walking to offset traffic congestion from single-passenger cars.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2123505" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Optibus-Geospatial-Suite.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="413" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Optibus-Geospatial-Suite.png 3701w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Optibus-Geospatial-Suite.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Optibus-Geospatial-Suite.png?resize=300,182 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Optibus-Geospatial-Suite.png?resize=768,466 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Optibus-Geospatial-Suite.png?resize=680,413 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Optibus-Geospatial-Suite.png?resize=1536,933 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Optibus-Geospatial-Suite.png?resize=2048,1243 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Optibus-Geospatial-Suite.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Optibus&#8217; customers include city governments and other companies and organizations that have implemented mass transportation systems (these include those who have large campuses, but also, for example, big tech companies that operate private shuttle services to bring users who live in one place to their headquarters in another); huge mass transportation providers; electric and other vehicle makers; and more.</p>
<p>In a city like London, Haggiag says that it helps run 30% of the city&#8217;s public transportation, focused mainly around bus usage, and 25% of public transportation in the U.K. market overall.</p>
<p>The funding is being co-led by two investors, Bessemer Venture Partners and Insight Partners, with previous investors Verizon Ventures*, Pitango, New Era Capital Partners, Dynamic Loop and Blue Red Partners also participating, along with strategics like bus company Stagecoach (which <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/stagecoach-the-uks-largest-bus-and-coach-operator-partners-with-ai-platform-optibus-to-help-plan-the-bus-networks-of-the-future-301237161.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced its investment</a>, but not the value of it, last week).</p>
<p>Indeed, this is a significant round for Optibus, which prior to this had only raised around $55 million since opening for business in 2014. The size of this Series C underscores the company&#8217;s traction and also the potential opportunities of being a transportation data provider at the moment.</p>
<p>Cities exist between a rock and a hard place these days. They have to continue to focus on how to operate well while also getting increasingly crowded &#8212; a long-term trend that&#8217;s existed for decades. But now, on top of that, dense metro areas <em>also</em> have to figure out how to operate safely at a time when effective social distancing can make the difference between life and death. These two imperatives are often at odds with each other.</p>
<p>While you might assume that social distancing has meant less rather than more use of public transportation, you would be right, but that&#8217;s not the full story. Haggiag said that in the last year Optibus has had a surge of new business and increased usage from its customers, not because they are handling more passengers &#8212; some cities have seen as much as an 80% drop in passenger revenues, he said &#8212; but because buses and other transportation modes have remained running as essential services, but ones that need to be better organised and spaced out than ever before, in order to be run responsibly.</p>
<p>The role of a company like Optibus has been to bring technology into an equation that has been tackled mostly as an offline problem before now.</p>
<p>&#8220;People sit in a room to map these routes out. It&#8217;s very old school stuff,&#8221; said Haggiag. &#8220;There so much budget involved and also lots of data that no one uses. No one had previously tried to figure out the patterns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Data has become an even more critical part of the transportation equation in recent years. Companies like Uber might have grown their profile through marketing and making their ride-hailing services as ubiquitous as possible, but they have also, very intentionally, positioned themselves as technology companies, building smart platforms to manage and optimize how the pieces move around on the map, so to speak, with the idea being that &#8220;winning&#8221; in the transportation game is as much about getting that right, as it is about customer service, or introducing new forms of transportation. (Arguably, as Uber has moved away from its moonshot projects, the third of these is even less prominent, making logistics and optimization an even more important part of the tech equation.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, autonomous vehicle technology plays are about as data-hungry as you can get. AI algorithms need to ingest an endless amount of information to &#8220;learn&#8221; how to work like humans (or to hope to work like humans, if you are a little cynical like I am). If and when those services ever get up, they too will rely endlessly on streams of data to optimise how and on which streets vehicles should run.</p>
<p>These are, interestingly, not yet two use cases for Optibus, Haggiag said. Interest from autonomous companies has so far been minimal, and it&#8217;s only just starting to see its own work in multimodal analytics meeting up with what transportation-on-demand and navigating startups have been working on.</p>
<p>They both, however, point to a couple of big areas where Optibus might grow in the coming years, or who might be interested in the company over time.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the startup has a very big opportunity in its current customer base and how attitudes in general around the purpose and longer-term aim of public transportation investments.</p>
<p>While cars have long been the default transportation option in many parts of the world for decades, we have seen a gradual shift even in the most unlikely of cities, like Los Angeles, where services are expanding not because people have suddenly decided they don&#8217;t love their cars, but because the growth in population has made the growth of more vehicles untenable. It&#8217;s led to a more extensive public transportation network, which has led to more people using it.</p>
<p>“Effective public transportation is a critical part of a well-functioning society, and with the rise of new mobility options and electric vehicles, paired with the added challenge of the pandemic, city operators face more complexity than ever,” said Alex Ferrara, Partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, in a statement. “Optibus stands out as a modern cloud-based solution that cuts through this complexity, allowing transit operators to plan routes and optimize schedules in minutes rather than days, promoting a more affordable and passenger-friendly experience. We are excited to partner with them as they build a global, world-class operating system for public transportation.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many things have accelerated in the world of fintech over the past year, not the least of which is the trend of digital banks aimed at specific communities in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the past few months alone, a number of neobanks targeting the Black and Latinx communities have emerged. Most recently, we covered </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/first-boulevard-raises-5m-for-its-digital-bank-aimed-at-black-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the $5 million raise </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of one such bank &#8212; First Boulevard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, <a href="http://earncheese.com">Cheese</a> announced the launch of its digital banking platform that is aimed at primarily serving the Asian-American community. Co-founder and CEO Ken Lian came to the United States from China in 2008 to attend college. In the years after his move, Lian said he paid thousands of dollars in bank fees and got rejected “multiple times” for basic bank accounts, despite having a FICO score over 800.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those experiences led him to come up with the concept behind Cheese, which he said will offer its banking services via a multi-language platform. The one-year-old startup also has a social component, giving customers a way to support Asian-American businesses and organizations. Lian is no stranger to the world of entrepreneurship, having also founded Moolah Science, a startup that helped consumers find out if online stores owed them a refund that got acquired by a Fortune 500 company in 2019.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lian founded Cheese along with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zhen Wang and Qingyi Li</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> under the premise that Asian-Americans are often subject to discrimination and “an unequal playing field” in America despite being among the <a href="https://prosperitynow.org/blog/racial-wealth-snapshot-asian-americans">most educated</a> in the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We understand Asian users much better than anybody else because we </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">are</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the user,” Lian told TechCrunch. “[Traditional] banking didn’t understand me or my culture or my lifestyle or what matters to me. Our needs are different.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of challenger banks also never focused on Asian communities and immigrants,” he added. “We want to provide a great product to welcome these people to the U.S. and make it easy for them to bank.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past year, Cheese has raised a total of $3.6 million in funding from investors such as iFly.vc; Amplify; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam Nash, former CEO of </span><a href="https://www.wealthfront.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wealthfront</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; Zillow co-founder Spencer Rascoff and VC firms Wedbush Ventures, Idealab and Operate Venture Studio.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The startup has also partnered with actor </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jfwong?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jimmy Wong</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an advocate for Asian rights. He will serve as Cheese’s chief community ambassador.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheese’s platform provides a debit Mastercard (issued by Coastal Community Bank), which is available to those with no credit history. (If this sounds familiar, it’s a similar offering as that of TomoCredit, a startup that recently </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/tomocredit-raises-7m-to-help-people-with-cash-but-little-to-no-credit-history/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $7 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to scale its debit card product for those with little or no credit history.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cheese cardholders can use the virtual cards instantly through their mobile wallets, the company said. Other features include offering advance pay up to two days early with direct deposit, a 3% deposit bonus for referring friends, 0.3% annual percentage yield (APY) and up to 10% cash back on purchases at more than10,000 merchants. </span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanshen/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Han Shen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, founding partner of iFly, believes Cheese can help the underbanked community in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They don’t necessarily get the same kind of service or product for their banking needs and they face all kinds of pain points,” he wrote. “Cheese has a list of products they want to develop for that type of customer&#8230;We know there is a product market fit based on our research and we know this is a strong team.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment marks iFly’s first in the consumer fintech space in which it acted as a lead investor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were already determined to invest on the mission side. They wanted to make things easier and better for the underbanked, including immigrants,” Shen continued. “People deserve a better service. In Cheese’s case, the question is not whether or not to provide it, the question is about how to do it right to address their pain points.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conjunction with its launch, Cheese has pledged $100,000 to the Cheese Giveback Fund, 100% of which will be donated to nonprofits and community service programs in support of Asian neighborhoods and businesses impacted by violence and economic hardship during the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Growth for Facebook is coming from the developing world, and so the social network today made another key move to cater better to consumers in those countries. After nearly three years in the planning, Facebook is taking the plunge today and officially launching <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.lite&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Lite</a>, a less data- and storage-intensive Android-only version of its popular photo and video app. It will take up just 2MB on a phone, and it is going live in 170 countries, with a focus on emerging markets, today.</p>
<p>Instagram Lite is <a href="https://tech.fb.com/instagram-lite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launching</a> with all the basic bells and whistles around editing, sharing and viewing photos and videos, as well as the ability to add stickers, create and view Stories, IGTV and the Explore discovery and recommendation algorithms. And given the launch across 170 countries, it&#8217;s coming with specific language support to be usable in those markets.</p>
<p>But to whittle down the experience from the 30MB that full-fat Instagram takes up on iOS and Android devices (and countless MB of mobile data usage), it&#8217;s launching without some things, too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Namely, the developers have left out many graphics; they haven&#8217;t included advertising; and it&#8217;s missing some key features like the ability make TikTok-ish Reels (you can still view them), dark mode, Shopping, and end-to-end encryption. (Notably, encryption was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/technology/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-messenger.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly</a> being worked on for the main app in 2019, but it has yet to launch). Nor are there iOS or feature phone versions of the app in the works.</p>
<p>Facebook said that some of that list &#8212; such as dark mode, and (of course) adverts &#8212; will be added in future updates.</p>
<p>Instagram Lite has been teased out in different forms by Facebook <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/instagram-lite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since 2018</a>, and it&#8217;s hitting what has proven to be a receptive market for the social media giant. Tzach Hadar, Tel Aviv-based director of product management for all of Facebook&#8217;s Lite apps &#8212; which also include versions of Facebook and Messenger, also built in Tel Aviv &#8212; said this week that <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.lite&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Lite</a> now has more than 200 million monthly active users.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just a fraction of the <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/FB-Earnings-Presentation-Q4-2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">billions that use Facebook itself</a>, but represents a key way of targeting those newer to Facebook or those who might not otherwise be using the app because of financial or bandwidth constraints.</p>
<p>But although Instagram is wildly popular and would have been an obvious candidate for the Lite treatment years ago, and Instagram Lite was one of the most requested items from users in developing markets, it has proven to be trickier beast.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not just because the app focuses on images and videos, which by their nature use up more bandwidth and data; but because over the years Instagram has become increasingly laden with features: those aimed at enhancing the user experience; those aimed at competing better with other apps (hello, Stories and Reels); and those to extend monetization opportunities for Facebook.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instagram offered another kind of unique challenge for us to deliver under the same constraints the same experience,&#8221; said Nick Brown, a product manager based out of New York (the app was co-developed across Facebook&#8217;s Tel Aviv and NYC offices and &#8212; presumably, given the year we&#8217;ve had &#8212; across many Facebook employees&#8217; homes). &#8220;The philosophy is really that we want to bring all of Instagram to these users.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123482" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123482" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2123482" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg 3242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg?resize=1536,1023 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg?resize=2048,1364 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Instagram-Lite-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123482" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>Indeed, as with other Lite versions of apps like Facebook and Messenger, Instagram Lite is geared towards consumers in emerging economies, where smartphones are most likely to be Android-based and less likely to be top-of-the-range devices; consumers are more likely to be more price- and bandwidth-sensitive when it comes to using mobile data; and a substantial proportion are still only now getting to grips with being online.</p>
<p>Facebook notes <a href="https://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimates</a> that show 65% of emerging market populations are online versus 90% in North America, which is one reason why the company focuses so squarely on serving those users: they represent growth at a time when growth has slowed down, or become significantly more competitive against newer entrants, in its more mature markets like the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>However, building for the demands of developing markets can often, by their nature, run counter to the concept of building in ever more features as you might otherwise see with highly competitive consumer apps.</p>
<p>The Instagram Lite app had some fits and starts over the years, with the first version, built on React Native, launching in a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/instagram-lite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited release back in 2018</a>, taking up a mere 573kb of space on a device. It also came without a lot of features, but Instagram itself had less features, too. While it was never explained why, that version was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/instagram-lite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quietly pulled last year</a>, and then shortly after a newer version was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/facebook-launches-new-instagram-lite-app-in-india-global-rollout-to-follow-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched again in December in a limited test</a>. Debuted first in India, a key market for the company, Instagram Lite launched there with support for Bangla, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s that last test that has turned into the official Instagram Lite app. Interestingly, it turns out that in the process, the whole app was rebuilt, moving it away from Facebook&#8217;s own React Native framework and building it instead on another internal framework called Bloks (not to be confused with <a href="http://bloks.tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloks</a>), heavy lifting a lot of the basic workings from Messenger and Facebook&#8217;s Lite versions. I&#8217;ve asked for more detail about this, and I wonder if it&#8217;s related to <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2020/03/02/data-infrastructure/messenger/">LightSpeed</a>, which was a development shift that saw a lighter and new version of Messenger get released last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bloks is a framework that is much more performant and has more features and capabilities, and this new Instagram light application is built upon it,&#8221; said Hadar. &#8220;So it&#8217;s like a new app altogether.&#8221; It&#8217;s not clear what exactly happened behind the scenes leading to the previous app getting pulled, but it seems that in any case the foundations now give the company more room for expanding the service (even while bumping up the app size from under 600kb to 2MB).</p>
<p>That fact might matter less to users, but does point to some notable trends at the company itself and how it&#8217;s approaching tech in the future, and also how it views the important of feature parity between full and Lite versions of its flagship apps.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since launching in 2012, Savannah Fund —  led by <a href="https://tz.linkedin.com/in/mbwana">Mbwana Alliy</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bragiel">Paul Bragiel</a> — has backed more than 30 startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of its well-known investments include South African car subscription company, FlexClub; Kenyan on-demand logistics company, Sendy; and Nigerian fintech company, Lidya</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before becoming a VC firm, Savannah Fund started as an accelerator program in Kenya. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startups who got accepted participated in cohorts for three months and received up to $30,000 in funding</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in 2016, Savannah transitioned into venture capital investing, focusing on seed and Series A stages within $25,000 to $500,000 checks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the second fund for the nine-year-old Mauritius-headquartered investment firm. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has secured a first close led by <a href="https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/region__ext_content/IFC_External_Corporate_Site/Sub-Saharan+Africa">International Finance Corporation</a> (IFC) with participation from the <a href="https://we-fi.org/">Women’s Finance Initiative</a> (WeFi)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">US investor Tim Draper via his VC fund, Draper Associates and Visa Forsten, co-founder of Tencent-owned Supercell, are other notable investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking with TechCrunch, Alliy said the firm has invested in seven startups already with the first close, which indicates effort on their part that would help close the rest of the fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We raised from some angel investors, high net worth individuals, so when we the official fund launched, we rolled these select companies into the fund,&#8221; Alliy said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you can show that you already have investments you&#8217;ve made with your own money, it&#8217;s easier to raise from institutional investors, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we&#8217;re on that path</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These seven startups cut across the firm&#8217;s focus areas, including fintech, edtech, logistics and e-commerce, SaaS, healthtech, and agritech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The disclosed investments include South African agritech Aerobotics and car subscription FlexClub, Ethiopian healthtech Orbit Health and Kenyan-based Safigen, Moringa School and Ando Foods</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm has a presence in Kenya, South African and Tanzania, but its core markets remain Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The managing partner says Savannah is big on startups that can scale across regions in Africa &#8212; Rwanda, Ethiopia, Uganda in East Africa; Ivory Coast and Ghana in West Africa; and globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is typical of some of the startups in its portfolio &#8212; Aerobotics recently expanded to the US, Sendy is an established East African player, and FlexClub operates in Mexico</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I know it might sound cliche, but we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> want founders in our portfolio to think big enough, and we will help them get there,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm has doubled the ticket size from its first fund to $50,000 to $1 million. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund plans to invest as low as $50,000 at the pre-seed, but typical first check sizes will be between $150,000 to 250,000. Follow up rounds that will likely involve larger amounts will depend on the firm&#8217;s position as a lead investor or not</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, Savannah Fund&#8217;s portfolio raised $118 million across Series A, B and C, with some operating in the U.S., Europe, and Latin America. With this new fund, Alliy </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">said the firm is looking to perform better this year and increase its portfolio from 30 to 50 in the foreseeable future. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm also acknowledges the role its backer &#8212; WeFi &#8212; will be playing in increasing these numbers, especially those led by female founders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Entrepreneurs in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Residence</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (EIRs), especially female founders, are a key part of our investment strategy as we have seen with the success of Moringa School, Safigen and Sendy &#8211; all 3 of which have women founders/CEOs who </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worked with Savannah as EIRs, Associates &amp; Interns</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re proud to partner with WeFi to further expand and encourage female founders on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even during a pandemic, we held 3 internships in 2020, some virtual and some in-person in Kenya and Tanzania,&#8221; the statement read</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>Lead investor IFC confirmed the news with TechCrunch. According to its statement, the World Bank Group member invested $3 million while We-Fi cut a $500,000 check for the fund.</p>
<p>&#8220;Early-stage funding is vital to enable more of Africa&#8217;s emerging and growing tech founders to grow their business and fuel the transformation of Africa&#8217;s internet economy. By partnering with Savannah Fund, we can help more entrepreneurs to access funding,&#8221; said Kevin Njiraini, IFC regional director for Southern Africa and Nigeria.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Miami-based cybersecurity startup Lumu today announced the closing of its $7.5 million Series A. The round was co-led by SoftBank Group Corp.’s SB Opportunity Fund and Panoramic Ventures.</p>
<p><a href="https://lumu.io/">Lumu</a>, co-founded and headed by Colombian native Ricardo Villadiego, offers a cloud-based service that helps companies continually scan and react to data compromises in real time. The company collects and standardizes metadata from across the network, including DNS queries, network traffic, access logs from perimeter proxies, firewalls and spam box filters, then applies AI to correlate threat intelligence from these disparate data sources to isolate confirmed points of compromise.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2123377" style="width: 402px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123377" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2123377" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ricardo_CEO_Lumu.png" alt="" width="392" height="484" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ricardo_CEO_Lumu.png 961w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ricardo_CEO_Lumu.png?resize=122,150 122w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ricardo_CEO_Lumu.png?resize=243,300 243w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ricardo_CEO_Lumu.png?resize=768,948 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ricardo_CEO_Lumu.png?resize=551,680 551w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Ricardo_CEO_Lumu.png?resize=41,50 41w" sizes="(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123377" class="wp-caption-text">Lumu CEO Ricardo Villadiego. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lumu</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Villadiego described it in lay terms: “If you’re speaking with a bad guy, there’s no good that’s going to come from that. So we apply the same idea with cybersecurity. If your phone or your laptop is talking to an adversary, you don’t really need to understand what the conversation is about,” he said. What you do need to do, he says, is shut it down and prevent it from happening again.</p>
<p>He explained that Lumu not only helps companies prevent breaches but also allows them to automate their responses.</p>
<p>Lumu launched in February 2020 at the RSA cybersecurity conference in San Francisco, and already has 1,300 enterprise customers and targets small to large corporations. In just over 12 months, the company said it has analyzed more than 55 billion metadata records and detected more than 11 million adversarial contacts.</p>
<p>Villadiego was born and raised in the colonial port town of Cartagena, Colombia. With a degree in electrical engineering, he found his passion for cybersecurity while working at Unisys, which, through its cybersecurity excellence program, is how he ended up in the United States.</p>
<p>During his time at Unisys — and later at IBM — he said he was exposed to merger and acquisition deals, motivating him to start his own business. He founded his first cybersecurity company, Easy Solutions, in Miami in 2009, focused on preventing fraud. Easy Solutions caught the eye of tech heavyweight — and Miami local — Manny Medina of the eponymous Medina Capital, who invested in the company&#8217;s first round.</p>
<p>“I told him we were looking to raise $5 million and he said, &#8216;I’m in, but it has to be $10 million,&#8217;” Villadiego told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The two eventually agreed on $11 million, and about a decade later Medina’s own company — Cyxtera — bought Easy Solutions for an undisclosed sum. Cyxtera announced last month that it’s going public at a $3.4 billion valuation through a merger with a SPAC.</p>
<p>Villadiego said Lumu, which has 35 full-time employees, will use the funds to fuel growth in the United States.</p>
<p>“In the U.S., I understand all the issues that we have — especially with diversity — but if you work hard, you have the chance to change your story,&#8221; said Villadiego. &#8220;At the end of the day, you have to build a business. The hardest part for any entrepreneur is getting access to capital.&#8221;</p>
<p>With funding help from SoftBank&#8217;s Opportunity Fund, which helps Black, Latinx and Native American founders and entrepreneurs in the U.S., Villadiego said he can focus entirely on the work.</p>
<p>“Once you have access to SoftBank, you sort of forget about the money part, because you know you’ll have access to capital to build your company,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now your focus can be on execution &#8212; to make sure you’re solving the problem.&#8221;</p>

In total, Aqua Security has now raised $265 million since it was founded in 2015.</p>
<p>The company was one of the earliest to focus on securing container deployments. And while many of its competitors were acquired over the years, Aqua remains independent and is now likely on a path to an IPO. When it launched, the industry focus was still very much on Docker and Docker containers. To the detriment of Docker, that quickly shifted to Kubernetes, which is now the de facto standard. But enterprises are also now looking at serverless and other new technologies on top of this new stack.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enterprises that five years ago were experimenting with different types of technologies are now facing a completely different technology stack, a completely different ecosystem and a completely new set of security requirements,&#8221; Aqua CEO Dror Davidoff told me. And with these new security requirements came a plethora of startups, all focusing on specific parts of the stack.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>What set Aqua apart, Dror argues, is that it managed to 1) become the best solution for container security and 2) realized that to succeed in the long run, it had to become a platform that would secure the entire cloud-native environment. About two years ago, the company made this switch from a product to a platform, as Davidoff describes it.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a spree of acquisitions by CheckPoint and Palo Alto [Networks] and Trend [Micro],&#8221; Davidoff said. &#8220;They all started to acquire pieces and tried to build a more complete offering. The big advantage for Aqua was that we had everything natively built on one platform. [&#8230;] Five years later, everyone is talking about cloud-native security. No one says &#8216;container security&#8217; or &#8216;serverless security&#8217; anymore. And Aqua is practically the broadest cloud-native security [platform].&#8221;</p>
<p>One interesting aspect of Aqua&#8217;s strategy is that it continues to bet <a href="https://github.com/aquasecurity">on open source</a>, too. Trivy, its open-source vulnerability scanner, is the default scanner for GitLab&#8217;s Harbor Registry and the CNCF&#8217;s Artifact Hub, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are probably the best security open-source player there is because not only do we secure <em>from</em> vulnerable open source, we are also very active in the open-source community,&#8221; Davidoff said (with maybe a bit of hyperbole). &#8220;We provide tools to the community that are open source. To keep evolving, we have a whole open-source team. It&#8217;s part of the philosophy here that we want to be part of the community and it really helps us to understand it better and provide the right tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 2020, Aqua, which mostly focuses on mid-size and larger companies, doubled the number of paying customers and it now has more than half a dozen customers with an ARR of over $1 million each.</p>
<p>Davidoff tells me the company wasn&#8217;t actively looking for new funding. Its last funding round came together only a year ago, after all. But the team decided that it wanted to be able to double down on its current strategy and raise sooner than originally planned. ION had been interested in working with Aqua for a while, Davidoff told me, and while the company received other offers, the team decided to go ahead with ION as the lead investor (with all of Aqua&#8217;s existing investors also participating in this round).</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to grow from a product perspective, we want to grow from a go-to-market [perspective] and expand our geographical coverage &#8212; and we also want to be a little more acquisitive. That&#8217;s another direction we&#8217;re looking at because now we have the platform that allows us to do that. [&#8230;] I feel we can take the company to great heights. That&#8217;s the plan. The market opportunity allows us to dream big.&#8221;</p>
