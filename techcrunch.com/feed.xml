										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every Sunday in your inbox</a>. </em></p>
<p>Hi friends and new readers, welcome back to The Station, a newsletter dedicated to all the present and future ways people and packages move from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Last week, I provided some of my predictions for 2021 focused on autonomous vehicle technology and electric vehicles. I&#8217;ll weigh in today with a few predictions about the rest of the &#8220;future of transportation&#8221; sector, including ride-hailing, on-demand delivery and in-car tech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Email me at <a href="mailto:kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com">kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com</a> to share thoughts, criticisms, offer up opinions or tips. You can also send a direct message to me at Twitter — <a href="https://twitter.com/kirstenkorosec">@kirstenkorosec</a>.</p>
<p>Alrighty, here&#8217;s the remaining predictions for the 2021.</p>
<h2><strong>Delivery </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2037863 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png" alt="the-station-delivery" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/the-station-delivery.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></h2>
<p>On-demand delivery will continue to grow even as consumers return to physical stores, which will put pressure on the logistics ecosystem. The retailers that have the best success will be the ones that have locked in multiple channels to get their &#8220;goods&#8221; to the consumer.</p>
<p>Big retailers and even smaller local stores have come to understand that their physical location has become an extended part of the supply chain. Startups that have developed platforms to make it easier to manage inventory and get it to the consumer will continue to pop up.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the increase in demand for delivery will encourage giants like Amazon and Walmart invest in technological solutions to meet their needs. This might include partnering with or acquiring startups. (This goes beyond interests in longer term efforts like autonomous vehicle delivery).</p>
<p>Delivery apps such as <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Eats, DoorDash and Instacart will face increased scrutiny for use of gig economy workers as well as whether businesses benefit from using them. This may very well spawn local businesses to find their own in-house solutions. Demand will rise for digital tools that help optimize delivery fleets and platforms designed to help companies gets goods to consumers without relying on Uber, DoorDash and others.</p>
<p>Restaurant groups will pull together to offer delivery hubs from ghost kitchens, a prediction that mirrors one shared with me from <span lang="EN">Khaled Naim, the CEO </span><span lang="EN">last mile delivery management software startup Onfleet. I believe local stores will make the same efforts. </span></p>
<p>I expect more pitches from companies hawking curbside management tools and subscription delivery platforms.</p>
<p>On the ride-hailing front, shuttle companies like Via will continue to grow (despite concerns about sharing rides) and make acquisitions to round out their current offerings. Via will continue to sell its platform to cities as opposed to standing up more of its own operations. Via handles booking, routing, passenger and vehicle assignment and identification, customer experience and fleet management. And it will likely look for ways to broaden its services to become more appealing.</p>
<h2>In-car tech</h2>
<p>Some of the trends that started two years ago will continue to play out. Automakers are increasing the size and display resolution of infotainment screens in its vehicles. Sadly, only a handful will unlock the more important piece of the infotainment system: the user interface.</p>
<p>Two announcements this past week — one from holographic startup <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/envisics" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="envisics">Envisics <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and the other from Mercedes — hint at what&#8217;s to come in 2021.</p>
<p>Mercedes unveiled January 7 its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mercedes-unveils-hyperscreen-a-curved-56-inch-screen-for-its-flagship-eqs-electric-vehicle/">next-generation MBUX Hyperscreen</a>, which features a 56-inch curved screen that runs the length of the dashboard. The MBUX Hyperscreen will be optional in the 2022 Mercedes EQS, the flagship sedan under the automaker’s electric EQ brand.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2093071" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2093071" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2093071 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg" alt="Mercedes-EQ. MBUX Hyperscreen" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21C0001_011.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2093071" class="wp-caption-text">Mercedes-EQ. MBUX Hyperscreen</p></div></p>
<p>I&#8217;m interested and maybe even encouraged (I have yet to test it) in the UI. Mercedes chose to put information on charging, entertainment, phone, navigation, social media, connectivity and massage — yes massage — right up front on the screen. This means no scrolling through menus or using the voice assistant to locate these options.</p>
<p>The system’s software, which will learn the patterns of the driver, will prompt the user, removing any need to go deeper into the sub-menu. The navigation map is always visible in the center and located just below it are the controls for the phone and entertainment — or the feature that best suits the specific situation, according to the automaker.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/holographic-startup-envisics-partners-with-panasonic-to-fast-track-in-car-ar-tech/">Envisics announced a partnership</a> with Panasonic Automotive Systems to jointly develop and commercialize a new generation of head-up displays for cars, trucks and SUVs.</p>
<p>Envisics&#8217; technology allows for head-up displays to have higher resolution, wide color gamut and large images that can be overlaid upon reality. The technology can also project information at multiple distances simultaneously. The company&#8217;s founder Jamieson Christmas told me that in the short term this will provide relatively simple augmented reality applications like navigation, highlighting the lane you’re supposed to be in and some safety applications.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094016" style="width: 2512px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Envisics_Dashboard_Navigation_01.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094016" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2094016 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Envisics_Dashboard_Navigation_01.jpg" alt="Envisics Navigation" width="2502" height="1669" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Envisics_Dashboard_Navigation_01.jpg 2502w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Envisics_Dashboard_Navigation_01.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Envisics_Dashboard_Navigation_01.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Envisics_Dashboard_Navigation_01.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Envisics_Dashboard_Navigation_01.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Envisics_Dashboard_Navigation_01.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Envisics_Dashboard_Navigation_01.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Envisics_Dashboard_Navigation_01.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2502px) 100vw, 2502px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2094016" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Envisics</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;But as you look forward into things like autonomous driving it unlocks a whole realm of other opportunities like entertainment and video conferencing,” he said.</p>
<p>Finally, I expect more chatter and maybe even deployments of driver monitoring systems as automakers roll out more advanced driver assistance systems that allow for &#8220;hands-free&#8221; operations in certain conditions.</p>
<p>I want to stress however, that having a DMS is only part of the solution. The safe operation of an advanced driver assistance system comes down to how well the driver understands the features and can easily see or hear when they&#8217;re on and off. A number of vehicle models, with the regular ol&#8217; less &#8220;advanced versions of ADAS, already fail at properly communicating to drivers when features are on and off. My hope for 2021 and beyond is that there&#8217;s an effort to improve this shortfall.</p>
<p>For those who missed last week&#8217;s predictions, here is my recap on AVs and EVs.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896325 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png" alt="the station autonomous vehicles1" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<h2>Autonomous vehicles</h2>
<p>The wave of consolidation that began in 2020 will continue this year, leaving fewer players that are aiming to commercialize autonomous vehicle technology in three distinct areas: robotaxis, trucking and delivery.</p>
<p>In 2020, Starsky Robotics shut down, Uber sold its self-driving subsidiary to Aurora and autonomous delivery startup <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nuro-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nuro-2">Nuro <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> acquired Ike Robotics. This evolution is not yet complete.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be paying attention to the activities of all the big AV players including Cruise, Motional, Waymo and Zoox. I&#8217;m particularly interested in how Aurora will handle absorbing Uber ATG into its operations. I&#8217;m also watching for progress at Argo AI, which has spent the past several months integrating VW&#8217;s self-driving subsidiary Autonomous Intelligent Driving (AID) into its operations.</p>
<p>I expect big moves by the often-overlooked Voyage, including new partnerships and driverless operations.</p>
<p><strong>Autonomous delivery</strong> will see the most investment, consolidation and commercialization activity in 2021. This won&#8217;t be the year when autonomous delivery becomes ubiquitous. But expect more pilot programs in urban, and even suburban and rural areas as companies try to figure out what environment and form factor — sidewalk bots, purpose-built vehicles that operate on roads or drones — produces the best economics.</p>
<p>New regionally focused entrants will pop up in 2021 and drone delivery companies will expand to larger geofenced areas.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also curious to see what becomes of Postmates&#8217; autonomous robot now that Uber has completed its acquisition of the on-demand delivery company.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1942908" style="width: 6730px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nuro-r2-07-original-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1942908" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1942908 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nuro-r2-07-original-1.jpg" alt="Nuro R2 delivery bot" width="6720" height="4480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nuro-r2-07-original-1.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nuro-r2-07-original-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nuro-r2-07-original-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nuro-r2-07-original-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nuro-r2-07-original-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nuro-r2-07-original-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nuro-r2-07-original-1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nuro-r2-07-original-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6720px) 100vw, 6720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1942908" class="wp-caption-text">Nuro&#8217;s second-generation R2 delivery robot. <strong>Image credit:</strong> Nuro</p></div></p>
<p>Companies pursuing <strong>autonomous trucking</strong> are going to learn that long-haul logistics are more difficult and expensive than previously thought. While companies will continue to focus on Class 8 trucks that can operate without a human, expect greater activity in the so-called middle-mile logistics market. This is an area that startup Gatik AI has targeted with some successful results.</p>
<p>The middle-mile market, in which autonomous trucks run frequent trips from large distribution centers to local retailers, will become increasingly important as consumers continue to order groceries and other goods online. Amazon, Walmart and Kroger are just a few of the large and deep-pocketed companies keenly interested in finding faster and cheaper ways to move goods. Expect more investments and even acquisitions from big retailers.</p>
<p><strong>Autonomous vehicle regulations</strong> in the United States will shift in 2021 due to the new Biden Administration. The changes won&#8217;t happen immediately; there will be far more activity in 2022 and beyond. But there will be change nonetheless.</p>
<p>The Trump Administration has taken a light touch to autonomous vehicle development and deployment, choosing to stick with voluntary guidelines instead of creating new mandatory rules. For instance, last month the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration posted a notice that clarified AV policy and seemed to make the path to deployment much easier. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/the-station-zooxs-six-year-ride-aurora-makes-its-uber-atg-employee-picks-and-nhtsa-takes-a-new-position-on-avs/">Read the details</a> in my Dec. 21 newsletter)</p>
<p>President-elect Joe Biden nominated former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg as the next Secretary of Transportation, a Cabinet position that will have him overseeing the Federal Highway Administration and NHTSA among other roles. The expectation is that Buttigieg will lead the charge (ahem) for electric charging infrastructure. What&#8217;s less clear is how he and the Biden Administration will approach automated vehicle technology and the advanced driver assistance systems found in today&#8217;s modern vehicles.</p>
<p>The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the automotive industry group, released its<a href="https://www.autosinnovate.org/avroadmap"> four-year plan</a> last month for how it wants the federal government to act. The group made 14 recommendations that includes reforming regulations to allow for AV deployment at scale. Expect the Alliance for Automotive Innovation to push for a national AV pilot program and a new vehicle class for AVs.</p>
<h2>Electric vehicles</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_1896228" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1896228" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1896228 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png" alt="the station electric vehicles1" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-electric-vehicles1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-1896228" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bryce Durbin</p></div></p>
<p>A bevy of new electric vehicles from startups and legacy automakers will arrive in 2021. The Lucid Air, Rivian R1T and R1S, Audi Q4 etron and Nissan Ariya will come to market, while production ramps up for the Ford Mustang Mach-E and VW ID.4 .</p>
<p>In the latter half of the year, we should also see a few electric pickups from Lordstown Motors and the first deliveries of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/bmw-announces-the-ix-its-next-gen-electric-flagship/">the BMW iX</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/gmc-reveals-the-hummer-ev-1000-hp-350-mile-range-and-0-60-in-around-3-seconds/">GMC Hummer EV</a>.  I don&#8217;t expect the Tesla Cybertruck to appear until the very end of 2021, if not 2022.</p>
<p>In the U.S., I&#8217;ll be watching for policy changes at the federal level that might encourage more consumers to make the switch to electric vehicles. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/01/biden-clean-energy-453171">According to Politico</a>, there is $40 billion in unused Energy Department loan authority that was awarded under the 2009 stimulus. These funds could become central piece of the incoming Biden Administration&#8217;s climate and infrastructure plan. While those loans will likely go towards energy storage and other infrastructure, it&#8217;s worth noting that former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm will be heading up the DOE. Granholm was directly involved in the Obama Administration&#8217;s bailout of the U.S. auto industry during the Great Recession.</p>
<p><strong>Electric bikes, mopeds, scooters and even skateboards</strong> will continue to grow in 2021 as consumers look for means of getting around town without buying a car or using personal transit.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean every ebike or scooter company will prosper. Some shared electric scooter companies have struggled in 2020 or shut down altogether. Others are switching to subscription -based models. Expect the tinkering to continue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Chinese fitness class provider <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/keep-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="keep-3">Keep <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> continues to diversify its offerings to include Peloton-like bikes, health-conscious snacks among other things, it&#8217;s bringing in new investors to fund its ambitions.</p>
<p>On Monday, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/keep-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="keep-3">Keep <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said it has recently closed a Series F financing round of $360 million led by SoftBank Vision Fund. Hillhouse Capital and Coatue Management participated in the round, as well as existing investors GGV Capital, Tencent, 5Y Capital, Jeneration Capital and Bertelsmann Asia Investments.</p>
<p>The latest fundraise values the six-year-old startup at about $2 billion post-money, people with knowledge told TechCrunch. Keep said it currently has no plans to go public, a company spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Keep started out in 2014 by providing at-home workout videos and<a href="https://technode.com/2017/08/14/chinese-social-fitness-app-keep-reaches-100-million-users/"> signed up 100 million users</a> within three years. As of late, it has served over 300 million users, the company claims. It has over time fostered an ecosystem of fitness influencers who give live classes to students via videos, and now runs a team of course designers, streaming coaches and operational staff dedicated to its video streaming business.</p>
<p>The company said its main revenue driver is membership fees from the 10 million users who receive personalized services. It&#8217;s also expanding its consumer product line. Last year, for instance, the firm introduced an internet-connected stationary bike that comes with video instructions like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/peloton-interactive" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="peloton-interactive">Peloton <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. It&#8217;s also rolled out apparel, treadmills and smart wristbands.</p>
<p>The company launched <a href="https://keepkeep.com/?_branch_match_id=837951310592172963">foreign versions of its Keep app</a> in 2018 as it took aim at the overseas home fitness market. It was posting diligently on Western social networks including Instagram, Facebook and Twitter up until the spring of 2019.</p>
<p>According to Keep, the purpose of the latest funding is to let it continue doing what it has focused on in recent years: improving services and products for users and serving fitness professionals against a backdrop of the Chinese government&#8217;s campaign for &#8220;national fitness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe fitness has become an indispensable part of Chinese people&#8217;s everyday life as their income rises and health awareness grows,&#8221; said Eric Chen, managing partner at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/softbank-vision-fund" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="softbank-vision-fund">SoftBank Vision Fund <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China&#8217;s search giant <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/baidu" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="baidu">Baidu <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is extending its car ambitions from mere software to production. The company said Monday that it will set up a company to produce electric vehicles with the help of Chinese automaker Geely. Baidu, a dominant player in China&#8217;s internet search market for the last decade or so, will provide smart driving technologies while Geely, which has an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volvocars-results/geelys-volvo-cars-in-gear-for-recovery-while-merger-delayed-idUSKCN24M0IV">impending merger with Sweden&#8217;s Volvo</a>, will be in charge of car design and manufacturing.</p>
<p>The move marks the latest company in China&#8217;s internet industry to enter the EV space. In November, news arrived that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/alibaba-saic-ev-brand/">Alibaba and Chinese state-owned carmaker SAIC Motor</a> had joined hands to produce electric cars. Ride-share company Didi and EV maker BYD co-developed a model for ride-hailing, which is already attracting customers like <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/meg-announces-purchase-agreement-for-2-000-units-of-d1--byds-custom-electric-ride-hailing-vehicle-301198604.html">Ideanomics</a>. Meanwhile, the stocks of China&#8217;s Tesla challengers, such as Xpeng, Li Auto, and NIO, have been in a steady uptrend over the past year.</p>
<p>Baidu&#8217;s car push is part of its effort to diversify a business relying on search advertising revenue. New media platforms such as ByteDance&#8217;s Toutiao news aggregator and short-video app Douyin come with their own search feature and have gradually eroded the share of traditional search engines like Baidu. Short video services have emerged as the second-most popular channel for internet search in China, trailing after web search engines and coming ahead of social networks and e-commerce, data analytics firm Jiguang <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/RUyiG2o7YfSYvJHEMWsCLw">shows</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Baidu has been working aggressively on autonomous driving since 2017. Its Apollo ecosystem, which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/05/baidus-apollo-platform-becomes-the-android-of-the-autonomous-driving-industry/">billed as &#8220;an Android for smart driving,&#8221;</a> has accumulated over a hundred manufacturing and supplier partners. Baidu has also been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/02/baidu-self-driving-2018/">busy testing autonomous driving</a> and recently <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3101168/baidu-opens-its-robotaxis-public-beijing-making-it-third-city-china">rolled out a robotaxi fleet</a>.</p>
<p>The new venture will operate as a Baidu subsidiary where Geely will serve as a strategic partner and Baidu units like Apollo and Baidu Maps will contribute capabilities. The firm will cover the entire industrial chain, including vehicle design, research and development, manufacturing, sales, and service.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how Baidu&#8217;s tie-up with Geely will affect Apollo&#8217;s operation, though Baidu promised in its announcement that it will &#8220;uphold its spirit of open collaboration across the AI technology industry, striving to work closely with its ecosystem partners to advance the new wave of intelligent transformation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At Baidu, we have long believed in the future of intelligent driving and have over the past decade invested heavily in AI to build a portfolio of world-class self-driving services,&#8221; said Robin Li, co-founder and chief executive officer of Baidu.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that by combining Baidu&#8217;s expertise in smart transportation, connected vehicles and autonomous driving with Geely&#8217;s expertise as a leading automobile and EV manufacturer, the new partnership will pave the way for future passenger vehicles.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">San Francisco police are preparing for a pro-Trump protest at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> headquarters, a building which has been essentially abandoned since the start of the pandemic last year, with most Twitter employees working remotely.</p>
<p>The potential protest comes days after Twitter banned the president from using its service — his favorite form of communication to millions of followers — following what the company called his continued incitements to violence in the wake of the January 6 assault on the Capitol last week by a mob of his followers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The San Francisco Police Department is aware of the possibility of a demonstration on the 1300 block of Market Street (Twitter) tomorrow, Monday January 11, 2021. SFPD has been in contact with representatives from Twitter. We will have sufficient resources available to respond to any demonstrations as well as calls for service citywide,&#8221; a police department spokesperson wrote in an email. &#8220;The San Francisco Police Department is committed to facilitating the public’s right to First Amendment expressions of free speech. We ask that everyone exercising their First Amendment rights be considerate, respectful, and mindful of the safety of others.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The San Francisco Chronicle,<a href="https://twitter.com/sfchronicle/status/1348414208329867265?s=20"> which first reported the preparations from SF police</a>, noted that posts on a popular internet forum for Trump supporters who have relocated from Reddit called for the president&#8217;s adherents to protest his Twitter ban outside of the company&#8217;s headquarters on Monday.</p>
<p data-words="46">Twitter is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">one of several tech companies to deplatform the president</a> and many of his supporters in the wake of the riot at the Capitol on Wednesday.</p>
<aside class="ad-point ad-banner bottom" data-component="ad">
<div id="BP728" data-google-query-id="CO6Z08boku4CFUxc1Qod6TwMMA">At this point, most of the biggest names in tech have pledged to deny service to the President for what they said was his incitement to violence in the wake of the Capitol hill raid that left five people dead &#8212; including a Capitol Police officer.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ajaib.co.id/">Ajaib Group</a>, an online investment platform that says it now runs the fifth-largest stock brokerage in Indonesia by number of trades, announced it has raised a $25 million Series A led by Horizons Ventures, the venture capital firm founded by Li Ka-Shing, and Alpha JWC. Returning investors SoftBank Ventures Asia, Insignia Ventures and Y Combinator also participated in the round, which was made in two closes.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019 by chief executive officer Anderson Sumarli and chief operating officer Yada Piyajomkwan, Ajaib Group focuses on millennials and first-time investors, and currently claims one million monthly users. It has now raised a total of $27 million, including a $2 million seed round in 2019.</p>
<p>Stock investment has a very low penetration rate in Indonesia, with only <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/02/07/govt-idx-still-hope-to-attract-more-to-invest-in-stock-market.html">about 1.6 million capital market investors</a> in the country, or less than 1% of its population (in comparison, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/266807/percentage-americans-owns-stock.aspx">about 55% of Americans own stocks</a>, according to Gallup data).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The very low penetration rate, coupled with <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/08/27/the-rise-of-the-retail-investor-a-new-force-in-indonesias-pandemic-hit-stock-market.html">growing interest in the capital market among retail investors during the pandemic</a>, has spurred VC interest in online investment platforms, especially ones that focus on millennials. Last week, Indonesian investment app Bibit announced a $30 million growth round led by Sequoia Capital India, while another online investment platform, Bareksa, <a href="https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/bareksa-ovo-investment-169842/">confirmed</a> an undisclosed Series B from payment app OVO last year.</p>

<p>Ajaib Group’s founders said it differentiates as a low-fee stock trading platform that also offers mutual funds for diversification. Bibit is a robo-advisor for mutual funds, while Bareksa is a mutual fund marketplace.</p>
<p>In an email, Sumarli and Piyajomkwan told TechCrunch that the stock investment rate is low in Indonesia because it is typically done by high net-worth individuals who use offline brokers and can afford high commissions. Ajaib Group was launched in 2019 after Sumarli became frustrated by the lack of investment platforms in Indonesia where he could also learn about stock trading.</p>
<p>Inspired by companies like Robinhood in the United States and XP Investimentos in Brazil, Ajaib Group was created to be a mobile-first stock trading platform, with no offline brokers or branches. It appeals to first-time investors and millennials with a simple user interface, in-app education features and a community where people can share investment ideas and low fees.</p>
<p>Since people prefer to invest small amounts when trying out the app for the first time, Ajaib requires no minimums to open a brokerage account. Piyajomkwan said “we typically see investors triple their investment amount within the second month of investing with Ajaib.”</p>
<p>Ajaib Group’s platform now includes Ajaib Sekuritas for stock trading and Ajaib Reksadana for mutual funds. The company says that Ajaib Sekuritas became the fifth-largest stock brokerage in Indonesia by number of trades just seven months after it launched in June 2020.</p>
<p>The Indonesian government and Indonesia Stock Exchange have launched initiatives to encourage more stock investing. Some of Ajaib Group’s Series A will be used for its #MentorInvestai campaign, which works with the government to educate millennials about investing and financial planning. The round will also be spent on expanding Ajaib’s tech infrastructure and products, and to hire more engineers.</p>
<p>Ajaib may eventually expand into other Southeast Asian markets, but for the near future, it sees plenty of opportunity in Indonesia. “Ajaib was built with regional aspiration, having two founders from the two biggest capital markets in Southeast Asia, Indonesia and Thailand,” Piyajomkwan said. “But for the immediate term, we are focused on Indonesia as investment penetration is still low and there are many more millennial investors we can serve.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It might be easier at this point to ask which tech platforms President Donald Trump can still use.</p>
<p>Payment-processing company <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/stripe" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="stripe">Stripe <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is the latest tech company to kick Donald Trump off of its platform, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/stripe-stops-processing-payments-for-trump-campaign-website-11610319116">according to a report in The Wall Street Journal</a>.</p>
<p>That means the president&#8217;s campaign website and online fundraising arms will no longer have access to the payment processor&#8217;s services, cutting off the Trump campaign from receiving donations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sources told the Journal that the reason for the company&#8217;s decision was the violation of company policies against encouraging violence.</p>
<p>The move comes as the president has remained largely silent through the official channels at his disposal in the wake of last week&#8217;s riot at the Capitol building.</p>
<p>While Trump has been silent, technology companies have been busy repudiating the president&#8217;s support by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">cutting off access to a range of services</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>The<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/"> deplatforming of the president</a> has effectively removed Trump from all social media outlets including Snap, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Spotify and TikTok.</p>
<p>The technology companies that power most financial transactions online have also blocked the president. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/shopify" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="shopify">Shopify <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/paypal" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="paypal">PayPal <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> were the first to take action against the extremists among President Trump supporters who participated in the riot.</p>
<p>As we wrote earlier this week, PayPal has been <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/paypal-and-shopify-remove-trump-related-accounts-citing-policies-against-supporting-violence/">deactivating the accounts of some groups of Trump supporters</a> who were using the money-transfer fintech to coordinate payments to underwrite the rioters’ actions on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>The company has actually been actively taking steps against far-right activists for a while. After the Charlottesville protests and subsequent rioting in 2017, the company <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paypal-suspends-dozens-of-racist-groups-sites-altright-com/">banned a spate of far-right organizations</a>. These bans have so far not extended directly to the president himself from what TechCrunch can glean.</p>
<p>On Thursday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/shopify-pulls-donald-trump-stores-off-its-website/">Shopify announced that it was removing the storefronts</a> for both the Trump campaign and Trump’s personal brand. That’s an evolution on policy for the company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/09/shopify-ceo-attempts-to-defend-continued-hosting-of-breitbarts-online-store/">which years ago said that it would not moderate its platform</a>, but in recent years has removed some controversial stores, such as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-05/shopify-bans-some-right-wing-groups-after-activist-pressure?sref=AwwRcx4b">some right-wing shops in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>Now, Stripe has joined the actions against the president, cutting off a lucrative source of income for his political operations.</p>
<p>As the Journal reported, the Trump campaign launched a fundraising blitz to raise money for the slew of lawsuits that the president brought against states around the country. The lawsuits were almost all defeated, but the effort did bring in <a class="icon none" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-rnc-raised-207-5-million-after-election-day-11607042954?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> for the Republican party.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hbo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hbo">HBO <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> miniseries &#8220;The Undoing&#8221; wrapped up back in November, but the hosts of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">the Original Content podcast</a> took advantage of the holidays to get caught up.</p>
<p>Based on a novel by Jean Hanff Korelitz, &#8220;The Undoing&#8221; tells the story of Grace Fraser (played by Nicole Kidman), a Manhattan psychologist whose husband Jonathan (Hugh Grant) is accused of a brutal murder. As the trial turns into a media spectacle, Grace tries to navigate how she feels about her husband and to discover who else might be guilty of the crime.</p>
<p>While Jordan had already watched the show as it aired, Anthony and Darrell were inspired to binge it thanks to an email from listener Michael Benedosso, who shared some amusing thoughts on Kidman&#8217;s wavering attempts at a New York accent — resulting in what he called &#8220;a world tour expressed via spoken word.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We agreed that Kidman&#8217;s accent left a lot to be desired, and that her performance often felt a bit oblique (the latter, at least, was probably intentional).</p>
<p>We had other quibbles. For one thing, although the cast is relatively diverse, the story spends most of its time on the wealthy white family at its center, as their wealthy white friends. And there were perhaps a few too many red herrings that didn&#8217;t lead anywhere interesting.</p>
<p>Still, we were pretty satisfied in the end. With only six episodes and plenty of plot twists, there was really no time to get bored, and we were particularly impressed by Grant&#8217;s performance as Jonathan, as well as Noah Jupe as the Frasers&#8217; adolescent son Henry and Noma Dumezweni as Jonathan&#8217;s steely lawyer Haley.</p>
<p>Before reviewing he show, we also discussed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/discovery-plus-launch/">the recent launch of the Discovery+ streaming service</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lenovo" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lenovo">Lenovo <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> seems to have gotten the memo that the real money in the augmented reality space is going to be made in enterprise. Ahead of tomorrow’s <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ces" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ces">CES <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> kick off, the hardware company announced the impending arrival of the ThinkReality A3, a pair of enterprise AR glasses that look to follow the lead set by companies like Epson and Microsoft.</p>
<p>The glasses are set to arrive at some point in the middle of the year. No word from Lenovo on pricing &#8212; which isn’t entirely surprising for an enterprise-only device. The headset sports a 1080p resolution, powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon XR1 chip. A pair of fish-eye cameras provide motion tracking, while an eight-megapixel RGB camera grabs video for remote use.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094012" style="width: 4010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094012" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2094012 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ThinkReality-A3-1.png" alt="" width="4000" height="3000" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ThinkReality-A3-1.png 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ThinkReality-A3-1.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ThinkReality-A3-1.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ThinkReality-A3-1.png?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ThinkReality-A3-1.png?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ThinkReality-A3-1.png?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ThinkReality-A3-1.png?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ThinkReality-A3-1.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4000px) 100vw, 4000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094012" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Lenovo</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The device is designed to tether to a PC or a handful of Motorola (owned by Lenovo) phones via USB-C. The glasses follow the announcement of the ThinkReality A6 head-mounted display, which offers a more traditional form factor (insofar as there is a traditional form factor for AR, I suppose).</p>
<p>“For use in scenarios from factory floors and laboratories to busy retail and hospitality spaces, certified turnkey applications on the Think Reality platform powers remote assistance, guided workflows, and 3D visualization,” the company writes. “Now, industrial workers have a light, flexible, and scalable set of smart glasses to increase productivity and safety while decreasing error rates in daily tasks.”</p>
<p>Clearly Lenovo thinks the immediate future for AR is in the enterprise space. The company has dabbled with it a bit in the consumer space with products like the Star Wars Jedi Challenges headset, but for now at least, that feels like something of a one-off.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The internet is not a private place. Ads try to learn as much about you to sell your information to the highest bidder. Emails know when you open them and which links you click. And some of the biggest internet snoops, like Facebook and Amazon, follow you from site to site as you browse the web.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t have to be like that. We&#8217;ve tried and tested six browser extensions that will immediately improve your privacy online by blocking most of the invisible ads and trackers.</p>
<p>These extensions won&#8217;t block every kind of snooping, but they will vastly reduce your exposure to most of the efforts to track your internet activity. You might not care that advertisers collect your data to learn your tastes and interests to serve you targeted ads. But you might care that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/19/oracle-bluekai-web-tracking/">these ad giants can see</a> which medical conditions you&#8217;re looking up and what private purchases you&#8217;re making.</p>
<p>By blocking these hidden trackers from loading, websites can&#8217;t collect as much information about you. Plus by dropping the unnecessary bulk, some websites will load faster. The tradeoff is that some websites might not load properly or refuse to let you in if you don&#8217;t let them track you. You can toggle the extensions on and off as needed, or you could ask yourself if the website was that good to begin with and could you not just find what you were looking for somewhere else?</p>
<h2>HTTPS Everywhere</h2>
<p>We&#8217;re pretty much hardwired to look for that little green lock in our browser to tell us a website was loaded over an HTTPS-encrypted connection. That means the websites you open haven&#8217;t been hijacked or modified by an attacker before it loaded and that anything you submit to that website can&#8217;t be seen by anyone other than the website. <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> is a browser extension made by the non-profit internet group the Electronic Frontier Foundation that automatically loads websites over HTTPS where it&#8217;s offered, and allows you to block the minority of websites that don&#8217;t support HTTPS. The extension is <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">supported by most browsers</a>, including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera.</p>
<h2>Privacy Badger</h2>
<p>Another extension developed by the EFF, <a href="https://privacybadger.org/">Privacy Badger</a> is one of the best all-in-one extensions for blocking invisible third-party trackers on websites. This extension looks at all the components of a web page and learns which ones track you from website to website, and then blocks them from loading in the browser. Privacy Badger also learns as you travel the web, so it gets better over time. And it requires no effort or configuration to work, just install it and leave it to it. The extension is available on <a href="https://privacybadger.org/">most major browsers</a>.</p>
<h2>uBlock Origin</h2>
<p>Ads are what keeps the internet free, but often at the expense of your personal information. Ads try to learn as much about you — usually by watching your browsing activity and following you across the web — so that they can target you with ads you&#8217;re more likely to click on. Ad blockers stop them in their tracks by blocking ads from loading, but also the tracking code that comes with it.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock">uBlock Origin</a> is a lightweight, simple but effective, and widely trusted ad blocker used by millions of people, but it also has a ton of granularity and customizability for the more advanced user. (Be careful with impersonators: there are plenty of ad blockers that aren&#8217;t as trusted that use a similar name.) And if you feel bad about the sites that rely on ads for revenue (including us!), consider a subscription to the site instead. After all, a free web that relies on ad tracking to make money is what got us into this privacy nightmare to begin with.</p>
<p>uBlock Origin works in <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en">Chrome</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">Firefox</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/#installation">Edge</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/">extension is open source</a> so anyone can look at how it works.</p>
<h2>PixelBlock &amp; ClearURLs</h2>
<p>If you thought hidden trackers in websites were bad, wait until you learn about what&#8217;s lurking in your emails. Most emails from brand names come with tiny, often invisible pixels that alerts the sender when you&#8217;ve opened them. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixelblock/jmpmfcjnflbcoidlgapblgpgbilinlem">PixelBlock</a> is a simple extension for Chrome browsers that simply blocks these hidden email open trackers from loading and working. Every time it detects a tracker, it displays a small red eye in your inbox so you know.</p>
<p>Most of these same emails also come with tracking links that alerts the sender which links you click. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clearurls/lckanjgmijmafbedllaakclkaicjfmnk?hl=en">ClearURLs</a>, available for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clearurls/lckanjgmijmafbedllaakclkaicjfmnk?hl=en">Chrome</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/clearurls/">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/mdkdmaickkfdekbjdoojfalpbkgaddei">Edge</a>, sits in your browser and silently removes the tracking junk from every link in your browser and your inbox. That means ClearURLs needs more access to your browser&#8217;s data than most of these extensions, but its makers <a href="https://gitlab.com/KevinRoebert/ClearUrls/-/issues/159">explain why</a> in the documentation.</p>
<h2>Firefox Multi-Account Containers</h2>
<p>And an honorary mention for Firefox users, who can take advantage of <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/">Multi-Account Containers</a>, built by the browser maker itself to help you isolate your browsing activity. That means you can have one container full of your work tabs in your browser, and another container with all of your personal tabs, saving you from having to use multiple browsers. Containers also keep your <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers">private personal browsing separate</a> from your work browsing activity. It also means you can put sites like Facebook or Google in a container, making it far more difficult for them to see which websites you visit and understand your tastes and interests. Containers are easy to use and customizable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/parler" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="parler">Parler <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is at risk of disappearing, just as the social media network popular among conservatives was reaching new heights of popularity in the wake of President Donald Trump&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">ban from all major tech social platforms</a>.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon-web-services" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon-web-services">Amazon Web Services, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which provides backend cloud services, has informed Parler that it intends to cut ties with the company in the next 24 hours, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/amazon-parler-aws">according to a report in BuzzFeed News.</a> Parler&#8217;s application is built on top of AWS infrastructure, services that are critical for the operation of its platform. Earlier today, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/apple-suspend-parler-from-app-store/">Apple announced that it was following Google in blocking the app from its App Store</a>, citing a lack of content moderation.</p>
<p>Parler, whose fortunes have soared as users upset at the President&#8217;s silencing on mainstream social media outlets flocked to the service, is now another site of contention in the struggle over the limits of free speech and accountability online.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Parler CEO John Matze said that <a href="https://twitter.com/parlertakes/status/1348097074772930560?s=20">the platform would be offline for at least a week</a>, as &#8220;they rebuild from scratch&#8221; in response to AWS&#8217; communications. Some Parler users, <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnPaczkowski/status/1348113828324667396?s=20">as captured in screenshots shared on Twitter</a>, seemed to respond with vague intentions to violently attack AWS data centers, perhaps proving Amazon&#8217;s point in the process.</p>
<div id="mod-subbuzz-text-1" class="subbuzz subbuzz-text xs-mb4 xs-relative " data-retailers="Amazon" data-keywords="cleaning,fast fashion" data-module="subbuzz-text">
<p>In the wake of the riots at the Capitol on Wednesday and a purge of accounts accused of inciting violence on Twitter and Facebook, Parler had become the home for a raft of radical voices calling for armed &#8220;Patriots&#8221; to commit violence at the nation&#8217;s capitol and statehouses around the country.</p>
<p>Most recently, conservative militants on the site had been calling for &#8220;Patriots&#8221; to amplify the events of January 6 with a march on Washington DC with weapons on January 19.</p>
<p>Even as pressure was came from Apple and Amazon, <a href="https://twitter.com/AMZNforClimate/status/1347799256883552259">whose employees had called for the suspension of services with the company</a>, Parler was taking steps to moderate posts on its platform.</p>
<p>The company acknowledged that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/parler-reportedly-removed-posts-by-trump-affiliate-lin-wood-calling-for-execution-of-vp-mike-pence/">removed some posts from Trump supporter Lin Wood</a>, who had called for the execution of Vice President Mike Pence in a series of proclamations on the company&#8217;s site.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, Republican lawmakers including <a href="https://www.cruz.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=5218" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sen. Ted Cruz</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DevinNunes/status/1326700669579882497?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Congressman Devin Nunes</a> — along with conservative firebrands like Wood have found a home on the platform, where they can share conspiracy theories with abandon.</p>
<p>In an email quoted by BuzzFeed News, Amazon Web Services&#8217; Trust and Safety Team told Parler&#8217;s chief policy officer, Amy Peikoff that calls for violence that were spreading across Parler&#8217;s platform violated its terms of service. The company&#8217;s team also said that Parler&#8217;s plan to use volunteers to moderate content on the platform would prove effective, according to BuzzFeed.</p>
<p>“Recently, we’ve seen a steady increase in this violent content on your website, all of which violates our terms. It’s clear that Parler does not have an effective process to comply with the AWS terms of service,” BuzzFeed reported the email as saying.</p>

<p>Here’s Amazon’s letter to Parler in full.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Amy,</p>
<p>Thank you for speaking with us earlier today.</p>
<p>As we discussed on the phone yesterday and this morning, we remain troubled by the repeated violations of our terms of service. Over the past several weeks, we’ve reported 98 examples to Parler of posts that clearly encourage and incite violence. Here are a few examples below from the ones we’ve sent previously: [See images above.]</p>
<p>Recently, we’ve seen a steady increase in this violent content on your website, all of which violates our terms. It’s clear that Parler does not have an effective process to comply with the AWS terms of service. It also seems that Parler is still trying to determine its position on content moderation. You remove some violent content when contacted by us or others, but not always with urgency. Your CEO recently stated publicly that he doesn’t “feel responsible for any of this, and neither should the platform.” This morning, you shared that you have a plan to more proactively moderate violent content, but plan to do so manually with volunteers. It’s our view that this nascent plan to use volunteers to promptly identify and remove dangerous content will not work in light of the rapidly growing number of violent posts. This is further demonstrated by the fact that you still have not taken down much of the content that we’ve sent you. Given the unfortunate events that transpired this past week in Washington, D.C., there is serious risk that this type of content will further incite violence.</p>
<p>AWS provides technology and services to customers across the political spectrum, and we continue to respect Parler’s right to determine for itself what content it will allow on its site. However, we cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others. Because Parler cannot comply with our terms of service and poses a very real risk to public safety, we plan to suspend Parler’s account effective Sunday, January 10th, at 11:59PM PST. We will ensure that all of your data is preserved for you to migrate to your own servers, and will work with you as best as we can to help your migration.</p>
<p>&#8211; AWS Trust &amp; Safety Team</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Update January 9, 2020: Added a note about Parler users&#8217; reactions.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> confirmed that it has suspended the conservative social media app Parler from the App Store, shortly after Google banned it from Google Play. The app, which became a home to Trump supporters and several high-profile conservatives in the days leading up to the Capitol riots, had been operating in violation of Apple’s rules.</p>
<p>The company tells TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have always supported diverse points of view being represented on the App Store, but there is no place on our platform for threats of violence and illegal activity. Parler has not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of these threats to people’s safety. We have suspended <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/parler" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="parler">Parler <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> from the App Store until they resolve these issues.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the wake of its decision Apple sent Parler&#8217;s developers the following note:</p>
<blockquote><p>To the developers of the Parler app,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response regarding dangerous and harmful content on Parler. We have determined that the measures you describe are inadequate to address the proliferation of dangerous and objectionable content on your app.</p>
<p>Parler has not upheld its commitment to moderate and remove harmful or dangerous content encouraging violence and illegal activity, and is not in compliance with the App Store Review Guidelines.</p>
<p>In your response, you referenced that Parler has been taking this content “very seriously for weeks.” However, the processes Parler has put in place to moderate or prevent the spread of dangerous and illegal content have proved insufficient. Specifically, we have continued to find direct threats of violence and calls to incite lawless action in violation of Guideline 1.1 &#8211; Safety &#8211; Objectionable Content.</p>
<p>Your response also references a moderation plan “for the time being,” which does not meet the ongoing requirements in Guideline 1.2 &#8211; Safety &#8211; User Generated content. While there is no perfect system to prevent all dangerous or hateful user content, apps are required to have robust content moderation plans in place to proactively and effectively address these issues. A temporary “task force” is not a sufficient response given the widespread proliferation of harmful content.</p>
<p>For these reasons, your app will be removed from the App Store until we receive an update that is compliant with the App Store Review Guidelines and you have demonstrated your ability to effectively moderate and filter the dangerous and harmful content on your service.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>App Review Board</p></blockquote>
<p>Conservative commentator and Parler investor Dan Bongino posted about Apple&#8217;s decision on the site:</p>
<blockquote><p>The tech tyrants at Apple have pulled the app from their App Store. Apple is no different than the Chinese communist party in their preference for totalitarian thought control. I’m proud of the remaining liberty-loving people of this great country. And I’m embarrassed, and horrified by the tech totalitarians who’ve taken control of it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bongino was among those recently suspended from Twitter. He noted, however, that <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/dan-bongino-quits-twitter-after-suspension/">he had no intention to return to the site</a>.</p>
<p>While Parler is no longer available through the store at present, it seems it will still be available to access for those who have already downloaded it. As The New York Times noted earlier this week,</p>
<blockquote><p>If Apple pulls Parler from the App Store, people would not be able to download the app to their iPhones or iPads. People who had already downloaded the Parler iPhone app would still be able to use it, but the company would not be able to update the app, meaning it would eventually be rendered obsolete as Apple updated the iPhone software.</p></blockquote>
<p>But Parler&#8217;s future remains more uncertain than most, as there&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/acvisneski/status/1347717079533645824">a growing push inside Amazon</a> to pull the plug on Parler, too.</p>

<p>The news comes shortly after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/">Google banned it from Google Play</a>. The app, which became a home to Trump supporters and several high-profile conservatives in the days leading up the Capitol riots, had been operating in violation of Apple&#8217;s rules, we understand. Apple&#8217;s App Store guidelines require apps hosting user-generated content to have moderation policies to remove content that incites violence.</p>
<p>Despite these policies, neither Apple nor Google had taken action to remove Parler in prior weeks, even though Trump supporters and other far-right users had <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/01/06/trump-riot-twitter-parler-proud-boys-boogaloos-antifa-qanon/6570794002/">used the app to call for violence </a>and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/trump-rioters-planned-online?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">organize their plans</a> to storm the Capitol. The insurrection left five people dead, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/07/four-dead-after-pro-trump-rioters-storm-capitol.html">over 50 police officers injured</a>, and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/thirteen-charged-federal-court-following-riot-united-states-capitol">more than a dozen facing federal charges</a>, in addition to the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-01-07/capitol-arrests-in-dc-riots">growing number of arrests</a> emerging as suspects are identified.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/apple-threatens-ban-parler">BuzzFeed News</a> on Friday reported Parler had received a letter from Apple which warned that the app would be removed from the App Store within 24 hours, unless the company submitted a content moderation improvement plan.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s notice read:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>We have received numerous complaints regarding objectionable content in your Parler service, accusations that the Parler app was used to plan, coordinate, and facilitate the illegal activities in Washington D.C. on January 6, 2021 that led (among other things) to loss of life, numerous injuries, and the destruction of property. The app also appears to continue to be used to plan and facilitate yet further illegal and dangerous activities.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>(TechCrunch additionally confirmed BuzzFeed&#8217;s reporting.)</p>
<p>Parler CEO John Matze posted about Apple&#8217;s ultimatum to his own Parler account, saying he would not cave to &#8220;those authoritarians who hate free speech.&#8221; Earlier today, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/parler-reportedly-removed-posts-by-trump-affiliate-lin-wood-calling-for-execution-of-vp-mike-pence/">it was noted that</a> the service reportedly removed a post from Trump associate Lin Wood over calls for violence against Vice President, Mike Pence.</p>

<p>Ahead of its removal, Parler had ranked No. 1 in News on the iPhone App Store and No. 13 Overall, according to data from App Annie. On Friday, it was ranking as high as No. 1, at times, on the iPhone&#8217;s Top Charts of free non-game apps, though final data was not available.</p>

<p>Currently, the app is hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS), but it appears to be in violation of the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/aup/#:~:text=AWS%20Acceptable%20Use%20Policy.%20This%20Acceptable%20Use%20Policy,examples%20described%20in%20this%20Policy%20are%20not%20exhaustive.">AWS Acceptable Use Policy</a> which could serve as grounds for its removal.</p>
<p>The collective action of tech company employees is playing a key role in some of the decisions being made regarding Trump and his supporters&#8217; access to platforms to communicate and organize in the days following the Capitol riots. According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/08/twitter-trump-dorsey/">The Washington Post</a>, for example, over 350 Twitter employees signed a letter urging CEO Jack Dorsey and other execs to permanently suspend Trump&#8217;s account before the company followed through.</p>

<p>Trump <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/the-deplatforming-of-a-president/">has now lost his ability</a> to post to Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and Twitch, to name a few. Meanwhile, Parler&#8217;s removal from both app stores will limit the reach of the more radical and violent Trump supporter movement to some extent, forcing them to more obscure corners of the web. However, many argue these measures <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/the-technology-202-facebook-s-critics-say-trump-ban-came-too-late/ar-BB1cAivz?civicscience-widget-version=4">have come too late</a>, as the damage to not only Capitol, but to the nation&#8217;s psyche as whole, has already been done.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It seems that even the &#8220;free speech&#8221; social network <a href="https://parler.com/">Parler</a> has its limits.</p>
<p>The social network that has attracted scores of conservative commentators because of its commitment to free speech has taken down several posts from Trump affiliate Lin Wood, <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/news/pro-trump-lawyer-lin-wood-calls-for-pence-to-be-executed-posts-get-removed-from-parler/">according to a report in <em>Mediaite</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>In one of the posts removed from the social media platform, Wood called for the execution of Vice President <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/pence-mike" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="pence-mike">Mike Pence <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wood adds on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/parler" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="parler">Parler <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> that he is currently serving a Twitter suspension. <a href="https://t.co/JqvF0VM2gu">pic.twitter.com/JqvF0VM2gu</a></p>

<p>In a statement to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/mediaite" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="mediaite">Mediaite, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Parler chief executive John Matze confirmed that the service had taken action against Wood&#8217;s posts to the platform.</p>
<p>“Yes, some of his parleys that violated our rules were taken down,” Matze told Mediaite. “Including the ones you are talking about.”</p>
<p>The move from Parler is significant because it would mark one of the first instances of a high profile conservative figure having their content removed from the service.</p>
<p>Parler, despite its reputation as a social platform dedicated to free speech, does have some rules governing content.</p>
<p>And, as Mediaite flagged, the posts from Wood likely ran afoul of a rule in the company&#8217;s terms of service that states &#8220;reported parleys, comments, or messages sent using our service will be deemed a violation of these Guidelines if they contain: an explicit or implicit encouragement to use violence, or to commit a lawless action, such that: (a) the Parleyer intends his or her speech to result in the use of violence or lawless action, and (b) the imminent use of violence or lawless action is the likely result of the parley, comment, or message.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wood, whose account remains active on Parler, had his <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> account suspended on Thursday, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackbrewster/2021/01/07/lin-wood-lawyer-closely-tied-to-trump-permanently-banned-from-twitter-after-claiming-capitol-siege-was-staged/?sh=7594929e1be3">as Forbes reported at the time</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the incitements to execute Pence seem to have been the animating factor for at least some of the rioters who stormed the Capitol building on Wednesday. Reuters Photo News Editor Jim Bourg tweeted about hearing at least three different rioters hoping to &#8220;find Vice President Mike Pence and execute him by hanging him from a Capitol Hill tree as a traitor.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congrats on surviving this wild first week of 2021. Outside all-things political, a few labor developments happened that are worth noting. Also, shortly before the mob of Trump supporters wreaked havoc on the U.S. Capitol, I caught up with Dr. Timnit Gebru, the prominent AI ethics researcher who said she was fired from Google last month for speaking out about diversity issues. Our full conversation will be available to listen to next Saturday on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/techcrunch-mixtape/id1317432118">the newest episode of TC Mixtape</a>, but I’ve included some snippets for y’all below.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sign up here to get Human Capital delivered straight to your inbox every Friday at 1 p.m. PT. </span></p>
<p><b>Google, Alphabet workers unionize</b></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of more than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/google-alphabet-employees-union/">200 Google and Alphabet workers announced the formation of the Alphabet Workers Union earlier this week</a>. With the help of Communication Workers of America Union’s Campaign to Organize Digital Employees (CODE-CWA), the union is open to both employees and contractors in the U.S. and Canada.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the 690 workers who have signed on to support the union as of this weekend, they all committed to set aside 1% of their yearly compensation to go toward union dues. Those dues will be used to help compensate folks for lost wages in the event of a strike. The bulk of the workers who have signed on are mostly based in offices in the San Francisco Bay Area and one in Cambridge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be clear, though, the Alphabet Workers Union is a bit untraditional. For the Alphabet union, the intent is not necessarily to be able to bargain with Alphabet-owned companies but to be able to work collectively toward common goals.</span></p>
<p><b>Labor department issues filing ruling re: gig workers</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this week, the U.S. Department of Labor </span><a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/flsa/2021-independent-contractor"><span style="font-weight: 400;">issued a final rule pertaining to gig workers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The rule, which goes into effect March 8, 2021, makes it easier for gig economy companies like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Instacart to legally classify workers as independent contractors throughout the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it remains to be seen if this rule will fully manifest under the new leadership of President-Elect Joe Biden, who is set to be inaugurated on Jan 20, 2021. </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/labor-department-finalizes-independent-contractor-rule-11609943031?mod=hp_lead_pos4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Wall Street Journal</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Biden spokesperson Jen Psaki previously pointed to the labor rule as an example of regulation Biden could stop or delay on his inauguration day. </span></p>
<p><b>Independent Drivers Guild Chicago forms</b></p>
<p><a href="https://drivingguild.org/welcome-chicago/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rideshare drivers in Chicago recently teamed up with Independent Drivers Guild</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to launch a local branch of the drivers’ rights organization. IDG, which is affiliated with the Machinists Union, has historically advocated for the rights of rideshare drivers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“IDG beat the odds to win higher pay and benefits for drivers in New York City and working together, we know we can do the same here in Chicago,” Steven Everett, a Chicago rideshare driver-organizer, said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><b>What’s next for Dr. Timnit Gebru</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of you are likely familiar with Dr. Timnit Gebru, but the TL;DR is that she recently left Google after speaking out about diversity issues in artificial intelligence. Google says Gebru resigned and it merely accepted her resignation, while Gebru says Google fired her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I caught up with Dr. Gebru on Wednesday to chat about what’s next for her, as well as some recent developments in tech’s labor struggles.</span></p>
<p><b>On the Alphabet Workers Union:</b></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a combination of a lot of peoples work and frustration. And i think this is the only way because this is a way to give workers power, and so that they can be at the negotiating table, because right now, they don’t have power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;] One thing I really appreciate about this union is that it’s all workers. It’s not just, you know, full time workers, it’s temp workers and full-time workers, which is extremely important because the tech industry is right now running on the backs of these contract workers who have zero security.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;] What I worry about though, is that [Google has] been extremely aggressive with trying to union  bust and trying to stop these kinds of organizing &#8212; any type of organizing and now that it’s become something real, I think  they’re going to intensify their efforts, like a lot more in trying to stop this organizing from happening. And there are many well-known tactics to do this, right. This kind of like propaganda and kind of dividing and conquering and all that. So that’s my worry. And I think everybody needs to stay vigilant to make sure that that doesn’t happen.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>On fighting for severance:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t know if I’m going to, you know, explain to you exactly what I’m thinking right now about that,” she said, adding that “I definitely have lawyers.”</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, what they did to me was wrong and I definitely want to, you know, take some sort of action but what that is is not necessarily crystal clear.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><b>On working at a tech company again</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to joining Google, Dr. Gebru held roles at Apple and Microsoft. While, she still plans to work in the field of artificial intelligence ethics and work with Black in AI, Dr. Gebru said “it’s very hard for me to imagine joining a corporation right now.”</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m just sick of these institutions because you spend so much of your energy, fighting for simple things, just simple things that people don&#8217;t have any incentive to change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;] I want to spend more time thinking about how we can have our own institutions rather than just you know, fighting these people over and over again. That&#8217;s my current thinking.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Envisioning a firm or a non-profit that does what the ethical AI team at Google was doing under her leadership, but that’s not affiliated with any corporation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to create technology that would also work for us, rather than just playing catch up,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So I think that’s the idea of Black in AI.”</span></p>

<hr />
<p>So much for a quiet start to the year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Any hopes of 2021 giving us respite from the turbulent waters of 2020 went splat, as the first week of the New Year was busy with venture capital deals (Divvy! Gtmhub!), IPO news (Affirm! Poshmark! Roblox!), SPAC news (SoFi! BuzzFeed!), and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/tech-leaders-speak-out-about-platforms-roles-in-us-capitol-riots/">violence in the American capital</a>. We’ll get to all of that in a minute, minus the political stuff as I don’t have the heart to scream again before the work week is over.</p>
<p>Today we’re starting with two growth stories, one from a company that is nearing IPO scale, and the other from a startup that is just getting its feet underneath it after a product launch.</p>
<p>We’ll start with <a href="https://cloudinary.com/">Cloudinary</a>, a media-focused software company that we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/cloudinary-passes-60m-arr-without-vc-money/">covered in early 2020</a>, when the bootstrapped company announced that it had reached $60 million in annual recurring revenue, or ARR. I caught up with the private upstart again this week to check in on what it was like to bootstrap through a pandemic.</p>
<p>Cloudinary co-founder and CEO Itai Lahan told TechCrunch that his company has reached $80 million ARR, or 33% growth during a very busy year. Not bad, right? But according to Lahan, Cloudinary had targeted a number over $90 million for the year. So what happened?</p>
<p>Well, Cloudinary intentionally decelerated a little bit.</p>
<p>Lahan walked TechCrunch through how Cloudinary dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic, which had an impact on parts of its customer base. Lahan and the rest of the company decided to slow down, he said, reducing the pace at which it was hiring, among other initiatives. The goal was to get the company through the pandemic, switch to remote work with its culture intact, he said.</p>
<p><em><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/army-air-force-exchange-service" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="army-air-force-exchange-service">The Exchange <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is looking for startups between $35 million and $60 million ARR that are growing quickly and are willing to share performance metrics. </em><a href="mailto:alex.wilhelm@techcrunch.com"><em>Email in if that’s you</em></a><em>. More on the project </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/one-final-100m-arr-company-and-the-startups-we-want-to-meet-in-2021/"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>The gap between the company’s $80 million ARR result and its original goal was a mix of COVID-19’s commercial impact and the company’s own choices, Lahan said.</p>
<p>When’s the last time I heard the CEO of a private technology company tell me that they were making conscious choices to slow their company down? I honestly don’t remember. Lahan had reasons, however, that went past <em>not</em> having recently raised $100 million or whatever. Instead, the company decided to exchange short-term financial growth for what the CEO described variously as long-term growth or sustainable growth.</p>
<p>Lahan said that if Cloudinary focuses on its customers and employees over short-term financial goals, it will grow more in the next half-decade than it will if it decided to sprint as fast as it could today. One example of the choice to go a little slower in 2020? The company has around 285 people today, under its original plan to have around 320.</p>
<p>Wild, right? This is all possible because Lahan and his team at once don’t have to answer to external investors with short, or medium-term time frames in mind for liquidity, and because Cloudinary makes secondary liquidity available to its workers, alleviating internal agitating for an IPO.</p>
<p>Not that we would <em>mind</em> Cloudinary going public so we could dig into its numbers more deeply. It should cross $100 million ARR this year, so it’s nearly time to start sending it regular, annoying emails.</p>
<p>Now on to our smaller company: OnJuno! If Cloudinary is nearly ready to go public, OnJuno is getting ready to think about a Series A. So it’s just a <em>little</em> bit younger.</p>
<p>TechCrunch first spoke with <a href="https://onjuno.com/">OnJuno</a> in December, right after it launched, trying to figure out why the world needed another neobank of sorts. According to co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/varundeshpande14/">Varun Deshpande</a>, OnJuno is targeted at <em>affluent</em> individuals, while other neobanks have more traditionally targeted less-wealthy customers.</p>
<p>OnJuno entices them with higher interest rates, and a focus on what Deshpande described as the more debit-focused Asian American community. How is it going? We checked back in with OnJuno, about three-and-a-half weeks after it launched. Per Deshpande, OnJuno expects to reach the $10 million assets under management (AUM) threshold shortly, with users bringing average deposits of $7,000 to $8,000. That’s a multiple of some other neobanks, the startup said.</p>
<p>The fintech upstart said that it expects to reach $100 million AUM in the next two to three quarters, adding that around 80% of its users come <em>from</em> traditional banks. Let’s see how fast it can reach $25 million AUM, and if its deposit averages hold up.</p>
<p>Now, venture rounds, IPOs news, and then &#8212; I am sorry &#8212; some SPAC news we need to discuss.</p>
<h2>Venture capital</h2>
<p>Despite it being the first minutes and hours and days of 2021, so very much happened. To pick an example, we have now seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/with-5-new-unicorns-in-first-week-of-2021-are-we-in-for-a-stampede-this-year/">around a half dozen new unicorns born</a>, with another group in the provisional camp.</p>
<p>The pace of new unicorn creation feels exciting, but as we’re still too close to Q4 2020 for comfort, I don’t want to call this a trend yet. But as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/divvy-raises-165m-as-the-spend-management-space-stays-red-hot/">Divvy puts $165 million</a> to work at a $1.6 billion valuation, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/hinge-healthy-d/">Hinge Health blasts to a $3 billion valuation</a> and Salesloft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/with-5-new-unicorns-in-first-week-of-2021-are-we-in-for-a-stampede-this-year/">meets the mark and more</a>, it’s been busy.</p>
<p>On the slightly-smaller-but-still-very-interesting side of the VC coin, Bangalore-based Jumbotail <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/jumbotail-raises-14-2-million-for-its-wholesale-marketplace-in-india/">picked up $14.2 million</a> this week to help it pursue what we called “the opportunity to digitize neighborhood stores in the world’s second-largest internet market.” That actually sounds cool? And important?</p>
<p>And in an even smaller round, Atlanta, Georgia-based Voxie <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/voxie-series-a/">raised a $6.7 million in Series A</a>. Voxie “offers tools to help businesses automate and manage” their text message-based marketing. This shows how much space there still is in the software market for new startups. I would have bet you an espresso that we had tapped out the text messaging startup space three years ago. Nope!</p>
<p>Coming up, some re-digs into startup clusters. After looking at how quickly startups building corporate-cards-and-software businesses are growing, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/okr-focused-gtmhub-raises-30m-series-b-after-growing-3x-in-2020/">we’re dipping back into software startups building OKR software</a>. If that’s you, <a href="mailto:alex.wilhelm@techcrunch.com">get your data in</a> or be left out.</p>
<h2>IPOs</h2>
<p>Zooming out from our regular coverage of IPOs, here’s what you need to know: Affirm and Poshmark are pursuing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/affirm-targets-up-to-38-per-share-in-ipo-pushing-its-valuation-above-9b/"><em>traditional</em> IPOs</a> at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/at-35-to-39-per-share-poshmarks-ipo-could-5x-its-last-private-valuation/"><em>huge markups</em></a> to their final private valuations. That means that the 2021 IPO market is kicking off like a mirror to the late-2020 IPO market. Expect some big pops in coming months for some companies you know by name.</p>
<p>The other bit of news that matters is that Roblox has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/robloxs-raises-at-29-5-billion-valuation-as-it-readies-for-direct-listing/">scrapped its IPO plans</a>, raised an enormous brick of cash, and now intends to direct list. <em>Why</em> is a perfectly fine question to ask, and one that we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/the-roblox-gambit/">tried to answer here</a>.</p>
<p>Takeaways? The IPO market will be active, and perhaps more diverse than expected in 2021. At least to start.</p>
<h2>SPACs (alas)</h2>
<p>While you are tired and bored of SPACs, and I am as well, they are actually doing things at last that we do care about. In brief to respect your time and sanity:</p>
<ul>
<li>BuzzFeed <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/buzzfeed-has-held-discussions-with-rascoffs-spac">might go public via a SPAC</a>. Our verdict: That shit’s bodacious and we want to see BuzzFeed News have as much loot as possible to keep up <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alison_killing/xinjiang-camps-china-factories-forced-labor">its critical reporting</a>.</li>
<li>SoFi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/sofi-nears-deal-to-go-public-in-merger-with-chamath-palihapitiyas-newest-spac/">might go public via a SPAC</a>, you can read the investor deck <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1818874/000110465921001952/tm211973d1_ex99-2.htm">here</a>, which seems dumb. Why not just go public? But as Chamath is involved, this one is going to do a <em>lot</em> of press.</li>
<li>Bustle <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bustle-m-a/bustle-hires-bank-to-explore-deal-to-go-public-source-idUSKBN29C33T">could go public via a SPAC</a>. Our verdict: Wait, really?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Odds/Ends</h2>
<p>Lots of venture capital funds raised capital, which we yammered about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/hopin-might-be-the-fastest-growth-story-of-this-era/">here</a> on the podcast. But I wanted to throw one more into the mix: Transformation Capital, which put together <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/2021/01/08/transformation-capital-launches-500m-digital-health-fund/%5C">a $500 million fund focused on digital health</a>.</p>
<p>The nice thing about thematic funds, like this and <a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2021/01/usv-climate-fund/">USV’s new climate fund</a>, is that you actually know what they do. Which in the case of Transformation Capital, is investing “investing in commercial-stage digital health companies,” in its own words. Word.</p>
<p>This is the second such fund from the group, which now has $800 million under management. Cool.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[In the past few months, there hasn’t been one conversation I’ve had about remote work that doesn’t include a mention of Hopin, a virtual events platform last valued at $2.1 billion.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Want this newsletter in your inbox every Saturday morning? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here.</a></em></p>
<p>In the past few months, there hasn’t been one conversation I’ve had about remote work that doesn’t include a mention of Hopin, a virtual events platform last valued at $2.1 billion.</p>
<p>For a company only a little older than a year, Hopin has a wild growth story. It grew its ARR from $0 to $20 million in nine months. It scooped up two businesses to differentiate its business, including StreamYard <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/hopin-buys-livestreaming-startup-streamyard-for-250m-as-it-looks-to-expand-its-product-lineup/ ">for $250 million</a> just this week. And its last financing round left the company’s valuation at $2.1 billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hopin’s growth amid Zoom’s fatigue is giving validation to a whole crop of remote-work-focused startups. I see startups in the category sitting in two camps: Either you’re betting that users want a more passive way to interact with video or you’re betting that users want a more active way to interact with video.</p>
<p>This week, for example, I wrote about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/rewatch-seed/">Rewatch</a>, which creates internal private channels for startups to archive all their videoconferencing meetings. The company is essentially turning live meetings into transcribed documents that employees can sift through on their own time, shifting from synchronous to asynchronous.</p>
<p>In contrast, I also covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/teamflow-lands-3-9-million-for-a-productive-virtual-hq-platform/ ">Teamflow</a>, a platform that wants to give a virtual space to companies to recreate the serendipity and productivity of an office. Unlike Rewatch, Teamflow thinks that employees want there to be more live moments in a distributed world.</p>
<p>Both previously in-stealth companies cited Hopin as an example of the need for innovation around how we interact virtually. Rewatch and Teamflow, respectively, see Zoom as a plug-in or competitor &#8211; not inspiration.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/hopin-might-be-the-fastest-growth-story-of-this-era/?tpcc=ECTW2020">this week’s podcast</a>, it’s a dynamic I expect to play out even more over the next few months, as we evolve from a Zoom world to a Zoom alternative world. I want to hear from you, even if you disagree, about what companies in the remote work space should be on my radar.

<h2><strong>The power of platform</strong></h2>
<p>This week, the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://techcrunch.com/tag/capitol-riot&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1610142154051000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3xYNZyrGHa0hdVQDxSu0Vl">U.S. Capitol building was stormed</a> by pro-Trump insurrectionists in a fatal riot. Many in the tech community blamed Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg for not limiting hate speech on their respective platforms, thus stoking flames of domestic terrorism.</p>
<ul>

<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">banned Trump for 2 weeks</a></li>

<p>Even as many see the response as too little too late, the events mark a crucial change in the way that regulation between government and tech works.</p>
<p><strong>Etc:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/HipCityReg">Reggie James</a>, CEO and founder of Eternal, framed the issue in a<a href="https://twitter.com/HipCityReg/status/1347190338784473088 "> tweet:</a></p>

<h2><strong>FTC versus DTC</strong></h2>
<p>Sticking to our government and tech theme, P&amp;G has officially<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/pg-terminates-plan-to-acquire-razor-startup-billie-following-ftc-lawsuit/"> terminated its plan</a> to acquire razor startup, Billie, after the FTC sued over antitrust concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>Billie was founded in 2017 with the goal of fighting the “pink tax” on goods marketed to women, including razors and body wash. It was going to be acquired by P&amp;G after raising just $35 million in venture capital.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/12/billie-which-wants-to-destroy-the-pink-tax-closes-a-6m-seed-round-for-its-razor-subscription-service/">Here’s our seed coverage</a> of the startup.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Etc: </strong>Direct-to-consumer brands <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/ftc-sues-to-block-pgs-acquisition-of-billie-a-razor-startup-for-women/">are not happy</a>. The failed deal is not-so-subtly signaling to DTC brands that there is a cap to their scale, at least in the FTC’s eyes. Government regulation and limited scale also could hurt VC interest in the category.</p>
<p>The optimistic news is that VC funding might <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/why-vc-funding-is-falling-out-of-favor-with-top-d2c-brands/ ">be falling out of favor with top D2C brands. </a></p>
<p>Many product-based brands, as it turns out, are no longer interested in chasing venture capital, playing the “grow-at-all-costs” game and relinquishing partial control to investors, despite the pandemic and the uncertain circumstances many founders find themselves facing.</p>

<p>The social network, <a href="https://parler.com/">Parler</a>, a network that mimics Twitter, is now the number one app in Apple&#8217;s app store and Gab, another conservative-backed service, <a href="https://twitter.com/getongab/status/1347936722265391114?s=20">claimed that it was seeing an explosion in the number of signups to its web-based platform as well</a>.</p>

<p>Parler&#8217;s ballooning user base comes at a potentially perilous time for the company.

<p>Both Parler and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gab-online" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gab-online">Gab <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> have billed themselves as havens for free speech, with what&#8217;s perhaps the most lax content moderation online. In the past the two companies have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/07/russian-trolls-graphika-parler-gab/">left up content posted by an alleged Russian disinformation campaign,</a> and allow users to traffic in conspiracy theories that other social media platforms have shut down.</p>
<p>The expectation with these services is that users on the platforms are in charge of muting and blocking trolls or offensive content, but, by their nature, those who join these platforms will generally find themselves among like-minded users.</p>
<p>Their user counts might be surging, but would-be adopters may soon have a hard time finding the services.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">On Friday night, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google </a>said that it would be removing <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/parler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="parler">Parler</a> from their Play Store immediately &#8212; suspending the app until the developers committed to a moderation and enforcement policy that could handle objectionable content on the platform.</p>
<p>In a statement to TechCrunch, a Google spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In order to protect user safety on Google Play, our longstanding policies require that apps displaying user-generated content have moderation policies and enforcement that removes egregious content like posts that incite violence. All developers agree to these terms and we have reminded Parler of this clear policy in recent months. We’re aware of continued posting in the Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the US. We recognize that there can be reasonable debate about content policies and that it can be difficult for apps to immediately remove all violative content, but for us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content. In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app’s listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues.“</p></blockquote>
<p>On Friday, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/apple-threatens-ban-parler">Buzzfeed News</a> reported that Parler had received a letter from Apple informing them that the app would be removed from the App Store within 24 hours unless the company submitted an update with a moderation improvement plan. Parler CEO John Matze confirmed the action from Apple in a post on his Parler account where he posted a screenshot of the notification from Apple.</p>
<p>“We want to be clear that Parler is in fact responsible for all the user generated content present on your service and for ensuring that this content meets App Store requirements for the safety and protection of our users,” text from the screenshot reads. “We won’t distribute apps that present dangerous and harmful content.</p>
<p>Parler is backed by the conservative billionaire heiress Rebekah Mercer, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/parler-backed-by-mercer-family-makes-play-for-conservatives-mad-at-facebook-twitter-11605382430">according to a November report in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>. Founded in 2018, the service has experienced spikes in user adoption with every clash between more social media companies and the outgoing President Trump. In November, Parler boasted some 10 million users, according to the Journal.</p>
<p>Users like Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo and the conservative talk show host Dan Bongino, a wildly popular figure on Facebook who is also an investor in Parler, have joined the platform. In the Journal article Bongino called the company “a collective middle finger to the tech tyrants.”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Parler and Gab aren&#8217;t the only companies to see users numbers soar after the Trump bans. MeWe Network, OANN, Newsmax and Rumble have also seen adoption soar, according to data from the analytics company Apptopia.</p>
<p>The company noted that Parler was the #1 app on the iOS app store for two days surging from 18th on Thursday and 592 on Wednesday. Overall, the app was the 10th most downloaded social media app in 2020 with 8.1 million new installs.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an event driven app though,&#8221; a company analyst noted. &#8220;After events like the election, BLM protests, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> first applying labels to Trump’s Tweets, we see bursts of downloads and usage but it will then drop off.&#8221;</p>

<p>The app industry is as hot as ever, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 204 billion downloads and $120 billion in global consumer spend in 2019.

<p>Not including third-party Chinese app stores, iOS and Android users <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/app-stores-to-see-130-billion-downloads-in-2020-and-record-consumer-spend-of-112-billion/">downloaded</a> 130 billion apps in 2020.

<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business.

<h3>Social apps boot Trump following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/capitol-riot/">Capitol riot</a></h3>
<p>To varying degrees, social apps had to quickly figure out where to draw the line on allowing Trump to continue to use their platforms this week, after his false claims about a rigged election led Trump supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, destroying property, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/07/cybersecurity-202-riot-capitol-is-nightmare-scenario-cybersecurity-professionals/">stealing</a> at least one computer, potentially gaining access <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/decrypted-how-bad-was-the-us-capitol-breach-for-cybersecurity/">to other unlocked computers</a> and causing chaos that led to five deaths, including a Capitol Police officer who has now <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/us/brian-sicknick-police-capitol-dies.html">died of injuries</a> sustained on duty.</p>

<p>Social platforms, however, have been complicit in allowing these dangerous and radicalized groups to emerge in the first place. Facebook, for example, allowed StoptheSteal and Secession groups <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/trump-rioters-planned-online">to organize</a> using its platform. It also waited years to sweep the platform of QAnon groups, and then didn&#8217;t even finish the job &#8212; these disinformation networks remain live on the platform today. But even smaller gestures aimed at cleaning up the mess of a platform that prioritized ad dollars over safety led some Trump supporters to flee to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/us/politics/protesters-storm-capitol-hill-building.html">other social media networks</a> used by the far-right, such as Gab and Parler. There, they could post even more violent rhetoric without repercussions.</p>

<p>Following the riot, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">announced</a> Trump would be banned from both Facebook and Instagram for two weeks. Twitter initially locked Trump&#8217;s account on Wednesday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitter-will-reinstate-trumps-account-following-his-deletion-of-tweets/">then allowed him to return</a> after deleting a few tweets, noting that another violation would result in permanent suspension. On Friday, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/">permanently banned</a> Trump, and his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/twitter-qanon-sidney-powell-michael-flynn-ron-watkins/">other close associates.</a></p>
<p>Both also removed Trump&#8217;s video where he showed support for rioters, telling them to go home but also &#8220;we love you, you&#8217;re very special.&#8221;</p>
<p>TikTok, though obviously not used by Trump, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/tiktok-bans-videos-of-trump-inciting-mob-blocks-stormthecapital-and-other-hashtags/">took down re-shares of Trump&#8217;s video</a>, but allowed counter speech against it and some posts by news organizations. And it proactively blocked the hashtags used by rioters. Snapchat <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/snapchat-locks-president-donald-trumps-account/">locked</a> Trump&#8217;s account as well, and Twitch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitch-disables-trumps-channel-over-incendiary-rhetoric/">disabled</a> him until the end of his term.</p>

<p>New social apps and startups with social features will often mimic the general approaches of the large platforms as they craft their own content policies. But human rights organizations argue that what’s being done is not enough.</p>
<p>Said activist group <a href="https://colorofchange.org/press_release/color-of-change-facebook-must-permanently-ban-trump-and-take-action-against-his-enablers/">Color of Change</a> this week, &#8220;Mark Zuckerberg does not deserve applause for taking action at the 11th hour, after years of damage has already been done. Facebook is unquestionably complicit in the violent insurrection on Capitol Hill yesterday, and in the erosion of our democracy that’s continued to unfold in plain sight.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>The group is urging for Trump&#8217;s permanent ban from Facebook and for the network to &#8220;take action against his enablers and allies who continue to use the platform to incite violence and spread dangerous misinformation.&#8221;</p>
<h3>App Stores take action on Parler</h3>
<p>On Friday, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/apple-threatens-ban-parler">Buzzfeed News</a> reported Parler had received a letter from Apple that said they had 24 hours to come up with a moderation plan for the app, otherwise it would be banned from the App Store. Google Play, however, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/">more quickly banned the app on Friday</a> until the company could commit to a moderation and enforcement policy to handle objectionable content on its network.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s statement reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>“In order to protect user safety on Google Play, our longstanding policies require that apps displaying user-generated content have moderation policies and enforcement that removes egregious content like posts that incite violence. All developers agree to these terms and we have reminded Parler of this clear policy in recent months. We’re aware of continued posting in the Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the US. We recognize that there can be reasonable debate about content policies and that it can be difficult for apps to immediately remove all violative content, but for us to distribute an app through Google Play, we do require that apps implement robust moderation for egregious content. In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app’s listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues.“</p></blockquote>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Parler removed from Google Play store as Apple App Store suspension reportedly looms&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/embed/#?secret=OkQzcPbGWL" data-secret="OkQzcPbGWL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Parler had been one of the places where Trump supporters and other extremists to organized their plans to storm the Capitol this week as well as plan future attacks. Posts on Parler, which has a looser moderation policy compared with Twitter, often call for people&#8217;s deaths and even for Civil War.</p>
<p>Several high-profile conservatives, including members of Trump&#8217;s family, had been participating on Parler, following the increased enforcement of various polices against election misinformation and false claims about COVID-19, among other things, on mainstream social platforms.</p>
<p>It is not unusual for Apple and Google to take action against apps with harmful content, though one has to wonder why it took a deadly insurrection aimed at toppling U.S. democratic processes for them to care.</p>
<h3>U.S. bans transactions with Chinese payments apps</h3>
<p>Ahead of the violence at the Capitol this week, the Trump administration continued its crackdown on Chinese mobile applications. Via an executive order signed on Tuesday, the U.S. banned transactions with eight Chinese mobile apps, including Ant Group’s Alipay mobile payment app, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-tech-exclusive-idUSKBN29A2PA">Reuters first reported</a>.</p>
<p>Others named in the order include CamScanner, SHAREit, Tencent QQ, VMate (published by Alibaba Group subsidiary UCWeb) and Beijing Kingsoft Office Software’s WPS Office.</p>
<p>The move is meant to cut off China&#8217;s access to U.S. user data, including, per the order, the ability for China to &#8220;track the locations of federal employees and contractors&#8221; and &#8220;build dossiers of personal information.&#8221;</p>
<p>The administration had previously banned TikTok and WeChat, but U.S. courts blocked the orders from going into effect.</p>
<h3>FTC settles with Tapjoy over deceptive practices, but lays blame at feet of app store gatekeepers</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2093531" style="width: 598px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2093531" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2093531 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Tapjoy-Offerwall-Image.png?w=588" alt="" width="588" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Tapjoy-Offerwall-Image.png 972w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Tapjoy-Offerwall-Image.png?resize=130,150 130w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Tapjoy-Offerwall-Image.png?resize=259,300 259w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Tapjoy-Offerwall-Image.png?resize=768,889 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Tapjoy-Offerwall-Image.png?resize=588,680 588w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Tapjoy-Offerwall-Image.png?resize=43,50 43w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2093531" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credits: Tapjoy</p></div></p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Mobile advertising company Tapjoy <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/01/ftc-requires-mobile-advertising-company-stop-misleading-users">settled with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over allegations</a> that it was misleading consumers about the in-app rewards they could earn in mobile games. The FTC said Tapjoy deceived consumers who participated in various activities — like purchasing a product, signing up for a free trial, providing their personal information like an email address or completing a survey — in exchange for in-game virtual currency. But when it was time to pay up, Tapjoy’s partners didn’t deliver.</p>
<p>The order will now require Tapjoy to follow up on complaints and monitor to ensure that offers are delivered, or face further fines of up to $43,280 per each violation.</p>
<p>Tapjoy serves as a middleman between developers, consumers and advertisers, and is one of many &#8220;offerwall&#8221;-based mobile ad networks available today.</p>
<p>Mobile game developers integrate Tapjoy&#8217;s technology to display ads — aka “offers” — to their customers, in order to earn payments for their users’ activity. When the consumer completes the offer by taking whatever action was required, they’re supposed to earn in-game coins or other virtual currency. The app developers then earn a percentage of that ad revenue. But the FTC said that would often not happen, and Tapjoy ignored hundreds of thousands of consumer complaints.</p>
<p>Though Tapjoy was the business being held accountable in the FTC&#8217;s ruling, the Commissioners harshly scolded the &#8220;rent-seeking&#8221; app store business model for allowing networks like Tapjoy to rise in the first place. Using language that strongly hinted that regulation of the app stores was on the way, the Commissioners scolded the app stores&#8217; &#8220;vast power to impose taxes and regulations on the mobile gaming industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>“This market structure also has cascading effects on gamers and consumers,&#8221; the ruling stated. &#8220;Under heavy taxation by Apple and Google, developers have been forced to adopt alternative monetization models that rely on surveillance, manipulation, and other harmful practices,” it said.</p>
<p>Apple is being given a lot of credit in recent weeks for its privacy push, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/apple-launches-its-new-app-privacy-labels-across-all-its-app-stores/">the launch of its so-called app store “nutrition labels”</a> that help to better highlight the bad actors in the mobile app market. But some of the recent reporting neglects to explain why these alternative business models rose in the first place or detail how Apple will financially benefit from the shift to subscriptions that will result from the mobile ad clampdown. It’s also rarely noted that Apple itself serves behavioral advertising within its own apps that is based on the user data it collects from across its catalog of first-party apps and services. That’s not to say that Apple isn’t doing a service with its privacy push, but it’s a complex matter. This isn’t sports; you don’t have to pick one side or the other.</p>
<p>The FTC then not-too-subtly warned Apple and Google that it &#8220;will need to use all of its tools — competition, consumer protection, and data protection — to combat middlemen mischief, including by the largest gaming gatekeepers.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After years of placid admonishments, the tech world came out in force against President Trump this past week following the violent assault of the U.S. Capitol building in Washington D.C. on Wednesday. From <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to PayPal, more than a dozen companies have placed unprecedented restrictions or outright banned the current occupant of the White House from using their services, and in some cases, some of his associates and supporters as well.</p>
<p>The news was voluminous and continuous for the past few days, so here’s a recap of who took action when, and what might happen next.</p>
<h2 id="Twitter: a permanent ban and a real-time attempt to shut down all possible account alternatives">Twitter: a permanent ban and a real-time attempt to shut down all possible account alternatives</h2>
<p>Twitter has played a paramount role over the debate about how to moderate President Trump’s communications, given the president’s penchant for the platform and the nearly 90 million followers on his @realDonaldTrump account. In the past, Twitter has repeatedly warned the president, added labels related to election integrity and misinformation, and outright blocked the occasional tweet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week, however, Twitter’s patience seemed to have been exhausted. Shortly after the riots at the Capitol on Wednesday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-pop-up-trump-video-capitol-rally/">Twitter put in place a large banner warning its users</a> about the president’s related tweet on the matter, blocking retweets of that specific message. A few hours later, the company instituted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-locks-trump-out-of-his-account-for-at-least-12-hours/">a 12-hour ban on the president’s personal account</a>.</p>
<p>At first, it looked like the situation would return to normal, with Twitter offering Thursday morning that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitter-will-reinstate-trumps-account-following-his-deletion-of-tweets/">it would reinstate the president’s account after he removed tweets</a> the company considered against its policies around inciting violence. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/is-trump-back-on-twitter/">The president posted a tweet later on Thursday</a> with a video attachment that seemed to be relatively calmer than his recent fiery rhetoric, a video in which he also accepted the country’s election results for the first time.</p>
<p>Enormous pressure externally on its own platform as well as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/08/twitter-trump-dorsey/">internal demands from employees</a> kept the policy rapidly changing though. Late Friday night, the company announced that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/">decided to permanently ban the president from its platform</a>, shutting down @realDonaldTrump. The company then played a game of whack-a-mole as it blocked the president’s access to affiliated Twitter handles like @TeamTrump (his official campaign account) as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/president-trump-responds-to-twitter-account-ban-in-tweet-storm-from-potus-account/">the official presidential account @POTUS</a> and deleted individual tweets from the president. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/why-twitter-banned-president-trump/">The company’s policies state</a> that a blocked user may not attempt to use a different account to evade its ban.</p>
<p>Twitter has also taken other actions against some of the president’s affiliates and broader audience, blocking <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/twitter-qanon-sidney-powell-michael-flynn-ron-watkins/">Michael Flynn, a bunch of other Trump supporters, and a variety of QAnon figures</a>.</p>
<p>With a new president on the horizon, the official @POTUS account will be handed to the new Biden administration, although <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/twitters-potus-account-will-reportedly-be-reset-to-zero-followers-when-biden-takes-over/">Twitter has reportedly been intending to reset the account’s followers to zero</a>, unlike its transition of the account in 2016 from Obama to Trump.</p>
<p>As for Trump himself, a permanent ban from his most prominent platform begs the question: where will he take his braggadocio and invective next? So far, we haven’t seen the president move his activities to any social network alternatives, but after the past few years (and on Twitter, the last decade), it seems hard to believe the president will merely return to his golf course and quietly ride out to the horizon.</p>

<h2 id="Snap: a quick lock after dampening the president’s audience for months">Snap: a quick lock after dampening the president’s audience for months</h2>
<p>Snap <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/snapchat-locks-president-donald-trumps-account/">locked the president’s account</a> late Wednesday following the events on Capitol Hill, and seemed to be one of the most poised tech companies to rapidly react to the events taking place in DC. Snap’s lock prevents the president from posting new snaps to his followers on the platform, which currently number approximately two million. As far as TechCrunch knows, that lock remains in place, although the president’s official profile is still available to users.</p>
<p>Following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and the concomitant Black Lives Matter protests, <a href="https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/we-stand-together">the company had announced back in June</a> that it would remove the president’s account from its curated “Discover” tab, limiting its distribution and discoverability.</p>
<p>The president has never really effectively used the Snap platform, and with an indefinite ban in place, it looks unlikely he will find a home there in the future.</p>

<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> like Twitter, is one of the president’s most popular destinations for his supporters, and the platform is also a locus for <a href="https://twitter.com/facebookstop10?lang=en">many of the political right’s most popular personalities</a>. It’s moderation actions have been heavily scrutinized by the press over the past few years, but the company has mostly avoided taking direct action against the president — until this week.</p>
<p>On Wednesday as rioters walked out of the halls of Congress, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/facebook-and-youtube-remove-trump-video-calling-extremists-special/">Facebook pulled down a video from President Trump</a> that it considered was promoting violence. Later Wednesday evening, that policy eventually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/facebook-stormthecapitol-hashtag-dangerous-organizations-policy/">extended into a 24-hour ban of the president’s account</a>, which currently has 33 million likes, or followers. The company argued that the president had violated its policies multiple times, automatically triggering the one-day suspension. At the same time, Facebook (and Instagram) took action to block a popular trending hashtag related to the Capitol riots.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">On Thursday morning</a>, Mark Zuckerberg, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10112681480907401">in a personal post on his own platform</a>, announced an “indefinite” suspension for the president, with a minimum duration of two weeks. That timing would neatly extend the suspension through the inauguration of president-elect Biden, who is to assume the presidency at noon on January 20th.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EPQ4O7OqsP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">Mark Zuckerberg announces Trump banned from Facebook and Instagram for &#8216;at least the next two weeks&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mark Zuckerberg announces Trump banned from Facebook and Instagram for &#8216;at least the next two weeks&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/embed/#?secret=EPQ4O7OqsP" data-secret="EPQ4O7OqsP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>What will happen after the inauguration? Right now, we don’t know. The president’s account is suspended but not deactivated, which means that the president cannot post new material to his page, but that the page remains visible to Facebook users. The company could remove the suspension once the transition of power is complete, or it may continue the ban longer-term. Given the president’s prominence on the platform and the heavy popularity of the social network among his supporters, Facebook is in a much more intense bind between banning content it deems offensive, and retaining users important to its bottom line.</p>
<h2 id="Shopify / Paypal: Ecommerce platforms won’t sell Trump official merchandise for the time being">Shopify / PayPal: Ecommerce platforms won’t sell Trump official merchandise for the time being</h2>
<p>It’s not just social networks that are blocking the president’s audience — ecommerce giants are also getting into moderating their platforms against the president. On Thursday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/shopify-pulls-donald-trump-stores-off-its-website/">Shopify announced that it was removing the storefronts</a> for both the Trump campaign and Trump’s personal brand.</p>
<p>That’s an evolution on policy for the company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/09/shopify-ceo-attempts-to-defend-continued-hosting-of-breitbarts-online-store/">which years ago said that it would not moderate its platform</a>, but in recent years has removed some controversial stores, such as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-05/shopify-bans-some-right-wing-groups-after-activist-pressure?sref=AwwRcx4b">some right-wing shops in 2018</a>.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/paypal" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="paypal">PayPal <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> meanwhile has been <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/paypal-and-shopify-remove-trump-related-accounts-citing-policies-against-supporting-violence/">deactivating the accounts of some groups of Trump supporters</a> this week, who were using the money-transfer fintech to coordinate payments to underwrite the rioters’ actions on Capitol Hill. PayPal has been increasingly banning some political accounts, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk02E1krqY2KYsmYSubWsxGDVyQtK2w%3A1610206356011&amp;ei=lMz5X5gQy_LmAu_Vg7AE&amp;q=paypal+ban+right+wing&amp;oq=paypal+ban+right+wing&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIFCCEQqwIyBQghEKsCMgUIIRCrAjoECAAQRzoECCMQJzoFCAAQyQM6AggAOgQIABAKOgYIABAWEB46CAgAEBYQChAeOgUIIRCgAToICCEQFhAdEB46BwghEAoQoAFQsRZYgSFg_SFoAHACeACAAViIAfYFkgECMTGYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6yAEIwAEB&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYqvWOlo_uAhVLuVkKHe_qAEYQ4dUDCAw&amp;uact=5">banning a far-right activist in 2019</a> and also <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paypal-suspends-dozens-of-racist-groups-sites-altright-com/">banning a spate of far-right organizations</a> in the wake of violent protests in Charlottesville in 2017. These bans have so far not extended directly to the president himself from what TechCrunch can glean.</p>
<p>Given the president’s well-known personal brand and penchant for product tie-ins before becoming president, it’s a major open question about how these two platforms and others in ecommerce will respond to Trump once he leaves office in two weeks. Will the president go back to shilling steaks, water and cologne? And will he need an ecommerce venue to sell his wares online? Much will depend on Trump’s next goals and whether he stays focused on politics, or heads back to his more commercial pursuits.</p>

<p>For supporters of Trump and others concerned about the moderation actions of Facebook and other platforms, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/parler" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="parler">Parler <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has taken the lead as an alternative social network for this audience. Right now, the app is number one in the App Store in the United States, ahead of encrypted and secure messaging app Signal, which is at number four and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/elon-musk-dunks-on-facebook-and-recommends-signal-in-wake-of-u-s-capitol-insurrection-attempt/">got a massive endorsement from Elon Musk this week</a>.</p>
<p>Parler’s opportunism for growth around the riots on Capitol Hill though has run into a very real barrier: the two tech companies which run the two stores for mobile applications in the United States.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announced Friday evening that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/">it would be removing the Parler app from its store</a>, citing the social network’s lack of moderation and content filtering capabilities. The app’s page remains down as this article was going to press. That ban means that new users won’t be able to install the app from the Play Store, however, existing users who already have Parler installed will be able to continue using it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Buzzfeed reports that <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/apple-threatens-ban-parler">Apple has reportedly sent a 24-hour takedown notice to Parler’s developers</a>, saying that it would mirror Google’s actions if the app didn’t immediately filter content that endangers safety. As of now, Parler remains available in the App Store, but if the timing is to be believed, the app could be taken down later this Saturday.</p>
<p>Given the complexities of content moderation, including the need to hire content moderators en masse, it seems highly unlikely that Parler could respond to these requests in any short period of time. What happens to the app and the president’s supporters long-term next is, right now, anyone’s guess.</p>

<p>Finally, let’s head over to the rest of the social networking world, where Trump is just as unpopular as he is at Facebook and Twitter HQ these days. Companies widely blocked the president from accessing their sites, and they also took action against affiliated groups.</p>
<p>Google-owned YouTube announced Thursday that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/youtube-election-strikes/">it would start handing out “strikes” against channels — including President Trump’s — that post election misinformation</a>. In the past, videos with election misinformation would have a warning label attached, but the channel itself didn’t face any consequences. In December, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/youtube-declares-war-on-us-election-misinformation-a-month-late/">the company changed that policy to include the outright removal of videos</a> purveying election misinformation.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitch disables Trump&#8217;s channel until the end of his term to &#8216;minimize harm&#8217; during transition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitch-disables-trumps-channel-over-incendiary-rhetoric/embed/#?secret=vcf7r6RYnL" data-secret="vcf7r6RYnL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This week’s latest policy change is an escalation from the company’s previous approach, and would result in lengthier and lengthier temporary suspensions for each additional strike that a channel receives. Those strikes could eventual result in a permanent ban for a YouTube channel if they happen within a set period of time. That’s precisely what happened with Steve Bannon’s channel, which was <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/youtube-bans-steve-bannons-war-room-podcast-channel/">permanently banned Friday late afternoon for repeated violations of YouTube’s policies</a>. Meanwhile, President Trump’s official channel has less than 3 million followers, and is currently still available for viewing on the platform.</p>
<p>Outside YouTube, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitch" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitch">Twitch <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> followed a similar policy to Facebook, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitch-disables-trumps-channel-over-incendiary-rhetoric/">announcing Thursday morning that it would ban the president “indefinitely”</a> and at least through the inauguration on January 20th. The president has a limited audience of just about 151,000 followers on the popular streaming platform, making it among the least important of the president’s social media accounts.</p>

<p>In terms of the president’s supporters, their groups are also being removed from popular tech platforms. On Friday, Reddit announced that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/reddit-donaldtrump-ban-capitol/">it would ban the subreddit r/DonaldTrump</a>, which had become one of a number of unofficial communities on the platform where the president’s most ardent supporters hung out. The social network had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/trump-suspended-from-twitch-as-reddit-bans-the-the_donald-and-additional-subreddits/">previously removed the controversial subreddit r/The_Donald back in June</a>. Discord on Friday <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221579/discord-bans-the-donald-server-reddit-subreddit?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">shut down a server related to that banned subreddit</a>, citing the server’s “overt connection to an online forum used to incite violence.”</p>
<p>Lastly, TikTok announced on Thursday that it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/tiktok-bans-videos-of-trump-inciting-mob-blocks-stormthecapital-and-other-hashtags/">limiting the spread of some information related to the Capitol riots</a>, including redirecting hashtags and removing violent content as well as the president’s own video message to supporters. The president does not have a TikTok account, and therefore, most of the company’s actions are focused on his supporters and broader content surrounding the situation on Capitol Hill this week.</p>

<p>Now that Trump&#8217;s gone for good, we have a pretty interesting glimpse into the policy decision making that led Twitter to bring the hammer down on Friday. The company first announced Trump&#8217;s ban in a <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1347684877634838528">series of tweets from its @TwitterSafety account</a> but also <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html">linked to a blog post detailing its thinking</a>.</p>
<p>In that deep dive, the company explains that it gave Trump one last chance <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-locks-trump-out-of-his-account-for-at-least-12-hours/">after suspending</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/is-trump-back-on-twitter/">and then reinstating</a> his account for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-pop-up-trump-video-capitol-rally/">violations made on Wednesday</a>. But the following day, a pair of tweets the president made pushed him over the line. Twitter said those tweets, pictured below, were not examined on a standalone basis, but rather in the context of his recent behavior and this week&#8217;s events.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; We have determined that these Tweets are in violation of the Glorification of Violence Policy and the user @realDonaldTrump should be immediately permanently suspended from the service,&#8221; Twitter wrote.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2094169" style="width: 647px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2094169" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2094169 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-08-at-5.39.28-PM.png?w=637" alt="" width="637" height="318" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-08-at-5.39.28-PM.png 637w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-08-at-5.39.28-PM.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-08-at-5.39.28-PM.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-08-at-5.39.28-PM.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 637px) 100vw, 637px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2094169" class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot via Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>This is how the company <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension.html">explained its reasoning, point by point</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;President Trump’s statement that he will not be attending the Inauguration is being received by a number of his supporters as further confirmation that the election was not legitimate and is seen as him disavowing his previous claim made via two Tweets (1, 2) by his Deputy Chief of Staff, Dan Scavino, that there would be an &#8216;orderly transition&#8217; on January 20th.</li>
<li>&#8220;The second Tweet may also serve as encouragement to those potentially considering violent acts that the Inauguration would be a &#8216;safe&#8217; target, as he will not be attending.</li>
<li>&#8220;The use of the words &#8216;American Patriots&#8217; to describe some of his supporters is also being interpreted as support for those committing violent acts at the US Capitol.</li>
<li>&#8220;The mention of his supporters having a &#8216;GIANT VOICE long into the future&#8217; and that &#8216;They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!&#8217; is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an &#8216;orderly transition&#8217; and instead that he plans to continue to support, empower, and shield those who believe he won the election.</li>
<li>&#8220;Plans for future armed protests have already begun proliferating on and off-Twitter, including a proposed secondary attack on the US Capitol and state capitol buildings on January 17, 2021.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>All of that is pretty intuitive, though his most fervent supporters aren&#8217;t likely to agree. Ultimately these decisions, as much as they do come down to stated policies, involve a lot of subjective analysis and interpretation. Try as social media companies might to let algorithms make the hard calls for them, the buck stops with a group of humans trying to figure out the best course of action.</p>
<p>Twitter&#8217;s explanation here offers a a rare totally transparent glimpse into how social networks decide what stays and what goes. It&#8217;s a big move for Twitter — one that many people reasonably believe should have been made months if not years ago — and it&#8217;s useful to have what is so often an inscrutable high-level decision making process laid out plainly and publicly for all to see.</p>
