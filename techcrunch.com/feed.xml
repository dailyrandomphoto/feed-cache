										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As many of the top cryptocurrencies seem to temporarily stabilize near all-time-highs, users looking to speculate on tokens that are a bit more volatile are searching across exchanges to find deals.</p>
<p>Amsterdam-based startup <a href="https://tab-trader.com/">TabTrader</a> has been capitalizing on this search with a platform that aggregates prices and token availability across dozens of exchanges. While other platforms allow users to look at token prices across exchanges, most are desktop-optimized while TabTrader has built up a substantial presence for its mobile app on iOS and Android.</p>
<p>As different exchanges take different approaches towards onboarding new tokens, crypto traders are increasingly signing up for accounts on multiple exchanges and tracking prices across multiple apps with multiple notification types set for each. Many users rely on TabTrader for its cross-exchange price alert feature, notifying users when a particular token has gone above or below a certain value. While plenty of exchanges offer this functionality inside their native apps, the reliability and customizability of these push notifications has often been inconsistent.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239428" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>CEO Kirill Suslov tells TechCrunch that the TabTrader app has more than 400,000 active users with particularly strong presences in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>The startup has adopted a Kayak-like model, aggregating prices for tokens and picking up rebate fees from exchanges when users make a purchase through the app. While users plug their wallet info into the app to easily make purchases through connected exchanges, Suslov says that TabTrader never has access to user funds.</p>
<p>Alongside these rebates, TabTrader also makes money through a $12 monthly subscription for a paid version as well as advertising. Suslov says his 20-person team has scaled to reach their current audience without any paid marketing.</p>
<p>While tens of millions of users have created accounts on centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, Suslov says that TabTrader&#8217;s biggest opportunity may be embracing so-called decentralized exchanges like Uniswap which allow users to rapidly exchange tokens with other users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Suslov says that while the exchanges have built out great technology in the back-end, the front-end interfaces aren&#8217;t as easy for users to navigate, leaving room for an aggregator like TabTrader to streamline the user experience while allowing users to explore decentralized exchanges for the first time. The startup says they&#8217;re starting with a number of Solana-based exchanges including Serum, Raydium and Orca.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Decentralized exchanges] are the hottest topic of 2021,&#8221; Suslov says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> &#8220;</span>We raised to get onto this rocket ship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suslov tells TechCrunch that hTabTrader has banked $5.8 million in Series A funding from 100X Ventures, Hashkey Capital, Spartan Capital, SGH Capital, SOSV and Artesian Venture Partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cannabis is quickly going to the nerds. As it gradually becomes legal around the world, startups have responded with innovative products from laser-powered water bongs to CNC machined vapes to AI-powered herb grinders. Got a friend who wants to get a bit fancy with it? Give&#8217;m the gift of high-tech consumption.</p>
<p>Please consume responsibility.</p>
<p>Throughout 2021, cannabis companies made major strides on the back of unprecedented consumer demand. Companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/in-new-round-dutchie-focused-on-smoother-cannabis-retail-sees-its-valuation-soar-by-eight-times/">Dutchie</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/cannabis-e-commerce-startup-jane-technologies-raises-100m-after-stellar-growth/">Jane Technologies</a> raised hundreds of millions in new venture financing, leading to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/cannabis-investment-jumps-82-the-second-half-of-2021-165-over-2020-levels/">industry investments climbing 82%</a> in the second half of 2021. Others companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/cannabis-giant-leafly-is-going-public-through-a-spac-merger/">Leafly</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/agrify-aims-to-be-the-fastest-growing-cannabis-company/">Agrify</a> turned to public markets to raise new capital. Amazon<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/amazon-to-stop-screening-employees-for-marijuana/"> stopped screening</a> employees for marijuana, and Apple started treating cannabis as it does with pharmaceuticals and started letting users order and pay for cannabis in apps (in places where that&#8217;s legal).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237982" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>There&#8217;s high hopes for cannabis in 2022. Cannabis is now legal for use in 36 states, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/cannabis-banking-act-passes-u-s-house-with-bipartisan-support/">there&#8217;s traction in Washington</a> that could end its federal prohibition.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.puffco.com/products/budsy?variant=39699376799803" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Puffco Budsy</a> is a fantastic discrete water bong, and it&#8217;s nearly invisible thanks to the Nalgene-style bottle. Just throw some water in the bottle, pack flower in the hidden bowl and hit the trails. When you&#8217;re ready, flip up the lid, hit the bud with a lighter and inhale from the spout (which is thankfully not connected to the water). Rinse and repeat. Puffco released the Budsy on April 1, 2021 but it wasn&#8217;t a joke. This product is real, and it&#8217;s a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Roger Volodarsky founded the company in 2013 and has since led the company as CEO. Over the last several years, the company has kept pushing forward into innovative dabbing products. The Puffco Peak Pro (below) even features interchangeable ovens to allow owners to tailor their smoking experience without buying a new rig.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>$50 and up</p>
<h2>Dynavap</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2238005" style="width: 777px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238005" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2238005 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/RS5001_32A1631-3__FillWzc2Nyw1MDBd.jpeg" alt="" width="767" height="500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/RS5001_32A1631-3__FillWzc2Nyw1MDBd.jpeg 767w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/RS5001_32A1631-3__FillWzc2Nyw1MDBd.jpeg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/RS5001_32A1631-3__FillWzc2Nyw1MDBd.jpeg?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/RS5001_32A1631-3__FillWzc2Nyw1MDBd.jpeg?resize=680,443 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/RS5001_32A1631-3__FillWzc2Nyw1MDBd.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 100vw, 767px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2238005" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dynavap</p></div></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dynavap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynavaps</a> are my go-to smoking device. They&#8217;re pocketable, batteryless and produce a great cloud of vapor. Think of it as a one-hitter vape with a thermometer. First, heat the tip with a torch or induction heater. In about 3-5 seconds, the cap will click, notifying the user that the herb is at the right temperature and ready to hit. The cannabis lasts about 3-4 cycles. Best yet, since the cap protects the ground flower from the flame, there&#8217;s no combustion or smoke &#8212; just vapor &#8212; and there&#8217;s very little smell.</p>
<p>Dynavap vaporizers are CNC machined in the company&#8217;s De Forest, Wisconsin facility. George Breiwa started the company in 2015 and currently employs around 40 people. Dynvap sells several versions of the little metal vape, including this <a href="https://www.dynavap.com/dynashop/ocs/the-gentleman-pipe-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stately &#8220;gentleman&#8217;s pipe&#8221;</a> and the sleek, all-black Obsidium Omni for $250.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>$60 and up</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.gpen.com/products/g-pen-dash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GPen Dash</a> is the GoPro of vapes. This tiny vaporizer is impressive: It costs $70 and hits above its weight. The little vape has a glass-coated stainless steel heating chamber and a clean air path. The hits are smooth and plentiful. The GPen Dash is a great grab-and-go vape. Pictured here is one of the special versions; the company teamed with the nonprofit breast cancer prevention foundation Keep A Breast and made this limited edition.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Chris Folkerts started Grenco Science with Anthony Barron in 2011. The company sells a wide range of vaporizers, including a portable dab rig and a battery-powered concentrate vaporizer for glass stems. In May 2020 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/grenco-science-acquires-stundenglass-a-contactless-water-pipe-company-founded-by-ex-apple-employee/">Grenco Science acquired Stündenglass</a>, a company founded by an ex-Apple employee that makes high-end gravity bongs.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no tech here. The <a href="https://blazysusan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blazy Susan</a> isn&#8217;t, technically, a high-tech gift. I don&#8217;t care. This is my list. The Blazy Susan is just a lovely weed station with little compartments to hold different toking accoutrements. There&#8217;s a dab station, a bowl cleaner and silicon inserts to make cleaning a bit easier. Prices start at around $90 and are available in different types of wood.</p>
<p>The company was started by Will Breakell and is based out of Colorado. The company also sells rolling papers, cones, grinders and a bunch of merch &#8212; everything is pink and I love it.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>$90</p>
<h2>Banana Bros’ OTTO AI-enabled Grinder</h2>

<p><em>Surprise Guest! TC&#8217;s Amanda Silberling dropped by the gift guide to add this:</em></p>
<p>If you’re still using that cheap grinder you bought on Amazon, you’re probably wondering why anyone needs an AI-powered grinder. Here&#8217;s why: The <a href="https://bananabros.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OTTO</a> considers the density, moisture level, texture and consistency of your flower, then adjusts the speed, pressure and even the grind direction. Then, the OTTO deposits the perfect ground flower into a magnetically attached chamber and evenly distributes it into a pre-rolled cone. The result is luxurious &#8212; so long as you’re not an elitist who thinks cones are a cop-out (but if you are, you can just use the grinder on its own).</p>
<p>Banana Bros says the OTTO can grind perfect herbs, spices and incense, but even though the grinder is easy to clean, you’d probably end up with slightly sedative cinnamon or strangely flavorful cones if you’re not careful. At $150, this thing isn’t cheap, but it gets the job done. Banana Bros was founded in 2017 by CEO Dave Richmond and Director of Innovation Manny Montano, whose background is in industrial and 3D design. They’ve patented the AI technology that powers the OTTO, which is the company’s first and flagship product.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.storz-bickel.com/en-us/mighty-plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mighty+</a> is the best vaporizer available. It&#8217;s reliable, can cook a lot of herb and produces some of the best vapor from any device. Sure, there are drawbacks, including its large size and $399 price, but it&#8217;s worth it. Storz &amp; Bickel released the original in 2014 and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/storz-bickle-new-mighty-vape-features-faster-heating-usb-c-and-ul-certification/"> just released the updated version in October 2021</a>. The new Mighty+ features quicker heat-up time, USB-C recharging and a ceramic filling chamber that&#8217;s much easier to keep clean than the chamber in the original.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Quick tip:</strong> The Mighty+ features orange arrow buttons while the original&#8217;s are gray.</p></blockquote>
<p>Markus Storz started working on a herbal vaporizer in 1996 and in 2002 Jürgen Bickel joined the board forming Storz-Bickel. The company still sells its original, groundbreaking device, the Volcano, and several less expensive products. The company is based in Germany, where its vaporizers carry medical device certifications. In 2018 Canadian cannabis giant Canopy Growth acquired Storz &amp; Bickel. Jürgen Bickel remains at the company and runs the day-to-day operations.</p>

<p>At its core, the <a href="https://hitoki.com/products/trident" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$499 Hitoki Trident V2</a> is a battery-powered water bong. The trick? It uses a laser and sealed chamber to heat the flower. When the device works, it hits like a truck. I tested the Hitoki, and it&#8217;s finicky and requires a lot of cleaning. The hose attachment is low quality, and the laser blasts the herb into a smoldering mess. So why is it on this list? Because despite its drawbacks, the Hitoki is a fun device and can produce an impressive cloud without butane. Plus lasers. You get to watch the laser light the pot and make a miniature mushroom cloud.</p>
<p>Joe and Jack Tran started Hitoki in 2019. The Trident V2 is the company&#8217;s second version of the product. The V2 version includes a carb button, a larger laser burn radius and an improved airflow path.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://stundenglass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stündenglass Kompact</a> is a compact version of the amazing Stündenglass gravity bong. The $599 device is made of high-end materials and works very well. Trust me. I&#8217;ve used it, and it&#8217;s smooth, rich and impressive. The device isn&#8217;t just for cannabis. It&#8217;s also a fantastic hookah, and with the right attachments, it can be used to infuse food and drinks with a burst of smokey flavor. Want a bigger hit? The full-size Stündenglass is the same price but is much less portable.</p>
<p>Stündenglass was founded by Tracey Huston and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/01/grenco-science-acquires-stundenglass-a-contactless-water-pipe-company-founded-by-ex-apple-employee/">purchased by Grenco Science in May 2020</a> for an undisclosed amount.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri will testify before the Senate for the first time as part of a series of hearings about online safety for children and teens. Per The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/24/technology/adam-mosseri-instagram-testify-congress.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Times</a>, Mosseri&#8217;s hearing will take place on December 6.</p>
<p>Mosseri&#8217;s upcoming testimony comes after Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) <a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2021.10.20%20-%20Facebook%20and%20Instagram%20-%20Consumer%20Protection%20Invitation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote a letter</a> to Facebook (now Meta) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, asking that either he or Mosseri participate in a Senate hearing.</p>
<p>Mosseri posted a video responding to the news of his forthcoming appearance on Capitol Hill. He discussed growing concerns about teen safety online, then outlined past actions Instagram has taken to protect young users, like making young teens&#8217; accounts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">private by default</a> and restricting the kinds of ads they see.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239403" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to be talking about these issues with Congress relatively soon,&#8221; Mosseri <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>. &#8220;These are important issues, but we all have shared goals. We all want young people to be safe when they&#8217;re online.&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>When reports leaked in September about Instagram&#8217;s knowledge of its <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=instagram+bad+teen+girls+wsj&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS954US954&amp;oq=instagram+bad+teen+girls+wsj&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.2245j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dangerous affects</a> on teen girls, the Senate <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Committee on Commerce, Science, &amp; Transportation</a> didn&#8217;t take it lightly. The committee <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/">first questioned</a> Facebook Global Head of Security Antigone Davis, who was reticent to answer direct questions from the Senate. Then weeks later, the committee heard testimony from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen</a>, a former civic integrity product manager who leaked thousands of internal documents known as the &#8220;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/25/1049015366/the-facebook-papers-what-you-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Papers</a>.&#8221; In her hearing, Haugen told the Senate that Facebook cares more about profits than user safety.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I am disappointed that Facebook has been unwilling to be fully transparent with me, other members of Congress, and the public, and appears to have concealed vital information from us about teen mental health and addiction,&#8221; <a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2021.10.20%20-%20Facebook%20and%20Instagram%20-%20Consumer%20Protection%20Invitation.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> Senator Blumenthal, who chairs the Senate committee hosting these hearings. &#8220;When I sought specific information about Instagram and teens in an August letter, Facebook provided clearly evasive and misleading answers that have now been directly disputed by Ms. Haugen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, after hearing from executives at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-snap-youtube-hearing-congress/">Snap, TikTok and YouTube</a> last month, the committee will convene again to hear from the head of Instagram himself. Given the committee&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/lawmakers-confront-tiktok-snapchat-and-youtube-about-eating-disorder-content/">demonstrated concern</a> about Instagram&#8217;s connection to the onset of adolescent eating disorders, it&#8217;s expected that Mosseri will be questioned about leaked internal studies that Meta conducted about Instagram&#8217;s impact on teen girls.</p>
<p>The internal study, obtained by The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal</a> and later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/seeking-to-respin-instagrams-toxicity-for-teens-facebook-publishes-annotated-slide-decks/">published by Meta</a> itself, found that Instagram makes body image issues worse for one in three teen girls, and that teens blame Instagram for increases in anxiety and depression. Among teens with suicidal thoughts, the study says that 6% of users traced their desire to die by suicide to Instagram. Plus, 32% of surveyed teen girls reported that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made those feelings worse.</p>
<p>Shortly after these documents were leaked, Mosseri announced that Instagram would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/instagram-puts-kids-version-on-ice-after-critical-backlash/">pause building</a> <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/pausing-instagram-kids" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram Kids</a>. Meta already has products like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/04/facebook-messenger-kids/">Messenger Kids</a>, which lets users under 13 chat with people approved by their parents.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="m9fpN1GWiX"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testifies before the Senate</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testifies before the Senate&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/embed/#?secret=m9fpN1GWiX" data-secret="m9fpN1GWiX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;While we stand by the need to develop this experience, we’ve decided to pause this project,&#8221; Mosseri <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/pausing-instagram-kids" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>. &#8220;This will give us time to work with parents, experts, policymakers and regulators, to listen to their concerns, and to demonstrate the value and importance of this project for younger teens online today.&#8221;</p>
<p>But critics are skeptical of Meta&#8217;s ability to build an Instagram Kids product responsibly. Per research published this month, Facebook allegedly continues to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/facebook-accused-of-still-targeting-teens-with-ads/">surveil teens</a> for ad targeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is urgent and necessary for you or Mr. Adam Mosseri to testify to set the record straight and provide members of Congress and parents with a plan on how you are going to protect our kids,&#8221; Senator Blumenthal wrote to Zuckerberg.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ionity, an electric vehicle fast-charging charging network provider whose owners include Daimler AG and Volkswagen Group, has scored a €700 million ($783 million) investment from BlackRock Global and existing shareholders to expand its footprint across Europe.</p>
<p>The company, which was founded in 2017, installs ultra-high-speed EV charging stations. It was launched as a joint venture between a coalition of major automakers that includes Hyundai Motor Group, Ford and BMW. The investment will allow Ionity to increase the number of charging points to 7,000 by 2025 &#8212; a more than four-fold increase from the 1,500 that are installed today.</p>
<p>The new charging stations will be situated on highways and other major roads as well as near major cities. Six to 12 charging points will be at each location, Ionity said in a statement. The firm is also planning on adding more charging points to existing sites with high demand.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239397" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ionity&#8217;s planned expansion includes owning and operating full service stations for drivers to &#8220;recharge&#8221; while charging their vehicles. These stations, a concept it&#8217;s calling “Oasis,” are similar to roadside rest stops today.</p>
<p>BlackRock is the first non-automotive company to invest in Ionity, through its Global Renewable Power equity investment vehicle. The investment management company raised $4.8 billion for the fund in April, a sign that institutional investors are increasingly interested in decarbonization technologies.</p>
<p>Its investment also speaks to the growing surety amongst powerful investment players in the forthcoming electric revolution in transportation. Thus far, BlackRock has mostly invested in onshore and offshore wind, and solar-powered projects, so its interest in EV charging is notable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok has seen its short-form video feed copied by a host of competitors, from Instagram to Snap to YouTube and even Netflix. Now it looks like you can add Spotify to that list. The company has confirmed it&#8217;s currently testing a new feature in its app, Discover, which presents a vertical feed of music videos that users can scroll through and optionally like or skip. For those who have access to the feature, it appears as a fourth tab in the navigation bar at the bottom of the Spotify app, in between Home and Search.</p>
<p>The new addition was first spotted by <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/1463542273216446472" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Messina</a>, who tweeted out a video of the Discover feature in action. He described it as a &#8220;pared-down version&#8221; of a TikTok-style feed of music videos.</p>
<p>Messina told us he found the feature in Spotify&#8217;s TestFlight build (a beta version for iOS), where a new icon in the navigation toolbar brings you immediately to the video feed when tapped. You can then swipe up and down to move through the feed, much like you would on TikTok. In addition to tapping the heart to like songs, you also can tap the three-dot menu to bring up the standard song information sheet, he notes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239363" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Messina also speculated the feature may be taking advantage of Spotify&#8217;s existing Canvas format.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not only that, <a href="https://twitter.com/Spotify?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Spotify</a> Discover is basically a pared down version of a TikTok-style feed of vertical music videos (likely using their canvas format) that you can like or skip.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NewSpotify?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NewSpotify</a> <a href="https://t.co/hpOEZ8v9bl">pic.twitter.com/hpOEZ8v9bl</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/get-ready-to-see-more-looping-videos-on-spotify-as-canvas-launches-into-beta/">broadly in 2019</a>, Canvas allows artists to create videos that accompany their music on the Spotify app. The feature <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/get-ready-to-see-more-looping-videos-on-spotify-as-canvas-launches-into-beta/">had mixed reviews</a> from users, as some reported they preferred to see just the static album art when listening to music and found the video and its looping imagery distracting. But others said they liked it. Canvas, however, appears to drive the engagement metrics that Spotify wants &#8212; the company <a href="https://canvas.spotify.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that users are more likely to keep streaming, share tracks or save tracks when they see a Canvas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>From the video Messina shared and others we viewed, we can confirm that the videos playing in the vertical feed are the artists&#8217; existing Canvas videos. But Spotify would not confirm this to us directly.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Spotify for further information on the feature, including whether it had plans to roll this out further, whether it was available on both iOS and Android, which markets had access to the feature and more. The company declined to share any details about the feature but did confirm, via a statement, it was exploring the idea of a vertical video feed.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Spotify, we routinely conduct a number of tests in an effort to improve our user experience,&#8221; a spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;Some of those tests end up paving the way for our broader user experience and others serve only as an important learning. We don’t have any further news to share at this time,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>In other words, the test is still very early and may not make its way to the public. But if it did, it wouldn&#8217;t be a surprising move on Spotify&#8217;s part. The company has before looked to popular social media formats to engage its users. In the past, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/spotify-test-lets-influencers-post-stories-to-introduce-their-own-playlists/">Spotify tested a Stories feature</a> that allowed influencers to post Stories to introduce their own, curated playlists. But that option never became available to all Spotify users.</p>
<p>While the TikTok format has been adopted by top social platforms, including Instagram (Reels), Snapchat (Spotlight), YouTube (Shorts) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/pinterest-gets-more-tiktok-like-with-a-watch-tab-for-videos-announces-20m-in-creator-rewards/">Pinterest</a> (Idea Pins), it&#8217;s also proving to be an ideal format for content discovery. Netflix, for instance, recently adopted the short-form vertical video feed in its own app with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/netflix-launches-fast-laughs-a-tiktok-like-feed-of-funny-videos/">the launch of its &#8220;Fast Laughs&#8221; feature</a>, which offers clips from its content library and tools to save the programs to a watch list or just start streaming them. Similarly, Spotify&#8217;s video-based Discover feature could help introduce users to new music and offer a way to signal their interests to Spotify in a familiar format.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/03/gen-z-and-millennial-workers-are-leading-the-latest-quitting-spree-.html">Great Resignation</a> is among the most significant events in recent U.S. history. We are seeing a post-COVID-19 generation refusing to work under the same conditions as they did before. The U.S. is facing the most prominent<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2021/09/07/labor-day-2021-when-worker-shortage-end/5674223001/"> labor shortage</a> of the decade, and positions that require high-demand skills are harder than ever to fill.</p>
<p>Midsized companies are finding it particularly hard to retain qualified personnel. Confronted by notable resource constraints, smaller budgets and workers’ demand for flexible solutions, the problems for SMBs are as great or even more significant than for larger organizations.</p>
<p>One way to make your company attractive is by developing attractive compensation strategies and increasing pay transparency and equity. Employees don&#8217;t always leave or stay because of their pay, but an opaque model for allocating compensation exacerbates feelings of disconnection and lowers engagement.</p>
<p>Let’s dive into how startups can benefit from compensation analysis, and how they can utilize available data to develop a comprehensive compensation strategy.</p>
<h2>Understanding the complexity of compensation</h2>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Pay equity is one of the most pressing social issues today, and any discrepancies can have adverse spillover effects on reputation and company relationships.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The amount that lands in an employees’ bank account is just one fragment of today’s compensation packages. Compensation can consist of a base salary, annual cash bonuses and long-term incentives.</p>
<p>When stirring a compensation mix together, there are different trade-offs to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed versus variable compensation:</strong> Base salary compared with bonuses.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term incentives versus short-term incentives:</strong> Short-term incentives can be in the form of annual bonus structures. Long-term incentives are usually stock or other forms of compensation that vest over the years.</li>
<li><strong>Cash versus equity:</strong> Equity can include stock options, restricted stock and performance shares.</li>
<li><strong>Group incentives versus individual incentives</strong>: You could implement a percentage-based salary increase for all positions or give bonuses to select employees.</li>
</ul>
<p>It isn&#8217;t ideal to have a uniform policy for all positions and departments. Managers should explain their reward decisions on an individual level, and compensation decisions should reflect the skills and contributions of every employee. In addition, companies are bound to have varying budgets (e.g., higher revenue during the holiday seasons) and philosophies on allocating them.</p>
<p>Many make the mistake of sticking to an approach that doesn’t pan out from a strategic standpoint or doesn’t motivate the team enough. Instead, managers should gather data, work through various analyses and scenarios and design a compensation strategy tailored to the company. This is where compensation management software comes into play.</p>
<h2>The devil is in the data</h2>
<p>Data will help you understand where the talent market is headed and where your company stands.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>My co-founders and I think we might qualify for International Entrepreneur Parole. </strong></p>
<p><strong>How long does it take to get IEP approved? How does that compare to other options that are available to startup founders, and can my spouse work?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Committed COO</strong></p>
<p>Dear Committed,</p>
<p>Great questions! With Thanksgiving in the United States tomorrow, I’m reflecting on how appreciative I am of you and everyone who submits questions to this column, wherever you are in the world!</p>
<p>My law partner Anita Koumriqian and I recently chatted on our <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/098-it-takes-a-village-happy-thanksgiving/">Thanksgiving gratitude podcast episode</a> about all the things we appreciate about U.S. immigration in 2021, including how grateful we are that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced this year that it would continue the International Entrepreneur Parole (IEP) program. (In May, USCIS under the Biden administration announced it was rescinding a proposal created by the previous administration that would have ended the IEP program.)</p>
<p>I recommend that you consult an immigration attorney who has experience filing <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/dear-sophie-whats-the-process-for-getting-international-entrepreneur-parole/">IEP applications</a>. Remember, only up to three individuals from the same startup can get IEP. Take a look at these previous Dear Sophie columns in which I discuss the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/dear-sophie-whats-the-difference-between-iep-and-the-latest-proposed-startup-visa/">qualifications for IEP</a> and the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/dear-sophie-whats-the-process-for-getting-international-entrepreneur-parole/">IEP process</a>. An immigration attorney will also be able to offer alternative options and steps to take based on the unique needs and situations of you and your leadership team.</p>

<h2>Timing is still an unknown</h2>
<p>The time it takes USCIS to process IEP applications remains uncertain for now, but we are still fervently advocating for anyone who may be eligible to take this path.</p>
<p>USCIS began processing IEP cases just this year, and it does not offer an estimate on processing times for <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/humanitarian-parole/international-entrepreneur-parole">Form I-941</a>, the application for IEP, on its <a href="https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/">Case Processing Times</a> webpage.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.fairphone.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fairphone</a>, the Dutch social enterprise dedicated to making consumer electronics (more) sustainable and ethical, including by supporting repairability so that users can hold onto their hardware for longer, has announced public testing of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/google-releases-android-10/">Android 10</a> for the six-year-old <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/04/meet-the-tiny-phone-company-thats-making-modularity-sustainable/">Fairphone 2</a>.</p>
<p>Owners of the modular handset that was first released back in 2015, running Android 5, should expect to be able to upgrade to Android 10 (released date: 2019) in early 2022, Fairphone said today, announcing the beta rollout of the upgrade.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Meet the tiny phone company that&#8217;s making modularity sustainable&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/04/meet-the-tiny-phone-company-thats-making-modularity-sustainable/embed/#?secret=LMDVwZjYLb" data-secret="LMDVwZjYLb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Fairphone stopped producing (but not supporting) the Fairphone 2 back in 2018 &#8212; going on to release the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/08/fairphone-3-is-a-normal-smartphone-with-ethical-shine/">Fairphone 3</a> (in 2019), the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/grab-your-screwdriver/">Fairphone 3+</a> (in 2020, also available as a modular upgrade to the 3) and, earlier this fall, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/fairphone-4/">Fairphone 4</a>, its first 5G handset &#8212; which it said would be supported until at least 2025.</p>
<p>Given the Fairphone 2&#8217;s impending update to Android 10 next year &#8212; which will mean it will have been supported for a total of seven years &#8212; 2025 looks like a conservative estimate of how long Fairphone 4 owners should expect to receive software support.</p>
<p>Fairphone says it collaborated with its community of users for the Android 10 upgrade project &#8212; and with a software developer in India, <a href="https://teamb58.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://teamb58.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637853157006000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2vF9VwqrfXQS42iHeRd5qr">Bharath Ravi Prakash</a>, which it says worked as a volunteer open source dev &#8212; and by doing that says it was able to streamline the process and shrink the time required to carry out the upgrade.</p>
<p>So while the prior Fairphone 2 OS update (to Android 9) took 18 months, this time the process has been condensed to 10 months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google, meanwhile, has gone on to release Android 11 (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/android-11-has-arrived/">2020</a>) and Android 12 (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/android-12-launched/">last month</a>) &#8212; for a sense of how far behind the Fairphone 2 upgrades are trailing the latest OS release.</p>
<p>&#8220;The company learned a lot from the Android 9 upgrade and although still complex, Android 10 was more predictable than Android 9,&#8221; Fairphone notes in a press release, which also quotes its head of software longevity &amp; IT, Agnes Crepet, who writes: “Our unique approach to software has allowed us to help our users keep their devices for as long as possible. We’re pleased to be able to provide our Fairphone 2 community with yet another software upgrade, reaching our goal to provide at least five years of support from launch for our phones and with the Android 10 upgrade, we’re going beyond that to seven years of support. We are constantly raising the bar for ourselves and the industry, showing that doing things more sustainably in software is possible.”</p>
<p>Seven years&#8217; support puts Fairphone into Apple iPhone software support timespans. But of course the average Android-based handset can expect fair fewer years of software love &#8212; typically Android smartphones only get around three years&#8217; support. So it&#8217;s a major achievement.</p>
<p>And while Fairphone may only now be catching up to Apple on the software longevity front it is already years ahead of Cupertino in another respect: Hardware sustainability through repairability via modular construction and offering direct-to-consumer spare parts.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/beginning-next-year-apple-will-mail-you-parts-and-tools-to-fix-your-iphone-and-mac-at-home/">Earlier this month</a> Apple announced that, starting next year, it would kick off a &#8220;Self Service Repair&#8221; program &#8212; shipping spare parts and repair tools to iPhone and Mac users to let them perform basic repairs at home.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s by no means full modularity from the company that has &#8212; historically &#8212; loved a hermetically sealed, stupidly thin, often <em>literally</em> glued shut box, but it is a small step in a more sustainable direction. And one that Fairphone has long pioneered.</p>

<p>Apple has sent threat notification alerts to victims of state-sponsored hackers in Thailand, El Salvador and Uganda, just hours after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/apple-nso-group-lawsuit/">filing a lawsuit against </a>Israeli spyware maker NSO Group<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/apple-nso-group-lawsuit/">.</a></p>
<p>At least six Thai activists and researchers who have been critical of the government have received the notification, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-warns-thai-activists-state-sponsored-attackers-may-have-targeted-iphones-2021-11-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a>, including Prajak Kongkirati, a political scientist at Bangkok’s Thammasat University, researcher Sarinee Achananuntakul and Thai activist Yingcheep Atchanont of the legal monitoring group iLaw. Citizen Lab, which tracks illegal hacking and surveillance, identified in 2018 a Pegasus spyware operator active within Thailand.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239252" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The alerts — which Apple says are <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sa/HT212960" target="_blank" rel="noopener">designed to inform and assist users who may have been targeted</a> by state-sponsored attackers — were also sent to a number of users in El Salvador. This includes 12 employees from <a href="https://elfaro.net/es/202111/el_salvador/25861/Apple-env%C3%ADa-alerta-de-espionaje-patrocinado-por-el-Estado-a-12-miembros-de-El-Faro.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">El Faro</a>, an online digital newspaper that has been notoriously critical of the government, as well as two leaders of civil society organizations and two opposition politicians.</p>
<p>Norbert Mao, the president of the Democratic Party in Uganda, also said on <a href="https://twitter.com/norbertmao/status/1463364241688305664" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> that he had received the threat notification.</p>
<p>The alert from Apple warns: “Apple believes you are being targeted by state-sponsored attackers who are trying to remotely compromise the iPhone associated with your Apple ID. These attackers are likely targeting you individually because of who you are or what you do. If your device is compromised by a state-sponsored attacker, they may be able to remotely access your sensitive data, communications, or even the camera and microphone. While it’s possible this is a false alarm, please take this warning seriously.”</p>
<p>Apple on Tuesday sued NSO Group to seek <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/apple-nso-group-lawsuit/">a permanent injunction</a> to prevent the spyware maker from using any Apple product. This would make it more difficult for the company to find and exploit vulnerabilities in iPhone software and hack its targets.</p>
<p>“The steps we’re taking today will send a clear message: In a free society it is unacceptable to weaponize powerful state-sponsored spyware against those who seek to make the world a better place,” said Apple’s security chief Ivan Krstić. “Apple runs one of the most sophisticated security engineering operations in the world, and we will continue to work tirelessly to protect our users from abusive state-sponsored actors like NSO Group.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Buy now, pay later&#8221; company <a href="https://www.afterpay.com/en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Afterpay</a> announced Wednesday that it was going after the <a href="https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/our-approach/marketnews/article.1525238.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.5 trillion global subscription payments market</a> by offering to its U.S. customers payment installments for subscriptions, like gym memberships, entertainment subscriptions and online services.</p>
<p>The service will launch in both the U.S. and Australia beginning early in 2022 and will be free for customers who pay on time. IPSY, BoxyCharm, Savage X Fenty and Fabletics are among the initial list of merchants that will offer the feature. The company plans to expand the feature in-store and into other regions later, including Canada, New Zealand, the U.K. and Europe.</p>
<p>In addition to paying for subscriptions in installments, Afterpay is also enabling its offering to be used on preordered items, where users can pay in four installments over time once the item ships. Another feature coming soon will allow merchants to accept deposits on custom items.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239268" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;By offering customers the option to pay for subscriptions with Afterpay, we&#8217;re not only giving consumers flexibility to pay for more expensive monthly costs, but we&#8217;re also helping our merchant partners capture a wider consumer base through this convenient experience,” said Zahir Khoja, general manager of North America for Afterpay, in a written statement.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/klarna-offers-pay-now-option-in-u-s-klarna-card-coming-soon/">Klarna</a>, Afterpay’s competitor in the BNPL space, also announced news this week for its U.S. customers that it was offering its “Pay Now” option.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in August, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/square-to-buy-buy-now-pay-later-giant-afterpay-in-29b-deal/">Square announced that it was buying Afterpay</a> in an all-stock deal valued at $29 billion. Afterpay has also been on a roll with feature debuts recently, launching both Afterpay Ads, a suite of advertising products for brands to engage with shoppers within the ecosystem, and merchant analytics tool Afterpay IQ, in August.</p>
<p>Afterpay works with 100,000 retailers and has approximately <a href="https://corporate.afterpay.com/investors/asx-announcements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10.5 million active customers in North America</a> as of June 30, up from 5.6 million the year prior. North America is the company’s “largest region in terms of underlying sales,” which grew 145% year over year, or from $4 billion in fiscal year 2020 to $9.8 billion in fiscal year 2021, according to the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">For those who weren&#8217;t online last week, here&#8217;s what you missed: a not-so-subtle group of strangers on the internet banded together to try to buy one of the remaining 13 copies of the Constitution. With crypto. The bold bid eventually fell short, but many saw it as an inspiring </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/constitutiondaos-bold-crypto-bid-for-us-constitution-falls-short/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">onramp into how communities can mobilize around a shared goal in a web3 world. </a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The whole movement, from its meme start to its poetic, and billionaire Ken Griffin-themed, end, was just too interesting for Equity to not dedicate an entire episode to.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238783" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>So, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a> brought on <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasmtny" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lucas Matney</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/AnitaRamaswamy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anita Ramaswamy </a>to unpack, decompress and bond over our shared experience of witnessing this &#8220;financial flash mob.&#8221;</p>
<p>We talked about what a DAO is, and what they might be used for. We dug into the question of just how many folks the effort really brought to the larger &#8220;web3&#8221; space. And, of course, we had to talk about gas fees, NFTs and the pace of innovation in crypto more broadly. Lucas even broke out an excellent analogy to explain level-two chains!</p>
<p>The crew were generally bullish on the blockchain economy, if skeptical of some of its current uses. In short, the potential remains potent in crypto even if some of its projects, today at least, are a bit more boring than breakthrough. Crypto, we&#8217;re told, is going to shake up the world. More of that, we reckon, and less of the meme-wars wouldn&#8217;t be amiss.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[More dollars, rising deal sizes. What's going on in Canada?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s boom times for startups building with or atop AI functionality: <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Exchange </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/huge-deals-are-pushing-more-ai-startups-into-ipo-territory/">explored the rise</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in venture capital dollars for AI startups last week, noting that investment into the business niche set all-time records in Q4 2020, and then successively in quarters one, two and three in 2021.</span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>

<hr />
<p>Given how heated the overall venture capital market is proving to be, those data points were only so surprising. What did shock us a little, however, was how active the Canadian AI startup market has been this year.</p>
<p>Perhaps it shouldn’t have. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-cohen1/?originalSubdomain=ca">Matt Cohen</a>, a managing partner at Ripple Ventures, told The Exchange that “while investment in Canadian startups of all varieties has ramped up lately, AI-enabled startups are certainly leading the pack.”</p>
<p>We’re behind, it turns out. But not so far behind that we cannot catch up on the Canadian AI startup story. Our questions are simple: Why are Canadian startups seeing their fundraising fortunes rise so sharply, what parts of the AI stack are being attacked, what role does public money play in the rising investment totals and what impact do local universities have on artificial intelligence work in Canada?</p>

<p>We’ll start with data, and then talk about what&#8217;s pushing up the numbers.</p>
<h2>From the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4ALQyinHGIctf3q6YhWemg?si=c08f581ec3e74384">land of milk in a bag</a>, rising AI investment</h2>
<p>Let’s start from a yearly perspective. Funding for Canadian AI startups rose to record heights in 2019 before seeing declines in 2020 to just $488 million in total funding. But 2021 is proving to be more than a return to form for Canadian AI startups, with some $1.5 billion raised through the third quarter.</p>
<p>The results are a bit uneven, to be fair. Canada saw $895 million across 21 deals in Q2 2021 AI funding, and just $446 million in the third quarter, albeit from a slightly higher deal count of 24. But as the Q3 2021 dollar result for the country is nearly on par with its full-year 2020 total, it&#8217;s hard to be too bearish.</p>
<p>The evolution of Canadian AI funding as a portion of all venture capital funding in the country is impressive. AI companies raised 16% of known venture capital funds in 2021 thus far, a huge gain on the mere 2% that they were worth of total dollar volume in 2016.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">With Tesla&#8217;s latest FSD (&#8220;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-10-beta-145035031.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">Full Self-Driving</a>&#8220;) release, it&#8217;s asking drivers to consent to allowing it to collect video taken by a car&#8217;s exterior and interior cameras in case of an accident or &#8220;serious safety risk.&#8221; That will mark the first time Tesla will attach footage to a specific vehicle and driver, according to an <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/11/23/tesla-asks-full-self-driving-beta-to-accept-being-recorded-crash-safety-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><em>Electrek</em></a> report.</p>
<p>Tesla has gathered video footage as part of FSD before, but it was only used to train and improve its AI self-driving systems. According to the new agreement, however, Tesla will now be able to associate video to specific vehicles. &#8220;By enabling FSD Beta, I consent to Tesla’s collection of VIN-associated image data from the vehicle’s external cameras and Cabin Camera in the occurrence of a serious safety risk or a safety event like a collision,&#8221; the agreement reads.</p>
<blockquote><p>By enabling FSD Beta, I consent to Tesla’s collection of VIN-associated image data from the vehicle’s external cameras and Cabin Camera in the occurrence of a serious safety risk or a safety event like a collision.</p></blockquote><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239243" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As <em>Electrek</em> notes, the language could indicate that Tesla wants to ensure it has evidence in case its FSD system is blamed for an accident. It could possibly also be used to detect and fix serious issues more quickly.</p>
<p>FSD 10.3 was released more widely than previous betas, but it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-pulls-latest-self-driving-beta-over-left-turn-and-other-issues-063331006.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">quickly pulled back</a> due to issues like unwarranted Forward Collision Warnings, unexpected autobraking and more. At the time, CEO Elon Musk tweeted that such issues are &#8220;to be expected with beta software,&#8221; adding that &#8220;it is impossible to test all hardware configs in all conditions with internal QA, hence public tests.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, other drivers on public roads are unwitting beta testers, too. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nhtsa-tesla-full-self-driving-beta-investigation-192733573.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">currently investigating</a> a driver&#8217;s complaint that FSD led to a November 3rd collision in Brea, California. The owner alleged that it caused his Model Y to enter the wrong lane and hit another car, causing considerable damage to both.</p>
<p>Tesla is releasing the new beta to even more users with Driver Safety Scores of 98 and up — previously, beta releases were limited to drivers with perfect 100 scores. Tesla charges drivers $199 per month for the feature or $10,000 in one shot, but has failed meet promised deadlines for autonomous driving. Currently, the FSD system is considered to be a Level 2 system — far from the Level 4 required to really be &#8220;full self-driving.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

		<div class="byline__author">
							<span class="byline__author-name">Roman Bysko</span>
						<span class="byline__author-title" style="display: block;">Contributor</span>
		</div>

			</div>

		<div class="contributor-byline__bio">
		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/byskoro/">Roman Bysko</a> is a co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.meredot.com/">Meredot</a>, a mobility infrastructure company that develops next-gen electric charging stations. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Compared with cars, e-scooters are a lower-carbon, quieter and cheaper means of transport that can make a positive impact on urban mobility and the environment. However, despite their promising potential, the majority of the urban population perceives them either as toys or a <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/Injuries-Using-E-Scooters-E-Bikes-and-Hoverboards-Jump-70-During-the-Past-Four-Years">public safety hazard</a>.</p>
<p>The amount of venture investments in the industry is correspondingly meager: Since 2010, shared micromobility <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/shared-mobility-where-it-stands-where-its-headed">received</a> only $9 billion in investments <em>globally</em> &#8212; compare that with the $72.3 billion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">raised</a> by U.S. startups in the third quarter of this year alone. If we want to move toward a truly sustainable urban environment where people en masse choose low-carbon micromobility transport over cars, we need to find ways to make this business profitable.</p>
<p>Initially, e-scooter operators were competing for the attention of riders by putting as many e-scooters as they could on the market, and physical presence meant success. As cities started to adopt regulations and grant licenses, the operators’ focus shifted to getting approvals from city officials because licenses secured their access to end consumers and gave confidence that allowed for long-term planning.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238144" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The licenses also eased the task for investors, and the startups that secured licenses saw a surge of funding. For instance, in 2021, players like Tier, Voi and Dott <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/europe-leads-the-pack-for-2021s-micromobility-vc-deals">raised</a> a cumulative $490 million.</p>
<p>This sends a clear message to other e-scooter operators that aim to compete on the market: If you want to raise investments and grow, claim a place in the cities first. Currently, this applies predominantly to Europe, which has a better infrastructure and serves as a test site for micromobility transport and business models.</p>
<p>However, when micromobility at large proves efficient for urban communities, these practices will likely expand to other regions such as the U.S., where major cities are already <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/is-the-us-becoming-more-bike-friendly">building</a> more bike lanes. Considering that by 2030 global micromobility is <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/the-future-of-micromobility-ridership-and-revenue-after-a-crisis">expected</a> to become a $300 billion to $500 billion industry, it’s well worth the effort.</p>
<p>Merely winning a tender, though, isn’t enough because the licensed operators move on to the next round of competition. They have to meet the expectations of both <a href="https://www.trucks.vc/blog/the-three-axes-of-micromobility-supply-chains-distribution-and-maintenance">end consumers</a> and investors &#8212; that is, to achieve profitability while offering supreme product and product experience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So far, the e-scooter sharing business has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/micromobilitys-next-big-business-is-software-not-vehicles/">not proven profitable</a>, and the existing business models have lots of room for improvement. The most evident issues are expensive charging and operations that may <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2019/promise-pitfalls-e-scooter-sharing">account</a> for 60% of costs, so even a slight optimization here would be beneficial.</p>
<h2>So what can we do?</h2>
<p>Operations may vary between companies, but charging scenarios are few. Micromobility operators either collect vehicles manually at the end of the day to bring them to charging warehouses or manually swap dead batteries for new ones. Both of these involve manual labor, and some players have started offering solutions that aim to cut this cost.</p>
<p>Taiwan-based e-scooter manufacturer Gogoro <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/gogoro-plans-to-launch-80-battery-swapping-stations-in-china-by-the-end-of-this-year-171414.html">launched</a> swapping stations that essentially pass charging tasks on to riders. So far it’s compatible only with two e-scooter brands. German operator Tier chose a similar approach and recently <a href="https://about.tier.app/tier-raises-200-million-series-d/">rolled out</a> Tier Energy Network: Now, Tier riders can swap batteries themselves using PowerBoxes installed at local partner shops. However, if an operator goes for swapping, they have to have at least two batteries in stock for every e-scooter in their fleet, and battery cells are <a href="https://www.trucks.vc/blog/the-three-axes-of-micromobility-supply-chains-distribution-and-maintenance">the most expensive</a> hardware component.</p>
<p>Besides, having to change a route to swap batteries at brand-specific locations might worsen product experience for some consumers and limit an operator’s user base, which is essential when the competition is tight.</p>
<p>Moreover, when the demand for micromobility increases, the stations will need to be able to fit a large number of vehicles simultaneously. It will create a demand for universal infrastructure. Companies such as <a href="https://www.kuhmute.com/">Kuhmute</a> and <a href="https://www.pbsc.com/">PBSC Urban Solutions</a> have partially addressed this issue and developed universal chargers compatible with various e-mobility vehicle types and brands, though many such solutions are electric contact-based and therefore can accommodate only a limited number of vehicles at a time. Besides, stations are prone to contact oxidation in two to three months and change the city landscape.</p>
<p>In that case, a natural next step would be to roll out a one-type-fits-all charger with a substantially bigger parking capacity. Though once we start discussing parking spaces, cities come into play as key stakeholders. They already have to convert plenty of land suitable for residential development into spaces for cars to park, and they’ll need to also assign it to e-scooter charging &#8212; both swapping stations and charging docks have overground hardware.</p>
<p>Some players have started addressing this issue, and such products already exist in the electric car domain. For instance, U.S.-based company <a href="https://witricity.com/">WiTricity</a> has developed a ground charging pad that charges cars wirelessly and over-the-air once vehicles are parked over it. The charger doesn’t have any overground hardware, so it can double as a regular road or sidewalk. The absence of destroyable parts also serves as vandalism protection.</p>
<p>If applied in the e-scooter segment, this technology can improve unit economics by saving on extra batteries and manual labor required to swap or plug them in. Such standardization would be beneficial for end consumers and micromobility companies alike.</p>

The change comes as the social media giant recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/say-goodbye-to-disappearing-tweets-twitter-no-longer-auto-loads-new-tweets-on-the-web/">updated its web platform</a> to no longer automatically refresh timelines with new tweets. Twitter acknowledged that in the past, tweets would often disappear from view as users were reading them when their timeline would automatically refresh, creating a frustrating experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve made some updates on iOS to prevent Tweets from disappearing mid-read. Now when you pause your timeline scrolling to look at a Tweet, it should stay put!,&#8221; Twitter outlined in<a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1463270547706585100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1463270547706585100%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a tweet</a>.</p>

<p>&mdash; Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1463270547706585100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In September, the company noted it would be rolling out updates to the way it displays tweets so that they wouldn’t disappear mid-read. These updates have now rolled out to Twitter&#8217;s web and iOS platforms. Twitter notes that it&#8217;s working on making changes to the disappearing tweet experience <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1463283116735410176" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Android</a> too, but it&#8217;s unknown when the updates will roll out.</p>
<p>Twitter also recently announced that it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/twitter-no-longer-crops-image-previews-on-the-web/">no longer automatically</a> crop image previews on the web, after rolling out full-size image previews on mobile earlier this year. On Twitter for the web, images will now display in full without any cropping. Instead of gambling on how an image will show up in the timeline, images will look just like they did when you shot them. The social media giant first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/twitter-cropped-image-previews-test/">tested the change</a> in March with a small subset of iOS and Android users.</p>
<p>These tweaks come as Twitter has been working to enhance its platform and make its services more accessible. The social media giant<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/twitter-now-lets-you-tune-into-spaces-without-an-account-via-direct-links/"> recently rolled out</a> the ability for users to share direct links to their Spaces to let others tune into a live audio session via the web without being logged into the platform. The company also recently introduced its in-app tipping feature to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/twitter-tipping-feature-android-users/">all Android users</a> above the age of 18.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/virgin-galactic-and-richard-branson-celebrate-launch-of-first-passengers-into-space/">Virgin Galactic&#8217;s big event for its founder&#8217;s first flight</a>, Richard Branson announced that the company would be making seats on its spacecraft available via online raffle platform Omaze. The first winner of those tickets was just announced: Antigua&#8217;s Keisha S. (her last name is being held confidential) and her daughter.</p>
<p>The idea is, you enter with $10, and the money ultimately goes to charity, but you also get a chance at the prize of two tickets to the edge of space (of course the platform gets a little something too). In this case they raised $1.7 million for <a href="https://spaceforhumanity.org/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Space for Humanity</a>, which is itself an organization aimed at putting people into space.</p>
<p>Out of a couple hundred thousand entries from over 200 countries (obviously everyone wants to go to space) the winner was Keisha, an Antigua local who plans to take her daughter, an astrophysics student, on the flight.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238936" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;I’ve always had a lifelong love of flying and a fascination with space, and this is truly a dream come true for me. It means the world to me that I’m sharing this experience with my daughter and am hopeful that together we can inspire the next generation to follow their dreams,&#8221; she said in the press release.</p>
<p>They&#8217;ll also get a personal tour of Spaceport America from Branson himself. Should be fun — congratulations to the lucky pair. No timing yet but commercial service is expected to start at the end of next year, so that&#8217;s at least a ballpark to start with.</p>
<p>Now, when Branson was on stage he implied these raffles would be regular events, but a Virgin Galactic representative said they &#8220;have not announced plans for future sweepstakes at this time.&#8221; Observe that this leaves open the possibilities that it is not yet announced, or that there will be none. Of course it is arguably premature to give away even more tickets when the first set isn&#8217;t due to fly for a year or more.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Longevica's goal is to validate the pipeline of turning scientific research into consumer-ready products.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Life science company <a href="http://longevica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Longevica</a> said Wednesday it is launching an open research tool so scientists and research institutions can access a data set that tracks the effects of more than 1,000 pharmacological compounds for testing drugs.</p>
<p>This is the latest effort from the biotechnology company, which is researching mechanisms of healthy aging and life extension. To do this, the company took in $2.5 million in funding led by Xploration Capital.</p>
<p>In April, Longevica announced the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/longevity-startup-longevica-plans-to-launch-supplements-based-on-long-term-research/">launch of a line of supplements</a> based on its research. The company got its start more than 11 years ago and has now raised over $15.5 million in funding from investors, including Alexander Chikunov, a longevity investor, who is also president of the company.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238752" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>When the company emerged from stealth, it was primarily focused on finding the best ways to leverage the results of its research as soon as possible and bringing some consumer-ready products to market, Longevica co-founder and CEO Ainar Abdrakhmanov told TechCrunch via email.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We still move along this path, which includes screening and trials; however, through a series of deep interviews, we found that most scientists in the longevity space lack infrastructure, and we decided to share our internal engine to leverage more research through partnerships and by giving researchers a data platform for their work,” he added.</p>
<p>Living longer is an area that other companies are working in as well, for both humans and pets. The <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/global-anti-aging-drugs-market-survey-2021-analysis-with-top-countries-data-growth-sizecurrent-situation-value-research-method-trend-application-and-forecast-by-2027-with-covid-19-impact-analysis-2021-09-20#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20the%20global%20Anti,Drugs%20Scope%20and%20Market%20Size." target="_blank" rel="noopener">global anti-aging drugs market</a> was valued at nearly $8 billion in 2020 and is projected to double by 2027.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Crunchbase News took a look at the <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/top-venture-investments-for-radical-life-extension/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">status of longevity startups</a> in July and found over 30 operating in the space that collectively raised billions of dollars. A more recent example is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/loyal-raises-27m-aims-to-give-dog-owners-more-time-with-their-pets/">Loyal, which raised $27 million</a> to examine longer lives in animals with a long-term vision of translating that into human longevity.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Longevity startup Longevica plans to launch supplements based on long-term research&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/longevity-startup-longevica-plans-to-launch-supplements-based-on-long-term-research/embed/#?secret=6spFWAGqpY" data-secret="6spFWAGqpY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Longevica itself started fundraising when it came up with the idea of the end-to-end open research platform. The new funding will go toward supporting the platform’s development and integration of the company’s research data set.</p>
<p>The goal is to validate the pipeline of turning scientific research into consumer-ready products, Abdrakhmanov said.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of hypotheses around ageing and lifespan, but there’s a clear bottleneck in actually testing those ideas to figure out who might be right,” he added. “Our platform should help the scientific community get a bit closer to the answers.”</p>
<p>Its original study, led by Chikunov and Longevica co-founder Dr. Alexey Ryazanov, tested 1,033 compounds and showed significant life extension properties. The company is close to publishing a peer-reviewed paper on that study. Abdrakhmanov called it “more of a moonshot project,” but also that this direction could bring results much sooner and be beneficial for the entire industry, something its investors were able to see, he added.</p>
<p>Armed with the new research capabilities, Longevica will now go deeper into testing 300 of those compounds with a new research study at Jackson Laboratory. In January, the company will also begin collecting applications from researchers interested in testing their drugs in a full-scale pharmacological screening experiment that will begin in June 2022.</p>
<p>“Also in January, we will start a public database including marked up data on most longevity-related experiments on mice, both public and some which haven’t been published yet,” Abdrakhmanov said. “The entire platform will be free and open source, even its program code will be publicly available on GitHub.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Adil estimates that today’s growth factor costs $2 million per gram to make, but she believes that with efforts from Tiamat Sciences and others, that cost could come down 10 times.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cellular growth medium is a component of cellular agriculture that enables lab-grown meat to be made at a lower cost. However, the traditional ways of making these growth factors, or reagents, are costly themselves, which makes large-scale manufacturing difficult.</p>
<p>On average, reports show that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47724267" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lab-grown meat costs about $50</a>, but that new technologies could bring that down to a more reasonable <a href="https://gfi.org/blog/cultivated-meat-lca-tea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3 per pound by 2030</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tiamat-sciences.com/">Tiamat Sciences</a> is one biotech startup developing a more cost-effective biomolecule aimed at replacing more costly bioreactors. Today, it announced $3 million in seed financing, led by True Ventures, with participation from Social Impact Capital and Cantos.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238762" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2238769" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238769" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2238769" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/France-Emmanuelle-Adil75.png" alt="France-Emmanuelle Adil, Tiamet Sciences" width="400" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/France-Emmanuelle-Adil75.png 400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/France-Emmanuelle-Adil75.png?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/France-Emmanuelle-Adil75.png?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/France-Emmanuelle-Adil75.png?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2238769" class="wp-caption-text">France-Emmanuelle Adil, founder and CEO, Tiamet Sciences. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tiamet Sciences</p></div></p>
<p>The company’s CEO, France-Emmanuelle Adil, founded the company in 2019 to manufacture animal-free proteins using a proprietary plant molecular farming approach that combines biotechnology, vertical farming and computation design to reinvent recombinant proteins.</p>
<p>“The growth factors used in media are expensive right now,” she told TechCrunch. “We can reduce costs drastically and reach price parity with meat.”</p>
<p>Adil estimates that today’s growth factor costs $2 million per gram to make, but she believes that with efforts from Tiamat Sciences <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/02/future-fields-is-tackling-cultured-meats-biggest-problem/">and others</a>, that cost could come down 10 times with a focus on making it 1,000 times cheaper by 2025 so that large-scale production can proceed.</p>
<p>Prior to the $3 million seed round, the company brought in a small round last July to give it $3.4 million in total funding to date. Adil wanted to expand the company, which was in Belgium, where it has an operating site, and moved to North Carolina in May.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new funding will aid in building a pilot production facility in Durham, North Carolina and in technology development. The company is already on its way to reaching carbon-neutral production.</p>
<p>She was not able to disclose customers yet, but said the company is in development of its first product aimed for release by the end of the year. Tiamet would then be sending samples to customers for testing, which she believes will lead to some partnerships in 2022.</p>
<p>In addition to food, Adil says Tiamat’s approach could be applicable in other industries like regenerative medicine and vaccine production.</p>
<p>“Growth factors are transferable to other industries because the processes are similar,” she added. “We will be working on expansion for the end of 2022. We will scale very fast with a number of plants and then 100,000 plants. We are in discussion with companies to help us scale big but progressively.”</p>
<p>Phil Black, co-founder of True Ventures, said the investment into Tiamat Sciences fit into its plant-based portfolio. The initial money raised by the company allows them to prove to people that their technology works and to produce it at the trial level. Then will come a much larger round to scale up from liters to gallons.</p>
<p>“The cell meat industry is here to stay and now people are interested in making it more profitable for themselves and making more of it,” he added. “Limited factors exist, and Taimat’s solution will be a game-changer.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spinny, a Gurgaon-based startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/indias-spinny-raises-43-7m-to-expand-its-online-platform-for-selling-used-cars/">operates a platform to facilitate the purchase and sale of used cars</a>, is the latest firm to become a unicorn in the world’s second-largest internet market.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spinny.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spinny</a> has raised more than $280 million in its Series E financing round, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The round, which is co-led by Tiger Global and Abu Dhabi Growth Fund, values Spinny at over $1.75 billion post-money, the source said.</p>
<p>This is the third funding round raised by Spinny this year. The startup was valued at about $700 million in July this year and $350 million in April.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2239214" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new round follows quarters of strong growth that saw Spinny expand to 15 Indian cities, up from fewer than half a dozen last year. The startup has grown its business by four times in the current calendar year, the source said, requesting anonymity as the figures are not public.</p>
<p>Spinny, which counts Elevation Capital and Accel among its existing backers, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Indian news outlet Entrackr <a href="https://entrackr.com/2021/11/exclusive-spinny-turns-unicorn-after-series-e-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first reported</a> about the funding round.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of used cars are sold in India each month. But buying them through the offline and traditional channel could prove to be a painstakingly long and high-risk process.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges people face in buying a used car is the trust factor, Niraj Singh, co-founder and chief executive of Spinny told TechCrunch in an interview earlier this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Spinny is addressing this by removing the traditional middlemen from the equation, thereby making it more affordable and reliable for customers to buy a used car. The startup buys cars from the owners, performs thorough and transparent inspections and then makes them available for customers to purchase.</p>

<p>If a customer is not satisfied with the car that they have purchased from Spinny, they get a full refund, the startup says on the website.</p>
<p>The growth potential for Spinny and some other startups operating in this space is massive. The market for auto e-commerce currently has less than 1% penetration in India, according to analysts at Bernstein.</p>
<p>“This is largely because the auto market still requires physical inspections and the target market skews towards used vehicles — an unorganized market,&#8221; they wrote in a report earlier this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The total addressable market in India is around $220 billion, which includes used vehicle purchase by consumers, auctions and remarketing, growth potential for the new vehicles market, and financing and advertisements. The total addressable market for only the used car market in US is over $800 billion,” they wrote in a report earlier this year.</p>
<p>Spinny is the second Indian startup to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/nobroker-becomes-first-indian-proptech-unicorn-with-fresh-210-million-funding/">become a unicorn this week</a>. India has produced more than three dozen unicorns this year — more than all other years put together — after several high-profile global investors, including Tiger Global, SoftBank and Falcon Edge Capital, began to double down on the world’s second-largest internet market earlier this year at the height of the ravaging pandemic.</p>
<p>In a letter to shareholders earlier this year, Tiger Global identified India as one of the few markets where it was planning to deploy billions of dollars. SoftBank Group chief executive Rajeev Misra said earlier this month that the Japanese firm has invested more than $3 billion in India this year and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/softbank-has-deployed-3-billion-in-india-this-year-can-invest-up-to-10-billion-in-2022/">can invest up to $10 billion in the country</a> next year.</p>
