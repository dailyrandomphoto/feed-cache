										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GitHub has reached an &#8220;amicable resolution&#8221; with the person the company fired in the aftermath of the attack on the U.S. Capitol in January, the former employee told TechCrunch.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">On the day a violent mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, a worried GitHub employee warned his co-workers in the D.C. area to be safe. After making a comment in Slack saying, “stay safe homies, Nazis are about,” a fellow employee took offense, saying that type of rhetoric wasn’t good for work, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/fired-github-employee-who-warned-coworkers-about-nazis-is-seeking-legal-counsel/">the former employee previously told me</a>. Two days later, he was fired, with a human relations representative citing a “pattern of behavior that is not conducive to company policy” as the rationale for his termination, he previously told me.</p>
<p>Later that month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/githubs-head-of-hr-resigns-in-light-of-termination-of-jewish-employee/">GitHub COO Erica Brescia said the company’s head of HR took full responsibility for what happened and resigned from the company yesterday</a>. GitHub did not disclose the name of the person who resigned, but it’s widely known that Carrie Olesen was the chief human resources officer at GitHub. At that time, GitHub said it also &#8220;reversed the decision to separate with the employee” and was talking to his representative.</p>
<p>The fired employee, however, did not take his job back.</p>
<div>“We offered the employee his job back immediately after reviewing the investigation findings, and he declined,” a GitHub spokesperson told TechCrunch.</div>
<p>Instead, he told me, &#8220;me and the company reached an amicable resolution. I appreciate that they have denounced white supremacy and the dangers it poses to everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not specify the terms of the resolution, but he previously told me he was seeking damages or some other form of reconciliation.</p>
<p>Below is his full statement, which he requested we publish in full:</p>
<blockquote><p>Me and the company reached an amicable resolution. I appreciate that they have denounced white supremacy and the dangers it poses to everybody.</p>
<p>We all saw on January 6 that the greatest threat to the USA is not Islam, Black<br />
Lives, or defunding police.</p>
<p>White supremacy has us all held hostage using feigned civility, bad-faith arguments/negotiations, and amtssprache*, and it does not stop until we are all dead or subjugated. I am glad that the nazi coup was a failure, and we avoided a successful Reichstag fire. That said, nazis do not give up easily.</p>
<p>Keep your families and communities safe. Connect with your neighbors and local stores. Fascism and nazism succeed when we are divided. They demand that you abandon reason, that you acquiesce to power and hierarchy, and that you shun altruism. Love yourself. Support, join or create local unions. Build community. Don’t entertain nazis.</p>
<p>I appreciate those who have supported me and my family. I wish you safety and wellness.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://gumroad.com/">Gumroad</a>, a startup that helps creators sell their work, is raising $6 million at a $100 million valuation. While $1 million of that total is reserved for AngelList co-founder Naval Ravikant and Basecamp founder Jason Fried, the remaining $5 million is being raised with a twist: anyone willing to fork over at least $100 bucks can invest in the round.</p>
<p>Founded by Sahil Lavingia, Gumroad is using a new SEC regulation, passed today, that increases the maximum amount of money that can be raised in an equity crowdfunding campaign. Now, investors and founders can raise up to $5 million per year from crowdfunding, up from $1.07 million the year prior.</p>
<p>The increase might not turn heads in a world of $90+ billion valuations, but Lavingia thinks the new rules could revitalize a path to raising capital for venture capitalists and founders alike. Unaccredited investors &#8212; whether its users, friends or non-accredited investors &#8212; could become the new limited partners.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“If this works, startup founders will start to be able to go direct more frequently,” Lavingia said.</p>
<p>Despite venture capital growing as an asset class, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/investors-discuss-alt-financing-and-the-role-of-venture-capital/">alternative ways to raise are becoming increasingly popular</a> to help founders maintain ownership and to access capital.</p>
<p>Up until this point, Gumroad has raised more than $8 million from investors, including Kleiner Perkins, First Round, Max Levchin and SV Angel, as well as others, since 2011. But today marks what Lavingia views as a long-term shift in how Gumroad raises capital. If all goes well, Gumroad will continue raising via crowdfunding on an annual basis until it goes public.</p>
<p>Now that companies can raise $5 million per year through crowdfunding, platforms like WeFunder, StartEngine, SeedInvest and Republic, which Lavingia is using, have a better chance to shake up the modern fundraise.</p>
<p>So far, Gumroad has raised $3.4 million of its $5 million goal across commitments from 3,458 investors. Investors in the crowdfund include part-time creators on Gumroad, Lavingia’s Twitter followers, YouTubers, as well as Figma founder Dylan Field and partners from VC firms. In order to promote a diversity of investors, Gumroad has capped total investments from individuals at $1,000 for the first few days.</p>

<p>The startup is giving up 6% of ownership as part of the financing event, and the investors will only receive equity stakes once the SAFE note turns into a round. This process could take a year, Lavingia said. The conversion round to make it happen could be an IPO, acquisition or $10 million priced round. The priced round will likely happen next year through a Reg A round, the annual limit of which is $75 million, the founder said.</p>
<p>The SAFE’s cap is placed at a present-day 3.5x revenue multiple. In 2020, Gumroad brought in $9.2 million in net revenue, up 87% from the year prior, generating $1.08 million in net profit, up 286% from the year prior.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The new, higher crowdfunding investing cap has some downsides, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/vc-democratization/">according to institutional investors.</a> A simple one is that it is an administrative burden to give hundreds of people equity in your company for a small amount of money. Another issue, one investor told TechCrunch, is that institutional investors are sometimes experts in investment areas, which is helpful in a way hundreds of smaller investors might not be. Finally, the max of crowdfunding is still $5 million a year, so the method may be less effective for later-stage companies like, say, Stripe, which needs traditional investors to buy in.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">12) There are certainly many issues that still need to be resolved &#8212; such as how does a non-professional investor know what to invest in? </p>
<p>You can imagine influencers and sherpas with an audience replacing the concept of a VC fund.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elizabeth Yin (@dunkhippo33) <a href="https://twitter.com/dunkhippo33/status/1371562884342280194?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 15, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Despite these concerns, the recent Gumroad raise is a continuation of two trends of which Lavingia has been on the forefront: building in public and the democratization of venture capital. He livestreams every Gumroad board meeting through Clubhouse and Zoom, and shares business metrics that most private companies decline to report, such as revenue and profit. (In fact, I knew about this plan to raise months ago after reading one of his newsletters.)</p>
<p>Readers will also remember that Lavingia was one of the first people to use the AngelList platform to create a rolling fund, which uses a 506(c) SEC regulation that allows investors to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/gumroad-founder-sahil-lavingia-launches-new-seed-fund-in-collaboration-with-angellist/">publicly solicit investments on an ongoing basis</a>. The move was met with controversy at first, since venture capital funds have historically been raised behind closed doors.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WEgBR6vyax"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/vc-democratization/">Crowdfunding limits are poised to change next week, but most VCs aren&#8217;t paying attention &#8212; yet</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Crowdfunding limits are poised to change next week, but most VCs aren&#8217;t paying attention &#8212; yet&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/vc-democratization/embed/#?secret=WEgBR6vyax" data-secret="WEgBR6vyax" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“People were upset at the rolling fund, so imagine when they see that you are cutting out the whole industry [of venture capital],” Lavingia said, referring to a conversation he had with AngelList’s Ravikant.</p>
<p>One thing to be wary of, Lavingia says, is the<a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2021/03/173206-as-reg-cf-funding-cap-jumps-to-5-million-first-issuers-take-advantage-of-the-increased-funding-amount/"> Testing the Waters</a> dynamic. Under Reg CF and A+, startups are able to differentiate between offering and selling securities. Offering simply allows a founder to “test the waters” and see if interest is there for a crowdfunded round. Despite this guardrail, commitments aren’t capital. For example, a startup could get $1 million in commitments but wind up only raising $100,000, Lavingia said. The conversion rate for intended buys versus actual buys could leave some founders in a thorny spot.</p>
<p>His way for combating this is to be obvious about red flags and transparent, which is already in line with Gumroad’s thesis.</p>
<p>“I preceded this fundraise with a blog post that I’m the only person who works on Gumroad as an employee,” he said. “I want to scare off anyone who is like this is weird [from investing].”</p>
<p>Other than Lavingia, Backstage Capital’s Arlan Hamilton has used Republic to crowdfund her firm’s operating fees. Hamilton made history earlier this month when she raised $1 million in eight hours for her fund. Today, she similarly opened up investments in her firm in light of the new cap and has already closed $2.4 million.</p>
<p>When Hamilton spoke about the raise at TC Sessions: Justice, she said she expects another asset class to be born because venture is a “broken” and “old” system.</p>
<p>“I’ll probably pivot Backstage, we’ll find ways and we’ve already started,” she said. “If you look at our raise we did in the Republic, it didn’t exist the way we wanted it to exist, this ability to go to the crowd as a fund.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">2014: income &lt;$10,000<br />2016: raised first $1.2M fund<br />2020: deployed first $1M “check” <br />2021: raised $1M in 8 hours</p>
<p>Don’t give up.</p>
<p>&mdash; Arlan <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f44a-1f3fe.png" alt="👊🏾" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@ArlanWasHere) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArlanWasHere/status/1371323662058409984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 15, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>“The way it starts is not by a normal person doing it,” Lavingia said. “It’s by someone who is at the tip of the spear, someone who has an interesting angle, and then it gets sort of democratized over time.”</p>
<p>The fact that a founder turned part-time venture capitalist is using crowdfunding to raise money for his own company is a meta headache on its own. But the founder sees this as an opportunity to make crowdfunding mainstream and an attractive asset class.</p>
<p>Long-term, a public crowdfunding round in startups could be just a small drop in a startup’s financing pre-exit, but one that could empower thousands of normal people to own startup equity for the first time.</p>
<p>“I’m basically trying to become a private-market Chamath,” he said, referring to the billionaire behind Social Capital credited with the recent boom in popularity around SPACs. “I want to build a huge brand associated with investing in private equities, startups, and having an army of people that I can use and wield in different ways.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every once in a meme-ified blue moon, the wildly irrational cryptocurrency ecosystem gives birth to something that might outlive the hype.</p>
<p>The crypto art hype may be silly and expensive, but it might also empower artists from <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkd83y/people-are-spending-millions-on-jpegs-tweets-and-other-crypto-collectibles">emerging economies</a> and <a href="https://thedefiant.io/destigmatizing-the-blockchain-sex-workers-in-nft-cryptoart/">underrepresented groups</a> to access the global art market in ways that they couldn&#8217;t before.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1367990471759306752?s=20">March 5</a>, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey auctioned off a blockchain receipt, called a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/27/if-you-havent-followed-nfts-heres-why-you-should-start/">nonfungible token</a> (NFT), for a screenshot of his first tweet in 2006, and bids for it promptly exceeded <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/07/tech/jack-dorsey-nft-twitter/index.html">$2.5 million</a>. Since 2018, people have spent roughly <a href="https://cryptoart.io/data">$237 million </a>on NFTs, with the vast majority of those funds spent since the trend exploded in January 2021.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The crypto art hype may be silly and expensive, but it might also empower artists from emerging economies and underrepresented groups to access the global art market in ways that they couldn&#8217;t before.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Bryana Kortendick, VP of operations and communications at the NFT startup <a href="https://enjin.io/">Enjin</a>, said the platform and corresponding NFT wallet’s growth is up 100% since December 2020, now tallying more than 47,426 registered users. Her company was funded by a <a href="https://blog.enjincoin.io/enjin-coin-ico-is-a-massive-success-75-000-eth-raised-with-18-500-contributions-b757bd65c0c5">token sale in 2017</a> that amassed 75,041 ether (ETH), worth more than $130 million today. Kortendick declined to comment on how the cryptocurrency treasury is managed, other than to say they have enough runway for the startup’s continued growth because “Enjin has retained a portion of the funds raised through our ICO in ETH.”</p>
<p>As of 2021, Kortendick said the wallet app’s fastest-growing markets include the United States, Korea, the United Kingdom, Iran, Germany, Canada, India, Indonesia, Turkey and Australia. In sanctioned countries like Cuba, Iran and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkd83y/people-are-spending-millions-on-jpegs-tweets-and-other-crypto-collectibles">Venezuela</a>, NFTs provide one of the only ways for up-and-coming artists to transact with global art collectors. It can also be a way for <a href="https://twitter.com/enjin/status/1358395608269258753">dancers </a>to make money by selling NFTs with GIFs showcasing <a href="https://www.beautyinthestreetz.com/">specific moves</a> or NFTs that allow video game characters to dance a specific move.</p>
<p>“There has been an influx of new [app] users in countries like Iran, and we are working to localize the app accordingly to make it more accessible for these growing markets,” Kortendick said. “We recently saw a surge of [web] users in Cuba too, which prompted us to translate our entire website into Spanish.”</p>
<h2>A new world coming under compliance</h2>
<p>It remains to be seen if that type of market activity is sustainable, with regard to compliance across jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/recent-actions/20201230_33">penalized</a> the crypto company BitGo in 2020 for allowing users to transact with people in sanctioned countries. Maintaining financial sanctions appears to be one of the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/how-the-biden-administration-is-approaching-crypto-regulations/"> regulator&#8217;s priorities</a> in 2021. In any case, companies can <a href="https://decrypt.co/59635/wheres-the-trust-in-the-150-million-nft-art-market">delist</a> artists and pieces, which means anyone who isn’t fluent in command-line Ethereum tricks can <a href="https://twitter.com/neitherconfirm/status/1369285946198396928">lose access</a> to their NFTs. It will still exist “on the blockchain,” yet it would be quite a stretch to call NFTs “<a href="https://mashable.com/article/nft-explainer-what-are-non-fungible-tokens/">permissionless</a>” art, as many blockchain advocates do.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amid growing competition from Twitter Spaces and other newcomers, popular social audio startup Clubhouse is making a move aimed at seeding its network with more high-quality content: It&#8217;s <a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/creator-first-accelerator">launching an accelerator program</a>. During its weekly town hall event on Sunday, the company detailed its plans for its inaugural accelerator called &#8220;Clubhouse Creator First,&#8221; which will initially help around 20 creators get their shows off the ground. To do so, Clubhouse said it will provide creators with anything they need to get started &#8212; whether that&#8217;s equipment like an iPhone, AirPods or an <a href="https://janoschtroehler.medium.com/how-i-get-audio-from-my-computer-into-clubhouse-2af74c7dc317">iRig</a>, promotional support or help with booking guests, or even a babysitter. Most importantly, Clubhouse is promising the participating creators an income of some sort.</p>
<p>During the town hall, Clubhouse CEO Paul Davison explained that a core part of the accelerator experience will be to help creators get paid for their work. In order to make this happen, Clubhouse will match the creator with a brand sponsor, he said &#8212; something the company believes will be possible because brands are already reaching out to Clubhouse, looking for opportunities to get involved.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today’s Town Hall Updates:<br />We are launching our first creator accelerator program, Clubhouse Creator First. We are looking to support and equip 20 creators w/ resources they need to bring their ideas and creativity to life. Details and application here: <a href="https://t.co/kmKjQvoUBK">https://t.co/kmKjQvoUBK</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Clubhouse (@joinClubhouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/joinClubhouse/status/1371152823631577089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 14, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In the case that Clubhouse can&#8217;t find a brand sponsor for a particular show, the company will just guarantee a basic income of $5,000 per month during the three months the creator is participating in the program.</p>
<p>Presumably, this cushion could help people transition from other projects to focus on their Clubhouse show instead, while also giving them time to grow their audience and form the brand relationships that could sustain their shows longer term.</p>
<p>Clubhouse will also play a hands-on role in helping to develop the shows from the accelerator&#8217;s participants, we understand.</p>
<p>Already, the Andreessen Horowitz-backed social audio app has aided in the success of one of its more popular tech programs, <a href="https://www.thegoodtimeshow.club/">The Good Time Show</a><em>,</em> co-hosted by the VC firm&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/social-platform-veteran-sriram-krishnan-is-andreessen-horowitzs-latest-general-partner/">latest general partner</a>, Sriram Krishnan. His program has regularly featured guests and co-hosts either investing with the firm or connected to it somehow, and has been responsible for some of Clubhouse&#8217;s biggest celeb guests &#8212; like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/31/elon-musk-goes-live-on-clubhouse-but-with-the-room-full-fans-stream-audio-on-youtube/">Elon Musk</a> and Mark Zuckerberg, for example.</p>
<p>That formula could be repeatable, it seems. As Davison noted during the town hall, the company will work on matching creators with guests for their shows. In other words, it&#8217;s helping produce.</p>
<p>Davison also said Clubhouse will offer directed feedback to the accelerator&#8217;s participants, including its opinion on what works and what doesn&#8217;t, and other &#8220;deep dive concept development.&#8221; When the creators&#8217; shows are ready to launch, Clubhouse will then connect them with creative services to help design promotional materials to market the shows outside of the social app. It may even give the creators invites they can dole out to potential listeners to help them build up the show&#8217;s initial audience, if need be.</p>
<p>Of course, Clubhouse has been doing some of this kind of work behind the scenes before today, but the accelerator both formalizes the arrangement and devotes dedicated resources to a larger handful of promising creators.</p>
<p>But it also puts Clubhouse in a potentially precarious position with regard to its still underdeveloped moderation practices.</p>
<p>Brands are typically hesitant to associate themselves with problematic or toxic content and will pull out of creator deals and relationships if they find that to be the case. In the past, content moderation failures have led to advertisers&#8217; exodus from top social platforms &#8212; like the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/27/youtube-faces-brand-freeze-over-ads-and-obscene-comments-on-videos-of-kids/">YouTube brand freeze a few years ago over obscene comments</a>, which necessitated a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/01/youtube-bans-hateful-videos-from-making-money-via-its-advertising-network/">cleanup of the videos allowed on the YouTube ad network.</a> And last year, Facebook faced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/07/facebook-ad-boycott-rashad-robinson-interview-color-change">its largest corporate boycott to date</a> when brands<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/07/facebook-ad-boycott-rashad-robinson-interview-color-change"> protested the company&#8217;s failures</a> to properly prevent the spread of hate speech and misinformation on its platform.</p>
<p>Though small by comparison &#8212; the app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/13/this-week-in-apps-parler-denied-app-store-re-entry-walmart-doubles-down-on-tiktok-live-shopping-instagram-lite-rolls-out-worldwide/">now has 12 million global downloads</a>, App Annie says &#8212; Clubhouse has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-clubhouse-moderation/from-clubhouse-to-twitter-spaces-social-media-grapples-with-live-audio-moderation-idUKKBN2AP1J2">already been called out for allowing</a> misogyny, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495419/clubhouse-conversation-antisemitism-content-moderation">anti-Semitism</a> and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3vkde/clubhouse-app-misinformation-problem">COVID-19 misinformation</a> on the platform, despite rules against prohibiting this content. It&#8217;s also allowed for verbal abuse, with some users still being name-called or harassed in Clubhouse rooms. (We&#8217;ve heard these stories from users directly but will not name names without permission.).</p>
<p>More recently, there&#8217;s been growing concern about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQeod1vuTuk">scam artists</a> taking over Clubhouse and <a href="https://gritdaily.com/clubhouse-is-a-haven-for-self-help-content-but-with-a-toxic-catch/">the lack of accountability</a> for what&#8217;s being said. Many so-called &#8220;experts&#8221; are happy to go on the app to dole out advice, but when they wade into territory like mental health, they can spread harmful misinformation that can really hurt people.</p>
<p>All these things could potentially catch up to Clubhouse in a big way in the months to come, if the company can&#8217;t figure out a better moderation strategy to weed out the bad actors and keep the platform brand-safe.</p>
<p>Starting today, the company is allowing interested creators to <a href="https://creatorfirst.joinclubhouse.com/">apply for Clubhouse Creator First</a>. The deadline to apply is March 31, 2021.</p>

<p>The new accelerator program was one of several town hall announcements on Sunday.</p>
<p>The company also announced it has hired Netflix, OWN and Harpo Productions alum <a href="https://twitter.com/mayawatson/status/1371133952321150980">Maya Watson</a> as its new head of global marketing, and it detailed several new product updates.</p>
<p>Among those, users will now be able to invite people to the app by phone number alone, instead of having to upload their entire address book. It also now allows users to share links that point to their user profile or Club page and will now better remember a user&#8217;s language preferences when displaying its list of rooms, among other things.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kelauni Jasmyn, general partner at the new <a href="http://btn.vc">Black Tech Nation Ventures</a>, can explain her aims for the new firm quite succinctly: “The goal is to get more Black people funded.”</p>
<p>That’s something Jasmyn has been working on already with <a href="https://blacktechnation.com">Black Tech Nation</a>, a Pittsburgh-based organization that supports Black entrepreneurs with education, content, community and more. Now she’s tackling the funding size of the equation more directly by raising a $50 million first fund with her fellow GPs Sean Sebastian and David Motley.</p>
<p>“We’re really at the beginning of something brand new, that I think will be historic and offer a literal economic shift for the Black community in building generational wealth,” Jasmyn said. “We get to be the ones who mold the foundation of that.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sebastian is a partner at Birchmere Ventures, a seed fund also based in Pittsburgh, while Motley is co-founder of BlueTree Venture Fund and African American Directors Forum. Sebastian also suggested that he and Motley are involved partly to enable a “transfer of knowledge” that will empower a new generation of Black investors, starting with Jasmyn.</p>
<p>Motley, meanwhile, suggested that this is an effort to take “take the Black Tech Nation platform and combine it with the Birchmere platform.” He recalled speaking to Jasmyn for the first time at Sebastian’s urging and immediately responding, “Sean, this is the real deal.”</p>
<p>All three of BTNV’s partners emphasized that while the fund has a social mission, they’re also focused on financial returns.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zLwOC6gKH1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/investors-are-missing-out-on-black-founders/">Investors are missing out on Black founders</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Investors are missing out on Black founders&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/investors-are-missing-out-on-black-founders/embed/#?secret=zLwOC6gKH1" data-secret="zLwOC6gKH1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“We are no different than any other fund just because you put a specific community around it,” Jasmyn said. “You shouldn’t expect any less valuable returns. We just happen to have the advantage of untapped potential.”</p>
<p>The fund will make seed and Series A investments, and Motley said they’re focused on software startups — which could be software as a service, B2B or B2B2C. These ideas can be pre-revenue and even pre-product, but they need to be “scalable and lend themselves to significant value creation.”</p>
<p>Sebastian added that although BTVN is based in Pittsburgh, they’ll look at investments across the country, particularly entrepreneurs that come from outside Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>I wondered whether the fund’s financial goals could, at times, conflict with the more inclusive approach of Black Tech Nation, but the partners<span class="Apple-converted-space"> countered</span> that the for-profit fund and nonprofit organization can actually complement each other. Motley said that Black Tech Nation “gives us more opportunities to say yes,” while Jasmyn suggested that if the venture fund has to turn someone down, she can still tell them, “Scoot over across the street [to Black Tech Nation] and maybe we can revisit this another time.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://fondeadora.com">Fondeadora</a>, a fintech startup based in Mexico City and building a challenger bank, has extended its Series A funding round. I covered the company’s original round <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/fondeadora-is-a-mexican-challenger-bank-that-just-raised-14-million/">back in August 2020</a>. And now, Fondeadora is adding $14 million on top of the original $14 million it had already raised — it now represents a $28 million funding round.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.p3vc.com">Portag3</a> is investing in the extension. Google’s Gradient Ventures, an existing investor in the company, is putting more money in Fondeadora. Gokul Rajaram and Anatol von Hahn are investing as business angels as well.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Y Combinator, Scott Belsky, Sound Ventures, Fintech Collective and Ignia also participated in the first tranche of the Series A.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We received an unsolicited and unexpected term sheet three months after our Series A,” co-founder and co-CEO Norman Müller told me. The company’s valuation has doubled with the round extension as well.</p>

<p>As most people still rely heavily on cash in Mexico, creating a challenger bank represents a good opportunity. In addition to customers from legacy banks, Fondeadora can become the first bank account for many people.</p>
<p>Fondeadora doesn’t operate any branch for its banking service. When you create an account, you receive a Mastercard debit card a few days later. There are no monthly subscription fee and no foreign transaction fee.</p>
<p>Like other challenger banks, your balance is updated instantly. You can choose to receive push notifications for transactions. You can also lock and unlock your card from the app.</p>
<p>More recently, the company launched a card without any personal info or card numbers — a bit like <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2019/03/25/apple-introduces-its-own-credit-card-the-apple-card/">the Apple card</a> in the U.S. On the back of the card, you can find a QR code. This way, you can show your card to your friends. They scan the code and you receive money a few seconds later.</p>
<p>Venmo launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/venmo-launches-its-first-credit-card-offering-up-to-3-cash-back-personalized-rewards/">credit card with a QR code</a> in the U.S. as well. I think challenger banks and peer-to-peer payment apps around the world should all do this as it’s a great bridge between the physical world and an app.</p>
<p>Fondeadora acquired a bank charter and now has plenty of money on its bank account. It sounds like things are working well so far and proves once again that banking is not a global industry. There&#8217;s room for plenty of local players around the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">From distributed homes in Cambridge, Mass. and Cambridge, England, <a href="https://inbalanceresearch.com/our-team">inBalance Research</a> is joining Y Combinator as it looks to accelerate its business as the oracle for independent energy providers, utilities and market makers.</p>
<p>Selling a service it calls Delphi, the very early-stage startup is hoping to provide analysis for power producers and utilities on the demand forecasts of energy markets.</p>
<p>The orchestration of energy load across the grid has become a more pressing issue for utilities around the country after witnessing the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/severe-weather-blackouts-shows-the-grids-biggest-problem-is-infrastructure-not-renewables/">disastrous collapse of Texas&#8217; power grid</a> in response to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/no-place-is-safe-from-failing-u-s-infrastructure/">second &#8220;once-in-a-century&#8221; storm in the last decade</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YduHkmiLLF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/no-place-is-safe-from-failing-u-s-infrastructure/">No place is safe from failing US infrastructure</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;No place is safe from failing US infrastructure&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/no-place-is-safe-from-failing-u-s-infrastructure/embed/#?secret=YduHkmiLLF" data-secret="YduHkmiLLF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If we want to address the solution long term, it’s a two-part solution,&#8221; said inBalance co-founder and chief executive, Thomas Marge. &#8220;It’s a combination of hardware and software. You need the right assets online and you need the right software that can ensure that markets operate when there are extreme market shocks.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prices for electricity change every 15 minutes, and sometimes those pries can fluctuate wildly. In some places, even without the weather conditions that demolished the Texas grid and drove some companies out of business, prices can double in a matter of hours, according to inBalance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s what makes forecasting tools important, the company said. As prices spike, asset managers of finite responsive resources such as hydro and storage need to decide if they will offer more value to the market now or later. Coming online too early or too late will decrease the revenue for their clean generation and increase peak prices for consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The situation is even worse, according to the company, if storage and intermittent renewables come online at the same time. That can create downward price pressure for both the storage and renewable assets, which, in turn, can lead to increased fossil fuel generation later the same day, once cleaner sources are depleted.</span></p>
<p>The software to predict those pressures is what inBalance claims to provide. Marge and his fellow co-founders, Rajan Troll and Edwin Fennell have always been interested in the problems associated with big data and energy.</p>
<p>For Marge, that began when he worked on a project to optimize operations for wind farms during a stint in Lexington, Mass.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fundamentally we’re a data-science solution,&#8221; said Marge. &#8220;It’s a combination of knowing what factors influence every single asset on every single market in North America. We have a glimpse into how those assets are going to be working one day before to one hour before in order to do price forecasting.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>So far, one utility using the company&#8217;s software in the Northeast has managed to curb its emissions by 0.2%. With a focus on renewables, inBalance is hoping to roll out larger reductions to the 3,000 market participants that are also using its forecasting tools for other services. Another application is in the work inBalance is conducting with a gas peaker plant to help offset the intermittency of renewable generation sources.</p>
<p>The reduction in emissions in New England is particularly impressive given that the company only began working with the utility there in December. Given its forecasting tools, the company is able to provide a window into which assets might be most valuable at what time &#8212; including, potentially, natural gas peaking plants, hydropower, pumped hydropower (basically an energy storage technology), battery or flywheel energy storage projects and demand response technologies that encourage businesses and consumers to reduce consumption in response to price signals, Marge said.</p>
<p>Already, six companies have taken a trip to see the Delphi software and come away as early users. They include a global renewable asset manager and one of the top 10 largest utilities in the U.S., according to Marge.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We use machine learning to accurately forecast electricity prices from terabytes of public and proprietary data. The solution required for daily power system stability is both hardware — like storage and electric vehicle charging — and the software required to optimally use it. inBalance exists to be that software solution,&#8221; the company said in a statement. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Let's explore both companies' pricing intervals through our usual lens of revenue multiples, market comps and general sass.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s a busy day in IPO-land: Olo has raised its IPO range and DigitalOcean is giving us a first look at what it may be worth when it debuts.</p>
<p>That Olo raised its IPO price is not a huge surprise, given the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/understanding-toasts-expected-ipo-through-the-lens-of-olos-2020-results/">software company&#8217;s rapid growth and profits</a>. In the case of DigitalOcean, we have more work to do as its approach to growth is a bit different.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s explore both companies&#8217; pricing intervals through our usual lens of revenue multiples, market comps and general <del>SaaS</del> sass. We&#8217;ll do this in alphabetical order, which puts the cloud infra company up first.</p>
<h2>DigitalOcean&#8217;s IPO price range</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1582961/000119312521080474/d898181ds1a.htm#rom898181_14">its S-1/A filing</a>, DigitalOcean expects its IPO to price between $44 and $47 per share. The price range is a coup for the company&#8217;s private investors, who as recently as the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/digitalocean-raises-50m-more-from-access-industries-and-a16z/">2020 Series C</a> paid about $10.59 each for the company&#8217;s shares. Andreessen Horowitz is going to do very well, having led the company&#8217;s Series A at a per-share price of just more than $2. IA Ventures, which led DigitalOcean&#8217;s seed round, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/digitalocean-seed--7e3b8e35">according to Crunchbase</a>, paid just $0.26 per share back in the 2012-2013 time frame. That&#8217;s going to convert well.</p>
<p>In valuation terms, the company&#8217;s simple share count post-IPO will be 105,303,340, or 107,778,340 if its underwriters purchase their option. At $44 to $47 per share, DigitalOcean is worth $4.72 billion to $5.07 billion, including shares designated for its underwriters.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s fully diluted valuation is higher. At midpoint, Renaissance Capital estimates DigitalOcean&#8217;s diluted valuation is $5.6 billion. That works out to a little under $5.8 billion at $47 per share.</p>
<p>Taking a look at DigitalOcean&#8217;s Q4 2020 revenue of $87.5 million, the company closed last year on a run rate of $350 million. Or a revenue multiple of 14.5x at the upper end of its nondiluted valuation, and around 16.5x at the upper bound of its diluted worth.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You might think that Clubhouse is the final word on audio-centric social networks, but a San Francisco startup called <a href="https://swell.life/">Swell</a> is launching its own iOS and Android app focused on voice conversations.</p>
<p>The big difference: While conversations on Clubhouse all happen in real time — meaning that you’ve got to listen live or miss it all (at least for now) — Swell is focused on asynchronous comments. In other words, users post a standalone audio clip that can be up to five minutes in length (with an accompanying image and links), then other users can browse, listen and leave their own audio responses in their own time.</p>
<p>Swell supports audio-only group chats and private conversations, as well as public &#8220;Swellcasts&#8221; — think of a bite-sized podcast, or a Clubhouse-style conversation that’s structured more like a comment thread than a free-for-all. Users can also promote their public posts through their own pages on <a href="https://swellcast.com/">the Swellcast website</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Swell is led by husband-and-wife team Sudha Varadarajan and Arish Ali, who previously founded e-commerce company Skava and sold it to Infosys.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/pXHEgfTJjn4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Varadarajan (the startup’s CEO) described the app as an attempt to “democratize” audio content creation, with no special equipment or serious production required, and allowing users to talk about anything. (In one example, the Swellcaster was outside talking about their front lawn.)</p>
<p>At the same time, she suggested that the app was created less as a response to Clubhouse and more as a general antidote to social media, where the pair saw increasing polarization and fewer genuine conversations.</p>
<p>Audio is hardly immune to ranting and anger — just look at talk radio. But Varadarajan suggested that making the posts asynchronous doesn’t just make it easier for listeners to catch up; it also improves the quality of the conversation: “People really think about what they’re going to say.”</p>
<p>She added that the company is determined to avoid any ad-based business models and instead make money by charging for premium tools and Swellcasts.</p>
<p>Until now, Swell has only been open to a small group of users. Today it’s launching more broadly, in advance of its session tomorrow at the virtual SXSW, “<a href="https://swellcast.com/sxsw2021">Voice is transforming our online presence. Why?</a>”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For modern cars, the standalone, photo-frame-like display in the center of the dashboard has become something of a default. But with its next-generation iDrive 8 system, BMW is moving away from this design language by introducing what it calls the &#8220;BMW Curved Display,&#8221; which takes this idea to the next level by expanding that center display all the way through the cockpit. It&#8217;s actually still two screens, the 12.3-inch information display and 14.9-inch control display, but it looks like a single curved display that BMW describes as giving an &#8220;appearance of almost floating.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new curved display with the new iDrive 8 system will debut in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/bmw-announces-the-ix-its-next-gen-electric-flagship/">upcoming all-electric iX</a> and i4, which should arrive later this year.</p>
<p>While the company isn&#8217;t sharing any details about the underlying technology stack just yet, BMW is willing to say that its new stack is able to process 20 to 30 times more data than the previous system. The company plans to share more details about the stack after July, Frank Weber, BMW&#8217;s head of development, told me during a press roundtable earlier today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company provided a first glimpse of the new layout when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/bmw-announces-the-ix-its-next-gen-electric-flagship/">announced the iX last November</a>, but at the time, it didn&#8217;t provide any details about the new iDrive system. At the core of it is, unsurprisingly, a wholesale redesign of the user interface. Drivers will be able to choose between different layouts, for example. There&#8217;s a standard &#8220;Drive&#8221; layout, which will feature &#8220;a dynamically changing area in the center of the information display to show individually selectable information.&#8221; There&#8217;s also a &#8220;focus&#8221; mode for &#8220;dynamic driving situations,&#8221; a &#8220;gallery&#8221; layout that minimizes driving info in favor of other widgets from apps like your media source and, for when you just want to drive and be left in peace, a &#8220;calm&#8221; mode that only shows your vehicle speed in the center of the information display, and virtually nothing else.</p>

<p>There also are three different driving modes: efficient, sport and personal, which allows you to change some of the core driving experience settings like engine throttle, steering characteristics and chassis settings, as well as the audio characteristics of the car.</p>
<p>For maps, which are probably still the most often used app in any car, there are also three different modes (adaptive, reduced and expanded), all going back to the central idea that the drivers should be able to decide how much information they want to see.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of personalization options and Weber acknowledged as much, but he also argues that the company has made them easy to use so that they don&#8217;t overwhelm the driver &#8212; and that a lot of drivers really want this functionality.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you test our system in China, you cannot do enough for personalization, they almost want to personalize everything,&#8221; Weber explained. &#8220;And then there are other people who say: I just want to drive my vehicle, I don&#8217;t want to see any of that. Therefore, what we did is, we have included a &#8216;My Mode&#8217; function &#8212; a very simple surface in the vehicle. When you push My Mode, you find Sport and you find Efficiency and you find Personal here. And there, it is very easy to almost say &#8216;Do I want something that is very reduced? Or do I want something that has all the possibilities of personalization?&#8217; There are very artful things that we have included in here. And there are very simple choices.&#8221;</p>

<p>And talking about personalization, with the BMW ID, the company now offers a new system for saving those personalized settings on your smartphone and the new My BMW app.</p>

<p>With this update, BMW is also launching the next generation of its BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant, which made its debut <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/06/bmw-launches-a-personal-voice-assistant-for-its-cars/">at TechCrunch Disrupt a few years ago</a>. Built on top of Microsoft&#8217;s Azure Cognitive Services, the improved in-car assistant will get better at interacting with drivers through a more natural dialog, but in addition to voice interactions, BMW is now also adding more visual components and integrating the assistant with its gesture recognition capabilities. We&#8217;ll have to see this in action to see how this works in practice. So far, BMW hasn&#8217;t shared a lot of details about these features.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125122" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415766_highRes__4152021.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125122" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2125122" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415766_highRes__4152021.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415766_highRes__4152021.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415766_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415766_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415766_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415766_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415766_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415766_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415766_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2125122" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;In communication between people, a great deal of information is conveyed nonverbally,&#8221; the company explains. &#8220;The BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant has thus been upgraded with a greater focus on how it is presented visually. This new visualization approach features spheres of light in differing sizes and brightness levels, giving the assistant more space and new ways of expressing itself. This visual image also gives it a “face” with a clearly visible point of focus and identifiable states of activity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like with the iDrive 7 system, this new operation system will also support remote software upgrades, either over the air thanks to the car&#8217;s built-in SIM card and cell connectivity (up to 5G for the iX) or through the My BMW app.</p>
<p>As for current cars with the iDrive 7, Weber noted that those cars will get some of the features from iDrive 8 that can be ported back to it &#8212; and iDrive 7 will continue to get updates as well.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125165" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415517_highRes__4152021.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125165" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2125165" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415517_highRes__4152021.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415517_highRes__4152021.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415517_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415517_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415517_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415517_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415517_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415517_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/P90415517_highRes__4152021.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2125165" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little bit like in the smartphone world,&#8221; Weber said. &#8220;All the things &#8212; and the good and interesting new things from iD8 that can be transferred to iD7, iD7 we&#8217;ll get those upgrades. But like a particular function on a phone, not all of them can be transferred back to the previous generation. So most of it can be transferred, but not all of them. But certainly, we will continue to work on updating the previous generation. We won&#8217;t stop that.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a side note, Weber also addressed the current chip shortage that has led some car manufacturers to slow down production. He noted that since about Christmas, BMW is &#8220;fighting for every single production day&#8221; but hasn&#8217;t lost one yet. He wasn&#8217;t willing to make any forecasts, but noted that the company has started to develop alternative solutions on the engineering side. &#8220;So far, we are really able and capable of adjusting our pipeline, so that we didn&#8217;t have to stop any production at this point,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Hi friends and new readers, welcome back to The Station, a newsletter dedicated to all the present and future ways people and packages move from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>I changed things up this week to make room for an interview we had with Mike Lelli, senior manager of advanced battery cell technology over at GM. That means I don&#8217;t have the typical roundup at the bottom of EVERYTHING, or most things, that happened this week. But don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll bring that back next issue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You might recall, or maybe not, that GM president Mark Reuss announced last week a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/gm-partners-with-startup-solidenergy-systems-to-pack-more-energy-in-its-batteries/">partnership with SolidEnergy Systems</a>, an MIT spinoff. GM and SES plan to work together to improve the energy density of lithium-ion batteries. The companies are going to build a prototyping facility in Woburn, Massachusetts and aim to have a high-capacity, pre-production battery by 2023.</p>
<p>As one reader pointed out to me, the partnership is an interesting next step in GM&#8217;s interest in SES. Five years ago, GM Ventures, the VC arm of the automaker, invested in SES. <a href="https://www.ses.ai/about/">Rohit Makharia,</a> a longtime engineer turned investment manager at GM Ventures, is now the COO at SES. In other words, this isn&#8217;t some casual relationship.</p>
<p>Scroll below for a Q&amp;A with Lelli.</p>
<p>Email me at <a href="mailto:kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com">kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com</a> to share thoughts, criticisms, offer up opinions or tips. You can also send a direct message to me at Twitter — <a href="https://twitter.com/kirstenkorosec">@kirstenkorosec</a>.</p>
<h2>Q&amp;A: GM&#8217;s battery plans</h2>

<p>After the partnership between GM and SolidEnergy Systems was announced, we (meaning me and TC reporter Rebecca Bellan) jumped on the phone with Mike Lelli, senior manager of advanced battery cell technology at GM, to try and learn about about the automaker&#8217;s battery plans.</p>
<p>Specifically, we wanted to find out if SES was going to be providing the tech for the next generation of Ultium batteries. I&#8217;m not talking about the first generation of Ultium batteries that are going in the upcoming GMC Hummer. We&#8217;re talking next generation. We also wanted to learn more about GM&#8217;s approach to battery development.</p>
<p>The interview with Lelli was edited for clarity and brevity.</p>
<p><b>TECHCRUNCH: </b>You’ve said that GM is trying to increase energy twofold and reduce the cost of batteries by 60%. So are you aiming to work directly with SolidEnergy Systems on building the next generation of Ultium batteries?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LELLI</strong>: The SolidEnergy Systems arrangement includes building a prototype line in Massachusetts. So, this new technology will be built on that line.</span></p>
<p><b>TECHCRUNCH</b>: Are you looking at any other battery tech startups to help speed R&amp;D along?</p>
<p><strong>LELLI</strong>: I would just say, stay tuned on that; we have a lot more to announce in the future. In the meantime, work is continuing on lithium-metal batteries and other related technologies at our R&amp;D lab. We&#8217;re working on many different technologies at this point, including high voltage cathode, electrolytes, dry processing, battery raw materials etc.</p>
<p><b>TECHCRUNCH</b>: GM already has a lot of critical IP in the space of lithium metal batteries. How is SES filling in the gaps?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LELLI</strong>: Well they have strengths and we have strengths and that&#8217;s the beauty of this arrangement. SolidEnergy Systems</span> is a very innovative technology company and they offer many novel ideas around lithium metal anode technology, and manufacturing and, of course, we do as well. That&#8217;s where their strength is.</p>
<p>They also have a strength in electrolytes, but we have a strength in electrolytes as well and we have IP around electrolytes that we think could be an enabler to this technology. We have 49 patents and over 45 pending in this lithium metal space, so we&#8217;ve been working on it for a while. This isn&#8217;t something that we&#8217;ve thought about, you know, a year ago and saying, &#8216;hey what are we going to do next?&#8217; This is stuff we&#8217;ve been working on for quite some time.</p>
<p><b>TECHCRUNCH</b>: How is GM thinking about pushing for reductions in nickel and cobalt? Is that a priority?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LELLI</strong>: When we came out with the event last year on the Ultium battery, we were very focused on the precious metals. And you may remember that we commented </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that our cathode would be NCMA &#8212; nickel, cobalt, manganese, aluminum. We said that technology we were taking on because it was able to reduce cobalt by over 70%, and we’re able to do that by building a cathode with aluminum. </span></p>
<p>We&#8217;re always focused on these raw materials and reducing high-cost materials and materials that are hard to get. That&#8217;s part of my group&#8217;s job; my group is responsible for the technology roadmap relative to all these different spaces within the cell: the cathode active material, separator, electrolyte, anode material, the different ways to process the cathode in manufacturing —  right now we have a wet process and if we can get dry to work, it&#8217;ll be less expensive. We work in all of these spaces simultaneously to reduce costs.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The beauty with the SolidEnergy arrangement is that we can put any of those cathodes that we develop and we can tie that to the lithium metal anode. The key work we&#8217;re doing with SolidEnergy is getting the lithium anode technology to work, and then we can, at some point in time, continue to change the cathode part of that cell for further cost reduction and less reliance on some of these critical battery materials out there.</span></p>
<p><b>TECHCRUNCH</b>: The work around the anode is really the key to unlocking that energy density, is my understanding. Are there any other benefits?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LELLI</strong>: Equally important is the electrolyte. Because the electrolyte is not just a commodity where you can buy it and put it in. It has the electrochemistry and the kinetic of electrochemistry in the cell are very dependent on the electrolyte. </span></p>
<p>And so the life of a cell will be very dependent on what electrolyte — and the electrochemistry behind that electrolyte — and how it reacts with the materials you&#8217;re using, like lithium.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lithium gives us energy density, but then you also have to design a cell that lasts many cycles, and so to do that you have to understand all the other parts and pieces of the cell that enable that. An </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">electrolyte is an extremely critical part of that. </span></p>
<p><b>TECHCRUNCH</b>: Is SES only working with GM or is it working with other automakers or clients?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LELLI</strong>: SolidEnergy Systems can work with other OEMs and, of course, we can work with other technologies. We&#8217;re not restricting SolidEnergy Systems in any way.</span></p>
<p><b>TECHCRUNCH</b>: What are you expecting the range to be for the next generation of Ultium batteries?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>LELLI</strong>: It&#8217;s conceivable that the range of our production in lithium metal batteries could be as high as 500 to 600 miles, but that really depends on the car you’re putting it into. If you put the same battery in a truck, it&#8217;s not going to have the range that if we took that same battery and put it in a small car. It really depends on the product you&#8217;re putting the battery in to answer that question, but to give you a frame of reference, 500 to 600 miles is conceivable.</span></p>
<p><b>TECHCRUNCH</b>: Has GM identified which vehicles will receive the first generation Ultium battery, besides the GMC Hummer?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cadillac Lyriq and the Cruise Origin will be among the first. </span></p>

<p>Earlier this year, I predicted that Via was going to have a big year; I was right. The on-demand shuttle startup turned mobility-as-a-service provider has been expanding, snapping up contracts with cities globally. And now it&#8217;s expanding through acquisitions.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/via-buys-mapping-startup-remix-for-100-million/">bought Remix</a>, the startup that developed mapping software used by cities for transportation planning and street design, for $100 million in cash and equity. Remix will become a subsidiary of Via, an arrangement that will let the startup maintain its independent brand. Remix’s 65 employees and two of its co-founders — CEO Tiffany Chu and CTO Dan Getelman — will stay on.</p>
<p>Remix’s strength is in planning, while Via brings expertise in software and operations. The acquisition should nicely rounded out Via&#8217;s current business and help it capture more customers, which currently number more than 350 local governments in 22 countries.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not so sure that Via is done. I expect more deal making — maybe even a bid to go public — by this company that last year hit a $2.25 billion valuation after raising $400 million in a Series E round.</p>
<p><b>Other deals that got my attention &#8230; </b></p>
<p><b>Damon Motors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the electric motorcycle company, raised more than $30M in funding, completing a bridge round led by Benevolent Capital, SOL Global Investments, Zirmania, and others.</span></p>
<p><strong>FlexClub</strong>, the South African-based car subscription startup founded in 2019,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/south-africas-flexclub-adds-5m-to-seed-round-to-scale-its-car-subscription-marketplace/"> raised $5 million</a> in equity and debt. This is a seed extension round, bringing the total investment raised by FlexClub to over $6 million. The company recently expanded to Mexico.</p>
<p><b>Optibus</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the transit-focused software-as-service company based in Israel,</span><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/03/10/optibus-launches-new-ai-platform-to-help-cities-plan-transit-routes/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">raised a $107 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a Series C round co-led by Bessemer Venture Partners and Insight Partners.</span></p>
<p><strong>Populus AI</strong>, a San Francisco-based startup founded in 2017, has<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/populus-ai-plots-expansion-with-5m-in-new-funding/"> raised $5 million</a> from new investors Storm Ventures and contract manufacturing and supplier company Magna along with existing backers Precursor, Relay Ventures and Ulu Ventures. The company has raised nearly $9 million to date.</p>
<p><strong>Zego</strong>, the insurtech that got its start by offering flexible motorbike insurance for gig economy workers, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/zego-unicorn/">raised $150 million</a>. DST Global led the London-based company&#8217;s C round, which gave it a $1.1 billion valuation and a unicorn status.  Other new backers include General Catalyst, whose founder and MD, Joel Cutler, joins Zego&#8217;s board. Zego has since expanded its business to offer a range of tech-enabled commercial motor insurance products.</p>
<h2>A deep dive: the Volkswagen ID. 4</h2>

<p>I recently brought on Abigail Bassett, a World Car Juror and longtime journalist who writes about cars and tech (among other topics) to review some of the most important vehicles of 2021. Last month, Tamara Warren (another longtime reporter in autos and tech) reviewed the Aston Martin DBX, a vehicle that is critical to the automaker&#8217;s survival.</p>
<p>This month, Bassett takes a deep dive into the Volkswagen ID. 4, a five-passenger, fully electric crossover with a starting price of $33,995 (before federal or state incentives).</p>
<p>The ID. 4 matters. A lot. Volkswagen, once a dabbler in electric vehicles, is now betting its future on the technology.</p>
<p>Did the ID.4 make the grade? Bassett tested it on three different occasions. I suggest you read the whole article, but for those busy folks here is the tl;dr: The VW ID.4 offers a balanced blend of technology, comfort and design for a more affordable price. It offers solid technology without being so out of this world that your average crossover buyer will balk &#8230; with one exception. The lack of seamless charging makes finding and then connecting to a third-party charging station a clunky, even complex experience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A ban by Amsterdam authorities on housing owners offering their properties for vacation rentals in three central districts of the popular tourist city has been overturned after a court ruled it has no basis in law.</p>
<p>City authorities had been responding to concerns over the impact of tourist platforms like Airbnb on quality of life for residents.</p>
<p>An update to the city&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amsterdam.nl/wonen-leefomgeving/wonen/vakantieverhuur/vergunning/?fbclid=IwAR3pHxkD4dtae98Ri9FFYbzY9O6vHZPxYp80yG7U-R31ectYGzMMn8-awu0">website</a> notes that, from tomorrow, it will be possible for property owners to apply for a holiday rental permit in the three neighborhoods where vacation rentals had been entirely banned from July 1 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/amsterdam-ejects-airbnb-el-at-from-three-central-districts-in-latest-p2p-platform-limits/">last year</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>City authorities write that they are studying the court ruling and will update the page &#8220;as soon as more is known.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amsterdam&#8217;s authorities took the step of prohibiting vacation rentals in the Burgwallen-Oude Zijde, Burgwallen-Nieuwe Zijde and Grachtengordel-Zuid districts last summer after a consultation process found widespread support among residents for a ban.</p>
<p>Authorities said strong growth in tourist rentals was impacting quality of life for residents.</p>
<p>It has also previously introduced a permit system to control vacation rentals in other districts of the city &#8212; which limits rentals to (currently) a maximum of 30 nights per year and for a maximum of four people per rental.</p>
<p>A further condition of the permit states that: &#8220;Your guests [must] not cause any inconvenience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following the court ruling that permit system will operate in the three central districts too.</p>
<p>The city&#8217;s ban on vacation rentals in the central districts was challenged by an association (Amsterdam Gastvrij) that represents the interests of homeowners who rent their properties through Airbnb and other platforms. They had argued that the<span class=""> Housing Act 2014 did not provide a legal basis for a prohibition on holiday rental.  </span></p>
<p><span class="">The Court of Amsterdam agreed, <a href="https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2021:1017">writing</a> in its judgement that &#8220;<span class="emphasis">a system of permits cannot contain a total prohibition.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p><span class=""><span class="emphasis">&#8220;Anyone who meets the conditions of the permit is in principle eligible for a permit. A total ban is a major infringement of the right to property and the free movement of services and will only be seen as a justified measure in very exceptional circumstances,&#8221; it further emphasized. </span></span></p>
<p>An Airbnb spokesperson told us the company was not involved in the proceedings to challenge the ban<span class=""> but the spokesperson was keen to highlight the outcome. </span></p>
<p>However the court&#8217;s verdict leaves room for the city to amend legislation to add new conditions to the permit system that could include a &#8220;quality of life&#8221; consideration (which it does not currently).</p>
<p>The court also suggests the possibility of a quota system with a night criterion being introduced under existing legislation, as another means of using the permit system to manage quality of life. It further suggests city authorities could enforce residential (rather than touristic) purposes for houses via a zoning plan. So there are alternative avenues for <span class="">Amsterdam&#8217;s officials</span> to explore as a policy tool to limit activity on Airbnb et al.</p>
<p>At the same time the court ruling underlines the challenges European cities face in trying to regulate the impacts of rental platforms on areas like housing availability (and affordability) and wider quality of life issues for residents dealing with over-tourism (not currently an issue, of course, given ongoing travel restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic).</p>
<p>In recent years a number of major tourist cities in Europe have expressed public frustration over vacation rental platforms &#8212; penning an <a href="https://www.amsterdam.nl/nieuwsarchief/persberichten/2019/persberichten-laurens-ivens/press-release-cities-alarmed-about/">open letter</a> to the European Commission back in 2019 that called for &#8220;strong legal obligations for platforms to cooperate with us in registration-schemes and in supplying rental-data per house that is advertised on their platforms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cities must protect the public interest and eliminate the adverse effects of short-term holiday rental in various ways. More nuisances, feelings of insecurity and a ‘touristification’ of their neighbourhoods is not what our residents want. Therefore (local) governments should have the possibility to introduce their own regulations depending on the local situation,&#8221; they also wrote, urging EU policymakers to support a rethink of the rules.</p>
<p>Since then the Commission has announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/06/airbnb-and-three-other-p2p-rental-platforms-agree-to-share-limited-pan-eu-data/">limited data-sharing arrangement</a> with the leading vacation rental platforms, saying it wants to encourage “balanced” development of peer-to-peer rentals.</p>
<p>Last year the Dutch government <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/dutch-deputy-prime-minister-calls-for-digital-services-act-regulation-against-airbnb/">pressed the Commission to go further over data access to vacation rental platforms</a> &#8212; pushing for a provision to be included in a major planned update to pan-EU rules wrapping digital services, aka the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">Digital Services Act (DSA)</a>.</p>
<p>The DSA proposal, which is now going through the EU&#8217;s co-legislative process, is broadly targeted at standardizing processes for tackling illegal goods and services &#8212; so it could have implications for vacation platforms in areas like data-sharing where it relates to illegal vacation rentals (i.e., where a property is advertised without a required permit).</p>

But bringing decades-long legacy code and design into the future isn&#8217;t easy (or cheap).</p>
<p>Businesses have to overcome the fear and uncertainty about how to do such retrofitting, address the lack of education to launch such projects, and balance the scope of these iterations while still maintaining other production work.</p>
<p>Among the U.S. adult population, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/disabilityandhealth/infographic-disability-impacts-all.html">26%</a> live with some form of disability, and businesses that are ignorant or slow to respond to accessibility needs are producing digital products for a smaller group of users. Someone who is a neophyte might not be able to use a product with overwhelming cognitive overhead. Someone using a product that isn&#8217;t localized may not be able to refill their prescription in a new country.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

		<blockquote>
			Accessibility is a key ingredient in your product cake &#8212; and it&#8217;ll always taste best when it&#8217;s added to the mix at the beginning.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We recently saw this play out in the “<a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2021-02-09/viral-cat-lawyers-response-to-zoom-filter-mishap-is-purr-fect">cat lawyer</a>” episode, which the kitten-faced attorney took in good humor. But it also reminded us that many people struggle with today’s basic tools, and for those who don’t, it’s hard to understand just how much this disrupts people’s personal and professional lives.</p>
<p>If you’re a founder with a software product out there, you probably won’t receive as loud an alarm bell as a viral cat filter video to tell you that something’s wrong. At least not immediately. Unfortunately, that time will come because social media has become the megaphone for support issues. You want to avoid that final, uncontrollable warning sign. Here are four other warning signs that make clear your product is not as accessible as you might think &#8212; and how you can address that.</p>
<h2>1. You didn’t define a11y principles at the start of your journey</h2>
<p>Accessibility is a key ingredient in your product cake &#8212; and it&#8217;ll always taste best when it&#8217;s added to the mix at the beginning. It&#8217;s also more time- and cost-effective, as fixing a usability issue after the product has been released can cost up to<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280742273_The_impact_of_usability_on_the_cost_of_quality"> 100 times more</a> than earlier on in the development process.</p>
<p>Your roadmap should work toward the four<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro.html#introduction-fourprincs-head"> principles</a> of accessibility, described using the acronym POUR:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>P</strong>erceivable: Your users need to be able to perceive all of the information displayed on your user interface.</li>
<li><strong>O</strong>perable: Your users must be able to operate and navigate your interface components.</li>
<li><strong>U</strong>nderstandable: Your content and the functioning of your user interface must be clearly understandable to users.</li>
<li><strong>R</strong>obust: Your content has to be robust enough that a wide variety of users can continue to access it as technologies advance, including assistive technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Without following each of these principles consistently, you cannot guarantee that your product is accessible to everybody.</p>
<p>The roadmap should integrate accessibility efforts into the design, development and quality assurance process, all the way through to product release and updates, where the cycle starts all over.</p>
<p>This means it’s vital to have everyone on your team informed and committed to accessibility. You could even go further and nominate one person from each team to lead the accessibility process and be responsible for each team’s compliance. It’s worth starting any new project with an accessibility audit so you understand exactly where your gaps are. And by syncing with sales and support teams, you can identify where users are experiencing friction.</p>
<p>This baking process helps you avoid legal problems in the future as a result of noncompliance. In 2019, a blind man<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/07/dominos-supreme-court.html#:~:text=Supreme%20Court%20hands%20victory%20to%20blind%20man%20who%20sued%20Domino's%20over%20site%20accessibility,-Published%20Mon%2C%20Oct&amp;text=The%20Supreme%20Court%20denied%20a,court%20decision%20against%20the%20company."> successfully sued</a> Domino’s after he was unable to order food on the Domino’s website and mobile app, despite using screen-reading software. Beyoncé’s company was<a href="https://fortune.com/2019/09/21/beyonce-lawsuit-website-ada-compliant/"> sued</a> by a blind woman that same year. Product owners are wide open to lawsuits if they don’t implement the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>To help you on your way,<a href="https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/"> IBM’s Carbon Design System</a> is an open-source design system for digital products that offers free guidelines to build an accessible product, including for people with physical or cognitive disabilities. In addition, software tools exist that can help you do accessibility checks ahead of time rather than when the product is finished.</p>
<h2>2. You’re treating a11y like a set-it-and-forget-it</h2>
<p>Design trends evolve fast in the tech world. Your team is probably staying on top of the latest software or mobile features, but are they paying attention to accessibility?</p>
<p>A11y needs maintenance; the requirements for the web and mobile platforms are changing all the time and it&#8217;s important (as well as necessary) to stay on top of those changes. If you’re not carrying out constant tweaks and upgrades, chances are that you’ve racked up a few accessibility issues over time.</p>
<p>Plan regular meetings where you review and discuss your products&#8217; accessibility and a11y compliance. Look at what other products are doing to be more accessible and attend courses about inclusive design (e.g.,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/learn-about-the-importance-of-accessible-product-design-at-techcrunch-sessions-justice/"> TechCrunch Sessions</a>). Platforms like<a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/"> the A11Y Project</a> are also incredibly useful resources for teams to stay up to date, and they also offer books, tutorials, professional support and professional testers.</p>
<h2>3. You and your team haven’t tried out a11y tools</h2>
<p>The best accessibility tool you have is your team itself. Building a product with a diverse group of people will mean you encounter and rectify any barriers to use faster and can innovate with greater impact &#8212; after all, people with disabilities are some of the world&#8217;s greatest innovators.</p>
<p>Outside of your team makeup, ask yourself: Have you ever used a screen reader? Or tried to navigate your website using only your keyboard? Seen your designs<a href="https://www.getstark.co/"> simulated against various types of vision</a>?</p>
<p>If the answer is no, chances are you’re letting key accessibility features slip through the cracks. By putting yourself in the shoes of someone with impairments, these tools force you toward a better appreciation of their needs.</p>
<p>Try and get your team using these tools as early as possible, especially if you’re struggling to convey to them the importance of a11y. Once you’ve broadened your perspective, it’ll genuinely be harder to <em>not</em> see how people with different abilities are experiencing your product. Which is why you should come back to your product afterward, as a user, and explore it through a new lens.</p>
<h2>4. You aren’t talking to your users</h2>
<p>Lastly, there’s little chance you’ve built a truly accessible product without actually talking to its users. The general population is the most diverse set of critics to warn you if your product’s falling short for people of different backgrounds and abilities. Every single user experiences a product uniquely, and regardless of all the effort you’ve put in until now, there will likely be issues.</p>
<p>Lend an ear to a wide range of users, throughout the product life cycle. You can do this by doing user testing with each update, asking users to complete surveys on their in-app experience, and holding focus groups that proactively enlist people with a spectrum of needs.</p>
<p>Accessible design is just good design. It’s a misconception that it only improves UX for people with disabilities &#8212; it provides a better experience for everyone. And all founders want their product to reach as many people as possible. Once you put in the initial effort and embrace it, it becomes easier, like another tool in your kit. You won’t get it 100% right on the first try. But this is about progress, not perfection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The COVID-19 pandemic boosted U.S. online shopping by $183 billion, according to a new report by Adobe&#8217;s e-commerce division, <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/03/15/adobe-digital-economy-index-covid-19-report.html#gs.vp3vqg">released</a> this morning. This figure represents the increase in online shopping during the months of March 2020, when the pandemic began in the U.S, through February 2021. During this time, U.S. consumers spent a total of $844 billion online. Meanwhile, $813 billion was spent during the calendar year 2020 alone, up 42% over 2019. To put this $183 billion in perspective, Adobe notes it&#8217;s nearly the size of the last holiday shopping season, when $188.2 billion was spent online during the months of November and December 2020. The firm expects this growth to continue in the years ahead, reaching $1 billion by 2022.</p>
<p>The pandemic has served as an accelerant to many industries, pushing them years ahead of where their natural growth would have otherwise taken them.</p>
<p>E-commerce benefitted from this trend as well, as consumers faced stay-at-home orders, nonessential retailers closed their doors, and in-person shopping was replaced with online commerce for many consumers. Adobe says the pandemic itself produced a &#8220;rare step change in online spending, equivalent to a 20% boost,&#8221; and noted the impacts will continue even as the pandemic comes to an end in the months to come.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s analysts, for example, noted that the first two months of 2021 (Jan.-Feb. 2021), have already seen consumer spending of $121 billion in the U.S, or a 34% year-over-year increase.</p>
<p>Also during this time, the buy-now-pay-later method for online shopping has jumped up by 215% year over year, with orders that are 18% larger &#8212; another factor in the growing sales driven by these changes.</p>
<p>Adobe predicts that current growth rates will continue, leading to 2021 calendar year sales of somewhere between $850 billion and $930 billion. It then expects 2022 to deliver the first trillion-dollar year for U.S. e-commerce.</p>
<p>Beyond the e-commerce sales increases, the pandemic may have also led to other long-lasting changes in terms of how people shop and what they&#8217;re buying.</p>
<p>Adobe said that both in-store and curbside pickup services had grown in adoption by 67% year over year, as of Feb. 2021. Consumers seem very receptive to this hybrid model of shopping, with a recent Adobe survey finding that 30% of U.S. consumers actually prefer pickup over standard delivery, for instance.</p>
<p>The shift to regular online shopping may have some later impacts on typical &#8220;sales holidays&#8221; that had, in the past, drawn larger increases in shopper activity. Memorial Day 2020 commerce grew 20% less than other days that week, and resulted in $32 million less revenue, Adobe noted. Labor Day and Presidents Day saw similar trends. And notably, the five days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday 2020 also contributed 9% less to revenue share during the holiday season, equivalent to $600 million.</p>
<p>There were some indications that retailers haven&#8217;t quite adapted to the surge of new online shoppers, however. &#8220;Out of stock&#8221; messages were common, peaking in July 2020, which saw 3x the number of stockouts compared with a pre-pandemic period. And in Jan. 2021, out of stock messages were elevated at 4x pre-pandemic levels. This was common particularly among groceries, pet products and medical supplies, Adobe said.</p>
<p>Online grocery has also benefited from the change in consumer behavior and doesn&#8217;t show any signs of slowing. In Feb. 2021, the category was up by 230% compared with Jan. 2020, pre-pandemic.</p>
<p>Unlike with consumer surveys, Adobe&#8217;s data is derived from trends seen directly in Adobe Analytics, which covers over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites and over 100 million SKUs, giving it a more comprehensive, real-time look into the U.S. e-commerce industry and consumer spending.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Voyage, the autonomous vehicle startup that spun out of Udacity, has been acquired by Cruise, a deal that points to the continued consolidation within the nascent industry.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed; the majority of Voyage&#8217;s 60-person team will move over to Cruise and the company&#8217;s co-founder and CEO Oliver Cameron will take on a new role as vice president of product. Voyage&#8217;s partnership with FCA, now called Stellantis, will also end once the acquisition with Cruise closes.</p>
<p>Voyage, which was founded in 2017, was a tiny startup compared to well-funded operations like Cruise, Argo AI, Waymo and Aurora. But despite its size and only raising $52 million, Cameron helped Voyage stand out. The company is best known for its operations in two senior living communities. Voyage tested and gave rides to people within a 4,000-resident retirement community in San Jose, California, as well as The Villages, a 40-square-mile, 125,000-resident retirement city in Florida.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Voyage’s approach has always been to leverage our limited resources to deliver a product that restores mobility to those who need it most: senior citizens. We’ve made tremendous progress toward this goal, moving countless senior citizens (some as old as 92!) around their communities,&#8221; Cameron <a href="https://news.voyage.auto/voyage-acquired-by-cruise-d5f76011032f">wrote in a blog</a> post announcing the deal. &#8220;Now at Cruise, we are thrilled to have the substantial resources to eventually serve not just senior citizens, but every possible demographic who stands to benefit from self-driving services.&#8221;</p>
<p>Voyage won&#8217;t be shutting down operations at the two senior communities immediately. However, Cruise reiterated to TechCrunch that its focus is commercial operations in San Francisco. Inevitably, any testing or operations at the senior communities will come to an end, although Cruise did not provide a timeline.</p>
<p>Cameron&#8217;s role as VP of product is another signal that Cruise is inching forward with plans to launch a commercial robotaxi service in San Francisco. Cruise has hired hundreds of engineers, both hardware and software, but it will need to win over customers if it hopes to build a loyal base of robotaxi users. In his new role, Cameron will be the one who will be thinking through every customer touchpoint for Cruise&#8217;s self-driving service.</p>
<p>Cameron described the union of Cruise and Voyage as a &#8220;wonderful marriage,&#8221; in a tweet Monday morning. He noted that Cruise has the &#8220;most advanced self-driving technology, unique auto partners and the first purpose-built self-driving vehicle. With Voyage and our customer-service obsessed team, we&#8217;ll together deliver a game-changing self-driving product.&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Cruise has the funds to put toward this component of the business. Earlier this year, Cruise said it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/microsoft-invests-in-cruise-in-new-2-billion-round/">raised $2 billion</a> in a new equity round that has pushed its valuation up to $30 billion and delivered Microsoft as an investor and partner. GM, Honda and other institutional investors also put more capital into Cruise as the autonomous vehicle company inches closer to commercializing its technology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mass manufacturing may be the future of 3D printing (one hopes), but health products are very much its present. From orthodontics to prosthesis, medical needs are right in the sweet spot for additive manufacturing. Prototyping is a category with a specific ceiling, while true mass manufacturing is still at an impossible scale for most of these systems. Medical and dental present a larger market that still requires a good deal of customization.</p>
<p>Today, Desktop Metal announced that it <a href="https://www.desktophealth.com/">launched Desktop Health</a>, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125113" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125113" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2125113" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hearing-aid-with-E-Shell-200.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="819" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hearing-aid-with-E-Shell-200.jpg 1763w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hearing-aid-with-E-Shell-200.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hearing-aid-with-E-Shell-200.jpg?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hearing-aid-with-E-Shell-200.jpg?resize=768,614 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hearing-aid-with-E-Shell-200.jpg?resize=680,544 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hearing-aid-with-E-Shell-200.jpg?resize=1536,1228 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/hearing-aid-with-E-Shell-200.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2125113" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Desktop Health</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Today the world manufactures more than $85 billion in medical and dental implants each year,” Desktop Metal CEO Ric Fulop said in a release. “We think a large percentage of these parts could be printed and made patient-specific before the end of the decade, making this market a key opportunity for Desktop Metal.</p>
<p>Dentistry/orthodontics continue to be top of mind (think retainers and Invisalign-style braces, to start), but current and future applications extend beyond that. The list includes things like tissue and graft printing, as the company explores how the process might grow in the future.</p>

<p>Leading the division is Michael Mazen Jafar. The former COO of Evolus will be coming on board as the CEO of the new line. “Desktop Health has a mission to change the way patients experience personalized healthcare, through innovation and science-based solutions,&#8221; he says in the release.</p>
<p>The additive manufacturing company announced plans to go public via SPAC last August. This January, it purchased EnvisionTEC for $300 million. The German company specializes in photopolymer printing, a key emerging technology for dental. It already sported 1,000 dental customers, including Smile Direct Club, which will no doubt serve as a key foundation for the new division.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix&#8217;s original films <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-list-of-nominees-updating-live">received 35 Oscar nominations</a> this year, once again putting the streaming service ahead of any other Hollywood studios.</p>
<p>“Mank” led the pack with 10 nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director (David Fincher), Best Actor in a Leading Role (Gary Oldman) and Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Amanda Seyfried). That doesn&#8217;t necessarily make it a shoo-in to be Netflix&#8217;s first Best Picture winner, however — it’s worth remembering that in 2019, the streamer’s film “Roma” received 10 nominations as well, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/24/netflix-roma-oscars/">ultimately winning three awards</a> but not Best Picture. And last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/09/netflix-oscars/">“The Irishman” went empty-handed despite its 10 noms</a>.</p>
<p>Besides “Mank,” Netflix’s “The Trial of the Chicago 7” received six nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Sacha Baron Cohen). And “Crip Camp,” a film from the Obamas’ production company Higher Ground, is nominated for Best Documentary Feature, as is “My Octopus Teacher.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HsRTtcfYii"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/09/netflix-oscars/">Netflix&#8217;s movies only won two Oscars this year</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Amazon, meanwhile, received 12 nominations, with six for “Sound of Metal” (including Best Picture). &#8220;Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan,&#8221; &#8220;One Night in Miami&#8221; and &#8220;Time&#8221; were nominated as well. And Apple received its first two nominations ever, for &#8220;Wolfwalkers&#8221; (Best Animated Feature) and &#8220;Greyhound&#8221; (Best Sound).</p>
<p>Of course, this is a streaming-centric year for movies overall. With the COVID-19 pandemic forcing theaters to close across the world, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/oscars-streaming-coronavirus/">the Oscars temporarily abandoned their requirement</a> that films screen commercially in theaters in order to qualify for awards.</p>

<p>And it’s probably safe to assume that most viewers (Academy members and otherwise) watched these movies via streaming. For example, Best Picture nominee and Golden Globe winner for Best Drama Film winner “Nomadland” was released by Fox Searchlight simultaneously in theaters and on Hulu.</p>
<p>The Academy Awards will air on April 25 at 5 p.m. Pacific on ABC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Relativity Space already has a significant volume of launch contracts on the books &#8212; more pre-sales for its Terran 1 rocket than any other launch vehicle in history, in fact, according to CEO and co-founder Tim Ellis. But its latest customer is a key one: The U.S. Department of Defense, which has contracted Relativity Space to launch a payload on its behalf as part of the Defense Innovation Unit&#8217;s (DIU) continued efforts to find responsive launch partners capable of sending payloads with a mass between 450 kg and 1,200 kg (roughly 1,000 to 2,650 lbs) to low-Earth orbit.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bigger satellite, and there&#8217;s a much limited number of companies that can actually launch this spacecraft,&#8221; Ellis said in an interview. &#8220;[Terran 1&#8217;s] three-meter payload fairing is unique, among all the U.S.-based companies that can actually launch that payload size, we&#8217;re still the only one that actually has the fairing big enough for that scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DIU has a specific mandate of working with innovative American companies, typically in the earlier stages of their development, and their collaboration is often seen as a stamp of approval that can set up a company for a much deeper DoD relationship going forward. In this case, citing Relativity&#8217;s relative maturity and its queue of pre-sold missions, which include a number of non-defense government contracts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Experts say Space Force is a vital, massive shift for US military&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/experts-say-space-force-is-a-vital-massive-shift-for-us-military/embed/#?secret=if8VVYTgbJ" data-secret="if8VVYTgbJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;In this case, there was just a true mission need for this particular spacecraft,&#8221; Ellis said. &#8220;And it was a good opportunity to work with them as our first DoD customer, to start on-ramping into a broader ecosystem of capabilities that we&#8217;re hearing the government wants to see. So it&#8217;s all specifically focused on Terran 1, though of course, we now have talked about Terran R, totally independent of this program. It&#8217;s a start of a conversation, and we see lots of opportunities to help support national interests across many different places with all the things that we&#8217;re building.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellis is referencing Relativity&#8217;s newly unveiled larger payload spacecraft, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/relativity-space-unveils-plans-for-a-new-much-larger-and-fully-reusable-rocket/">Terran R</a>. The 3D-printing rocket company debuted its plans for the much larger launch vehicle in February, and it&#8217;s tailor-made for delivering satellite constellations to low-Earth orbit &#8212; a need in which the DoD has expressed plenty of interest, given its focus on satellite technologies that offer responsive, redundant capabilities to suit shifting needs.</p>
