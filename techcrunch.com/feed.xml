										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Still can&#8217;t wrap your head around people wanting to watch others play video games on the Internet? Here&#8217;s another one that might bend your brain a bit: people watching other people <em>study</em> on the Internet.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s easy to miss if you&#8217;re a few years out of school, there&#8217;s a whole Internet community built around studying and how to (hopefully) study better — one filled with Discords, subreddits, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A">ridiculously chill music</a>.</p>
<p>One part of all this is the &#8220;Study With Me&#8221; stream — which, as the name suggests, is a livestream of someone studying, meant to be kinda-sorta-watched while the viewer studies too. There might be a bit of music, maybe some rain sounds&#8230; but, for the most part, the host won&#8217;t be talking much or trying to entertain. That&#8217;d kind of defeat the purpose, after all. Don&#8217;t think anyone would tune in to that? There are dedicated YouTube channels with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSQkQjPhnZw12Hj-SfsbX8w">hundreds of thousands of subscribers</a>, and pre-recorded, hours-long study streams with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ex_bNIFR1A">millions of views.</a></p>
<p>While the livestream studying concept has been around for a few years, much of its uptick in popularity came with the pandemic. How do you do study group when the library is closed and we&#8217;re not supposed to be sitting around each other in stuffy rooms?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.studystream.live/home">StudyStream</a>, a team out of Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2021 class, is bringing all of these ideas together and building it into a platform — a dedicated place online where students can study with others, share study tips, and more. They offer 24/7 &#8220;focus rooms&#8221; on Zoom, where students are meant to turn on their camera, pop on some headphones, and crack open their books with up to 1000 other students — plus a Discord community for students who want to connect after the fact, or want to live-study in smaller groups.</p>
<p>Launched late last year, the team is already seeing solid traction. Co-founder Sarujan Ranjan tells me they&#8217;ve seen upwards of four million users come onto the platform, and their Discord community recently passed 400,000 users. Any time I&#8217;ve checked in the past few weeks, their study streams (of which six run in parallel) have collectively had thousands of users online. They also host onboarding streams bright and early each weekday, where they breakdown how the focus rooms work and introduce people to the etiquette&#8230; like why no one is talking.</p>
<p>Just as talking in a library would probably get you shushed, the 1000-person streams aren&#8217;t meant for chatting — again, chatter would sort of defeat the purpose. Everyone&#8217;s microphone is blocked, and the in-Zoom chat is disabled.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, people find ways to express themselves. Some users change their Zoom display names to their social media handles; others hold up hand-written notes to say hello. One cute trick people seem to use is &#8220;waving&#8221; with Zoom&#8217;s built-in hand raise feature — it&#8217;s a way to say hello, but also a way to get yourself bumped into the first few pages of on-screen streamers, if that&#8217;s something you want.</p>
<p>(And, of course, people will find ways to troll — give people a webcam, an audience, and some degree of anonymity, and, well, it happens. As such, StudyStream has live moderators in each of the streams, with multiple ways to report anyone being nasty.)</p>
<p>Ranjan and his team didn&#8217;t initially set out to build a study streaming platform. In 2018, they founded the Knowledge Collective, an education platform where they&#8217;d host leadership training programs. In talking to more students, though, they found that most of them weren&#8217;t looking for another place to find stuff to watch or read.</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t have a problem with content. The thing that was really bothering them was &#8230; feeling unmotivated. Or unproductive, or isolated. [They&#8217;d say] &#8216;I can get the content, I just can&#8217;t get myself to actually read it.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they started experimenting with study focus rooms, quickly finding an audience after a few popular study TikTokers and study influencers (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/study-influencers-earning-thousands-dollars-youtube-productivity-hacks-exam-tips-2021-3">they exist!</a>) joined the platform and hyped it up. As more and more users stuck around and turned to StudyStream as a way to find community in a deeply isolating time, they knew it was time to make it their focus.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don’t want any student to have to study alone ever again,&#8221; says Ranjan, &#8220;regardless of where in the world they may be.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of StudyStream&#8217;s focus rooms are currently free to join, so how will they make money? That&#8217;s still in the works. Ranjan tells me they&#8217;ve experimented with premium rooms and have plenty of other concepts in the works — but for now, they&#8217;re focused on building out the platform and keeping users happy. One aspect of this is building out the experience <em>outside</em> of the focus rooms; they&#8217;re currently in a closed beta of their expanded web app, which will offer up things like shared task lists, an overview of how long/often you&#8217;ve studied, and more ways to connect with other students on the platform.</p>

<p>While StudyStream was part of YC&#8217;s most recent class, they didn&#8217;t take part in Demo Day — because, well, they&#8217;d already raised the money they needed for now. Ranjan tells me that the team closed a $2.1M SAFE round prior to Demo Day, backed by YC, Brighteye Ventures, Emerge Education, Dunce Capital, Ali Abdaal (a well-known YouTuber that focuses on productivity and studying techniques), Manchester City footballer Ilkay Gundogan, and other unnamed angel investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors said it expects its in-car subscription services to generate nearly $2 billion in revenue this year and will reach as high as $25 billion by the end of the decade, an amount the company said Wednesday will put it in the same <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/FINAL-Q420-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">league as Netflix</a>, Peloton and Spotify.</p>
<p>The automaker has 16 million vehicles on the road in the U.S. and Canada. About a quarter of those vehicles — 4.2 million — have owners that pay for subscriptions services today, <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">Alan Wexler, SVP of innovation and growth at GM, said during a presentation at the company&#8217;s investor event Wednesday.</span></p>
<p>GM expects that number to grow, especially as it gears up to launch its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/general-motors-new-software-platform-ultifi-is-coming-to-vehicles-starting-in-2023/">Ultifi end-to-end software platform</a> in 2023 that will enable an enhanced subscriptions platform and over-the-air software updates.</p>
<p>GM&#8217;s current subscription platform supports services like OnStar, a subsidiary of the company that provides in-vehicle security, emergency services and navigation.</p>
<p>The company said its customers&#8217; average willingness to select multiple services is high. GM conducted a study with several thousand customers, offering them 45 different feature and service options. On average, customers chose a bundle of 25 different products and services.</p>
<p><span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">&#8220;Our</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">research</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">indicates</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">that</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">with</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">the</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">right</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">mix</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">of</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">compelling</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">offerings,</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">customers</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">are</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">willing</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">to</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">spend</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">$135</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">per</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">month</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">on</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">average</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">for</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">products</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">and</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">services,&#8221; said Wexler.</span></p>
<p>By 2030, GM predicts it will have 30 million of its vehicles in the U.S. will have connected car technology, leaving it with a serviceable addressable market of $80 billion. Wexler said GM aims to generate additional incremental revenue of $20 billion to $25 billion, $6 billion of which will be from insurance and the rest from one-time purchases and subscriptions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Aside from OnStar, GM intends to target customers interested in <a href="https://plants.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/apr/0412-maps.html">Maps+</a>, an in-vehicle, app-based navigation solution that was rolled out in April and can be activated with Alexa voice control. GM also sees a big opportunity to earn revenue off of its commercial customers, specifically with its existing service, OnStar vehicle insights that can help both GM and non-GM mixed fleets with fleet management.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The meme-ification of ownership and the wild acceleration of private startup valuations have led us to this moment where a former VC firm associate has built a crypto marketplace designed for &#8220;fantasy startup investing,&#8221; where users spend real money buying fakes shares &#8212; in NFT form, of course &#8212; of real startups.</p>
<p>The game, which launches out of closed beta today, is called <a href="https://www.visionrare.com/">Visionrare</a> and founders Jacob Claerhout and Boris Gordts see a way to take the gamification of investing to its furthest end, mimicking the appeal of fantasy sports leagues and giving users a way to compete with friends by betting on startups they think will be successful. Users can bid on NFT shares of hundreds of different startups at auction and compete to build the best performing fake portfolio.</p>
<p>At launch, Visionrare&#8217;s database of companies is confined to a smattering of Y Combinator startups from some of the more recent classes. Before you ask, no, they mostly do not have the permission of the startups they&#8217;re selling fake shares in to use their names and logos, but the founders hope that the game-like nature of the platform will discourage those companies from sending out the cease &amp; desist letters. Startups can verify their profiles and receive a healthy percentage of their NFT shares to distribute as they see fit, or they can contact Visionrare to take their startup&#8217;s profile down, or they can, of course, just ignore it.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Crypto social network BitClout arrives with a bevy of high-profile investors &#8212; and skeptics&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/crypto-social-network-bitclout-arrives-with-a-bevy-of-high-profile-investors-and-skeptics/embed/#?secret=ViijakqgSU" data-secret="ViijakqgSU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The game aims to simplify the complexity of venture capital in an auction format that&#8217;s tied to the actual fundraising cycles of the startups and their real world performance. Visionrare auctions off 100 serialized &#8220;VisionShares&#8221; per funding round, one at a time for each startup, with bids starting at $5. Once a user accumulates a certain number of shares (at least five) they can join a league and compete with other users through a fantasy-like experience, moving up and down a leaderboard while competing for a share of the collective value of the VisionShares based on the performance of their own portfolio.</p>

<p>As the platform crosses into open beta, there are still some substantial to-do list items for the company, namely building out its secondary market and support to sell VisionShares on outside platforms like OpenSea. Users currently purchase VisionShares with credit cards, but the team is also looking to roll out crypto payments soon.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The game&#8217;s subject matter lacks a few correlations with something like Monday Night Football that may prove difficult to scale a fantasy league with, namely the lack of publicly available performance information. If these were public companies, the game could be organized around something concrete like share price or consistent metrics from their quarterly earnings, but startups are much more careful in the information they release publicly.</p>
<p>Visionrare gets startup performance data from Tracxn which they use to analyze their own valuation-like &#8220;Visionrare score&#8221; for the companies each week. This score is the fundamental basis for tracking progress and winners in the leagues, but in a market where intangibles can often push valuations, treating the market with this kind of cross-industry consistency overindexed on data like press mentions, social media followers and app downloads will clearly lead to some substantial disconnect at times between private valuations and the scores. Claerhout, who previously worked in early stage investing at Paris-based investment firm Partech, notes that &#8220;this is not an exact science,&#8221; but hopes they can get access to more data streams over time that improve the performance of their scoring algorithm.</p>
<p>A bigger challenge may be ensuring that the most deep-pocketed users aren&#8217;t consistently winning league competitions &#8212; just like they do in the real world. League winners are determined by which portfolios pick up the most Visionrare score points over a given playing period, but given the long timelines of venture success stories, there may be some misaligments when it comes to making long-term bets on an early team versus hitching your wagon to a trending SaaS startup. The founders say they are still playing with some of the league mechanics and note they will make adjustments as Visionrare scales to keep things fun and fair.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it&#8217;s an early project made by a couple of young entrepreneurs with zero funding that captures some of the ridiculousness of both the crypto space and today&#8217;s startup investment ecosystem, nevertheless Visionrare&#8217;s founders hope their fake NFT shares market offers an opportunity for people interested in startups to showcase their conviction for picking winners, something that they hope could one day serve as a signal for VCs looking for their next hires.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a really hard industry to build credentials in and t<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">here are a lot of people who have neither the access nor the capital,&#8221; Claerhout tells TechCrunch. &#8220;</span>If you believe in a company, buy a VisionShare.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pinterest is rolling out <a href="https://business.pinterest.com/blog/new-pinterest-shopping-features-to-help-people-find-what-they-love/">new features</a> for advertisers and brands to promote their products to users on its site. The launch marks the company’s latest initiative to grow online shopping and advertising on its platform.</p>
<p>A new ‘slideshow for collections’ feature pulls products from brands’ catalogues and automatically turns them into a &#8216;collections ad.&#8217; Pinterest notes that this new feature will help advertisers easily produce video-like content tailored to individual users. The aim is to encourage shoppers to purchase more items at once, as the company notes that shoppers on Pinterest have 85 percent bigger baskets than shoppers on other platforms and spend twice as much per month. Since shoppers will be browsing more than one product at a time through the slideshow feature, they’re more likely to purchase additional items.</p>
<p>Pinterest is launching another new feature called ‘merchant details’ to allow brands to showcase their values on their profile. Brands can showcase values such as “responsibly sourced” and “inclusive.” Further, companies can also highlight communities that they are a part of, such as “Women-owned” and “Black-owned.”</p>
<p>The company is also expanding its Verified Merchant Program, which helps users find vetted brands, to Austria, Brazil, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland. Brands who have been vetted get enhanced distribution and a “verified” badge on their profiles.</p>
<p>Pinterest is also testing a new ‘Idea Ads with paid partnership’ feature that is a joint partnership between creators and advertisers. As part of the feature, the creator makes an Idea Pin and tags a brand partner. The advertiser can then promote the Idea Pin as an Idea Ad. The company notes that this kind of partnership helps businesses and creators reach more users on the platform. Idea Ads are currently being tested with select creators and brands in 15 countries.</p>
<p>“People who use Pinterest weekly are 7x more likely to say it’s the most influential platform in their purchase journey, compared to social media platforms. That’s why, as of today, we’re dramatically expanding our suite of shopping solutions for advertisers,” the company said in a <a href="https://business.pinterest.com/blog/new-pinterest-shopping-features-to-help-people-find-what-they-love/">blog post.</a></p>
<p>These new features come as no surprise, as Pinterest has long positioned itself as a source for inspiration that could ultimately lead to online purchases. Earlier this year, the company rolled out a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/pinterest-adds-a-shopping-list-feature-to-round-up-your-saved-products/">‘Shopping List’ feature</a> aimed at turning users’ saved Pins into purchases.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting Pinterest is among several other platforms competing within the e-commerce market with a push towards online shopping, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/facebook-whatsapp-e-commerce-features/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tiktok-shopping-expands-with-more-partnerships-live-shopping-new-ads-and-more/">TikTok</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-emphasizes-commerce-in-updates-to-its-camera-and-ar-platforms/">Snap</a> have all launched shopping features over the past few months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.openstack.org/">OpenStack</a>, the open-source project that gives large enterprises and public cloud providers the tools to run their own AWS-like private clouds in their data centers, today announced the release of OpenStack 24. Codenamed Xena, the release focuses on polishing many of the system&#8217;s sharper edges.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that the OpenStack project, which now falls under the umbrella of the <a href="https://openinfra.dev/">OpenInfra Foundation</a>, has had its ups and downs. So it maybe comes as a surprise to many that it is actually seeing quite a bit of growth in usage lately. As the Foundation shared today, the number of total cores managed by OpenStack grew 66% over the last year.</p>
<p>OpenStack remains the backbone for many telco companies and indeed, nine of the 10 largest telcos run OpenStack. If you&#8217;ve made a 5G call on the Verizon network lately, OpenStack played a major role in making that happen (Disclosure: Verizon, through Verizon Media, used to own TechCrunch. They don&#8217;t anymore, which is obviously their loss). But companies like Workday and Walmart, too, now run OpenStack deployments, with over 1 million cores. But still, China Mobile, for example, is in its own league with over 6 million cores.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the biggest jump I think we&#8217;ve ever seen year over year,&#8221; OpenInfra Foundation COO Mark Collier told me. &#8220;There&#8217;s been a lot written about the massive growth in demand for infrastructure because of the pandemic. And there&#8217;s been lots of articles written about the hyperscale public clouds and all of a sudden, they&#8217;re needing to grow much faster &#8212; but I think that that&#8217;s absolutely driving OpenStack demand. We added 10 million cores in a year. It&#8217;s just awesome. One hundred new clouds were built just in the past year. We have seven organizations now running over a million cores.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213545" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/openstack-momentum-2021.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213545" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2213545" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/openstack-momentum-2021.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/openstack-momentum-2021.jpg 1105w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/openstack-momentum-2021.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/openstack-momentum-2021.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/openstack-momentum-2021.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/openstack-momentum-2021.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/openstack-momentum-2021.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2213545" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> OpenInfra Foundation</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that Microsoft joined the OpenInfra Foundation as a top-tier $350,000/year Platinum member a few weeks ago, joining <a href="https://openinfra.dev/members/">the likes of</a> Ant Group, AT&amp;T, Ericsson, Facebook, FiberHome, Huawei, Red Hat, Tencent Cloud and Wind River.</p>
<p>After 24 releases, after all, the core tools it takes to run a private cloud (compute, storage, networking, etc.) are now well established. But there are still some features like support for virtually any PCI device, something enterprises were looking for to attach <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2019/03/04/an-introduction-to-smartnics/">SmartNICs</a> (basically programmable networking devices) to OpenStack&#8217;s Nova compute and Neuton networking service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;As far as specific themes that we saw with this release, one of them is the integration of projects. So OpenStack Cyborg [which provides support for hardware accelerator], Nova, Neutron, did a lot of work on this peripheral component interconnect device flexibility, the PCI devices, proving that our projects are better together sometimes,&#8221; Kendall Nelson, OpenStack&#8217;s Upstream Developer Advocate, explained.</p>
<p>This also includes adding support for more functions from more components to the unified OpenStack command-line tool.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="FbfksWzIK1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/the-openstack-foundation-becomes-the-open-infrastructure-foundation/">The OpenStack Foundation becomes the Open Infrastructure Foundation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The OpenStack Foundation becomes the Open Infrastructure Foundation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/the-openstack-foundation-becomes-the-open-infrastructure-foundation/embed/#?secret=FbfksWzIK1" data-secret="FbfksWzIK1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;Historically, we&#8217;ve had the individual clients for each one of the services,&#8221; Nelson said. &#8220;They&#8217;re closer to the API and more maintained by the individual projects. We&#8217;ve been focusing on this OpenStack client and the OpenStack SDK that lives underneath it over the last couple of releases, so that we can remove a bunch of the project-specific clients so that users only have one command line they need to interact with and they can do everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>As far as many of the other updates, the OpenInfra Foundation&#8217;s VP of Engineering Thierry Carrez noted that they were often driven by new hardware requirements, as well as the scale at which many OpenStack users now operate.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s interesting to see how the development priorities shift,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At this point of OpenStack, the core features are pretty stable, but it&#8217;s actually hardware enablement that drives most of this new development.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, though, the team also used the last development cycle to address some technical debt that had amassed over the last decade, including removing support for long deprecated APIs, for example.</p>
<p>The OpenInfra Foundation, which also now supports projects like Kata Containers, CI/CD platform Zuul, the edge computing platform StarlingX and the lifecycle management tool Airship, also today announced a return to in-person conferences, starting in Berlin <a href="https://openinfra.dev/summit/">from June 7 to 9</a>, with registration opening next month. Ahead of that, it&#8217;ll host a virtual event, <a href="https://openinfra.dev/live/keynotes">OpenInfra Live: Keynotes</a>, this November.</p>

		Will Uppington is the CEO and co-founder of <a href="http://www.truera.com">TruEra</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The European Commission announced <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_1682">first-of-its-kind legislation regulating the use of artificial intelligence</a> in April. This unleashed criticism that the regulations could slow AI innovation, hamstringing Europe in its competition with the U.S. and China for leadership in AI.</p>
<p>For example, Andrew McAfee wrote an article titled “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a5970b6c-e731-45a7-b75b-721e90e32e1c">EU proposals to regulate AI are only going to hinder innovation</a>.”</p>
<p>Anticipating this criticism and mindful of the example of GDPR, where Europe’s thought-leadership position didn’t necessarily translate into data-related innovation, the EC has tried to address AI innovation directly by publishing a new <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/new-coordinated-plan-artificial-intelligence">Coordinated Plan on AI</a>.</p>
<p>Released in conjunction with the proposed regulations, the plan is full of initiatives intended to help the EU become a leader in AI technology. So will the combination of regulation and pro-innovation policies be enough to spur accelerating AI leadership?</p>
<h2>AI innovation can be accelerated with the right laws</h2>
<p>While the combination is well considered and targets improvements in both regulation and innovation, there is a problem: The pro-innovation initiatives are R&amp;D-focused and not targeted at increasing adoption in the “high-risk” AI use cases to be regulated.</p>
<p>Spurring adoption is a key missing element. <a href="https://itif.org/files/2011-impact-regulation-innovation.pdf">Many research studies</a> have shown that well-designed “hard law” regulations can actually <em>increase </em>innovation, especially when employed with incentives that accelerate adoption. If the EC were to follow such a strategy, the EU could become a hotbed of AI innovation.</p>
<h2>High-risk AI regulation and investment in innovation</h2>
<p>The main thrust of the EC regulations is to place new requirements on “high-risk” AI systems. These include AI systems used for remote biometric identification, public infrastructure management, hiring and employment, creditworthiness assessment, and education, as well as for various public-sector use cases, such as dispatching first responders.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The legislation requires developers of these systems to deploy an AI quality management system that addresses requirements around high-quality data sets, record keeping, transparency, human oversight, accuracy, robustness and security. Providers of AI systems not yet designated as high risk are encouraged to create voluntary codes of conduct to achieve similar goals.</p>
<p>It’s clear that the crafters of the proposal were cognizant of the balance between regulation and innovation.</p>
<p>First, the legislation limits the number of AI systems deemed to be high risk, excluding systems that could plausibly have been included, such as insurance, and mostly including AI systems that already have some amount of regulatory oversight, such as employment and lending.</p>
<p>Second, the legislation defines high-level requirements without dictating how they are achieved. It also creates a compliance system based on self-reporting instead of something more onerous.</p>
<p>Finally, the Coordinated Plan is chock-full of R&amp;D-supporting initiatives, including spaces for data-sharing, testing and experimentation facilities, investment in research and AI excellence centers, digital innovation hubs, funding for education, and targeted, programmatic investments in AI for climate change, health, robotics, the public sector, law enforcement and sustainable agriculture.</p>
<p>However, the proposal lacks adoption-driving policies that have led to faster innovation in combination with regulation in other sectors.</p>
<h2>A motivating precedent: EV incentives in the U.S.</h2>
<p>So how could the EC promote much faster AI innovation while enacting regulatory guardrails? The example of electric vehicles in the United States provides a guide.</p>
<p>The U.S. has become a leader in electric car production because of a combination of entrepreneurship, regulations and smart market creation incentives.</p>
<p>Tesla invigorated the electric car industry with the insight that the new vanguard of electric cars should be desirable, high-performance sports cars.</p>
<p>The Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) regulations created a stick that required the development of more efficient vehicles. Generous tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles helped directly accelerate vehicle sales without interfering with the natural, competitive market dynamics. The combination of CAFE regulations, tax credits and entrepreneurial companies like Tesla has created such a massive boost to innovation that electric vehicle engines are poised to become less expensive than internal combustion ones.</p>
<h2>Getting AI incentives right: Three additional initiatives to pursue</h2>
<p>The EC has an opportunity to achieve something similar with AI. Specifically, the EC should consider combining these current regulations with three additional initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Create tax incentives for companies to build or buy high-risk AI systems that adhere to these regulations. </strong>The EC should seek to proactively use AI to help meet economic and societal goals.</p>
<p>For example, some banks are using AI to better assess the creditworthiness of individuals with limited credit histories, while simultaneously working to ensure that banking activities are free from bias. This increases financial inclusion, a goal shared by governments, and represents a win-win AI innovation.</p>
<p><strong>Further reduce uncertainty around EC legislative implementation. </strong>Part of this can be done directly by the EC &#8212; through the development of more specific standards around AI quality management and fairness. However, there may be even greater value in bringing together a coalition of AI technology providers and user organizations to translate these standards into practical steps for compliance.</p>
<p>For example, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has orchestrated an industry consortium for banks, insurers and AI technology providers called <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2021/veritas-initiative-addresses-implementation-challenges">Veritas</a> to achieve similar goals for its Fairness, Ethics, Accountability and Transparency (FEAT) guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Consider accelerating the adoption of the AI quality management systems that the legislation requires by funding companies to build or buy these systems.</strong> There is significant academic and commercial activity already in this space, in areas such as explainability of black box models, assessment of potential discrimination due to data or algorithmic bias, and testing and monitoring of AI systems for their ability to survive significant changes in data.</p>
<p>By creating the conditions to encourage widespread adoption of such technologies, the EC should be able to meet the dual objectives of encouraging innovation <em>and</em> enabling compliance with the new legislation in a sustainable manner.</p>
<p>If the EC assertively reduces uncertainty, promotes the use of regulated, “high-risk” AI and encourages the use of AI quality management techniques, then it has the chance to become the global leader in AI innovation while providing critical protection to its citizens. We should all be pulling for them to be successful, as it would set an example for the world to follow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is making a change to its App Store <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=j5uyprul">by returning the &#8220;Report a Problem&#8221; link</a> to App Store product pages across iOS 15, iPadOS 15 and macOS Monterey devices. The link offers an easy way for users to report issues they&#8217;re having with an app, including whether it contains offensive or illegal content, or whether it was attempting to scam consumers out of their money. Apple had removed the consumer-friendly &#8220;Report a Problem&#8221; button from the App Store years ago, possibly to its detriment. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/06/06/apple-app-store-scams-fraud/">New reports have suggested</a> that many of the top apps are scams costing consumers millions and Apple has even been questioned by Congress over the situation.</p>
<p>The button&#8217;s return <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/apple-makes-it-easier-to-report-bad-apps-and-scams/">was spotted earlier this week</a>, but Apple didn&#8217;t officially announce it until today.</p>
<p>The company says the new feature is currently available in the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and will make its way to other markets over time. (Technically, however, the feature isn&#8217;t new &#8212; a button like this used to be a key feature in the App Store&#8217;s early days.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213681" style="width: 277px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213681" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2213681" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/117773.image0_.jpg?w=267" alt="" width="267" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/117773.image0_.jpg 267w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/117773.image0_.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/117773.image0_.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/117773.image0_.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 267px) 100vw, 267px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2213681" class="wp-caption-text">Example of old App Store with Report a Problem button.<strong> Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.dummies.com/consumer-electronics/smartphones/iphone/how-to-report-an-app-problem-from-your-iphone/">Dummies.com</a> <span class="screen-reader-text">opens in a new window)</span></p></div></p>
<p>The button appears only on apps consumers have installed.</p>
<p>When clicked, consumers will be able to select from options like &#8220;Report a scam or fraud” and “Report offensive, abusive, or illegal content&#8221; at <a href="https://reportaproblem.apple.com/">reportaproblem.apple.com</a>. They will also be able to report issues with free apps that don&#8217;t include in-app purchases.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213693" style="width: 481px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213693" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2213693" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1330.jpg?w=471" alt="" width="471" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1330.jpg 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1330.jpg?resize=104,150 104w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1330.jpg?resize=208,300 208w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1330.jpg?resize=768,1109 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1330.jpg?resize=471,680 471w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1330.jpg?resize=1064,1536 1064w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1330.jpg?resize=35,50 35w" sizes="(max-width: 471px) 100vw, 471px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2213693" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Store screenshot, Oct. 2021</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple&#8217;s App Review, Discovery Fraud and Live Moderation, and Financial Fraud teams will investigate these reported problems for signs of fraud, manipulation, abuse and other violations of the App Store Review Guidelines, Apple says. They will then reach out to developers to resolve the issues they uncover. There is no mention of any sort of immediate financial relief offered to consumers, however. Consumers still have to request refunds from this page as a separate process.</p>
<p>App Store scams have become more obvious, egregious, and, in many cases, more profitable since Apple shifted to the subscription model years ago. Almost immediately, bad actors took advantage of built-in tools to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/15/sneaky-subscriptions-are-plaguing-the-app-store/">trick consumers into subscriptions,</a> leading Apple to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/28/apples-new-developer-guidelines-signal-that-scammy-subscription-apps-time-is-up/">release new guidelines</a> aimed at catching developers attempting to use &#8220;dark patterns&#8221; or other deceptive measures in their subscription apps.</p>
<p>One developer, in particular, Kosta Eleftheriou &#8212; who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/fleksy-co-founder-is-suing-apple-over-lost-revenue-resulting-from-app-store-scammers/">filed a lawsuit against</a> Apple over revenue lost to scammers &#8212; has been making it his mission to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou">highlight</a> some of the worst scams on the App Store.</p>
<p>In addition to the scams that impacted his own business, where a rip-off of his Apple Watch app reportedly scammed consumers out of millions, he&#8217;s also uncovered scams that ended up making headlines because of how bold or disastrous they were for the end users. This included a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/30/trezor-scam-bitcoin-1-million/">crypto wallet app that scammed</a> the user out of his life savings (~$600,000) in bitcoin; a kids&#8217; game that actually <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/15/app-store-scam-is-a-kids-game-with-a-hidden-online-casino/">contained a hidden online casino</a>; and a VPN app <a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/another-ios-vpn-app-scam-is-uncovered_id131487">that was scamming users out of $5 million</a> per year.</p>
<p>Eleftheriou tells us he&#8217;s now looking into another case of App Store fraud, which he expects to publish soon, where a developer with millions of app downloads has been raking in tens of millions in revenue.</p>
<p>Eleftheriou&#8217;s work has raised questions about how much Apple has invested in fighting App Store fraud. After all, if a single developer can uncover scam after scam in his free time, why can&#8217;t the <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/apple/marketcap/">world&#8217;s most valuable</a> company?</p>
<p>In fact, Eleftheriou <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1398726525504036865">even built a system</a> to help him dig up the scams more easily. Called &#8220;Bunco Squad,&#8221; his tool offers a dashboard that displays an app&#8217;s metrics &#8212; like ratings, reviews, downloads and revenue, among other things, and assigns the app a trust score. As many scammers buy fake ratings, it&#8217;s fairly straightforward to locate potential scams by comparing an app&#8217;s overall star rating to a rating calculated only from written reviews.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The best way to complain is to build it yourself. <a href="https://t.co/Wm1PQQ3PyY">https://t.co/Wm1PQQ3PyY</a> <a href="https://t.co/Y8uVkitSOL">pic.twitter.com/Y8uVkitSOL</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1398726525504036865?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Eleftheriou tried to publish &#8220;Bunco Squad&#8221; to the App Store, where it was &#8212; not surprisingly &#8212; rejected. Apple told him some of the information the app offered may be inaccurate, he says.</p>
<p>Issues around App Store fraud have even made their way to Congress this year.</p>
<p>Apple had been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/apple-downplays-complaints-about-app-store-scams-in-antitrust-hearing/">questioned</a> about its seeming inability to rein in App Store scammers during a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/senate-antitrust-hearing-apple-tile-spotify-match-epic/">Senate antitrust hearing</a> in April. The company, in part, has justified the commissions it charges developers because of the work it does to maintain a safe and trusted app marketplace &#8212; which includes fighting fraud on developers&#8217; behalf. The Senators wanted to know why, then, we had to rely on journalists and other &#8220;open source reporting&#8221; (a comment likely referring to public efforts, like those from Eleftheriou), to uncover such App Store scams.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s response at the time was that fighting security and fraud was a &#8220;cat-and-mouse&#8221; game and that it was working to improve.</p>
<p>With today&#8217;s announcement, Apple appears to acknowledge that fighting fraud effectively may require public input.</p>
<p>The company also issued a statement, of sorts, in its <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=j5uyprul">announcement</a> about the App Store change which is likely meant to squash the rumblings that it isn&#8217;t working hard enough on fighting fraud because scam app revenue contributes to App Store profits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Problematic apps diminish the App Store experience for users and developers, and we’re constantly expanding techniques to identify even more types of problematic content for removal. If we suspect that a developer has engaged in purposeful manipulation, fraud or abuse, we will notify them and take action,&#8221; the company said, adding that problematic apps may be removed and their developers may lose their membership in the Apple Developer Program.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are deeply committed to protecting users from problematic apps so that the App Store continues to provide an incredible opportunity for all developers,&#8221; Apple added.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We caught up with Sila co-founder and CEO Gene Berdichevsky to explore how founders should think about scaling, how they should approach funding and why they should tackle the hardest problem first.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the last decade, battery chemistry company Sila has been working to replace the graphite anode in lithium-ion batteries with silicon, a material that&#8217;s easier to come by, more environmentally friendly and allows for a battery cell that&#8217;s denser and cheaper.</p>
<p>In September,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/sila-nanotechnologiess-first-next-gen-battery-will-launch-in-whoop-wearables/"> the company shipped its first commercial product with Whoop wearables</a>. Now, Sila aims to scale 100x so it can provide its battery chemistry to power electric vehicles by 2025.</p>
<p>Before Sila was founded, co-founder and CEO Gene Berdichevsky was the seventh employee at Tesla, where he spearheaded the production of the battery pack that was used in the Tesla Roadster, the world&#8217;s first highway-legal electric vehicle that ran on lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<p>Considering his background and experience with scale, we caught up with Berdichevsky to explore how founders who work on emerging tech should think about scaling, how they should approach funding and why they should go after the hardest problem first.</p>
<h2>Scaling as a part of the innovation process</h2>
<p>Billions of dollars have gone into producing different battery chemistries to make better, cheaper and more efficient batteries, but Berdichevsky says there&#8217;s a reason they haven&#8217;t hit the market yet. A startup could produce a stellar new technology, but if it can&#8217;t scale, no one will buy it.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things we did very early on is, we told our scientists and engineers they could only use global commodity inputs so that we know we can make enough for millions of cars,&#8221; Berdichevsky told TechCrunch. &#8220;You can&#8217;t use anything bespoke; you can&#8217;t say we&#8217;ll figure it out later.&#8221;</p>
<p>Supply chains are strained, particularly as COVID-19 drags on, so it is key to build technology that can scale quickly and cheaply. To do this, Sila also uses bulk manufacturing techniques and ensures its technology can seamlessly drop into any battery factory and existing cells.</p>
<p>To date, Sila has raised $925 million off the back of this strategy.</p>
<h2>Funding is a means to an end</h2>

with Varun Ganapathi (Akasa)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Digital transformation efforts in a number of industries have driven massive adoption of robotic process automation (RPA) over the past decade. The hard truth is that RPA is a decades-old technology that is brittle with real limits to its capabilities. It will always have some value in automating work that is simple, discrete, and linear. However, the reason automation efforts often fall short of their aspirations is because so much of life is complex and constantly evolving &#8211; too much work falls outside of the capabilities of RPA. In this talk, Varun Ganapathi, Ph.D., Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer of AKASA will discuss how exceptions and outliers can actually make automation stronger and how emerging machine-learning-based technology platforms combined with human-in-the-loop approaches are already expanding what it is possible to automate across a number of industries.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM plans to roll out a new, more capable hands-free driving assistance system in 2023 that will be able to handle 95% of all driving scenarios <span style="font-weight: 400;">and eventually be used on every paved road in the U.S. and Canada.</span></p>
<p>The automaker revealed the new Ultra Cruise system, along with some details on how it functions, during its two-day investor event that kicked off Wednesday. GM did not share information on what it will charge for this system and whether it will be a flat fee or subscription-based.</p>
<p>GM is sticking to the same cautious and slow-roll strategy it used when it launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/gm-is-bringing-its-upgraded-hands-free-super-cruise-driving-system-to-six-vehicles-in-2022/">Super Cruise</a>, a hands-free driver assistance system that it introduced in 2017. That means this newer system will first be released as an option in the Cadillac models and then slowly become available in other GM brands such as GMC and Chevrolet.</p>
<p>It will also be limited in the beginning, although far less than its predecessor system. Drivers who have vehicles with Ultra Cruise will be able to access the system on more than 2 million miles of roads at launch in the United States and Canada. That will eventually grow up to 3.4 million miles, the company said. And unlike the initial version of Super Cruise, this system is designed to work on city and subdivision streets and paved rural roads in addition to highways.</p>
<p>Notably, Super Cruise is not going away. That system, which more recently was upgraded to allow for automatic lane changes and towing support, will continue to be offered as an option by GM.</p>
<h2>Super Cruise versus Ultra Cruise</h2>
<p>Super Cruise uses a combination of lidar map data, high-precision GPS, cameras and radar sensors, as well as a driver attention system, which monitors the person behind the wheel to ensure they’re paying attention. Unlike Tesla’s Autopilot driver assistance system, users of Super Cruise do not need to have their hands on the wheel. However, their eyes must remain directed straight ahead.</p>
<p>The same is true for Ultra Cruise. Jason Ditman, a chief engineer in GM&#8217;s automated driving group, noted several times during a briefing with reporters that Ultra Cruise is designed as a so-called Level 2 system. While its functionality might be more robust and it will be available on more roads, it will still require the driver to pay attention at all times.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This means it is not a &#8220;fully autonomous&#8221; Level 4 system, a level of functionality that means the vehicle can handle all driving without the need of a human, in certain conditions. Level 4 systems are what companies like GM subsidiary Cruise is working to commercialize through a robotaxi application.</p>
<p>Ultra Cruise was designed to build on the capabilities of its Super Cruise system. Ultra Cruise also works through a combination of cameras, radars and lidar, developing accurate, 360-degree, three-dimensional statistical representations of the environment surrounding vehicles with redundancies in critical areas. The company is relying more on its sensors than mapping however.</p>
<p>Together, this means the system will be able to react to traffic lights, follow navigation routes, maintain and follow speed limits, support automatic and on-demand lane changes, make left- and right-hand turns, avoid objects and park in residential driveways.</p>
<p>In addition, Ultra Cruise uses an integrated lidar behind the windshield. The next-generation system is powered by 5-nanometer, scalable compute architecture that works in concert with GM&#8217;s Ultifi software platform and its so-called vehicle intelligence platform, or VIP.</p>
<p>GM last week said it was developing a new end-to-end software platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/general-motors-new-software-platform-ultifi-is-coming-to-vehicles-starting-in-2023/">Ultifi,</a> that will be in vehicles starting in 2023. GM says the software will offer an array of capabilities, including giving drivers access to in-car subscriptions and using over-the-air updates to offer new apps and services.<br />
The software platform will be built on top of the company&#8217;s VIP, an underlying hardware architecture that provides greater data processing power.</p>
<p>Like Super Cruise, this new system will have a driver monitoring system. It is also building out a human-machine interface that will give the driver information they need, including when they need to be in control of the vehicle. GM describes the main HMI as a freeform display directly in the driver&#8217;s line of sight.</p>
<p>GM is also developing an Ultra Cruise app that can be viewed on the vehicle&#8217;s center display when parked. The app will provide more centrally located information, including driver statistics, trips and history.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Video sharing platforms that offer a service in the UK have to comply with new regulations intended to protect users and under 18s from harmful content such as hate speech and videos/ads likely to incite violence again protected groups.</p>
<p>Ofcom, the country&#8217;s comms, broadcast and &#8212; in an expanding role &#8212; Internet content regulator, has published the <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0014/226301/statement-vsp-harms-guidance.pdf">guidance</a> for platforms like TikTok, Snapchat, Vimeo and Twitch today.</p>
<p>Among the requirements for in-scope services are that they must take &#8220;appropriate measures&#8221; to protect users from harmful material.</p>
<p>Terrorist content, child sexual abuse material, racism and xenophobia also fall under the &#8216;harmful content&#8217; bracket.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/news-centre/2021/better-protections-from-harmful-online-videos">press release</a> the regulator said its <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0024/216492/yonder-report-experience-of-potential-harms-vsps.pdf">research</a> shows that a third of UK Internet users say they have witnessed or experienced hateful content; a quarter claim they’ve been exposed to violent or disturbing content; while one in five have been exposed to videos or content that encouraged racism.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="HMm60o2Rs6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/uk-now-expects-compliance-with-its-child-privacy-design-code/">UK now expects compliance with children&#8217;s privacy design code</a></p></blockquote>

<p>There is no prescriptive list of what measures video sharing platforms must use to prevent users being exposed to such content.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But there are a number of recommendations &#8212; such as clauses in terms and conditions; functionality like the ability for uploaders to declare if their content contains an ad; and user-friendly mechanisms for viewers to report or flag harmful content, as well as transparent complaints procedures.</p>
<p>Age assurance systems are also recommended, as are the inclusion of parental controls &#8212; as the regulation has the specific aim of protecting under-18s from viewing videos and adverts containing restricted material.</p>
<p>Ofcom is also recommending &#8220;robust&#8221; age-verification for video-sharing platforms that host pornography in order to prevent under 18s from viewing adult material.</p>
<p>A list of video sharing platforms that have notified themselves to Ofcom as under scope of the regulations can be <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/information-for-industry/vsp-regulation/notified-video-sharing-platforms">found here</a>. (As well as the aforementioned platform giants it also includes the likes of OnlyFans, Triller and Recast.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We are recommending providers put in place systematic risk management processes to help providers to identify and implement measures that are practicable and proportionate,&#8221; Ofcom goes on to say in the guidance to video sharing platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we acknowledge that harmful material may not be completely eradicated from a platform, we expect providers to make meaningful efforts to prevent users from encountering it,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;The VSP [aka video sharing platform] Regime is about platform’s safety systems and processes, not about regulating individual videos, however evidence of a prevalence of harmful material on a platform may require closer scrutiny.&#8221;</p>
<p>The regulator says it will want to understand measures platforms have in place, as well as their effectiveness at protecting users &#8212; and &#8220;any processes which have informed a provider’s decisions about which protection measures to use&#8221;. So platforms will need to document and be able to justify their decisions if the regulator comes calling, such as following a complaint.</p>
<p>Monitoring tech platforms&#8217; compliance with the new requirements will be a key new Ofcom role &#8212; and a taster of what is to come under incoming and far more broad-brush safety-focused digital regulations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Along with engagement with providers themselves, we expect to inform our understanding of whether users are being effectively protected, for example by monitoring complaints and engaging with interested parties such as charities, NGOs and tech safety groups,&#8221; Ofcom also writes, adding that this engagement will play an important part in supporting its decisions about &#8220;areas of focus&#8221;.</p>
<p>Ofcom&#8217;s role as an Internet content regulator will be fleshed out in the coming years as the government works to pass legislation that will impose a wide-ranging duty of care on digital service providers of all stripes, instructing them to handle user-generated content in a way that prevents people &#8212; and especially children &#8212; from being exposed to illegal and/or harmful stuff.</p>
<p>A key appointment &#8212; the chair of Ofcom &#8212; has been delayed as the government decided to rerun the competition for the role.</p>
<p>Reports have suggested the government wants the former editor of the Daily Mail to take the post but an independent panel involved in the initial selection process <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-57280438">rejected Paul Dacre as an unsuitable candidate</a> earlier this year. (It is unclear whether the government will continue to try to parachute Dacre into the job.)</p>
<p>Ofcom, meanwhile, has been regulating video on-demand services in the UK since 2010.</p>
<p>But the video-sharing framework is a separate regulatory instrument that&#8217;s intended to respond to differences in the level of control as video-sharing platforms provide tools to allow users to upload their own content.</p>
<p>However this newer framework is set to be superseded by new legislation under the incoming online safety regulatory framework.</p>
<p>So these regulations for video sharing platforms are something of a placeholder and a taster as UK lawmakers grapple with laying down more comprehensive online safety rules which will apply much more widely.</p>
<p>Still, in the guidance Ofcom describes the VSP Regime as &#8220;an important precursor to the future Online Safety legislation&#8221;, adding:  &#8220;Given the two regimes’ shared objective to improve user safety by requiring services to protect users through the adoption of appropriate systems and processes, Ofcom considers that compliance with the VSP regime will assist services in preparing for compliance with the online safety regime as described by Government in the draft Online Safety Bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>The UK&#8217;s data protection regulation is also already enforcing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/uk-now-expects-compliance-with-its-child-privacy-design-code/">a set of &#8216;age appropriate&#8217; design requirements</a> for digital services that are likely to be accessed by children.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Move over, precision agriculture — precision <em>apiculture</em> is what&#8217;s on the minds of all future-focused farmers. BeeHero has been growing fast since its debut and seed round last year, and $19M in new funding means it can scale beyond its initial markets and find more uses for its one-of-a-kind collection of data collected from thousands of active honeybee hives.</p>
<p>The company empowers hives with IoT tech, making it possible to track the movements and health of their bees practically in real time and catch things like mite infestations before they go too far. The result is huge improvements to crop yields, healthier hives, and less trips in the tractor. The ordinary method of placing hives and then driving out to check on them every few weeks is slow and inefficient; a hive may have collapsed during that time, or is pollinating ineffectively, condemning acres of fields to an unproductive season.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way pollination is handled today is challenging,&#8221; BeeHero CEO and co-founder Omer Davidi said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a shortage of hives; you get a box, you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s inside, you just hope for the best. This is not an effective way to strategize your pollination. You need to understand the stressors, the variety of inputs and outputs&#8230; but to do this with older, less data intensive industries is hard.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212826" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-illus.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212826" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2212826" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-illus.jpg" alt="Beehives illustrated with labels describing problems they might be facing, like mites." width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-illus.jpg 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-illus.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-illus.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-illus.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-illus.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-illus.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-illus.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-illus.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2212826" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BeeHero</p></div></p>
<p>Despite the challenges of essentially launching during the initial panicked months of the pandemic, Davidi said that their traction was remarkable once they figured out how to make that connection with farmers, many of whom are slowly but surely adopting modern solutions. They&#8217;re skeptical of the benefits and understandably suspect startup founders offering quick solutions (via video calls and virtual demos, no less) of being charlatans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Originally I said, guys, we have to tell everyone we&#8217;ve increased sunflowers or cashews by a hundred percent! But you have to be careful. They&#8217;ve been doing this the same way for generations. When you come out of nowhere saying &#8216;I&#8217;ve figured it all out,&#8217; you lose credibility immediately,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;So we had to under-promise and over-deliver, and it pushed us to build a lower touch onboarding process. Then once they see the results, they want to do it year after year.&#8221;</p>
<p>The work has paid off, however, and BeeHero is now working with several of the top almond growers in California, which dominates the production of that crop globally. By the end of the year it expects to manage 100,000 hives and be the biggest pollination provider in the U.S. (they&#8217;re currently the fourth largest).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212825" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-app.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212825" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2212825" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-app.jpg" alt="The BeeHero app on a smartphone showing hive health metrics." width="1024" height="673" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-app.jpg 1929w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-app.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-app.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-app.jpg?resize=768,504 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-app.jpg?resize=680,447 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-app.jpg?resize=1536,1009 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/beehero-app.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2212825" class="wp-caption-text">The BeeHero app on a smartphone showing hive health metrics.</p></div></p>
<p>The $15M A round comes from ADM Capital, Rabo Food and Agri Innovation Fund, iAngels, FirstTime, J-Ventures, UpWest, Entrée Capital, Good Company, the Arison Group, and Gaingels. The company has also won $4M in grants from the European Commission, the BIRD Foundation, and the Israel Innovation Authority.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The primary goal of the raise is to expand beyond the U.S. and almonds. The plan is to expand first to berries, avocados, and apples, then to crops like sunflower and soybeans. Even greenhouse crops like tomatoes might be possible. Australia and Europe are both on the list, but it depends on partnerships and other factors, though at least the money&#8217;s there.</p>
<p>Davidi is hoping that the growing bee activity database will prove an invaluable resource in other ways, though he was realistic about the stage they&#8217;re in.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a data scientist, I can tell you: we know nothing,&#8221; he admitted. But &#8220;we&#8221; means the industry in general, and BeeHero is building by far the largest collection of bee-adjacent data out there. Knowing how hives and pollination react to different weather patterns, crops and planting styles, pesticides, invasive species (they&#8217;re watching for murder hornets) and a dozen other factors would be tremendously valuable and the company&#8217;s work is only beginning.</p>
<div class="embed-vimeo embed breakout embed--video" style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/431706289" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;For instance, we&#8217;re only just learning this, but bees know about rainfall 30 minutes before it happens,&#8221; Davidi said. Why? How? They have guesses, but whatever the case, it could be a useful data point for farmers — and probably for apiculture generally.</p>
<p>Research partnerships with the World Bee Project and Japan&#8217;s Ministry of Culture, among others in the academic sphere and beyond, show that there is untapped potential in this trove of data. With pollination so important to maintaining the world&#8217;s food supply and bees subject to an increasing number of threats, we&#8217;ll take any insights we can get.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">In a <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/pausing-instagram-kids">blog post</a> announcing plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/instagram-puts-kids-version-on-ice-after-critical-backlash/">temporarily stop developing a new app targeted at children</a>, Instagram head Adam Mosseri wrote, &#8220;the reality is that kids are already online, and we believe that developing age-appropriate experiences designed specifically for them is far better for parents than where we are today.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s rare that I find common ground with the head of Instagram, but he is right about this point. Kids and tweens need access to technology that meets their unique needs.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s just dead wrong about the solution.</p>
<p>Instagram Kids is a terrible idea, and, thankfully, plans for the pint-size version of the app have been put on hold. This development comes on the heels of yet another controversy — this one about the effects Instagram has on young people&#8217;s mental health. Instagram’s internal research suggests that the platform can be a toxic place for teens.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			It&#8217;s possible for companies to build platforms that better support parents, kids and tweens — but it can&#8217;t be done by moving fast and breaking things.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As a father and the founder of a tech company for kids, I always felt that platforms built on social validation, comparison and FOMO weren&#8217;t appropriate for younger users. And even though Facebook claimed in public that their research suggested a net-positive effect on mental health, behind closed doors, they had evidence that might not be the case.</p>
<p>Despite all this, I know that healthy technology for kids does exist. It&#8217;s possible for companies to build platforms that better support parents, kids and tweens — but it can&#8217;t be done by moving fast and breaking things.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Kids are growing up connected</h2>
<p>Technology is an ever-present part of our lives and the lives of our children. According to <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/the-common-sense-census-media-use-by-kids-age-zero-to-eight-2020">Common Sense Media&#8217;s 2020 census</a> on media use, kids from birth to age 8 have almost two and a half hours of screen time daily.</p>
<p>And that was <em>before</em> COVID-19 shuttered schools and made playdates impossible. Kids have turned to screens for remote learning, entertainment, and socializing with friends and family, and many parents will tell you that this increased screen time is a serious source of anxiety.</p>
<p>I believe that lots of parents inherently see the value in technology, especially when it&#8217;s been a lifeline keeping us connected during a pandemic. But there&#8217;s ambivalence baked in here since there&#8217;s a serious dearth of high-quality, safe environments for kids online. As a result, families turn to platforms that were never designed to meet the needs of children, often at the cost of their peace of mind.</p>
<h2>Retrofitting adult platforms isn&#8217;t the answer</h2>
<p>When you think of popular kids&#8217; apps, what comes to mind? Facebook Messenger Kids? YouTube Kids? These platforms all have something in common: They&#8217;re repackaged versions of adult apps, and they&#8217;ve had safety- and privacy-related scandals. That&#8217;s because adult apps simply don&#8217;t retrofit well for children. There are a few different reasons for this.</p>
<p>First, a lot of adult platforms are designed to be sticky. This is reflected in features like endless feeds, auto-playing content and arbitrary &#8220;streaks.&#8221;</p>
<p>These apps also have a way of using our own psychology against us to keep us scrolling. They exploit our need to belong by quantifying social validation. Because of follower counts, like buttons, comments and shares, we can see exactly how popular we are — and we can compare our metrics to others. Many adults can find these features anxiety inducing, and I don&#8217;t believe they belong in platforms designed for young users with brains that are still developing. They show up again and again in retrofitted apps for children because they&#8217;re at the core of these products.</p>
<p>Second, many tech platforms are wide-open networks. This is not the one-way media that we grew up with. Lots of social and gaming platforms encourage users to amass friends and followers and exchange messages and comments, which can pose serious safety risks for young, inexperienced internet users.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.thorn.org/thorn-research-minors-perspectives-on-disclosing-reporting-and-blocking/">report from Thorn</a> found that scores of children are using adult platforms before they turn 13, and a startling majority of them encounter &#8220;abuse, harassment or sexual solicitation from adults.&#8221;</p>
<p>When companies try to retrofit platforms for kids that eliminate the stranger danger, they&#8217;ve had varied success. Facebook Messenger Kids infamously included a design flaw that allowed children to connect and chat with strangers. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s really difficult to take an open network and work backward to lock it up. When it comes to safety, you really need to start from the ground up.</p>
<p>Finally, retrofitted platforms rarely appeal to kids the same way that their adult counterparts do. Ask any parent: Kids love YouTube. Not so much with YouTube Kids. Children are always in a hurry to grow up. They want to feel empowered, and mini versions of adult apps do the opposite. It&#8217;s the technical version of the kids&#8217; table, so getting buy-in from young users can be a struggle.</p>
<h2>Parental controls can only take you so far</h2>
<p>With all the dangers that exist out there for children online, you might think that parental controls are the obvious answer. That&#8217;s clearly what Facebook is thinking with their plans for Instagram Kids. But if you ask me, no parental control in the world will stop kids from comparing themselves to others. Again, it&#8217;s inherent to the platform.</p>
<p>Parental controls also won&#8217;t stop kids from finding creative workarounds. Children are resourceful when they want to circumvent screen time limits. They&#8217;re often just tiny, motivated hackers. With all that in mind, the best thing parents can do is get involved — like, really involved — with their kids&#8217; digital lives.</p>
<h2>Build a foundation with parental involvement and co-play</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever googled &#8220;screen time recommendations,&#8221; you already know that experts in digital parenting rarely agree on anything. But one thing we hear consistently is that parents need to be involved in their kids&#8217; digital lives.</p>
<p>We need to explore and play together. This gives us the chance to model appropriate behaviors for children and educate them about the big, bad online world. It&#8217;s also a lovely way to spend quality time with your kids. Ask them about the games they like. Get them to teach you how they work. Dedicate one night a week to enjoy screen time together.</p>
<p>When tech companies sell parental controls as the ultimate answer for kids&#8217; apps, they&#8217;re doing us a disservice. Rules and restrictions are obviously important, but what we truly need are opportunities to use technology together with our kids. We need apps that the whole family can enjoy together — not just where parents can toggle a switch, set a limit and leave.</p>
<p>We need to think beyond parental controls if we want to help children develop healthy relationships with technology. We need to talk to them about social validation. We need to make sure they understand their digital footprints. And we need to help them understand what motivates Big Tech companies.</p>
<p>A junior version of Instagram won&#8217;t make the internet a better place for kids or parents. It&#8217;ll just hook &#8217;em young — which is something Facebook is clearly motivated to do.</p>
<p>Thankfully, plans for the new platform have been paused, but I sincerely hope they abandon it altogether. Facebook has a questionable track record, and it’s probably not the right company to develop products for children. And Instagram is definitely the wrong template.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new proposed law would compel businesses in the U.S. to disclose any ransomware payments within 48 hours of the transaction.</p>
<p>The bicameral <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-and-ross-introduce-bill-to-require-disclosures-of-ransomware-payments">Ransom Disclosure Act</a>, drafted by Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Deborah Ross, would mandate companies and organizations — though not individuals — to provide the U.S. Department of Homeland Security data on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> payments, including the amount and type of cryptocurrency demanded and the sum that was paid.</p>
<p>The bill aims to bolster the U.S. government&#8217;s understanding of how cybercriminal enterprises operate and help officials develop a fuller picture of the ransomware threat. While ransom payments are typically made in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/bitcoin/">bitcoin</a>, security experts say threat actors are increasingly moving towards &#8220;privacy coins,&#8221; such as Monero, which make it harder for investigators to trace where the money goes.</p>

</ul>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The Ransom Disclosure Act would also require Homeland Security to set up a website for organizations to voluntarily report payment of ransoms, as well as to share information disclosed during the previous year, excluding identifying information about the entities that paid up. Similar <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/this-crowdsourced-payments-tracker-wants-to-solve-the-ransomware-visibility-problem/">efforts by security researchers already exist</a>.</p>
<p>Warren says these measures are needed due to the “skyrocketing” number of ransomware attacks; attacks rose by 158% in North America last year, and <a href="http://ct.symplicity.com/t/wrn/074b653b76f3ff9a6a5455e38def601a/4262265609/realurl=https:/www.cnbc.com/2021/06/10/heres-how-much-ransomware-attacks-are-costing-the-american-economy.html">victims worldwide paid nearly $350 million</a> in ransom  – a more than 300% increase over 2019, data shows. What&#8217;s more, recent research found that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/ransomware-recovery-can-be-costly-and-not-just-because-of-the-ransom/">ransom payments account for just 20% of the total cost of a ransomware attack</a>, with businesses suffering the majority of their losses through lost productivity and post-attack recovery.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We lack critical data to go after cybercriminals,&#8221; said Warren. &#8220;My bill with [Representative] Ross would set disclosure requirements when ransoms are paid and allow us to learn how much money cybercriminals are siphoning from American entities to finance criminal enterprises &#8212; and help us go after them.&#8221;</p>
<p>It’s not the only tactic the U.S. is employing in a bid to crackdown on ransomware.</p>
<p>Last month, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/us-treasury-sanctions-suex-ransomware/">the Treasury Department issued first of its kind sanctions against cryptocurrency exchange Suex</a> for its role in facilitating ransom payments after finding that over 40% of its total transactions were associated with bad activity. The Treasury also recently warned American companies that they are prohibited from paying threat actors based in countries subject to U.S. sanctions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There are still founders in Latin America that are not benefiting from the funding boom, which implies that there is more capacity to absorb capital there than is currently being taken advantage of.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Regions once overlooked by the venture capital industry are racking up impressive investment totals in recent quarters. African startups, for example, were long ignored by the global VC scene, with totals for the continent’s upstart technology companies representing a fraction of a fraction of the funds made available to other regions’ next-generation companies.</p>
<p>But in recent years, investment into African tech companies has surged, and just today, investment company Juven <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/goldman-sachs-spinoff-juven-to-back-african-tech-companies-with-large-checks/">announced plans to boost its investments in the continent</a>, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/google-sets-up-50m-fund-to-invest-in-african-startups/">Google set aside $50 million to do the same</a>.</p>

<hr />
<p>Latin America’s startup scene is similar to Africa’s in terms of attracting outside interest, but a few years further down the road. Reporting that SoftBank <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/softbank-commits-3b-more-to-investing-in-latin-american-tech-companies/">will put another $3 billion in the area’s startups</a> was news, sure, but not a shocking announcement last month. The Japanese conglomerate and investing powerhouse had already put $5 billion to work in Latin America.</p>
<p>Ahead of Q3 numbers that will update our thinking about the current state of the Latin American startup market, we wanted to dive into the structural forces in the region to better understand the impending numbers. So, The Exchange reached out to investors in Latin America for a little behind-the-numbers digging. We got a hold of Magma’s <a href="https://twitter.com/nathanlustig">Nathan Lustig</a>, Atlantico’s <a href="https://twitter.com/JulioCV">Julio Vasconcellos</a> and ALLVP’s <a href="https://twitter.com/Antorojase">Antonia Rojas</a> to flesh out our thinking.</p>

<p>We’ll talk a little bit about what is driving capital flows in Latin America, the pace of investing and whether it can stay high, why China is part of the conversation and where there may yet be overlooked companies that investors are missing thanks to institutional blind spots. Let’s go!</p>
<h2>What is driving the money?</h2>
<p>Latin America boasts 26 unicorns as of August, according to <a href="https://www.atlantico.vc/latin-america-digital-transformation-report">Atlantico&#8217;s 2021 digital transformation report</a>, a must-read that serves as a backdrop for today&#8217;s piece. As Vasconcellos clarified for us via email, the number reflects the fact that eight new unicorns were minted in 2021. For comparison, there were only four unicorns in the region in 2018 &#8212; and it wasn&#8217;t necessarily obvious at the time that several Latin American companies would go on to list their shares publicly, both in the U.S. (VTEX, dLocal) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/as-its-startup-market-accelerates-brazil-could-be-in-for-an-ipo-bonanza/">in Brazil</a>.</p>
<p>Another interesting data point is that the cumulative market cap of Latin American unicorns has already more than doubled. According to Atlantico, their total post-money valuation went from $46 billion in 2020 to $105 billion as of August 2021.</p>
<p>This is also reflected in funding tallies: Per <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/crunchbase-unicorn-board-1000-companies/">Crunchbase data</a>, venture capital funding into the region&#8217;s unicorns reached $10 billion this year to date. <a href="https://twitter.com/marceloclaure/status/1445373440006017024">Commenting</a> on the data, SoftBank Group International CEO and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/latin-america-finds-a-champion-in-softbank-international-group-ceo-marcelo-claure/">Latin America champion</a> Marcelo Claure wrote that &#8220;it ratifies the potential of Latin America and the incredible effect that the SoftBank Latin America fund has had in the region.&#8221; And there&#8217;s more to come: During TechCrunch Disrupt, Claure said that SoftBank can be expected to deploy between $8 billion to $10 billion of capital into Latin America in 2022.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more interestingly, unicorns are driving a self-reinforcing trend, ALLVP&#8217;s Rojas told TechCrunch. Highlighting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/uber-to-become-the-sole-owner-of-grocery-delivery-startup-cornershop/">Uber&#8217;s acquisition</a> of ALLVP&#8217;s portfolio company Cornershop, she wrote that the deal &#8220;generated a virtuous circle, in which investors all over the world increased their confidence in our region and in the fact that it’s possible to realize amazing returns while changing the way traditional industries operate.&#8221; Vasconcellos concurred, noting that &#8220;the boom in unicorns and IPOs coming from the region … shows that success is possible and attracts more global capital.&#8221;</p>
<p>But taking a step back, what is driving these cycles is what the Atlantico report refers to as &#8220;the second wave&#8221; of digital transformation. In a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/latin-americas-second-wave-of-digital-transformation/">guest post on TechCrunch</a>, Vasconcellos explained it as the &#8220;second- and third-order effects of the [COVID-19] crisis,&#8221; which has accelerated the ongoing &#8220;continentwide tech expansion to a pace beyond any projections.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the pandemic played the role of an accelerant in digitalization, it also drove structural changes. For instance, the expansion of e-commerce &#8220;required a significant evolution in the quality and scale of the infrastructure provided by logistics, payments and e-commerce platform companies,&#8221; Vasconcellos noted. And on a broader level, the region&#8217;s structural issues have typically represented opportunities for startups leveraging technology to address them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GM said Wednesday it will double its revenues by the end of the decade and take over the market share of EVs — a spot that Tesla currently enjoys — all while increasing profit margins for its internal combustion engine vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ambitious goal, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">outlined during GM&#8217;s two-day investor event that kicked off Wednesday, will be reached by selling a range of electric vehicles, software-based services and offering technology, including a new version of its hands-free advanced driving assistance system that the automaker claims will work in 95% of all driving scenarios and eventually be used on every paved road in the U.S. and Canada.</span></p>
<p>GM said it aims to hit $280 billion in annual revenues by 2030, which is more than double the $122.5 billion in sales it reported for 2020. The company is basing its revenue goal on a rolling average of about $140 billion, according to a company spokesperson.</p>
<p>GM has already committed billions to reach this new goal. The automaker said back in November that it would spend $27 billion over five years on the development of electric vehicles and automated technology, a 35% increase from its previous plan. GM upped that number again in July, this time to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/gm-increases-ev-and-av-investments-to-35b-through-2025/">$35 billion through 2025</a>.</p>
<p>That money is already being put to work, notably into Ultium, the underlying EV architecture and accompanying batteries for its next-generation electric vehicles, which includes the upcoming Chevrolet Silverado, a Chevrolet crossover priced around $30,000, Buick crossovers and the Cadillac Lyriq and Celestiq.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you look at the strong portfolio, the fact that we&#8217;re going to have affordable EVs, really affordable EVs for people and we&#8217;re also working on the ecosystem they need because for a lot of people it&#8217;s going to be their only vehicle — they need to have reliable reliable charging infrastructure,&#8221; Chair and CEO Mary Barra said during a media briefing explaining how the company planned to capture market share. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we believe that we&#8217;re going to attract those customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barra also noted that the company is building on loyalty that customers already have for the company. That, along with its portfolio, existing manufacturing capacity and dealership network are all advantages, she said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of things that we have that when we put our foot on the accelerator pedal, we can really move quite rapidly.&#8221;</p>
<p>To hit that mark, GM said it will dedicate more than 50% of its factories in North America and China to the production of electric vehicles by 2030.</p>
<p>GM&#8217;s revenue goal doesn&#8217;t rely entirely on the sale and financing of EVs. In a briefing call with media Wednesday, Barra and GM President Mark Reuss  repeatedly pointed to its plan to roll out digital services through its new Ultifi software platform as well as new businesses like its commercial EV delivery company BrightDrop and OnStar Insurance.</p>
<p>Details about those digital services and its strategy will be outlined Wednesday and Thursday during the investor event. Stay tuned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors laid out its forthcoming EV portfolio at its investor event Wednesday, with the full-size electric pickup Chevrolet Silverado as the centerpiece, as the company seeks to gain market share in the increasingly crowded electric truck market.</p>
<p>While GM had previously announced the electric Silverado, the company confirmed some additional details, like that it would feature a fixed-glass roof for certain models and that the vehicle would debut at the trade show CES in January 2022. It’s joining Ford’s F-150 Lightning and Rivian’s R1T in the burgeoning electric truck segment — a segment that until now has been conspicuously empty, despite the truck being one of the best-selling vehicle types in America.</p>

<p>Other details on the truck remain a mystery, however, particularly in relation to how GM plans to market the truck and the customers it anticipates lining up to buy it. “The proof points of who we’re going to target is going to be very evident when you see the truck,” GM’s president Mark Reuss said during a media briefing Wednesday. “If you look at the micro segmentation that&#8217;s happened on pickup trucks over many years, there&#8217;s a lot of different buyers. There&#8217;s not one buyer on the pickup truck [that] we target.”</p>
<p>GM also announced crossovers from its brands Chevy and Buick, in addition to its upcoming GMC Hummer pickup and Cadillac Lyriq crossover. The vehicles are part of the automaker&#8217;s plans to invest $35 billion through 2025 on electrification and autonomous vehicle tech, while also doubling its revenue by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>To what degree the automaker will face an uphill battle to hit these targets is unclear. Like other OEMs, GM reported dismal sales for the third quarter, citing the ongoing semiconductor shortage that disrupted manufacturing and vehicle delivery. In contrast to the legacy automakers, Tesla’s sales were very strong for the quarter, beating expectations on vehicle deliveries and previous delivery highs.</p>
<p>However, GM CEO Mary Barra emphasized that the company will offer affordable EVs — “really affordable EVs for people” — as well as other features to lure some would-be Tesla customers. “We believe that we’re going to attract those customers,” she said. She and Reuss added that GM has other advantages, like customer loyalty, strong manufacturing capacity and a wide dealership network to position it well in the EV market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is also betting that it’s Ultium battery electric propulsion platform, which is manufactured in partnership with South Korea-based LG Energy Solutions, will give its forthcoming vehicles a competitive boost. The electric Chevrolet Silverado, for example, will have a range of 400 miles.</p>

Kelly&#8217;s official channels after the singer was convicted of sex trafficking. The RKellyTV and RKellyVevo channels no longer exist and Kelly will not be allowed to create or own any other channel on the platform, YouTube told <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/youtube-drops-r-b-singer-051607466.html?guccounter=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>.

<p>However, this isn&#8217;t a blanket ban. Kelly&#8217;s music will still be available on YouTube Music. Kelly videos that other users have uploaded will still be available. Engadget has asked YouTube for clarification on why that&#8217;s the case.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As competition for creator talent heats up, Snap today <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/spotlight-challenges">introduced</a> a series of new tools, programs, and features that will enable creators on its platform to generate revenue. These include the expansion of a Gifting feature to worldwide creators, the expansion of the Creator Marketplace to include Snap Stars (top creators with verified accounts), the launch of a how-to resource called the Creator Hub, and a new way for Snapchat creators to be rewarded for making short-form video for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">its in-app TikTok rival,</a> known as Spotlight.</p>
<p>The latter, called Spotlight Challenges, will offer cash prizes for top-performing Spotlight content, as directed by Snap itself. This is different from other social apps&#8217; Creator Funds, which pay out based on metrics like views and engagement to anyone who qualifies. Instead, this is a &#8220;chance&#8221; to win cash where each individual challenge will reward an average of 3 to 5 creators as the winners &#8212; though sometimes that figure will be more or less, Snap notes. The minimum prize will be $250. Typically, the total prize pots for individual challenges will range from $1,000 to $25,000, but Snap says it may sometimes offer a larger sum.</p>
<p>The challenges will be designed to encourage the use of specific Lenses, Sounds or #Topics, rather than paying out for any top-performing content. These challenges will be featured on Spotlight&#8217;s &#8220;Trending&#8221; page, which you access by tapping the trending up icon in the top-right of Spotlight&#8217;s main screen in the Snapchat app. Here, users will be able to view the available challenges, read the details about submission details and associated prize, then tap to open the camera and create content.</p>
<p>The addition follows complaints expressed by Snap creators who had earlier this year <a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/snapchat-creators-report-frustration-with-spotlight-payments-as-spotlight-u/602906/">grown frustrated</a> with Spotlight payment delays and later, the dwindling amount of money they could earn. While previously, Snap was paying out an incredible $1 million per day to get its TikTok competitor Spotlight off the ground, it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/20/media/snapchat-spotlight/index.html">stopped</a> that program in late May saying it would decrease payments to&#8221;millions&#8221; per month as of June.</p>
<p>But creators who had grown to expect larger paydays were not happy with the change, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/11/snap-creators-say-theyre-leaving-the-apps-spotlight-feature-as-payments-dry-up.html">some began to look for better opportunities on other apps</a>. Today, there are many options to choose from, as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and Twitter are all trying to woo creators in their own ways &#8212; including, in some cases, with direct payments in addition to revenue sharing from ads.</p>
<p>Snap&#8217;s <a href="https://www.snap.com/terms/spotlight-challenges-official-rules">new system</a> of &#8220;challenges&#8221; would seem to offer a bit more transparency around payments, as creators will be able to see in advance what the prizes may be. But on the flip side, and perhaps most importantly, it signals to creators there is no guaranteed payday coming here &#8212; it&#8217;s a &#8220;prize,&#8221; not a paycheck. That means creators could still produce well-performing content and not &#8220;win&#8221; the cash.</p>
<p>However, Snap tells TechCrunch it&#8217;s not replacing creator payouts with prizes. The new feature will be in addition to the millions it distributes per month to the top Spotlight creators.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new feature will be rolled out in the U.S. next month on iOS and Android before expanding to more markets.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2213477" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gifting_Sending.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gifting_Sending.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gifting_Sending.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gifting_Sending.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gifting_Sending.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gifting_Sending.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gifting_Sending.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Gifting_Sending.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Other additions today include a <a href="https://creators.snap.com/">Snapchat Creator Hub</a> that offers information about getting started in Spotlight and other tips and the expansion of the Gifting feature to Snap Stars worldwide (see above). This feature <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/new-tools-and-monetization-opportunities-for-creators">had been announced in May</a> and allows fans to support creators using Snap Tokens through Story Replies. The Snap Stars receive a share of the revenue from the Gifts they receive, as a sort of virtual tip.</p>
<p>Snap is also expanding the<a href="https://creatormarketplace.tiktok.com/"> Creator Marketplace,</a> which was previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/snap-to-launch-a-new-creator-marketplace-this-month-initially-focused-on-lens-creators/">working to connect Lens creators</a>, developers and partners with businesses who wanted to run AR ads with their support.</p>
<p>Now, the marketplace will serve another purpose as well: it will connect businesses with Snap Stars worldwide for brand deals. This is how creator marketplaces across other top social platforms, like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/introducing-brand-collabs-manager">Facebook, Instagram</a>, <a href="https://creatormarketplace.tiktok.com/">TikTok</a>, and <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9385307?hl=en">YouTube</a> already work, so this is a bit of catch-up on Snap&#8217;s part.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2213475" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Creator-Marketplace.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Creator-Marketplace.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Creator-Marketplace.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Creator-Marketplace.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Creator-Marketplace.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Creator-Marketplace.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Creator-Marketplace.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Creator-Marketplace.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Creator-Marketplace.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Related to this move, Snap is also introducing a &#8220;Sponsored by&#8221; tag for businesses with Public Profiles so Snap Stars can tag brands in their sponsored content for transparency. In this case, 100% of the transactions will go directly to creators, Snap says.</p>
<p>Despite the changes to Snap&#8217;s earlier monetization efforts, the company claims the production of Spotlight content is booming. During its second-quarter earnings, Snap said Spotlight submissions more than tripled, daily time spent per user in the U.S. grew over 60% from the prior quarter, and daily active users were up 49%.</p>
<p>To date, Snap has paid out over $130 million to creators, it says. And it has seen &#8220;all-time highs&#8221; in terms of the number of creators posting to Spotlight since the June 1 revamp, the company noted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://costcertified.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CostCertified</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Canadian startup which provides real-time, interactive residential construction estimates, raised $8.45 million in a seed round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FUSE, a Pacific Northwest venture firm which counts former Microsoft CFO John Connors and Seattle Seahawks linebacker Bobby Wagner as venture partners, led the round. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is also backed by Y Combinator (having participated in the accelerator’s S21 batch), I2BF Global Ventures, Soma Capital and a number of proptech/construction tech founders such as Willy Schlacks, CEO and co-founder of EquipmentShare; Ryan Sutton-Gee, PlanGrid co-founder and former COO; Jonathan Wasserstrum, co-founder and CEO of SquareFoot and Bill Smith, founder and CEO of Landing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The raise marks CostCertified’s first external round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, CostCertified today is a price configurator tool for construction, but the Calgary, Alberta-based company’s end goal is to build the “Amazon for construction.” CostCertified allows contractors to send a shoppable interactive estimate to homeowners so that they can choose their selections during a project, and see the effect on price instantly. If you&#8217;ve ever performed a home remodeling project, you understand that this is something that would be incredibly useful considering all the various decisions required around vendors and products. Being able to see your options and how specific choices will impact your end cost in one place can certainly help make the project less stressful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mike Bignold teamed up with David Vass to start CostCertified in 2017 after running his own construction business and realizing the need for contractors to provide estimates in a more modern way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I ended up booking a pretty large project. And I hired a really great project manager who was really good with construction but not comfortable at all with tech,” Bignold recalls. “And that job ended up getting delayed as a result.”</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;10 proptech investors see better era for residential and retail after pandemic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/10-proptech-investors-see-better-era-for-residential-and-retail-after-pandemic/embed/#?secret=hTE4U35fZI" data-secret="hTE4U35fZI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bignold, who did some coding during college, put together a simple prototype of an app that generated a document with an estimate of project costs that was sent out via email to potential customers. Essentially, he had built a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quoting engine that gave contractors a way to provide consumers with “an interactive, shoppable experience” while managing a project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a contractor, I didn’t have the tools to support the price complexity of a large construction project,” Bignold said. “I thought to myself, ‘Why can’t you buy or sell construction services with the convenience of an Amazon-like, or Shopify, experience.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, he ended up selling his construction business with the intention of spinning out the app he had built into its own company. He teamed up with Vass, who had helped him get that contracting business “to the top of Google.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of Vass’s other contracting clients were looking for a system similar to what Bignold had built so the pair got beta customers to use the app, and become early adopters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think I realized the complex problems that I was getting into solving for large construction companies,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair spent several years on R&amp;D, iterating the app “over and over, listening to customers constantly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There were big structural problems in the industry that we were trying to solve for,” Bignold said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The SaaS platform came out of beta in early 2021, and today, CostCertified has $72 million in annualized GMV, and says it has seen 2,203% YoY growth (albeit it from a small base).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users can do things like select their finishes, upgrade, downgrade and build their own renovation or new construction with real-time price changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The software also allows built-in financing and payments that CostCertified says automates workflow and, ultimately, reduces the cost and risk for everyone involved in such projects &#8212; from general contractors to subcontractors to the consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We leveraged our capabilities by bringing retailers, the people who sell things like countertops and plumbing fixtures, into the point of sale,” Bignold said. “By bringing all selections to the POS, customers know exactly what they are getting and what it will cost. The contractor can also make more money on upgrades and justify the cost.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, CostCertified has a team of 25 and it plans to use its new capital in part to increase its headcount by over 100 people over the next year and on product development, sales and growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FUSE’s Brendan Wales said his firm was impressed with the CostCertified team’s “deep level of experience within the home renovation market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They have lived the pain of being a contractor and built the product for themselves. The product is robust and fully featured for its stage; the product is far greater than seed stage,” he wrote via email. “The customers love the product and that can be seen in the monthly logo growth, which is compounding. Lastly, they are playing within a large global market and there are many ways to monetize this audience than just SaaS fees.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another unique thing about the startup, he said, is that most renovation software vendors often only think about how the contractors will use the product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“CostCertified has put the contractor&#8217;s customer to the forefront,” he wrote. “They enable the end consumers of the renovation services to have a more dynamic and transparent service, more akin to a wonderful e-commerce experience, than a construction purchase.&#8221;</span></p>
