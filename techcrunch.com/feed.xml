										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More consolidation is afoot in the world of cybersecurity, specifically around services to help organizations manage identity and access. Today, <a href="https://www.oneidentity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One Identity</a> &#8212; which provides tools for managing &#8220;zero trust&#8221; access to systems, as well as running log management and other governance services for enterprises &#8212; announced that it has acquired <a href="https://www.onelogin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OneLogin</a>, a rival to companies like Okta, Ping and others in the area of secure sign-on services for end users.</p>
<p>Terms of the acquisition &#8212; which officially closed last week, on October 1 &#8212; are not being disclosed, but we are trying to find out. For some background, One Identity today it is part of Quest Software, which is privately held by PE firm Francisco Partners. Before that it was a part of Dell. Francisco originally partnered with Elliott to acquire Quest and related assets from Dell <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/20/confirmed-dell-sells-software-division-to-francisco-partners-and-elliott-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in 2016</a> as part of the latter&#8217;s streamlining efforts, in a deal that at the time was reportedly worth about $2 billion. The company has some 7,500 enterprise customers and says that it manages some 250 million identities.</p>
<p>O<span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;">neLogin, meanwhile, last disclosed funding in 2019 &#8212; a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/10/onelogin-snares-100m-investment-to-expand-identity-solution-into-new-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$100 million Series D</a></span><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1rem;"> that valued it at $330 million, according to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/52320-88/company/profile#deal-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a>. (Note: you will notice that PItchBook lists another fundraise after this, but it doesn&#8217;t specify a date, or an amount.) OneLogin has some 5,500 customers including the likes of Airbus, Stitch Fix, the AAA, and Pandora. Together, the companies will handle some 290 million identities under management, Quest CEO Patrick Nichols told TechCrunch in an interview. This figure includes not just &#8220;people&#8221; but M2M-style nodes on systems, he added. </span></p>
<p>The M&amp;A comes amid a bigger shift in the security industry. In the intervening years since both Dell sold off its assets, and OneIdentity raised money, cybersecurity threats have only grown, fueled by the ongoing shift to more cloud services and people and organizations doing more business digitally. (OneLogin, citing data from IBM, estimates that the average cost of breach <a href="https://www.onelogin.com/blog/iam-cyber-insurance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now stands at $3.86 million</a>, although that also does not include the significant cost to an organization&#8217;s reputation and trust with its users.)</p>
<p>Within that bigger trend, identity management &#8212; and often more likely mis-management &#8212; has been an especially vulnerable area, with malicious hackers using a variety of techniques relying both on sophisticated technology and human error to crack into systems.</p>
<p>When considering the different threat vectors in the market today, &#8220;70% of them are a direct result of poor identity management,&#8221; Nichols said, citing research from <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/solutions/secure-your-business/business-security-tips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Verizon</a>. And the threat is particularly acute in part because the number of end points are growing rapidly, not because of more people coming on to networks, but because of more connected devices. Half of the endpoints on a system are typically devices rather than specific individuals, he said, &#8220;and once they get breached, it is just like stealing a password.&#8221;</p>
<p>And at the same time, after years of using point-solutions for different aspects of their cybersecurity strategies, enterprises are increasingly looking for platforms and bigger toolsets that can handle multiple functions to have a more unified picture of system activity, and to ensure that there is less risk of two different cybersecurity tools inadvertently conflicting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All of this points to more consolidation. In the specific case of One Identity, the company sees an opportunity in providing a fuller set of services to customers beyond those to help them manage networks internally, by adding on more end-user facing tools. Similarly, the thinking goes that customers of OneLogin might also be interested in bringing more of their cyber strategy on to a single platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, organizations see a twofold gain from consolidating around a platform player in cybersecurity,&#8221; Nichols said. The first is, &#8220;to increase efficiency&#8221; but the other, he pointed out, is legislation. With more regulatory oversight in how companies are handling their cybersecurity challenges, the pressure is on them to make their systems more resilient, and having too many components becomes a challenge to manage for that reason, too.</p>
<p>“Joining One Identity provides us with the ability to further accelerate our growth and provide additional value for both of our customers,” added Brad Brooks, CEO of OneLogin, in a statement. “With OneLogin’s robust unified platform for both workforce and CIAM, combining forces with One Identity’s suite of products including their PAM solution, will allow new and existing customers, on a global scale, to tap into the market’s only unified identity security platform.”</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how and if we continue to see more M&amp;A moves in the space. Okta has been a very acquisitive player to date, and there are still a number of companies on the market covering different aspects of the identity challenge that are still independent. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/jumio-raises-150m-as-its-all-in-one-id-authentication-platform-crosses-300m-verified-identities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jumio</a> being one example.)</p>
<p>The combined company will cover a number of services, including <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Privileged Access Management (PAM); </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Identity Governance and Administration (IGA); Active Directory </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Management and Security; and now I</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">dentity &amp; Access Management (IAM).</span></p>
<p>“With the proliferation of human and machine identities, the race to the cloud and the rise of remote working, identity is quickly becoming the new edge – and protecting identity in an end-to-end manner has never been more important,” said Bhagwat Swaroop, president and general manager of One Identity, in a statement. “By adding OneLogin to our portfolio, and incorporating it into our cloud-first Unified Identity Security Platform, we can help customers holistically correlate all identities, verify everything before granting access to critical assets and provide real-time visibility into suspicious login activity. With identity at the core, customers can now implement an adaptive zero trust strategy and dramatically improve their overall cybersecurity posture.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The $110,000 GMC Hummer EV is a wild mashup that can keep up with the best off-roader, has the comfort of a luxury sedan and the speed of a sports car. And it has a truck bed. GM calls it a super truck, and I cannot disagree.</p>
<p>After driving the Hummer EV at General Motor&#8217;s test track, a few things were immediately apparent. First, the large Hummer EV is a joy to drive thanks to plenty of power and excellent four-wheel steering. Second, the infotainment system and driver&#8217;s gauge cluster are beautiful but overwhelmingly busy and occasionally slow. Lastly, the Hummer EV is a shining example of how General Motors&#8217; Ultium platform can lead to vehicles with unconventional capabilities and features.</p>
<p>GM spokespersons set strict expectations before letting me drive: GM only wanted to talk about how the Hummer EV drives and handles, and the company was not ready to answer questions concerning specific vehicle specifications, capabilities, and availability. Cameras were not allowed; GM security taped my phone. I only spent 30 minutes driving the Hummer EV, and all the driving was done deep in General Motors&#8217; remote Milford, Mich. proving grounds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that I drove a pre-production vehicle. Allegedly, all the necessary bits were in place, but a few things were missing, like texture on some interior materials and the addition of some noise dampening materials.</p>
<p>I drove the Hummer EV over a pile of rocks, sped around dirt roads, and hit 95 mph on General Motors&#8217; high-speed test track. I learned a lot. The Hummer EV is a competent go-anywhere, do-anything vehicle able to go bouldering, swing into tight parking spaces, and carry five adults and their luggage comfortably. It has a 0-60 time of 3.0 seconds, and it drives much smaller than it looks thanks to four-wheel steering.</p>

<h2>Four-Wheel Steering For The Win</h2>
<p>The Hummer EV plays a fun trick. The large, wide vehicle lumbers over the road but does so in a brisk, fleeting manner. The electric motors and four-wheel steering make it lighter on its feet than a pickup and more responsive than a large crossover. As a result, the Hummer EV drives like a sturdy and wide sports car instead of a pickup truck.</p>
<p>The Hummers of yesteryear felt like durable trucks, dominant and all-powerful. The Hummer EV still feels unstoppable, but now, it also feels as comfortable on the highway as it does on backwood trails. Buyers are not conceding comfort for capabilities with the Hummer EV. Past Hummers (and current Jeep and 4Runners) sacrificed on-road ride quality for off-road capabilities; nothing is seemingly lost with the Hummer EV. Just hit a button and it will climb boulders. Hit a different button and it can outrun most sports cars.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the formula: three electric motors + four-wheel steering. This isn&#8217;t a secret formula per se; Tesla is equipping its Cybertruck with the same combination.</p>
<p>I cannot understate the impact of the Hummer EV&#8217;s four-wheel steering. The rear wheels can turn up to 10 degrees, which comes standard on all models. In its most extreme use-case, called CrabWalk, the four-wheel steering makes the vehicle move as if on ice, gliding left and right in a way that feels more like a rear-wheel-drive forklift than a five-passenger pickup.</p>
<p>Rear-wheel steering debuted in the 1980s and saw little adaptation outside of sports cars at the time. It attempted a comeback in the early 2000s, and General Motors even offered it on the Suburban and Silverado half-ton trucks from 2002 to 2005. Today, it&#8217;s available on several sedans, with some models providing 2-3 degrees of turning, while ultra-luxury models offer up to 10 degrees. These systems are a costly option few buyers select, but it comes standard in the Hummer EV. This system is critical to the function and appeal of the Hummer EV.</p>
<p>The Hummer&#8217;s four-wheel steering also allows it to drive much smaller than similar-sized vehicles. It turns quicker, backs up easier, and makes the pickup handle more like a family sedan than a large SUV. The vehicle has a 37-foot turning circle closer to the compact Chevy Sonic than the Chevy Silverado &#8211; a full-size pickup.</p>
<p>I only had a few minutes to test this system. The four-wheel steering doesn&#8217;t have a learning curve, and I didn&#8217;t have to adjust my driving technique to compensate for the tighter turning. It just worked and felt natural. I&#8217;m curious whether passengers in the rear seat would feel the difference.</p>
<p>The four-wheel steering is active by default, though it can be turned off. I&#8217;m told it even improves towing as when the Hummer EV is at highway speeds, the wheels on the two axles move in phase, eliminating trailer sway (I would like to verify this claim).</p>
<p>This four-wheel steering feature allows the Hummer to drive diagonally. Called CrabWalk, this unique mode requires the driver to stop the vehicle and click through several menu buttons to activate. Once engaged, the front and rear axles move in tandem and allow the truck to glide in unexpected ways. Crab Walk mode makes the Hummer EV feel like it&#8217;s on ice. Turn the wheel left, and the vehicle glides diagonally left. The front end doesn&#8217;t turn left; the whole vehicle drifts left. This isn&#8217;t a system designed for use at speed, but rather when parking, overlanding, and impressing onlookers. I&#8217;ve never felt anything like it.</p>
<p>Watch this video from Detroit&#8217;s 2021 Woodward Dream Cruise where GM employees were eager to demonstrate the ability.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZvO3wTsAqvw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<h2>Watts to Freedom = WTF Mode</h2>
<p>The Hummer EV is blistering fast &#8212; if you want it to be. A launch mode, called Watts to Freedom (WTF mode), is impressive, allowing drivers to hit 60 mph in 3 seconds. That&#8217;s fast fast. Under normal conditions and in standard vehicle modes, the Hummer EV still scoots, but it won&#8217;t pin riders to their seats as it does in WTF mode.</p>
<p>Hitting that velocity is incredible in any vehicle; doing so in a five-passenger pickup is even more memorable. The all-wheel-drive pickup effortlessly finds enough traction to shoot forward with the force of a rocket. It&#8217;s similar to the launch sensation found in other electric vehicles like the Tesla Model X.</p>
<p>In its normal driving modes, the Hummer EV&#8217;s torque is on a short leash. It&#8217;s more tame but still fast enough to race anyone at a stoplight. The acceleration is controlled and measured, and I appreciate the finesse that went into the tuning.</p>
<p>The Hummer EV&#8217;s wide stance makes for a stable ride. I raced the Hummer EV around the proving ground&#8217;s back roads, fishtailing the SUV on the gravel. The pickup held firm and felt flat even during the most aggressive turns. On the banked test track, the Hummer EV felt as solid and sturdy as any vehicle. The batteries packed on the bottom of the truck force the gravity to the floor, the Hummer never felt top-heavy like its gas-powered ancestors.</p>
<p>On the high-speed loop, the Hummer hit 90 mph without trying. The vehicle didn&#8217;t feel strained or overworked. Hit the gas, and it gets to speed in a heartbeat. The Hummer EV cruises with the best, sailing across the road on massive 35-inch Wrangler tires &#8212; and I don&#8217;t recall an obnoxious amount of tire noise either.</p>
<p>The Hummer EV isn&#8217;t silent. Hit the accelerator, and you&#8217;ll hear two things: The whine of the three electric motors and an artificial revving sound that sounds like a more beefy electrical noise. In an off-road driving mode, the artificial tone is louder to drown out the increased road noise. In the end, I found it unoffensive. The sound is not heavy and is always in the background. A General Motors engineer explained that the company feels the driver needs and unknowingly expects audible feedback.</p>
<p>I took the Hummer EV bouldering in as much as driving over two dozen large rocks. Did it drive over? Sure. Was it graceful? Not really. The Hummer EV slid around the rocks, and I had trouble holding traction. To be clear, for this drive, GM dumped a pile of beach-ball-sized rocks in a field, allowing us to drive over a 10-foot section one time. I&#8217;m not comfortable drawing conclusions about the Hummer EV&#8217;s off-roading capabilities from this experience.</p>
<h2>An Industrial User Experience</h2>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t given a chance to dig deep into the infotainment system. From my little experience, I discovered a couple of things. One, the system is beautiful thanks to Epic&#8217;s Unreal graphical engine. The Hummer EV is the first to use this particular build of the Unreal engine generally reserved for video games. The system looks lovely, but in my pre-production test vehicle, it was laggy. It constantly took several moments to respond to input. It didn&#8217;t matter if I selected an option on the screen or used a hardware controller (like the terrain select dial).</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, while lovely to look at, the infotainment&#8217;s design is overly complex, busy, and styled with a faux industrial look. GM&#8217;s engineers were evidently trying to show off the graphical ability of the screen and implemented an interface that uses widely overstyled icons and menus. Every graphical element seems designed to look pretty rather than being easier to use.</p>
<p>General Motors was keen on demonstrating the capabilities of the Hummer EV&#8217;s cameras. There are 18 scattered around the vehicle, including several mounted under the truck, assist the driver when traversing sketchy terrain or parking at Trader Joe&#8217;s. These cameras work as advertised, and some have built-in cleaners to remove debris.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thrilled to report GM retained physical buttons for climate control instead of burying them in a touchscreen menu. Other EV makers like Tesla and Rivian have relegated temperature dials, heated seat controls, and even vent direction to the touchscreen. In the Hummer EV, there&#8217;s a row of rocker switches for such controls.</p>
<p>The driver has a commanding position. There&#8217;s great visibility from the driver&#8217;s seat. The front occupants have plenty of space with lots of headroom and legroom. The backseats have less space for legs, but there&#8217;s still lots of room thanks to the wide body. Think full-size SUV — roomy in the front, tighter in the back.</p>
<h2>The New Electric Powertrain</h2>
<p>General Motors revealed a few details about the Hummer EV&#8217;s powertrain. The first edition of the Hummer EV comes with a 24-module battery system packed within the vehicle&#8217;s unibody frame. It&#8217;s General Motors&#8217; first use of its Ultium platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/gm-reveals-ultium-the-heart-of-its-ev-strategy/">which the car company debuted in March 2020</a>.</p>
<p>The three-motor arrangement offers several advantages. The electric motors allow GM to equip the Hummer with electronic differentials on both axles &#8212; handy for low-traction situations. On the rear wheels, an e-locker enables the pickup to control traction at all four corners with torque vectoring; the two motors are not physically connected but equipped with software to virtually lock them together. This allows the wheels to start or stop in milliseconds.</p>
<p>I asked if the battery packs were similar to those used in the Chevy Bolt, which has had two recalls because of its battery. A GM spokesperson responded, saying GM is working with LG on the cells, but GM builds the Hummer EV&#8217;s packs at its Detroit Brownstone factory, and the batteries feature new cell chemistry over those used in the Bolt.</p>
<h2>Questions Remain</h2>
<p>The Hummer EV is packed full of features I was unable to test or experience. It comes equipped with GM&#8217;s latest version of its self-driving mode, SuperCruise, which now features highway lane changes. The pickup also has automated tire deflation, is supposedly able to ford 26 inches of water, and recharge 100 miles of travel in 10 minutes. Unfortunately, I could not remove the roof panels or see them stored in the so-called frunk. I would also love some time to dig into the infotainment system &#8212; it looks immersive but complex.</p>
<p>General Motors has been quiet on several aspects of the Hummer EV, and the company revealed little extra during this test. Exact pricing and availability are unknown. The official EPA range rating is unannounced. The towing and hauling capabilities are also still unknown.</p>
<p>As someone who regularly tows a large trailer, the Hummer EV doesn&#8217;t feel like it was built to haul or tow. The power is there, but the unibody frame and air suspension speak to a lower tow rating than a Chevy Silverado 1500 or Ford F-150. I expect the Hummer EV to have a rating closer to a full-size SUV (6,000 &#8211; 8,000 lbs.) than a half-ton pickup (8,000 to 12,000 lbs.). This means the Hummer EV could tow a trailer of ATVs, a small boat, or a cargo trailer, if I&#8217;m correct. With that rating, it would be unable to pull most travel trailers outside of small, ultra-light options. And how will hauling a load affect the battery range? That&#8217;s unknown, too.</p>
<h2>An Electric Revolution</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s the scene. General Motors is nervous. The Hummer EV was announced in October 2020 and was supposed to hit dealers in Fall 2021. Now, in October 2021, there&#8217;s a global supply chain crisis affecting automotive manufacturers, and the company is having to focus unexpectedly on battery recalls on its other EV, the Chevy Bolt. Insiders tell me General Motors is nervous about consumer confidence after sending Chevy Bolt owners two battery recalls.</p>
<p>The star of the Hummer EV show is GM&#8217;s Ultium platform. When GM announced its EV blueprint in 2020, the company said it allowed the automaker to build vehicles in 19 different battery and drive unit configurations, including rear-wheel, front-wheel, and all-wheel-drive configurations. It also provides for 400-volt and 800-volt packs, meaning this design gives America&#8217;s largest carmaker many options. The Hummer EV is a rolling proof of concept of the Ultium platform&#8217;s capability. If it can make a Hummer ultra-fast and ultra-maneuverable, what can it offer a roadster, crossover, or seven-passenger family mover?</p>
<p>The Hummer EV succeeds in being General Motors&#8217; ostentatious, attention-seeking super electric vehicle. The latest Hummer is outrageous and excessive just like it&#8217;s always been. It&#8217;s clear after just a few minutes that General Motors built something special in the electric pickup. It&#8217;s big, heavy and electric, and it has everything from insane speed to serious off-roading chops to substantial cargo capacity. The Hummer EV has everything.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">FoodTech is booming in Europe and is growing exponentially. In 2020, €3 billion went into European FoodTech companies (<a href="https://2020.stateofeuropeantech.com/">State of European Tech Report, March 2021</a>), and the pandemic has accelerated demand as consumers have shifted to grocery delivery. The industry has also been affected by the rise of direct-to-consumer food brands. Finally, the pandemic created a boom in interest in healthy food and nutrition to improve people&#8217;s immunity to COVID-19.</p>
<p>So it’s perhaps understandable that European FoodTech VC  <a href="https://www.fiveseasons.vc/">Five Seasons Ventures</a> has announced the final closing of €180 million second fund. Their first fund was €77 million, so this next fund is a sizeable improvement and reflects what’s going on in Food Tech.</p>
<p>The new Fund II will continue making Series A and B investments into European FoodTech companies, with, says the company “an emphasis on fast-growing consumer-focused food with a quantifiable environmental or social impact.”</p>
<p>Five Seasons says it’s aiming to prove that FoodTech startups can grow as fast as ‘normal’ tech startups, with its Fund I portfolio on track to reach a combined revenue of over €350M in 2021, it says. One such company, Air Up, has hit a €100M revenue run rate in less than two years, says Five Seasons. <a href="https://uk.air-up.com/">Air-Up</a> sells a reusable smart water bottle that “delivers flavor via retro-nasal scent”.</p>
<p>Ivan Farneti, Co-founding Partner of Five Seasons Ventures, said: “There’s no doubt that FoodTech is experiencing a boom in Europe right now. When we launched Five Seasons in 2018, we were the first VC to focus on FoodTech in Europe, and we believe we contributed to making this an attractive asset class. Fund II was quickly oversubscribed as more investors wanted to get exposed to European FoodTech, seeking high growth and impact.”</p>
<p>Five seasons has also backed Butternut Box, a direct-to-consumer fresh dog food company in Europe, and ‘This’, plant-based meat alternative. The VC’s team has also grown to nine, with the appointment of a Head of Impact and Sustainable Investing.</p>
<p>Fund II has so far invested in female wellness supplements her1, and vly, a company using peas to provide a plant-based milk alternative filled with protein. It’s also invested in Barkyn and The Nu Company. </p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In total, Five Seasons Ventures has backed 14 companies across six European countries: Germany, France, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, and the UK. </p>
<p>In an interview, Niccolo Manzoni, Co-founding Partner of Five Seasons Ventures, added: “If you look at the amount of capital that has gone into FoodTech ventures in the last two years it&#8217;s grown from €1 billion to €3 billion just in Europe, and it&#8217;s bound to continue growing because there are lots of companies that have raised good money and have grown really fast.”</p>
<p>“Secondly, it also has the Impact side,” he said. “Two of the most pressing issues the world is facing today are human health and climate change. And that&#8217;s exactly the kind of companies we look for. If you look across our portfolio, for example, last year we saved about 2 million kilograms of food waste. The products that our companies sell are designed to improve health and well being… There&#8217;s a huge amount of things you can do in food tech which you cannot do in SaaS, for example.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Byju’s has raised about $300 million as part of a larger round of new investment as the Indian edtech giant focuses on expanding its international business and aggressively explores merger and acquisition opportunities.</p>
<p>A filing, supplied to TechCrunch by research firm Tofler, showed that the new investment values the startup at $18 billion, up from a valuation of $16.5 billion in June this year. At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/ubs-investment-makes-byjus-the-most-valuable-startup-in-india/">$16.5 billion valuation</a>, Byju&#8217;s had already surpassed fintech giant Paytm for the tentpole position in India&#8217;s startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>Oxshott Capital Partners led the new tranche of investment while XN Exponent, Edelweiss, Verition Master Fund, IIFL, and Time Capital Advisors participated.</p>
<p>TechCrunch understands the new investment is part of a larger financing round that is likely to propel Byju&#8217;s valuation above $21 billion.</p>
<p>A Byju’s spokeswoman declined to comment Monday.</p>
<p>The new investment comes at a time when Byju’s is also engaging with bankers about potentially filing for an initial public offering sometime next year. Some bankers have given the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/bankers-chase-byjus-for-ipo-valuation-pegged-up-to-50-billion/">a valuation of up to $50 billion if it lists next year</a>, TechCrunch reported in August. In an interview last month, Byju Raveendran (founder and chief executive of Byju&#8217;s) confirmed that the &#8220;IPO was on the cards.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup, which has raised over $1.8 billion since the beginning of pandemic, has used a significant portion of its recent fundraises to acquire firms. Earlier this year, it bought Aakash, one of the largest coaching institutes for high-school students with over 200 centers, for nearly $1 billion. It has also purchased Great Learning, and U.S.-based Epic, among others, for over $1 billion in cash and stock deals. Last month, the startup unveiled it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/byjus-acquires-coding-platform-tynker-for-200-million-in-us-expansion-push/">acquired kids coding platform Tynker for $200 million</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Raveendran said last month that Byju’s is continuing to explore more merger and acquisition opportunities. These acquisitions are helping Byju’s aggressively broaden its offerings and tap international markets in more meaningful ways, he said.</p>
<p>Byju’s prepares students pursuing undergraduate and graduate-level courses, and in recent years it has also expanded its catalog to serve all school-going students. Tutors on the Byju’s app tackle complex subjects using real-life objects such as pizza and cake.</p>
<p>The pandemic, which prompted New Delhi to enforce a months-long nationwide lockdown and close schools, accelerated its growth, and those of several other online learning startups including Unacademy and Vedantu.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, <a href="https://hhi.harvard.edu/publications/perceptions-disaster-resilience-and-preparedness-philippines">with geography that makes it vulnerable</a> to typhoons, floods, volcanos, earthquakes and droughts. While working in IT, Felix Ayque began compiling cyclone reports and sending them as email alerts to communities. His work evolved into environmental intelligence platform <a href="https://komunidad.co/">Komunidad</a>, which collects data from government and private sources, and turns it into customizable analytics to help clients react quickly to potential disasters.</p>
<p>The Manila and Singapore-based startup announced it has raised $1 million in seed funding, led by Wavemaker Partners with participation from ADB Ventures, the Asian Development Bank’s venture arm, to expand in Asia and add features to its platform, including a self-serve version that is slated for release in January 2022.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019, Komunidad has clients in the Philippines, India, Cambodia and Vietnam, and serves multiple sectors, including utilities, agriculture, mining, education, local governments and business outsourcing centers. Before launching the startup, Ayque worked as an IT developer at several weather agencies, including the state-owned New Zealand MetService. He began creating cyclone reports on his own as a consultant after Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, also known as Super Typhoon Yolanda, which killed at least 6,300 people in the Philippines.</p>
<p>The reports were meant to help businesses respond more quickly to natural disasters. Typhoon Haiyan hit at a time when the business outsourcing sector was growing rapidly in the Philippines, with many foreign companies setting up multiple offices in the country. During a typhoon, businesses typically transfer workload to offices in areas that are not affected. Ayque’s first emails contained manual analysis of potential cyclones.</p>
<p>Demand for his reports grew as companies, including energy providers, needed to respond to climate change. Komunidad began earning enough revenue to expand and for Ayque to hire employees, including meteorologists, data scientists, software developers and business development teams based in India and Southeast Asia. Its new investment will be used to build a scalable platform.</p>
<p>Komunidad’s data sources include major players like The Weather Company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/28/ibm-will-acquire-the-weather-companys-digital-business/">acquired by IBM in 2015</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/weather-platform-climacell-is-now-tomorrow-io-and-raises-77m/">weather intelligence platform Tomorrow.io</a>, and several smaller environmental and weather data providers.</p>

<p>The platform turns data into dashboards relevant to their customers’ needs, like severe weather, solar, marine, soil moisture or air quality. “We act as a system integrator that only brings the relevant data and tells customers that this is the most important data,” said Ayque. Komunidad also enables its customers to build their own alert systems. For example, in the Philippines, many customers send alerts through Viber, one of the country’s most popular messaging apps, or SMS to reach areas with unstable internet connections.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;BreezoMeter, which powers air quality in Apple’s Weather app, launches Wildfire Tracker&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/breezometer-wildfire-tracker/embed/#?secret=J2U4kTOrNy" data-secret="J2U4kTOrNy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For customers in the energy sector, Komunidad’s tools help them predict things like power usage based on temperature. It&#8217;s also been used by local governments to decide school cancellations. During the pandemic, Komunidad helped cities monitor people density so they can decide what areas need more crowd control.</p>
<p>One of Komunidad’s competitive advantages is understanding what data is important in different areas. For example, it recently closed a deal with the Assam State Disaster Management Agency (ASDMA) to focus on lighting and thunderstorm alerts, because Assam is the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/guwahati/assam-9th-most-lightning-prone-state-with-46-deaths-in-last-1-year/articleshow/85136091.cms">one of the most lightning-prone states in India</a>.</p>
<p>“Every country has a different profile, and we understand that our approach has to really focus on community, and then extend to business,” Ayque said.</p>
<p>Since Komunidad’s customers have to react quickly, it creates easy-to-understand visualizations from raw data reports, which are often incomprehensible to people without technical backgrounds. For example, that might be a simple bar graph, warnings in green, yellow and red, or maps that turn red if a major weather or environmental event is expected to occur within the next six hours.</p>
<p>Part of Komunidad’s funding will be used to launch self-service customizable dashboards next year that will allow clients to drag-and-drop widgets, similar to creating a website in Wix or WordPress. The seed round will also help Komunidad take on new business opportunities in India, Thailand, Cambodia and other markets, grow its sales teams and pay for more data sources.</p>

		Howard Pyle is the founder of <a href="http://experiencefutures.org/">ExperienceFutures.org</a>, a nonprofit committed to building equity into digital experiences, and previously led brand-side design initiatives at MetLife and IBM.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">I had a conversation recently with a huge technology company, and they wanted to know if their work in human-centered design guards against experience bias. The short answer? Probably not.</p>
<p>When we say <em>experience</em> bias, we’re not talking about our own cognitive biases; we’re talking about it at the digital interface layer (design, content, etc.). The truth is that pretty much every app and site you interact with is designed either based on the perceptions and ability of the team that created it, or for one or two high-value users. If users don’t have experience with design conventions, lack digital understanding, don’t have technical access, etc., we’d say the experience is biased against them.</p>
<p>The solution is to shift to a mindset where organizations create multiple versions of a design or experience customized to the needs of diverse users.</p>
<p>Going back to this tech company I was talking with, any company’s investments in empathetic design are essential, but, as someone who has launched and runs design functions, we need to address a few dirty secrets.</p>
<p>The first is that UX and design teams are often instructed on very limited target users by a strategy or business function, and experience bias starts there. If the business doesn’t prioritize a user, then a design team won’t have the permission or budget to create experiences for them. So even if the company is pursuing human-centered design or employs design thinking, they’re often just iterating against a user profile based on commercial interests and not aligned with any definition of diversity in terms of culture, race, age, income level, ability, language or other factors.</p>
<p>The other dirty secret is that human-centered design frequently assumes humans design all of the UX, services and interfaces. If the solution to experience bias is to create tailored variations based on users’ different needs, this hand-crafted UI model won’t cut it, especially when the teams making it often lack diversity. Prioritizing a variety of experiences based on user needs requires either a fundamental change in design processes or leveraging machine learning and automation in creating digital experiences — both necessary in a shift to experience equity.</p>
<h2>How to diagnose and address experience bias</h2>
<p>Addressing experience bias starts with understanding how to diagnose where it might appear. These questions have been helpful in understanding where the problem can exist in your digital experiences:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h3>Content and language: Does the content make sense to an individual?</h3>
<p>Many applications require special technical understanding, use jargon oriented to the company or industry, or assume technical knowledge.</p>
<p>With any financial services or insurance website — the assumption is that you understand their terms, industry and nomenclature. If the days of an agent or banker translating for you are going away, then the digital experiences need to translate for you instead.</p>
<h3>UI complexity: Does the interface make sense based on my abilities?</h3>
<p>If I have a disability, can I navigate it using assistive technology? Am I expected to learn how to use the UI? The way that one user needs to navigate an interface may be very different based on ability or context.</p>
<p>For example, design for an aging population would prioritize more text and less subtle visual cues. In contrast, younger people tend to do well with color-coding or preexisting design conventions. Think about terrible COVID-19 vaccine websites that made it your problem to understand how to navigate and book appointments — or how each of your banks has radically different ways to navigate to similar information. It used to be that startups had radically simple UIs, but feature upon feature makes them complex even for veteran users &#8212; just look at how Instagram has changed in the past five years.</p>
<h3>Ecosystem complexity: Are you placing responsibility on the user to navigate multiple experiences seamlessly?</h3>
<p>Our digital lives aren’t oriented around one site or app — we use collections of tools for everything we do online. Almost every digital business or product team aspires to keep users locked into their walled garden and rarely considers the other tools a user might encounter based on whatever they’re trying to accomplish in their lives.</p>
<p>If I’m sick, I may need to engage with insurance, hospitals, doctors and banks. If I’m a new college student, I may have to work with multiple systems at my school, along with vendors, housing, banks and other related organizations. The users are always to blame if they have difficulty stitching together different experiences across an ecosystem.</p>
<h3><strong>Inherited bias</strong>:<strong> Are you using systems that generate content, design patterns built for a different purpose or machine learning to personalize experiences?</strong></h3>
<p>If so, how do you ensure these approaches are creating the right experiences for the user you’re designing for? If we leverage content, UI and code from other systems, you inherit whatever bias is baked into those tools. One example is the dozens of AI content and copy generation tools now available — if those systems generate copy for your site, you import their bias into your experience.</p>
<p>To start building more inclusive and equitable experience ecosystems right now, new design and organizational processes are needed. While AI tools that help generate more customized digital experiences will play a big role in new approaches to front-end design and content in the coming years, there are five immediate steps any organization can take:</p>
<p><strong>Make digital equity part of the DEI agenda</strong>: While many organizations have diversity, equity and inclusion goals, these rarely translate into their digital products for customers. Having led design at large companies and also worked in digital startups, the problem is the same across both: a lack of clear accountability to diverse users across the organization.</p>
<p>The truth is that at big and small companies alike, departments compete for impact and who is closer to the customer. The starting point for digital experiences or products is defining and prioritizing diverse users at the business level. If a mandate exists at the most senior levels to create a definition of digital and experience equity, then each department can define how it serves those goals.<br />
No design or product team can make an impact without management and funding support, and the C-suite needs to be held accountable for ensuring this is prioritized.</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Prioritize diversity in your design and dev teams</strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">: There’s been a lot written about this, but it’s vital to emphasize that teams that lack any diverse perspective will create experiences based on their privileged background and abilities. </span></p>
<p>I would add that it’s essential to cast for people who have experience designing for diverse users. How is your organization changing its hiring process to improve design and developer groups? Who are you partnering with to help source diverse talent? Are your DEI goals just check boxes on a hiring form that are circumvented when hiring the designer you already had in mind? Do your agencies have clear and proactive diversity programs? How well-versed are they in inclusive design?</p>
<p>A few valuable initiatives from Google are exemplary: In its efforts to improve representation in the talent pipeline, it has shifted funding of machine learning courses from predominantly white institutions to a more inclusive range of schools, enabled free access to TensorFlow courses and sends free tickets to BIPOC developers to attend events like Google I/O.</p>
<p><strong>Redefine what and whom you test with</strong>: Too often, user testing (if it happens at all) is limited to the most profitable or important user segments. But how does your site work with an aging population or with younger users who don’t ever use desktop computers?</p>
<p>One of the key aspects of equity versus equality in experience is developing and testing a variety of experiences. Too often, design teams test ONE design and tweak based on user feedback (again, if they’re testing at all). Though it might be more work, creating design variations considering the needs of older users, people who are mobile-only, from different cultural backgrounds, etc. allows you to link designs to digital equity goals.</p>
<p><strong>Shift your design goal from <em>one</em> design for all users to launching <em>multiple</em> versions of an experience: </strong>Common practice for digital design and product development is to create a single version of any experience based on the needs of the most important users. A future where there’s not one version of any app or site, but many iterations that align to diverse users, flies in the face of how most design organizations are resourced and create work.</p>
<p>However, this shift is essential in a pivot to experience equity. Ask simple questions: Does your site/product/app have a variation with simple, larger text for older audiences? In designing for lower-income households, can mobile-only users complete the tasks you’re expecting, as with people who would switch to desktops to complete?</p>
<p>This goes beyond simply having a responsive version of your website or testing variations to find the best possible design. Design teams should have a goal of launching multiple focused experiences that tie directly back to prioritized diverse and underserved users.</p>
<p><strong>Embrace automation to create variations of content and copy for each user group</strong>: Even if we create design variations or test with a wide range of users, I’ve often seen content and UI copy be considered an afterthought; especially as organizations scale, content either becomes more jargon-filled or so overpolished that it’s meaningless.<br />
If we take copy from existing language (say, marketing copy) and put it into an app, how are you limiting people’s understanding of what the tool is for or how to use it? If the solution to experience bias is variation in front-end design based on the needs of the individual, then one smart way we can dramatically accelerate that is to understand where automation can be applied.</p>
<p>We’re at a moment in time where there is a quiet explosion of new AI tools that will radically change the way UI and content are created. Look at the volume of copy-driven AI tools that have come online in the last year — while they’re largely aimed at helping content creators write ads and blog posts faster, it’s not a stretch to imagine a custom deployment of such a tool within a large brand that takes users’ data and dynamically generates UI copy and content on the fly for them. Older users may get more textual descriptions of services or products that have zero jargon; Gen Z users may get more referential copy with a heavier dose of imagery.</p>
<p>The no-code platforms show a similar opportunity — everything from WebFlow to Thunkable speaks to the possibility of dynamically generated UI. While Canva’s designs may feel generic at times, thousands of businesses are using it to create visual content rather than hire designers.</p>
<p>So many companies are using the Adobe Experience Cloud but seemingly ignore the experience automation functions that are buried inside. Ultimately, the role of design will change from handcrafting bespoke experiences to being curators of dynamically generated UI — just look at how animation in film has evolved over the past 20 years.</p>
<h2>The future of design variation powered by machine learning and AI</h2>
<p>The steps above are oriented toward changing the way that organizations address experience bias using current state technology. But if the future state of addressing experience bias is rooted in creating design and content variations, AI tools will start to play a critical role. We already see a huge wave of AI-driven content tools like Jarvis.ai, Copy.ai and others — then there are automation tools built into Figma, Adobe XD and other platforms.</p>
<p>AI and machine learning technology that can dynamically generate front-end design and content is still nascent in many ways, but there are interesting examples I’d call out that speak to what’s coming.</p>
<p>The first is the work that Google released earlier this year with <a href="https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you">Material You</a>, its design system for Android devices that’s intended to be highly customizable for users as well as having a high degree of accessibility built-in. Users can customize color, type and layout, giving them a high degree of control — but there are machine learning features emerging that may change the designs based on user variables such as location or time of day.</p>
<p>While the personalization aspects are initially pitched as giving users more ability to customize for themselves, reading through the details of Material You reveals a lot of possible intersections with automation at the design layer.</p>
<p>It’s also important to call out the work that organizations have been doing around design principles and interactions for how people experience AI; for example, Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/haxtoolkit/">Human-AI eXperience</a> program, which covers a core set of interaction principles and design patterns that can be used in crafting AI-driven experiences alongside an upcoming playbook for anticipating and designing solutions for human-AI interaction failures.</p>
<p>These examples are indicators of a future that <em>assumes</em> interactions and designs are generated by AI — but there are precious few examples of how this manifests in the real world as of yet. The point is that, to reduce bias, we need to evolve to a place where there is a radical increase in variation and personalization for front-end designs, and this speaks to the trends emerging around the intersection of AI and design.</p>
<p>These technologies and new design practices will converge to create an opportunity for organizations to radically change how they design for their users. If we don’t begin to look now at the question of experience bias, we won’t have an opportunity to address it as this new era of front-end automation takes hold.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venture capital is a popular source of capital for early-stage startups, but it&#8217;s definitely not the only one. Debt is an increasingly popular alternative, as is non-dilutive, revenue-based financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, we invited Accel Partner <a href="https://www.accel.com/people/arun-mathew">Arun Mathew</a>, Clearco co-founder and president <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/micheleromanow/?originalSubdomain=ca">Michele Romanow</a>, and Pipe co-founder and co-CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/harryhurst/">Harry Hurst</a> to TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 last week to discuss the various ways companies can raise capital and which might be the best avenue for startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. (Hurst unfortunately had a power outage so was not available for the entirety of the panel).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Clearco and Pipe offer revenue-based financing and both have raised large sums of venture capital themselves, some might say ironically. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Romanow and Hurst were emphatic in their belief that venture funding and other forms of capital don’t have to be &#8220;mutually exclusive.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I actually think the biggest companies in our portfolio are broadly using multiple, different pools of capital,&#8221; Romanow said. &#8220;I would encourage you to do your research on what type of capital is good for which particular stage of the company you&#8217;re in, and which particular purpose you&#8217;re using it for. And if you do that, I think you&#8217;ll find that you&#8217;ll end up being a lot less diluted at the end of the day. And you&#8217;ll actually find more leverage over time that will allow you to scale a lot faster.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mathew argued that the majority of startups are actually </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">not</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a great fit for venture investment. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venture investment is expensive, and depending on who you raise from, it comes associated with certain expectations,&#8221; he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Romanow pointed out that whether or not a founder should opt for venture capital or other types of financing largely depends on what they are planning to use the money for. For example, if a startup were looking for capital to spend on inventory and advertising, then venture dollars wouldn&#8217;t be the best fit. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It really doesn’t make sense to give up valuable equity at an early stage to do something that’s a repeatable and scalable expense with a fixed return,&#8221; Romanow said. </span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Wildfires have become an increasingly regular occurrence across the world, from Greece and Turkey to Australia and California.</p>
<p>There are various causes of these fires, from stray cigarettes and unextinguished campfires to lightning strikes and, as is especially prevalent in California, damaged power lines.</p>
<p>The Dixie Fire, which started on July 13 after a tree fell on Pacific Gas &amp; Electric power lines, grew to become the <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2021/08/06/dixie-fire-becomes-largest-single-wildfire-in-california-history-1389651">single largest fire</a> in California history.</p>
<p>With PG&amp;E facing mounting debt due to various lawsuits between the wildfires of 2015 and 2017 and the 2018 Camp Fire that consumed the town of Paradise, the utility company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in hopes of avoiding <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2020-06-17/pge-bankruptcy-new-pge-looks-like-old-pge">tens of billions of dollars in additional fire liabilities.</a></p>
<p>PG&amp;E emerged from bankruptcy with commitments to a $25.5 billion <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pg-e-charges-to-swell-to-25-billion-after-wildfire-settlement-11575904672">settlement</a> for all major wildfire victims and groups, along with changes to its board of directors.</p>
<p>Currently, <a href="https://www.pge.com/en_US/safety/yard-safety/powerlines-and-trees/power-line-clearance.page">PG&amp;E’s vegetation management</a> protocol consists of year-round tree clearances using traditional methods. After the land- or homeowner is notified of an upcoming inspection, inspectors will manually mark trees that require pruning or removal. It could take up to four to six weeks for marked trees to be taken care of accordingly.</p>
<p>As part of the bankruptcy’s plan of reorganization, <a href="https://www.pgecurrents.com/2020/06/20/pge-achieves-bankruptcy-court-confirmation-of-its-plan-of-reorganization/">the California Public Utilities Commission enacted measures to strengthen PG&amp;E’s governance and operations</a>. One of these measures includes the <a href="https://www.pge.com/en_US/safety/emergency-preparedness/natural-disaster/wildfires/vegetation-management.page">Enhanced Vegetation Management (EVM) program</a> to reduce wildfire risks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This means that while PG&amp;E continues its vegetation management protocol, it will also account for potential risks from trees that are dead or dying, have overhanging limbs or are too tall. The company’s main goal is to complete 1,800 out of 2,400 miles of EVM by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>The utility identified Circuit Protection Zones (CPZ) as the center of focus for the top 20% of areas with the highest wildfire risk. The top 20% are portioned into areas of risk from 1%-3%, 4%-10% and 11%-20%, with the top 1%-3% being the main focus for the 1,800 EVM miles. Just the 1%-3% cover an estimated 2,422 miles.</p>
<p>Comparing the origin of the Dixie Fire from sources like the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/california-fire-map/dixie-fire-2021">San Francisco Chronicle</a>, Google Maps and the map provided by PG&amp;E, it is apparent that the Dixie Fire is only near CPZs with a risk of 11%-20%. The likelihood of PG&amp;E carrying out its EVM program this year in the Dixie Fire region is very low.</p>
<p>California droughts have been <a href="https://www.drought.gov/states/california#historical-conditions">more intense and lasting longer</a>. There is not much leeway for wagering between what provides the most risk. In this case, access to information and the speed of these operations needs to match the scale.</p>
<p>At Spacept, we are interested in seeing whether our tools could spot the vegetation hazards that caused the Dixie Fire. Being able to spot encroachment could allow wildfire prevention in the future and increase utility reliability.</p>
<p>To determine this, we pulled satellite data taken on June 15 by the SPOT Satellite and focused on the area pinpointed by the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/california-fire-map/dixie-fire-2021">San Francisco Chronicle</a> as the likely starting point. The fire is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/09/1026078606/dixie-fire-california-only-21-percent-contained">reported</a> to have begun near Feather River Canyon on Dixie Road.</p>

<p>We then applied our Tree Detector to the satellite image to find any tree or vegetation encroachment on the path cleared by PG&amp;E surrounding the power lines.</p>

<p>Our Tree Detector found certain levels of overgrowth on the path of the power lines. Zooming in to one part of it and placing a mask detecting the power line’s path and the vegetation, we generated an image of one such area of dangerous overgrowth.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211392" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211392" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2211392" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/wildfire-3.png" alt="" width="1000" height="912" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/wildfire-3.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/wildfire-3.png?resize=150,137 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/wildfire-3.png?resize=300,274 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/wildfire-3.png?resize=768,700 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/wildfire-3.png?resize=680,620 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/wildfire-3.png?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211392" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spacept</p></div></p>
<p>In the image, the blue path represents cleared sections of the power line’s path, the red represents levels of high tree and vegetation density, and the orange represents medium levels of vegetation density.</p>
<p>Given <a href="https://www.pge.com/en_US/safety/yard-safety/powerlines-and-trees/right-tree-right-place/right-tree-right-place.page?WT.mc_id=Vanity_righttreerightplace">PG&amp;E’s recommendation</a> that tree lines of heights under 40 feet be no closer than 15 feet from power lines, we found several areas of high concern that breached such protocols in this area. In future situations, PG&amp;E and other power companies could use satellite-based solutions like those at <a href="http://spacept.com">Spacept</a> to identify such overgrowth beforehand and direct vegetation management resources to those areas.</p>
<p>In places like California where wildfires are especially frequent and devastating, any decrease in the number of wildfires in the area could prevent the destruction of crucial ecosystems and infrastructure &#8212; and save such companies billions of dollars in lawsuits.</p>
<p>The hurdles of scalability and the operations to initiate an inspection need improved management foresight. Satellite analysis is a feasible, proactive approach and presents accelerated results for vegetation management.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Updated at 8.15pm PT, October 3</strong>: In a statement just now, Ula confirmed TechCrunch&#8217;s reporting, saying it has raised $87 million in its Series B financing round. The round was, as TechCrunch reported, co-led by Prosus Ventures, Tencent, and B Capital. Jeff Bezos invested in the new round.</p>
<p>“We launched in 2020, with a single-minded mission to empower small, neighborhood retailers with technology to increase their income. We take a long-term approach to solve the underlying problems of traditional retailers by investing in technology, supply chain and data-enabled credit offering,” said Nipun Mehra, co-founder and chief executive of Ula, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Ula’s new investors come with global expertise and share this long-term mindset of the company. We are grateful to them for believing in Ula’s mission and hope to learn from their experience re-imagining retail in other emerging markets” he added.</p>
<p><strong>Our original story follows:</strong></p>
<p>Indonesian <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/ula-raises-20-million-to-expand-its-e-commerce-marketplace-in-indonesia/">e-commerce startup Ula</a>, which has raised over $30 million and courted many high-profile investors since launching last year, has now won the trust of the world&#8217;s richest person.</p>
<p>The founder of Amazon has invested in the one-and-a-half-year-old startup&#8217;s new financing round, his first in the Southeast Asia region, sources and many others familiar with the matter told me.</p>
<p>The Jakarta-headquartered firm &#8212; which counts B Capital Group, Sequoia Capital India, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Quona Capital among its existing investors &#8212; is in advanced stages of talks to finalize a new round of over $80 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jeff Bezos has agreed to invest in Ula through his family office, Bezos Expeditions, people said, requesting anonymity as the matter is private. B Capital Group, Tencent and Prosus Ventures are positioning to co-lead the round, which could close as soon as this month.</p>
<p>Bezos’ interest in Ula, which operates a business-to-business e-commerce platform, comes at a time when Amazon has either not entered most Southeast Asian nations &#8212; or maintains a limited presence there.</p>
<p>Public relations reps of Ula did not respond to requests for comment on Saturday.</p>
<p>Ula helps small retailers solve inefficiencies that they face in supply chain, inventory and working capital. It operates a wholesale e-commerce marketplace to help store owners stock only the inventory they need, and also grants them with working capital.</p>
<p>The startup was founded by Nipun Mehra (a former executive of Flipkart in India and ex-partner at Sequoia Capital India), Alan Wong (who previously worked with Amazon), Derry Sakti (who oversaw consumer goods giant P&amp;G’s operations in Indonesia), and Riky Tenggara (formerly with Lazada and aCommerce).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla delivered a record-breaking 241,300 electric vehicles in the third quarter, blowing past expectations as other U.S. automakers experienced a drop in sales as the result of a global chip shortage.</p>
<p>The vast majority of Tesla deliveries (some 96%) were its newer Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover, according to its <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q3-2020-vehicle-production-deliveries">report released</a> Saturday. Tesla said that 9,275 of the vehicles it delivered were  Model X and S. Deliveries grew 20% since the second quarter and by 73% than the same period last year.</p>
<p>Production numbers have also grown. Tesla produced 237,823 electric vehicles in the third quarter, another record for the company.</p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk congratulated the company and its employees via a tweet for hitting the delivery and production numbers. In a separate tweet, Musk wrote &#8220;And thanks very much to our suppliers &amp; logistics partners for coming through despite great difficulties!&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">And thanks very much to our suppliers &amp; logistics partners for coming through despite great difficulties!</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1444362460459323392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While Tesla beat expectations, other legacy automakers reported a drop in U.S. sales. (Tesla&#8217;s sales are global and the company does not provide regional data).</p>
<p>GM took the hardest hit. GM reported Friday it sold <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/oct/1001-gmsales.html">446,997 vehicles in the U.S.</a>, a 33% drop in new vehicle sales compared to the same quarter last year. GM has idled several plants this summer due to the global shortage of semiconductor chips and battery packs for its Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUV vehicles. Those plants have since come back online.</p>
<p>Despite the drop in U.S. sales, GM said it was maintaining its full-year adjusted earnings of $11.5 billion to $13.5 billion as the company &#8220;continues to develop solutions to mitigate the impacts of the semiconductor shortage and Chevrolet Bolt EV recall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stellantis, formerly Fiat Chrysler, reported an 18% drop in U.S. sales. Ford has not reported its sales numbers yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, subscribe here.</em></p>
<p>Emerging founders and investors in tech must be exuding extreme main character energy, because this week in tech was all about making their lives easier.</p>
<p>AngelList announced AngelList Stack, a new suite of products that will compete with Carta in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/angellist-stack-founder/">providing services to help founders start, operate and maintain ownership over their companies.</a> The new software will cover four bases: end-to-end incorporation, business banking, adviser equity grants and cap table management.</p>
<p>Here’s why AngelList isn’t worried about Carta, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/angellist-stack-founder/">per CEO Avlok Kohli</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are a lot of experiments around point solutions, around solving different problems for different point problems for founders. Our view is that founders prefer always being integrated into one bundle.</p></blockquote>
<p>Moving into the world of founder support was a surprising but sensical move for AngelList, according to my Twitter DMs. The startup spent the last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/angellist-pioneers-rolling-vc-funds-in-pivot-to-saas/">growing its venture services business,</a> after first piloting rolling funds, which allow LPs to back investors on a quarterly subscription model. Speaking of rolling funds, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/gumroad-founder-sahil-lavingia-launches-new-seed-fund-in-collaboration-with-angellist/">one of the first to launch was from Sahil Lavingia</a>, the founder and CEO of Gumroad. He had some news of his own with AngelList this week, albeit in the world of scouts, or people who source deals for venture capital investors.</p>
<p>Lavingia is launching a new, pooled scout fund with AngelList in which each scout gets carry in their referred deal (5%) and an additional 5% in the whole pool of startups. In other words, he redirected 33% of his carry, or how much money the fund makes from portco exits, to its scouts.</p>
<p>The scout fund is unique because, while most funds may have scout programs today, it’s still super rare to share carry with scouts both from a pooled <em>and</em> individual perspective.</p>
<p>He explained why it matters on a personal note: paper trails.</p>
<blockquote><p>I want to go super wide with this and build a very different kind of coalition of scouts. If they can prove themselves, and they get a paper trial that they have, I can help them get plugged into this ecosystem.</p>
<p>[Even with crypto] you&#8217;re seeing the financialization of all these relationships. Before, there&#8217;s kind of this informal handshake, pay-it-forward thing that happens in Silicon Valley, whereas with crypto, it&#8217;s kind of like &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna buy it in this transactional way knowing what the incentives actually are.&#8221; I&#8217;m sending you this deal, but let&#8217;s be real here: This is a business transaction and I&#8217;m sending you this deal so I think it’s good to codify it.</p>
<p>I actually don&#8217;t mind that I didn’t make any money off of Pinterest, but what is sometimes frustrating is that an LP won’t value the fact that I sent an investor to Pinterest [when it was valued at $5 million].</p></blockquote>
<p>As Lavingia hints, a common thread between his effort and AngelList&#8217;s is that they both want to  formalize processes &#8212; whether it’s starting a company or introducing an investor to one. It’s hard to philosophically argue against more transparency and distribution in entrepreneurship, but it’s also hard to pull off those goals in a way that actually helps those who need it most.</p>
<p>Think of it like this: AngelList wants it to be easier than ever to start a startup. But for whom? Lavingia thinks it&#8217;s great for scouts to get paid, in full, for companies that they spot and thus develop a track record. But what if the scouts are the same people that could probably start a rolling fund if they wanted to? I always worry that new bets, whether it&#8217;s a company going full stack or an investor sharing more of their carry, will want to de-risk from built-in volatility. In the end, democratizing access requires betting on historically overlooked people, and that’s a risk that venture clearly doesn’t make often.</p>
<p>It’s why AngelList and Lavingia have to go bold when building these new projects. Optionality (and affordability) is key when trying to usher in a new generation of innovators. But, they need to ignore the status quo of who full stack served in the past. Hell, they even need to take a page out of the crypto playbook.</p>
<p>In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll talk about frozen yogurt’s impact on consolidation, workplace benefits and a walk back on blitzscaling.

<p>This week on Equity, we graduated from a conversation on full-stack approaches, like the ones above, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/here-for-influencer-branded-mac-and-cheese/">how consolidation seems to be everywhere these days</a>. There’s layers, or as the Equity team would like to say, flavors, to think about.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>We used fro-yo toppings as a way to understand if it makes sense for startups to be point-solutions (give you the best of one flavor) or full-stack solutions (give you the medium option, but offer everything). This mindset helps fuel if consolidation makes sense from a horizontal or vertical perspective. And the conversation all started <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/rpa-industry-consolidation-continues-with-sale-of-blue-prism-to-vista-for-1-095b/">with a deal from the RPA space. </a></p>

<p>I’m still reflecting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/reid-hoffman-on-the-evolution-of-blitzscaling-amid-the-pandemic/">on a conversation</a> that I had with Reid Hoffman last week during TechCrunch Disrupt. The founder of LinkedIn joined us the same day that Greylock, where he is an investment partner, announced a $500 million seed fund. So, there was definitely a lot to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> Even though Hoffman is ironically adding to the ample capital in the market today, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/reid-hoffman-on-the-evolution-of-blitzscaling-amid-the-pandemic/">one of his loudest messages was to stay focused. </a></p>
<p>An excerpt from my piece:</p>
<blockquote><p>When LinkedIn co-founder and Greylock partner Reid Hoffman first coined the term “blitzscaling,” he kept it simple: It’s a concept that encourages entrepreneurs to prioritize speed over efficiency during a period of uncertainty. Years later, founders are navigating a pandemic, perhaps the most uncertain period of their lives, and Hoffman has a clarification to make.</p>
<p>“Blitzscaling itself isn’t the goal … blitzscaling is being inefficient; it’s spending capital inefficiently and hiring inefficiently; it’s being uncertain about your business model; and those are not good things.” Instead, he said, blitzscaling is a choice companies may have to make for a set period of time to outpace a competitor or react to a pandemic rather than a route to take from idea to IPO.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Around TC</h2>
<p>I buried the lede here, but this week we announced that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/introducing-techcrunch-plus/">ExtraCrunch is rebranding to TechCrunch+</a>! We’re doing it to better harness the TechCrunch brand, but also because we don’t think our pieces — most of which are helping to provide signal amid the noise — are “extra.” Instead, as our team puts it, it’s table stakes. Plus, it’s a super cute logo.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<p>At TikTok&#8217;s online event, TikTok World, the company announced a range of new initiatives, product updates and advertising formats in an effort to woo more marketers to its platform. On the e-commerce front, TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/tiktok-shopping-expands-with-more-partnerships-live-shopping-new-ads-and-more/">expanded its set of shopping partners</a> beyond pilot partner Shopify. Earlier this year, the video platform began piloting TikTok Shopping in the U.S., U.K. and Canada, in a deal that allowed Shopify merchants with a TikTok For Business account to add a Shopping tab to their TikTok profiles and sync their product catalogs to the app to create mini-storefronts. Now, TikTok is rolling out to new brand partners for TikTok Shopping, including Square, Ecwid and PrestaShop, with Wix, SHOPLINE, OpenCart and BASE coming soon. It also introduced a fuller slate of solutions for TikTok commerce, including ad products and later this year, a TikTok Shopping API. The app now offers a trio of in-feed ad products for online shopping: Collection Ads which feature swipeable and tappable product cards; Dynamic Showcase Ads (DSAs), which are automatically generated ads; and Lead Generation ads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company also presented its new plan to ramp up advertiser investment with a new promise of “brand safety” and the launch of several new and interactive ad formats, ranging from clickable stickers to “Choose Your Own Adventure”-type ads to “super likes” and more. The ads are meant to encourage TikTok users to tap, swipe and use gestures to interact with the ads&#8217; content. There&#8217;s even an ad where users get to direct the storytelling, and a mini page that lets brands connect users with their message directly in the TikTok app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210689" style="width: 448px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210689" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2210689" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.44-PM.jpg?w=438" alt="" width="438" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.44-PM.jpg 1084w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.44-PM.jpg?resize=97,150 97w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.44-PM.jpg?resize=193,300 193w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.44-PM.jpg?resize=768,1192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.44-PM.jpg?resize=438,680 438w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.44-PM.jpg?resize=990,1536 990w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-30-at-12.45.44-PM.jpg?resize=32,50 32w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210689" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok (super like)</p></div></p>
<p>To date, marketers haven’t carved out as much of their spending for TikTok compared with other major platforms, like Facebook and Instagram. But TikTok parent company ByteDance has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-owner-bytedances-annual-revenue-jumps-to-34-3-billion-11623903622">been making inroads in the global ad market</a>, with annual revenue across its apps more than doubling in 2020 to reach $34.3 billion. In the U.S., TikTok was expected to bring in $500 million in 2020, up from $200-$300 million in the year prior, according to a report by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tiktoks-u-s-revenues-expected-to-hit-500-million-this-year">The Information.</a> (Some of that is from <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-revenue-75-million">in-app purchases</a>, of course.)</p>
<p>As TikTok has scaled its ad business, its ad prices have been steadily increasing, too. Bloomberg noted this summer it was jacking up home page takeover ads, its most valuable real estate, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/tiktok-is-jacking-up-prices-as-it-builds-its-ad-business?sref=gni836kR">to more than $2 million</a> on top days — like holidays. Reuters also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/tiktoks-us-ad-business-roars-back-trumps-threats-recede-2021-02-16/">noted</a> that TikTok saw a 500% increase in the number of advertisers that were running campaigns in the U.S. from the start of 2020 to the end, though ad sales were still small compared with other major platforms. That continues to be the case in 2021. In fact, TikTok was not even broken out in eMarketer’s recent tabulation of U.S. ad revenues, where it’s instead lumped into an “Other” category with other, smaller social networks (like Tumblr), which, combined, are expected to reach $1.3 billion in 2021.</p>
<p>The company also this week announced a new milestone <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/tiktok-reached-1-billion-monthly-active-users/">with 1 billion monthly active users</a> worldwide.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2210742" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2210742" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2210742" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="673" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png 1020w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=300,297 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=768,760 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=680,673 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Social-Network-Ad-Revenues-by-Company-10.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2210742" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> eMarketer</p></div></p>

<h3>Apple finally lets users review its own apps</h3>
<p>Apple has put itself on equal footing with its rivals by <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/29/rate-and-review-apple-iphone-built-in-apps/">allowing users to rate and review</a> its first-party apps that are available for download in its App Store. That means users can now leave reviews for built-in apps like Mail, Music, News, Stocks and Calculator and others. Some apps are holding up better than others. News is sitting at 2.5 stars as users complain about ads, even in the paid version, personalization elements, nags to buy Apple News+ and more. Podcasts has just 2 stars, Apple Music has 3.5 stars. Fitness is doing well with 5 stars, and Wallet app has a solid 4.</p>
<p>The change likely came about due to increased regulatory scrutiny over the App Store, which critics argue gives Apple an unfair advantage over its competition. That could have included not displaying user sentiment and feedback about Apple&#8217;s own apps.</p>
<h3>Microsoft Windows store opens to third-party storefront; your move, Apple?</h3>
<p>Remember when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/apple-digs-in-heels-over-its-app-store-commission-structure-with-release-of-new-study/">Apple last year argued</a> that its commission rate wasn&#8217;t so high because the wider market for apps and games had already determined that 70/30 was a standard split? At the time, it pointed to other major app stores&#8217; policies, including the Amazon Appstore, Galaxy Store and Microsoft Store as points of comparison with its own App Store. (See below)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2020294" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2020294" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2020294" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-1.17.29-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="425" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-1.17.29-PM.jpg 1098w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-1.17.29-PM.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-1.17.29-PM.jpg?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-1.17.29-PM.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-1.17.29-PM.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screen-Shot-2020-07-22-at-1.17.29-PM.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2020294" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Analysis Group</p></div></p>
<p>Well, Apple would probably appreciate it if everyone would look away from those app stores now. And particularly don&#8217;t look too closely at what the updated Microsoft Store is doing!</p>
<p>This June, the Microsoft Store <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/">updated</a> its revenue share terms and <a href="https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.microsoft.com%2Ffwlink%2F%3Flinkid%3D528905&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cchoneck%40we-worldwide.com%7C65df3fea2a2444edec0608d9841cf255%7C3ed60ab455674971a5341a5f0f7cc7f5%7C0%7C0%7C637686082165371040%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=tY4PvkbRRRXpJCdVs8Ve9ZXEJAVG8FsxqeBzpsVUeRk%3D&amp;reserved=0">policies</a> to offer more favorable terms. App developers using Microsoft&#8217;s payments platform will now see an 85/15 revenue share, while game developers will see an 88/12 split as of August 1. More importantly, (non-game) app developers are allowed to use third-party payment processors in their own apps and retain 100% of the revenue.</p>
<p>This week, the Microsoft Store announced it will allow third-party app store apps as well. The company <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2021/09/28/microsoft-store-more-apps-more-open/">says it will make third-party storefront apps discoverable</a> in the Microsoft Store on Windows, including Amazon and Epic Games, over the next few months. There is no requirement for these stores to also list their apps and games inside the Microsoft Store, if they choose to go this route. And they can use their own payment processors and keep the revenues.</p>
<p>While being presented as a major win for an open ecosystem, the reality from a consumer&#8217;s perspective is that this doesn&#8217;t change much. You could always download third-party apps and third-party app stores, like the Epic Games Store, on Windows devices.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211227" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211227" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2211227" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image2-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image2-1.png 1429w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image2-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image2-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image2-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image2-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/image2-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211227" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>But in the broader regulatory environment, it&#8217;s a deft move. It immediately reduces the potential regularity scrutiny that could have landed on Microsoft &#8212; after all, the company is still tapping into the revenue streams for the apps and games it hosts, in some cases. And it would like that to continue! However, now Microsoft will be able to say developers on its platform have choices &#8212; they can distribute their apps with their own payment mechanisms and they can package their games into storefronts to avoid commissions, too.</p>
<p>This, in turn, will point the finger back at Apple and Google as being the platforms that are being slow to catch up with where the market is headed. And it could potentially keep Microsoft&#8217;s name out of any forthcoming legal battles or new app store legislation. In the meantime, Microsoft&#8217;s expanded and redesigned store &#8212; which will include storefront apps, PWAs and alternative browsers, too &#8212; has a better shot at becoming a place where users actually want to shop.</p>
<p>The question of third-party storefronts has been a longtime point of contention between Epic Games and Apple &#8212; the gaming company wants to offer its own distribution system from within the App Store to reach iOS users and retain the revenue it generates. But this issue extends further back than Apple&#8217;s latest fight with Epic. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/06/apple-tightens-the-noose-on-apps-for-recommending-apps-going-after-sharing-and-search-tools/">Apple has banned third-party app store apps</a> for years, as they had been used in the past as a way to artificially inflate app store rankings. The storefront apps claimed that all they offered was another way to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/07/apple-pulls-ios-app-discovery-service-appgratis-from-app-store/">discover new apps</a>, of course. But even that was a threat. Apple has always wanted to own discovery &#8212; and the ad dollars that accompany paid discovery, too.</p>
<p>While anyone who understands app ecosystems knows that a PC platform like Windows is <em>not at all</em> a direct comparison to a closed ecosystem like iOS and the App Store, it was Apple itself that had listed Microsoft, among others, as points of comparison. Apple said &#8220;everyone else was doing x,&#8221; so it should too, when it came to commissions. Now the company will have to hope that regulators can pick up on the nuances between a Windows app store and its own.</p>

<h3>Apple Updates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Some users are <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/30/ios-15-iphone-13-carplay-issues/">reporting CarPlay issues</a> with iOS 15 and iPhone 13,</strong> which is leading CarPlay to suddenly crash whenever someone tries to play music through Apple Music or third-party apps, like Spotify. This <a href="https://www.imore.com/iphone-13-users-complain-carplay-issues">is a pretty serious complaint</a>, with users filling online forums with their issues. Such a bug would be acceptable in a beta release, but in a public build it&#8217;s definitely not.</li>
<li><strong>The latest iOS 15.1 beta <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/09/28/apple-fixes-unlock-with-apple-watch-bug-in-ios-151-beta?utm_medium=rss">fixes</a></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><strong> the &#8220;Unlock with Apple Watch&#8221; bug</strong> which </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212828">was preventing</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> users from unlocking their iPhone 13 with their Apple Watch.</span></li>
<li><strong>Apple <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=oefg5bhp">reminded developers</a></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><strong> to get ready for the iPad mini&#8217;s new display.</strong> The company said if developers were following best practices with Auto Layout and size classes, their app’s interface will dynamically adapt to the new dimensions. If, however, they added UIRequiresFullScreen=YES to the app’s Info.plist in order to keep your app full screen during multitasking, they&#8217;ll instead need to recompile with Xcode 13 and the SDK for iPadOS 15 to take advantage of the full screen size.</span></li>

<li><strong>Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-unveils-new-features-in-iwork-suite-of-productivity-apps/">gave its iWork suite a notable update</a>.</strong> One of the standout features is the addition of a live video feature in Keynote, which lets you place a live camera view or screen capture view as video objects on a slide. These live video objects can be resized or styled with masks, frames, drop shadows and reflections. Users can also connect multiple external cameras for more interactive demos using different camera angles. Other new features include an optimized mobile experience for Pages; support for Pivot Tables and Radar charts (a new chart type that makes it easy to visually compare multiple variables) in Numbers; and support for new translation features across the suite of apps.</li>
<li><strong>Yahoo is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/yahoo-has-built-a-new-calendar-app-called-day-and-its-recruited-the-co-founder-of-sunrise-to-design-it/">developing</a> a new calendar app called Day,</strong> with help from Jeremy Le Van — who co-founded the popular calendaring app, Sunrise, which sold to Microsoft for over $100 million.</li>

<p>I love that the App Store still supports (at least, for now) small, single-purpose indie apps like Pearl. The app is great if you&#8217;re the kind of person who gets energized by motivational quotes or just needs to be reminded to chill, be calm, breathe, work toward your goals or anything else. With Pearl, you can turn Apple&#8217;s push notification system from a thing of annoyance into a thing that brings hope and purpose. The app lets you add images to motivational quotes or any other message of your choosing to create custom push notifications that will appear randomly throughout your day. Mac, iPhone and iPad are supported. Free download with a $1.99 one-time in-app purchase for multiple notifications.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered which politicians own a stock you&#8217;re looking into? Or do you wish you could see what the WSB folks were into without having to constantly check in with that community? Maybe you like to read Reddit for crypto ideas? In other words, if &#8220;alternative data&#8221; is your thing, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quiver-quantitative/id1568546369">Quiver Quantitivative</a> is a destination that makes it easier to access, by pulling from public records and message boards and putting it all in one place. While we <em>can&#8217;t</em> recommend making investment decisions off alternative data, as a research tool, the Quiver Quantitative app is an interesting find. The app was updated this week with a new dashboard tracking stock trading by U.S. Representatives, a new dashboard tracking off-exchange trading and a new dashboard tracking Reddit cryptocurrency discussions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by what the weekday </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>Exchange column</em></a><em> digs into, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>As the week closed out, we had a big SPAC deal drop that I have yet to fully unpack — though I will note that <a href="https://s28.q4cdn.com/828571518/files/doc_presentation/2021/09/IonQ_Investor_Presentation_-_Sept_2021_Updates_v092121.pdf">its investor presentation</a> includes a slide of global leaders’ headshots, which is worth at least a silver medal in the ISPAC presentation hype Olympics — and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/softbank-backed-oyo-files-for-1-16-billion-ipo/">Oyo filed to go public</a>. Expect a lot more on those matters to start next week!</p>
<p>But this fine Saturday we’re talking Y Combinator and DAOs. These are different topics, mind, as YC is most certainly not a DAO. Let’s get into it.</p>
<h2>Y Combinator, credentialism and for whom the valuation tolls</h2>
<p>In terms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale">Scovilles per character</a>, few tweets were as spicy this week <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisJBakke/status/1443772381567225873">was the following</a>:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The most surprising thing in 2021 early-stage investing isn’t Tiger, or $500m seed funds, or rolling funds.</p>
<p>It’s that YC is still buying 7% of incredible companies for $125k.</p>
<p>&mdash; Chris Bakke (@ChrisJBakke) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisJBakke/status/1443772381567225873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Translating a bit, with more and more capital lining up to pour itself into the open maws of early-stage startups, and the recent valuation inflation that the startup market has seen, how the hell is Y Combinator still able to charge so much for its capital-and-course in startup mechanics? Brand, in part. And the guidance it provides, to some degree.</p>
<p>Being a Y Combinator-backed startup provides an imprimatur of credibility to a nascent org that may be more dream than reality. It’s a bit like a diploma from a school you are proud to have attended for uni on your wall. And, critically, for startups in emerging economies, going through Y Combinator can help put you on the investor map. So, the dilution may be worth the price of admission.</p>
<p>It’s a darn steep cost, though. You are getting way less than $200 per basis point in your startup, a price that is beyond inexpensive given the hit rate of the standard Y Combinator batch these days. It’s essentially a license to print money for the group.</p>
<p>Not that there is a problem with that, per se, as it’s just capitalism at work. But as the effective cost of Y Combinator attendance has gone up — as the gap between market prices for YC-backed companies and the value that the accelerator places on them as an admission tax <em>expands</em> — the deal is getting less attractive as more international companies take part. So, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/y-combinators-new-batch-features-its-largest-group-of-indian-startups/">rise in Indian</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/this-yc-summer-batch-features-the-largest-group-of-african-startups-yet/">African startups</a> getting into YC is great, but it does seem that they are going to have to pay more for a more diluted program. That irks some part of my brain.</p>
<p>Still, hats off to whomever gets to LP the Y Combinator seed fund. Please enjoy your yachts.</p>
<h2>DAOs</h2>
<p>With that cranky of a start, I thank you for sticking with me for another segment. This one is a bit kinder.</p>
<p>The world of decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, had two key news items this week. The <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1444022549843623937">first was hysterically funny</a>:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m worried we’re not talking enough about how funny this is. <a href="https://t.co/5W1fUBbUc2">https://t.co/5W1fUBbUc2</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Casey Newton (@CaseyNewton) <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1444022549843623937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>To catch you up, Compound made a coding error that led it to sending out tens of millions of dollars in coins out. It was a mistake. And then it tried to get the money back. By <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/01/defi-protocol-compound-mistakenly-gives-away-millions-to-users.html">threatening to dox users</a> to the IRS if they didn’t send back their free money.</p>
<p>The issue of threatening your own user base for your own mistake aside, Compound operates along a democratic setup that decentralizes authority. You can read more about how that works <a href="https://medium.com/compound-finance/compound-governance-5531f524cf68">here</a>, but what matters is that in the case of Compound’s error we’re seeing what happens when a <em>decentralized</em> authority fucks up in a massive, hilarious manner.</p>
<p>More errors like this will occur. They will also be funny. But I don’t think that they put me off what’s attractive about DAOs.</p>
<p>One craptastic element of today’s capitalism has been the degradation of shareholder voting power. Facebook is a prime example of a company where a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/20/shareholders-wont-force-zuckerbergs-hand-in-facebook-management.html">single person</a> controls its future. Snap famously went public with public shares that <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2017/05/26/snap-and-the-rise-of-no-vote-common-shares/">got no votes at all</a>. Dual, and even triple-class shares that award more power to insiders than external parties are, it feels, increasingly common from Silicon Valley-backed companies.</p>
<p>And it sucks. Who the fuck wants capitalism to get <em>more</em> monarchical? The very thought makes me vomit a little in my mouth.</p>
<p>DAOs, by contrast, are more democratic by nature. Sure, voting power will likely be ascribed to those with more ownership. But that’s how the stock market works on a <em>good</em> day, so it’s at least an improvement on today’s IPOs and their hilarious demand that everyone trust that the folks in charge of it today are going to be the best stewards for life.</p>
<p>VCs didn’t used to believe that. They were big on professional CEOs back in the day. Then founders got more power thanks to a changing founder-investor power balance, and after a few founder-led companies did well VCs gave up on the matter.</p>
<p>Perhaps DAOs will have some success in making business slightly more democratic!</p>
<p>The second news item this week from DAO-land was this: “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/utopia-labs-is-building-an-operating-system-for-daos/">Utopia Labs is building an operating system for DAOs</a>.” The company’s name is not bad; it’s actually almost good. Why? Because utopias are hardly fascist paradises; more often when we consider utopia a model in which everyone has a say comes to mind. So, perhaps DAOs are to some degree the business equivalent of utopian thinking. I can’t hate that.</p>
<p>That’s all for this week. Notes from a chat with CapitalG’s Gene Frantz next week!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/china-roundup/">TechCrunch’s China roundup</a>, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">China&#8217;s anti-competition tech crackdown continues to redefine the dynamics among the country&#8217;s internet giants, leading to collaboration between Alibaba and Tencent in the payments race. In the meantime, China&#8217;s tech giants are expanding fearlessly around the world. TikTok became the first internet firm from China to have topped 1 billion overseas users, and Tesla&#8217;s battery supplier CATL is on course to buy a Canadian lithium company to lock up critical battery components.</p>
<h2>Lithium race</h2>
<p>China&#8217;s battery-making giant Contemporary Amperex Technology, known as CATL, has made some big moves to shore up its lithium supply that is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/dupont-and-vcs-see-lithium-mining-as-a-critical-investment-for-the-electric-future/">critical for electric car production</a>. The firm has agreed to acquire Vancouver, Canada-based Millennial Lithium in an all-stock cash deal valued at CAD$377 million, or $297 million, according to an <a href="https://www.millenniallithium.com/news/contemporary-amperex-technology-co-ltd-to-acquire-millennial-lithium-corp-in-an-all-cash-offer-for-cad377-million">announcement</a> made by Millennial Lithium on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The deal is set to secure the critical metal lithium for CATL, one of the world&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-china-positioned-itself-to-dominate-the-future-of-electric-cars-11572804489">largest</a> automotive battery makers. Millennial Lithium&#8217;s main exploration activity <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/millenial-lithium-corp./about/">takes place in Argentina</a>, which, along with Chile and Bolivia, forms the &#8220;lithium triangle&#8221; that holds <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/media/uploads/documents/LAP_201002_vasqyez%20brief_update_v1b%5B1%5D.pdf">most of the world&#8217;s lithium resources</a>.</p>
<p>CATL has been riding the EV boom in recent years, with its revenues spiking from 5.7 billion yuan ($880 million) in 2015 to over 50 billion yuan in 2020. It struck a <a href="https://www.catl.com/uploads/1/file/public/202107/20210712132229_bxn3nxmkua.pdf">major partnership</a> with Tesla earlier this year to supply lithium-ion batteries to the American EV maker from 2022 to 2025, which will no doubt further boost its revenues.</p>

<p>The Millennial investment is just one piece of CATL&#8217;s gigantic investment empire. A few weeks ago, news came that it had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pilbara-minerals-raising/chinas-catl-buys-into-beaten-down-australian-lithium-miner-pilbara-idUSKCN1VP0GT">bought 8.5% in</a> Australian lithium miner Pilbara Minerals. It also <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/catl-increases-investment-in-neo-lithium-866991760.html">holds an 8% stake</a> in another Canadian lithium firm, Neo Lithium.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>TikTok tops 1 billion monthly users</h2>
<p>This is a remarkable <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/tiktok-reached-1-billion-monthly-active-users/">milestone</a> for ByteDance, and really, China&#8217;s tech industry overall. Up until TikTok, no social media platforms from China had been able to rival the global reach of Western giants like Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>TikTok had a series of hurdles to overcome as it rose in dominance around the world, from PR crises around <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/tiktok-hit-with-consumer-child-safety-and-privacy-complaints-in-europe/">child safety concerns</a> to threats by the Trump administration to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/26/tiktok-timeline/">ban the app</a> over national security concerns. These deterrents haven&#8217;t seemed to kneecap TikTok&#8217;s growth in the West, though the app did lose a major market, India, after it was banned by the local government. It&#8217;s not a surprise that ByteDance is the fourth-largest lobbying spender in the U.S. only after Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet.</p>
<p>The question now is how TikTok can optimize monetization from its 1 billion monthly users. In China, ads and e-commerce are already major revenue drivers for TikTok&#8217;s sister short video app Douyin. TikTok is trying to beef up its content commerce business, for instance, by joining hands with Shopify to let its &#8220;business&#8221; creators easily <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/tiktok-expands-shopify-partnership-pilots-tiktok-shopping-in-us-uk-and-canada/">showcase products</a> on their in-app mini-stores.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DIzT28xqx3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/tiktok-expands-shopify-partnership-pilots-tiktok-shopping-in-us-uk-and-canada/">TikTok expands Shopify partnership, pilots TikTok Shopping in US, UK and Canada</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TikTok expands Shopify partnership, pilots TikTok Shopping in US, UK and Canada&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/tiktok-expands-shopify-partnership-pilots-tiktok-shopping-in-us-uk-and-canada/embed/#?secret=DIzT28xqx3" data-secret="DIzT28xqx3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s shopping endeavors, if successful, will also be a boon to China&#8217;s millions of small and medium e-commerce exporters. Many Chinese sellers on Amazon are diversifying sales channels amid the platform&#8217;s wave of crackdowns on black hat tactics, though they understand that in the foreseeable future, no other marketplace can match the Seattle-based behemoth&#8217;s scale.</p>
<h2>Further integration</h2>
<p>The Chinese government has been pressuring the country&#8217;s tech titans to dissolve their &#8220;walled gardens&#8221; and make their services more interchangeable. We wrote two weeks ago that WeChat <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/18/china-roundup-beijing-is-tearing-down-the-digital-walled-gardens/">began allowing</a> external web links, including those from Douyin and Alibaba, to be viewed inside the messenger after the government urged apps to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/18/china-roundup-beijing-is-tearing-down-the-digital-walled-gardens/">open up</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past few days, users noticed that apps affiliated with Alibaba, like food delivery platform Ele.me and video streaming site Youku, have added WeChat Pay as an alternative payments option to Alibaba&#8217;s affiliate Alipay. But Alibaba has yet to allow its rival&#8217;s payment system to enter its flagship marketplace Taobao.</p>
<p>Some of the collaborative efforts between the giants seem reluctant. For example, users can&#8217;t easily make purchases when viewing a Taobao link on WeChat, which defies the purpose of sharing content between apps. Inevitably, internet giants will find new ways to keep users on their platforms under the new and strict regulatory environment.</p>

<p>Hello friends and welcome to <em>bonus</em> Equity, the sort of podcast episode where you get even more chat for the same low price of zilch. We are here to ensure a high ROI for your podcasting dollar!</p>
<p>To cap the week off, Danny and Alex and Chris got together live on Twitter to chat through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/and-thats-that-as-the-zoom-deal-to-buy-five9-is-called-off/">the demise of the Zoom-Five9 deal</a>. Those of you who remember how recently the deal was announced are likely a little surprised &#8212; how did it fall apart so quickly? Well, a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>There could be inherent risk in all-stock transactions provided a rapidly-changing market.</li>
<li>It may be the case that Zoom simply did not bid enough for Five9.</li>
<li>And there&#8217;s a mix of anti-trust and national regulatory issues to the deal that never got fully hammered out.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, you can pick your poison, even though the answer appears to be some of each above point.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">China, the most populous nation in the world, passed its first significant data privacy legislation in August. Moving forward, any global business or aspiring startup doing any type of trade or offering services online likely will be affected because they’ll be engaging with Chinese residents covered by the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/what-chinas-new-data-privacy-law-means-for-us-tech-firms/">Personal Information Protection Law</a> (PIPL).</p>
<p>Although this seems like pretty significant news, the legislation itself is similar to the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which was introduced in 2016. What is shocking, however, is that companies had two years to prepare for GDPR, while PIPL goes into effect on November 1, 2021.</p>
<p>This leaves companies scrambling to figure out compliance. In addition, it highlights the importance and urgency of data privacy on a global scale. China marks the 17th country to establish a <a href="https://securityscorecard.com/blog/countries-with-gdpr-like-data-privacy-laws">GDPR-like privacy law.</a> Which global superpower is not on this list?</p>
<p>The United States has yet to adopt a broad-reaching, consumer-focused national data privacy law — despite <a href="https://www.datagrail.io/blog/data-privacy-day-survey/">multiple</a> <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/572607-majority-of-americans-support-national-data-privacy-standards-poll">studies</a> indicating that Americans want more control over their personal data online. This oversight has significant implications for the technology industry in particular.</p>
<p>With so much going on, it’s clear that we’ve reached a critical juncture in the maturation of data privacy. How we proceed will affect potentially billions of consumers worldwide as well as the development of companies ranging from the smallest startups to the biggest global enterprises. This moment demands careful consideration.</p>
<p>As such, let’s attempt to break down the present data privacy conundrum, starting first by examining how data privacy legislation is evolving in the U.S. and what this means on a broader scale, before diving into how data minimization attempts address these issues. After weighing these integral pieces of the data privacy puzzle, I will conclude by issuing a call for global data privacy standards that place people firmly in control of their data.</p>
<h2>Data privacy in the U.S.</h2>
<p>The data privacy landscape in the U.S. is complicated. In short, on the federal level, there has been movement but no overarching data privacy policy in place. There are industry-specific privacy regulations — The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/hipaa.html">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act</a> (HIPAA) governing healthcare and <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/gramm-leach-bliley-act">Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</a> (GLBA) covering consumer financial products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There is also the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule">Children’s Online Privacy Protection Rule</a> (COPPA), designed to protect children under 13. The FTC jumps into the mix as well because it can go after an app or website that violates its own privacy policy (the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/statutes/federal-trade-commission-act">Federal Trade Commission Act</a>).</p>
<p>But our federal government hasn’t passed a sweeping bill that protects consumers’ digital privacy rights, leaving it up to individual states to do it themselves (e.g., California’s <a href="https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a>, Virginia’s <a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+HB2307">VCDPA</a> and Colorado’s <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2021A/bills/2021a_190_rer.pdf">ColoPA</a>). This has left plenty of Americans without privacy rights and businesses confused about what they need to do.</p>
<p>Some folks argue that this is how it should be, warning that a gridlocked Congress could never pass meaningful consumer privacy legislation. Even if they do, it will be too watered down to matter, which would then negatively affect carefully constructed state laws.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is the potential of having 50 individual state data privacy laws &#8212; all similar, but likely each different in its own way, creating the nightmare scenario for businesses trying to do the right thing. Now magnify this globally.</p>
<h2>Data minimization is not the only answer</h2>
<p>One approach being bandied about to help address data privacy involves the principle of data minimization, which allows companies to collect and retain personal information only for a specific purpose.</p>
<p>Basically, it’s a call for companies to simply collect less data. Think marketing teams reducing their intake or establishing retention schedules to purge existing data.</p>
<p>This is great for some, but for others, it can be unrealistic. Even the most consumer-friendly companies are unlikely to encourage marketers to go out and collect less personal information about potential customers, and they could nearly always find a justification for grabbing data.</p>
<p>But, the practice, even in its purest state, could be detrimental to startups that rely on personal information and preferences to develop products and grow their businesses. Data minimization in this sense could have the unintended consequence of stifling innovation.</p>
<p>And frankly, it may not even be necessary if consumers have a say in how their data is acquired and used. In some cases, consumers are OK with sharing personal information because they prefer a more personalized, bespoke experience. For example, brands like <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/05/stitch-fixs-ceo-on-selling-personal-style-to-the-mass-market">Stitch Fix</a> or <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2019/09/20/sephora-wins-at-online-personalization/">Sephora</a> ask for a lot of personal preferences upfront to provide a better shopping experience &#8212; and for many, that’s OK.</p>
<h2>A call for global data privacy standards</h2>
<p>It is my view that all of these complexities, fine lines and moving parts are surfacing and posing problems for companies and consumers because there is no global standard to get people on the same page. Until one exists, everything else is just a Band-Aid.</p>
<p>The time has come for us to develop a set of basic principles on which countries can agree so that consumers worldwide are protected and businesses know what is required of them in any geography.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it won’t be long until we’re looking at a gaggle of international data privacy laws, some more stringent than others and all just a little bit different, making it next to impossible for companies to ensure 100% compliance. It’s time to rein things in.</p>
<p>Data privacy standards would establish a baseline of fairness that spans geographic borders and works for companies at any stage. This would make it exponentially easier for companies to engage in business internationally.</p>
<p>Expect the existing spheres of influence to drive this change. Because there are massive, negative and costly implications on the line for any company that even hopes to go global, entities will work together to create common solutions. The momentum is there. Considering the footprint of China alone, it won’t be long until other countries follow suit.</p>
<p>Despite the shortfalls on data privacy here at home, even U.S.-based trade organizations are pushing forward with the first steps toward global standards. Consumer Reports, for example, has put together <a href="https://thedigitalstandard.org/">a working group</a> to develop potential solutions. This could help fast-track global data privacy interests to protect both companies and consumers.</p>
<h2>The heart of data privacy standards</h2>
<p>Data privacy standards are now necessary, and the main thing to remember as they develop is that we must give people control over how companies handle their information.</p>
<p>Consumers deserve to know who has access to their information and why, particularly as services and applications become more connected to facilitate transactions. They should also have the right for personal data to be deleted upon request as well as to prevent companies from selling their information without permission. These are basic, universal rights; these are the things governing and supporting bodies should agree on.</p>
<p>Although marketers may grouse, it shouldn’t just be assumed that all consumers object to sharing their information. In fact, many appreciate the customization of experiences or ease of transactions that are made possible by allowing companies to collect and retain their personal information, as noted in the examples above.</p>
<p>Consumer choice ultimately creates a healthier ecosystem overall and opens up new ways for companies to build trust and transparency. It will also prevent companies from perpetually scrambling to develop and manage a slew of different mandates.</p>
<p>I foresee a future where startups are founded as privacy first. This is even likely to become a true differentiator. But the biggest element of change will be to give consumers unquestionable control of their data, no matter where they are, or the systems that contain their personal information. Data privacy standards will protect these rights in ways that other approaches can’t reasonably replicate or deploy at scale; they will eliminate confusion so that businesses can operate efficiently.</p>
<p>Once we are all on the same page through data privacy standardization, true progress can be made.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["Community" has grown into one of those buzzy Silicon Valley terms over the years, but long-time advocates explain that the concept is fundamental in entrepreneurship and venture capital investments.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;We believe that a thriving community is a company&#8217;s most valuable asset,&#8221; <a href="https://www.communityled.com/declaration">Community-led writes in its Declaration</a>. &#8220;Community scales your business, resources and presence in ways that traditional marketing or advertising channels can&#8217;t. When done right, community enables and improves customer acquisition, streamlines support and success, bolsters retention, and provides crucial product insights. Community is the beating heart of the business that keeps the rest of the team running.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a matter-of-fact document, aiming to emphasize the importance of community in building a forward-looking startup, while highlighting the concept’s elasticity. But it leaves a lingering question: What, precisely, do we mean when we use the word “community” in the world of startups?</p>
<p>You&#8217;d think that&#8217;d be a question answered easily by a panel titled, “How to Cultivate a Community for your Company that Actually Lasts” during TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 last week. But if I’ve learned anything from moderating said Disrupt panels, it’s that there’s no easy answer to the question, due in part to the aforementioned elasticity. So, is this just one of those “we know it when see it” things, to paraphrase a famous Supreme Court ruling?</p>
<p>&#8220;It depends on the person, the context and the company,&#8221; says Commsor&#8217;s chief community officer, Alex Angel. &#8220;But ultimately, to me, community, at its most basic, is a group of people who&#8217;ve come together with a shared purpose. That shared purpose could be your product, it could be a company, it could be a topic, it could be whatever, but they&#8217;re all there intentionally around that thing to gather and talk and learn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Community&#8221; has grown into one of those buzzy Silicon Valley terms over the past few years, but long-time advocates explain that the concept is fundamental in entrepreneurship and venture capital investments.</p>
<p>“Last October, when we launched Community Fund, people were asking investors and founders in the industry, ‘What is this community thing?&#8217; It’s very fluffy,” says Lolita Taub, corporate Development VP at Catalyte, and co-founder and general partner at The Community Fund. “All of a sudden, we started seeing companies like Reddit, Peloton and Glossier become unicorns. You’re seeing the real generational wealth that exists in community-driven companies.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;As a nerdy kid I loved tech and was fascinated by how business works,&#8221; says Cam Sinclair, founder of Australian growth marketing firm Ammo. &#8220;I always knew I wanted to find some way to help founders and innovators get their great ideas out into the world. After working in political campaigns, I realized that many of the skill sets overlapped with what startups need: moving fast, being lean, communicating well, being adaptable and staying flexible.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the latest installment of our ongoing interview series with top growth experts, Sinclair tells Anna Heim that his experience in politics &#8220;inspired me to grow an &#8216;anti-agency&#8217; where startup founders could genuinely feel like they had someone on their team who understood their challenges and the risks they were taking.&#8221;</p>
<p>The TechCrunch team has been hard at work the past two weeks. We had a wildly successful Disrupt conference, with all sorts of growth-related discussions that we&#8217;ve included links to below. We also renamed Extra Crunch, our subscription service for startups, to TechCrunch+ and expanded its availability to dozens of new countries (read more about that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/introducing-techcrunch-plus/">here</a>).</p>
<p>First up, though, here&#8217;s not one but two interviews that Anna did with top growth marketers. If you have a growth marketing expert that you think we should know about, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03">let us know</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/growth-marketing-is-not-a-magic-trick-says-ellen-jantsch-of-tuff/">Growth marketing is not a magic trick, says Ellen Jantsch of Tuff:</a> Anna had the chance to speak with Tuff founder Ellen Jantsch, who shares how they hire for their team, some pros and cons of hiring a marketing agency versus an in-house marketer and more. &#8220;We work with more than just e-commerce businesses; we flex into SaaS, fintech and B2B industries and it’s forced us to truly develop a model/process for growth and not just a playbook, meaning our channel and tactic mix is always different,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/australian-growth-marketing-agency-ammo-helps-startups-calibrate-their-efforts/">Australian growth marketing agency Ammo helps startups calibrate their efforts:</a> Anna spoke with Ammo about their collaboration process with startups, how they know when a startup is ready to work with them and how they help startups develop a minimum viable brand. Sinclair, Ammo’s director, says, &#8220;In the past we have described our role as making ourselves obsolete — that our clients would grow large enough to be able to hire their own in-house marketing team. Today we still retain many of these client relationships in different ways by providing more strategic advice.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/how-ryan-reynolds-has-mastered-authentic-marketing/">(TechCrunch+) How Ryan Reynolds has mastered authentic marketing:</a> During Disrupt, Jordan Crook spoke with Ryan Reynolds about his marketing agency, Maximum Effort. Jordan says, “At TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 this week, we sat down with Reynolds to discuss how startups can use &#8216;fast-vertising&#8217; (a term Reynolds coined), which involves treating real-time cultural moments as a springboard, to build their own brand buzz.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

She says, &#8220;The changes are a part of Google’s broader revamp of its ads business in the face of increased regulatory scrutiny and a broader shift across the tech industry to technologies that promote transparency and consumer privacy.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/29/the-death-of-identity-knowing-your-customer-in-the-age-of-data-privacy/">(TechCrunch+) The death of identity: Knowing your customer in the age of data privacy:</a> Ted Schlein, a general partner at Kleiner Perkins, writes about the importance of knowing your customer and how privacy demands are changing what customer data businesses should focus on. Schlein says, &#8220;While these developments threaten to upend how digital marketing is performed today, they signal a necessary, and effective, shift in the ways brands will understand their customers in the future.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It was almost exactly two years ago that a special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC) spearheaded by investor Chamath Palihapitiya took public the space tourism company Virgin Galactic.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was almost exactly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/24/virgin-galactic-set-to-trade-on-the-nyse-on-monday-as-the-first-space-tourism-stock.html">two years ago</a> that a special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC) spearheaded by investor Chamath Palihapitiya took public the space tourism company Virgin Galactic. It was the first human spaceflight company to trade on the NYSE &#8212; or any exchange, for that matter &#8212; and it was so successful, with the company&#8217;s shares trading higher and higher for so many months afterward, that it almost immediately kicked off the SPAC frenzy.</p>
<p>Consider that in the first three months of this year alone, SPACs raised $87.9 billion, exceeding the total issuance in all of 2020, according to data from SPAC Research. So far, according to SPAC Insider, 450 blank check companies have been successfully formed, compared with 15 just 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Palihapitiya has been among the biggest beneficiaries of the craze. Called the &#8220;<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/06/07/the-pied-piper-of-spacs">Pied Piper of SPACs</a>&#8221; by The New Yorker and the &#8220;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-12/the-king-of-spacs-wants-you-to-know-he-s-the-next-warren-buffett">King of SPACs</a>&#8221; by Bloomberg, he has formed at least 10 blank check companies and publicly shared plans to raise many more. (On the “All-In Podcast” that he co-hosts, Palihapitiya last year revealed he had reserved the symbols from “IPOA” to “IPOZ” on the NYSE.)</p>
<p>Of course, whenever market activity grows too feverish, retail investors <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spac-selloff-bruises-individual-investors-11621396808">get bruised</a>. Indeed, after a number of companies taken public via blank check companies were discovered to have fudged some of their numbers &#8212; in June, for example, Lordstown Motors admitted it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/lordstown-motors-reverses-claims-about-binding-orders-for-electric-pickup-truck/">did not</a> have binding orders from customers for its electric Endurance pickup truck after all &#8212; fears have grown that SPACs don&#8217;t feature enough disclosures and that they mostly benefit the people organizing them, like Palihapitiya, who joined us last week to talk about that concern and others.</p>
