										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=disruptagendapost">Disrupt 2021</a> stands to be the best Disrupt yet. We have an incredible lineup of speakers both on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=disruptagendapost">Disrupt Stage and the Extra Crunch Stage</a>. And, of course, we can&#8217;t forget the Startup Battlefield, which has been a launch pad for some of the biggest tech companies in the world today, including Dropbox, Mint, and Cloudflare.</p>
<p>Today, we&#8217;re excited to give you a closer look at the Disrupt Stage, where the biggest names in tech talk about their companies, their plans, and what&#8217;s next for the greater tech ecosystem.</p>
<p>And this is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg when it comes to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=disruptagendapost&amp;display=true">three jam-packed days</a> we&#8217;re planning for you at Disrupt. Along with these heavy hitters on the Disrupt Stage, you can get your founder how-to knowledge at sessions on the Extra Crunch Stage, breakout sessions and intimate roundtable discussions. You&#8217;ll be able to find and engage with people from all around the world through world-class networking on CrunchMatch and our virtual platform &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=disruptagendapost&amp;display=true">all for under $100 for a limited time</a> with even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=disruptagendapost&amp;display=true">deeper discounts for non-profit/government agencies, students and up-and-coming founders</a>!</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So without any further ado, check out the current agenda for the Disrupt Stage:</p>
<h3>HEALTH/BIOTECH</h3>
<p><strong>Saving the World with Ugur Sahin (BioNTech) and Ursheet Parikh (Mayfield Fund)</strong></p>
<p>COVID-19 changed everything. It not only threatened our individual health and well being, but shook industries and economies across the globe. But the same could be said about the COVID-19 vaccines. Hear from BioNTech cofounder and CEO Ugur Sahin on the process of rapidly developing the world&#8217;s most sought after vaccine, alongside Pfizer, and the long-term potential of mRNA-based therapies. Sahin will be joined by Ursheet Parikh of Mayfield Fund to discuss what&#8217;s next for startups in this rapidly evolving industry.</p>
<p><strong>Democratizing Healthcare with Toyin Ajay (Cityblock Health), Adrian Aoun (Forward), and Eren Bali (Carbon Health) </strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that the current healthcare system in America is broken. Technology stands to make a huge difference, especially in the backdrop of eased regulations due to COVID-19. Hear how startup founders from Forward, Carbon Health and Cityblock Health decided to tackle the behemoth, backward industry of healthcare, as well as talk through their plans to democratize access and digitize the industry.</p>
<p><strong>Pot, Pottery and Beyond with Seth Rogan (Houseplant), Haneen Davies (Houseplant), and Michael Mohr (Houseplant)</strong></p>
<p>Somehow we live in world where alcohol is sold in grocery stores and weed is considered a gateway drug. But that is rapidly changing. The legalized cannabis industry is estimated to be worth more than $13 billion in 2021, and major players from big food, pharma, etc. all want a slice of the pie. Hear from actor and comedian Seth Rogan on his well-known passion for pot, and how it led him to start Houseplant. Rogan will also be joined by Houseplant chief commercial officer Haneen Davies and cofounder and CEO Michael Mohr.</p>

<h3>IMPACT</h3>
<p><strong>From ABC&#8217;s to IPO with Luis Von Ahn (Duolingo)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Language learning company Duolingo was founded in 2011 and has raised more than $167 million in private capital, and recently filed to go public. Despite avoiding monetization for years, the startup saw revenue growth of 120+ percent in 2020, with no signs of slowing. CEO and cofounder Luis Von Ahn will join us on the Disrupt stage to talk about gamifying education, prepping for a public offering, and how he and the team built the anti-Rosetta Stone with an owl as a mascot.</span></p>

<h3>FINTECH</h3>
<p><strong><b data-stringify-type="bold">Collecting Crypto Opportunities with</b> Roham Gharegozlou (Dapper Labs)</strong></p>
<p>Dapper Labs launched the digital collectible craze into the mainstream earlier this year with its smash hit NBA Top Shot, but even amid sinking NFT sales, CEO Roham Gharagozlou has big ambitions for the space. His startup most recently hit a $7.5 billion valuation and has aims to own the NFT ecosystem with their Flow blockchain product.</p>
<p><strong>Breaking the Bank with Brian Armstrong (Coinbase)</strong></p>
<p>Coinbase’s massive direct listing earlier this year couldn’t have come at a better time as peaking crypto enthusiasm reached market exuberance, but now amid a major market correction, CEO Brian Armstrong is once again tasked with building for the future and navigating volatility while fending off global competitors knocking at their door.</p>

<h3>ENTERPRISE/SAAS &amp; SECURITY</h3>
<p><strong>Staying a Step Ahead with Rinki Sethi (Twitter)</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, in the midst of an already-frantic year, Twitter was breached in a very public way. Behind the scenes, Twitter spends a tremendous amount of time, money, and energy on user protection and platform integrity. A big part of that is through information security. CISO Rinki Sethi will join us at Disrupt to talk through how Twitter tries to stay ahead of malicious actors, and how tech companies large and small can do the same.</span></p>
<p><strong>From Bootstrapped to Billions with Tope Awotona (Calendly)</strong></p>
<p>Dozens have tried to reinvent the calendar, and dozens have failed. Tope Awotona built Calendly not as a way to reinvent the wheel, but to add a layer of simplicity to the chaos of human communication and time management. And boy did it work! The once-bootstrapped company is now worth more than $3 billion, serving individuals and enterprises alike. Hear from the founder and CEO on how he got Calendly off the ground, why he decided to finally take institutional investment, and how the company has changed as it grows.</p>

<p><strong>An Unstoppable Force and an Immovable Object with Stewart Butterfield (Slack) and Bret Taylor (Salesforce)</strong></p>
<p>Slack and Salesforce are two of the biggest names in all of tech. The communication tool (born from one of the odder pivots in tech history) is commonplace across organizations from almost every industry. It&#8217;s an unstoppable force. The sales CRM behemoth is used all over the world by sales teams small and large. An immovable object. In December of 2020, the pair announced a $27.7 billion merger. Hear from Slack founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield and Salesforce President and COO Bret Taylor about the future of the combined entity, why the deal made sense, and what it&#8217;s like to write down that many 0&#8217;s.</p>
<p><b>Dogmatic Design with Melanie Perkins (Canva)</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rapid evolution of the design industry can&#8217;t be understated. From better collaboration among designers and other departments, to collaboration among designers themselves, to the democratization of design across an organization, the landscape is changing. Canva has led the charge in this evolution, building one of the simplest (and yet full-featured) tools on the market. Hear cofounder and CEO Melanie Perkins talk about scaling the business to now be worth upwards of $15 billion, and expanding the business from B2C to B2B, all while continuing to iterate the product.</span></p>

<h3>HARDWARE</h3>
<p><strong>Reflecting on Success with Brynn Putnam (MIRROR)</strong></p>
<p>Mirror cofounder and CEO Brynn Putnam first hit the Disrupt Stage years ago to launch her idea for a better, more beautiful, fitness product. This year, she&#8217;s returning to our stage to talk through the ups and downs of building a hardware product, how she manages the variety of moving pieces of this business (from the instructor network, to the content and subscription business, to sales and marketing, etc.) and walk us through the company&#8217;s $500 million acquisition by Lululemon.</p>
<p><strong>A Fictional Future Built with Real AI with Kai-Fu Lee (Sinovation Ventures) and Chen Quifan (World Chinese Science Fiction Association)</strong></p>
<p>A leading mind in AI research and investment and a bold new voice in science fiction collaborate in &#8220;AI 2041,&#8221; a remarkable new collection of stories imagining a future shaped by technology being built today. Hear Sinovation Ventures Chairman and CEO Kai-Fu Lee and author Chen Quifan (AKA Stanley Chan) discuss the tech that inspired their book and the changes they expect over the next two decades.</p>
<p><strong>Drones, Self-driving Cars, and Everything in Between with Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg (U.S. Department of Transportation)</strong></p>
<p>Pete Buttigieg first came on the scene as a small town Mayor in Indiana. He launched onto the national stage as a presidential candidate for the Democratic party in 2020. He now serves as Secretary of Transportation under the Biden administration, and oversees everything from public transport to autonomous vehicle regulation.

General Partner Katie Haun co-leads the crypto team tasked with tracking down the firm’s next Coinbase, which returned billions for the firm.</p>
<p><strong>Checking In with Chris Sacca (Lowercarbon Capital)</strong></p>
<p>Chris Sacca has been a judge on &#8220;Shark Tank&#8221; and appeared on the show &#8220;Billions.&#8221; But he&#8217;s best known for sharing his opinions on Twitter, a company in which he invested early and often, and for placing a wide range of other hugely successful bets, including Uber, Instagram and Twilio. Now, at his newest firm, Lowercarbon Capital, Sacca is focusing his attention and dollars on finding and funding solutions to climate crisis, and we&#8217;re excited to talk with him about where he&#8217;s seeing the most opportunity bubbling up in this fireside chat.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new challenger has emerged in the gaming hardware category. Game distribution giant <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/hardware">Valve today announced the launch of Steam Deck</a>, a $399 gaming portable designed to take PC games on the go.</p>
<p>The handheld (which has echoes of several portable gaming rigs of years past) features a seven-inch screen and runs on a quad-core Zen 2 CPU, coupled with AMD RDNA 2 graphics and 16GB of RAM. Storage runs 64GB to 512GB, the latter of which bumps the price up to $649. The built-in storage can be augmented via microSD.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178258" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178258" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2178258" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hero-banner-sequence-english.2021-07-15-13_49_51.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178258" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Valve</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Naturally, the thing is custom built for Valve’s wildly popular Steam platform (it’s right there in the name, after all). Users log into their Steam account and their library &#8212; and friends list &#8212; are right there, ready to go. There’s even a dedicated Steam button.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The system has been rumored for some time now, but it enters the world during a rapidly evolving era for gaming. Essentially the company is hoping to outperform the admitted graphical limitations of Nintendo’s Switch (OLED or no), while filling in the gap as cloud-based gaming from companies like Microsoft are still working on a foothold as they deal with latency and other technical limitations. There’s also the Nvidia Shield Portable &#8212; though we’ve not heard much from that project, of late.</p>

<p>Flanking the 1280 x 800 touchscreen are a pair of trackpads and thumb sticks. A built-in gyroscope also uses movement to control the gaming experience. There’s a single USB-C port for charging, peripherals and connecting to a big screen, while a 40Wh battery promises between 7-8 hours of gameplay, by Valve’s numbers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DeepMind stunned the biology world late last year when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/alphabets-deepmind-achieves-historic-new-milestone-in-ai-based-protein-structure-prediction/">its AlphaFold2 AI model</a> predicted the structure of proteins (a common and very difficult problem) so accurately that many declared the decades-old problem &#8220;solved.&#8221; Now researchers claim to have leapfrogged DeepMind the way DeepMind leapfrogged the rest of the world, with RoseTTAFold, a system that does nearly the same thing at a fraction of the computational cost. (Oh, and it&#8217;s free to use.)</p>
<p>AlphaFold2 has been the talk of the industry since November, when it blew away the competition at CASP14, a virtual competition between algorithms built to predict the physical structure of a protein given the sequence of amino acids that makes it up. The model from DeepMind was so far ahead of the others, so highly and reliably accurate, that many in the field have talked (half-seriously and in good humor) about moving on to a new field.</p>
<p>But one aspect that seemed to satisfy no one was DeepMind&#8217;s plans for the system. It was not exhaustively and openly described, and some worried that the company (which is owned by Alphabet/Google) was planning on more or less keeping the secret sauce to themselves — which would be their prerogative but also somewhat against the ethos of mutual aid in the scientific world.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: DeepMind published more detailed methods <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2">in the journal Nature today</a>. The code is available <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/alphafold">on GitHub</a>. This does considerably lessen the aforementioned concern, but the advance described below is still highly relevant.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Alphabet&#8217;s DeepMind achieves historic new milestone in AI-based protein structure prediction&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/alphabets-deepmind-achieves-historic-new-milestone-in-ai-based-protein-structure-prediction/embed/#?secret=hfpbOm04m6" data-secret="hfpbOm04m6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That concern seems to have been at least partly mooted by work from University of Washington researchers led by David Baker and Minkyung Baek, published in the latest issue of the journal Science. Baker, you may remember, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/3m-breakthrough-prize-goes-to-scientist-designing-molecules-to-could-fight-covid-19/">won a Breakthrough Prize</a> for his team&#8217;s work combating COVID-19 with engineered proteins.</p>
<p>The team&#8217;s new model, RoseTTAFold, makes predictions at similar accuracy levels using methods that Baker, responding to questions via email, candidly admitted were inspired by those used by AlphaFold2.</p>
<p>&#8220;The AlphaFold2 group presented several new high level concepts at the CASP14 meeting. Starting from these ideas, and with a lot of collective brainstorming with colleagues in the group, Minkyung has been able to make amazing progress in very little time,&#8221; he said. (&#8220;She is amazing!&#8221; he added.)</p>

A score above 90 is considered extremely good.</p></div></p>
<p>Baker&#8217;s group more or less placed second at CASP14, no mean feat, but hearing DeepMind&#8217;s methods described even generally set them on a collision course. They developed a &#8220;three-track&#8221; neural network that simultaneously considered the amino acid sequence (one dimension), distances between residues (two dimensions), and coordinates in space (three dimensions). The implementation is beyond complex and far outside the scope of this article, but the result is a model that achieves almost the same accuracy levels — levels, it bears repeating, that were completely unprecedented less than a year ago.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, RoseTTAFold accomplishes this level of accuracy far more quickly — that is, using less computation power. As the paper puts it:</p>
<blockquote><p>DeepMind reported using several GPUs for days to make individual predictions, whereas our predictions are made in a single pass through the network in the same manner that would be used for a server&#8230;the end-to-end version of RoseTTAFold requires ~10 min on an RTX2080 GPU to generate backbone coordinates for proteins with less than 400 residues.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hear that? It&#8217;s the sound of thousands of microbiologists sighing in relief and discarding drafts of emails asking for supercomputer time. It may not be easy to lay one&#8217;s hands on a 2080 these days, but the point is any high-end desktop GPU can perform this task in minutes, instead of requiring a high-end cluster running for days.</p>
<p>The modest requirements make RoseTTAFold suitable for public hosting and distribution as well, something that might never have been in the cards for AlphaFold2.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a public server that anyone can submit protein sequences to and have the structures predicted,&#8221; Baker said. &#8220;There have been over 4500 submissions since we put the server up a few weeks ago. We have also made the source code freely available.&#8221;</p>
<p>This may seem very niche, and it is, but protein folding has historically been one of the toughest problems in biology and one towards which countless hours of high-performance computing have been dedicated. You may recall Folding@Home, the popular distributed computing app that let people donate their computing cycles to attempting to predict protein structures. The kind of problem that might have taken a thousand computers days or weeks to do — essentially by brute-forcing solutions and checking for fit — now can be done in minutes on a single desktop.</p>
<p>The physical structure of proteins is of utmost importance in biology, as it is proteins that do the vast majority of tasks in our bodies, and proteins that must be modified, suppressed, enhanced, and so on for therapeutic reasons; first, however, they need to be understood, and until November that understanding could not be reliably achieved computationally. At CASP14 it was proven to be possible, and now it has been made widely available.</p>
<p>It is not, by a long shot, a &#8220;solution&#8221; to the problem of protein folding, though the sentiment has been expressed. Most proteins at rest in neutral conditions can now have their structure predicted, and that has huge repercussions in multiple domains, but proteins are seldom found &#8220;at rest in neutral conditions.&#8221; They twist and contort to grab or release other molecules, to block or slip through gates and other proteins, and generally to do everything they do. These interactions are far more numerous, complex, and difficult to predict, and neither AlphaFold2 nor RoseTTAFold can do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many exciting chapters ahead&#8230; the story is just beginning,&#8221; said Baker.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re curious about the science and the potential repercussions, <a href="https://moalquraishi.wordpress.com/2020/12/08/alphafold2-casp14-it-feels-like-ones-child-has-left-home/">consider reading this much more detailed and technical account</a> of the methods and possible next steps written in the wake of AlphaFold2&#8217;s CASP14 performance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In our review last year, we called the Freewrite Traveler “outstanding, but expensive.” The latest version of Astrohaus’ distraction-free word processing hardware tool does little to address the latter concern. In fact, the Ernest Hemingway Freewrite Signature Edition comes in at a full $300 more than its predecessor.</p>
<p>But the latest edition of the hardware strives to be something more than just a utilitarian writing tool. In fact, Astrohaus secured the blessing from the Ernest Hemingway estate for the new version of a product that began life as the “Hemingwrite” for its 2014 Kickstarter campaign.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2178117" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Hemingwrite-2.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The product strives to live up to some of the ethos and/or aesthetics of &#8220;The Sun Also Rises&#8221; author. “Even though we changed the name to Freewrite in 2015, the original Hemingwrite concept is what captured the world’s attention,” co-founder and CEO Adam Leeb said in a release tied to the news. This time out, however, the company secured the family’s blessing.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9nvt0TaY5u"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/the-freewrite-traveler-is-an-outstanding-but-expensive-dedicated-portable-writing-laptop/">The Freewrite Traveler is an outstanding, but expensive, dedicated portable writing laptop</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Freewrite Traveler is an outstanding, but expensive, dedicated portable writing laptop&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/the-freewrite-traveler-is-an-outstanding-but-expensive-dedicated-portable-writing-laptop/embed/#?secret=9nvt0TaY5u" data-secret="9nvt0TaY5u" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The new version trades portability for aesthetic, with the inclusion of an attaché case that brings to mind both writers&#8217; tools of yore and, more recently, retro turntables from companies like Crosley. There were, of course, travel typewriters that came with their own carrying case, but the Freewrite’s significantly slimmer profile makes the setup far more compact.</p>

<p>Here’s Astrohaus’ write-up of the hardware [best read in a Ron Burgundy voice]:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Hemingwrite features an exclusive design with green keycaps and a hand-polished aluminum chassis that is uncoated and will develop a unique patina over time. Each unit is finished by hand &#8211; no two are exactly alike. Every Hemingwrite comes with a Hemingway monogramed cleaning cloth and an exclusive attaché case to safely store the device and elegantly transport it anywhere inspiration is found. The hard-sided Hemingwrite Attaché Case is crafted from rich cognac leather and a cream-colored velvet lining. A deep pocket is located inside to store books, pens, notebooks, or other pieces of writing inspiration.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you’re looking for something to reduce the distractions that come from writing on a laptop, while ramping up the aesthetic homage to days of yore, the Ernest Hemingway Freewrite Signature Edition is available now for $899.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Express is branching out into financial planning, with a little help from a seven-person startup called BodesWell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, the credit card giant launched a pilot of its first self-service digital financial planning tool, dubbed “My Financial Plan (MFP).” The six-month pilot kicked off on July 11 with about 25,000 select Amex cardmembers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">American Express quietly invested in BodesWell in late 2020 via its venture arm, Amex Ventures. Since then, the financial services behemoth teamed up with the tiny startup to develop the financial planning tool for its users. The new product is designed to give users a complete picture of their financial health and help them make and achieve major life goals, such as buying a house or retirement.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch talked with Amex Ventures’ Julia Huang, who led the investment and strategy around the new product, and BodesWell co-founder and CEO Matthew Bellows to learn more details.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair actually met while serving on a panel together in 2019. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I was drawn to the fact that it was not a round-up savings tool, but rather a holistic tool to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">understand your full financial picture that could be used to plan for the financial impact of your life decisions,” Huang told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before deciding to invest in BodesWell, Huang says Amex Ventures &#8212; which over time has backed more than 70 startups &#8212; had “evaluated the space quite extensively.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huang introduced Bellows and his staff to Amex’s Digital Labs team and they embarked on jointly developing a specialized offering for Amex customers. (While Bellow is based in Boston, he says the startup is “globally distributed.”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to democratize financial planning with our cardmembers by providing detailed insights and forecasts to help them with their holistic planning,” she told TechCrunch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So much of financial planning software is aimed at financial advisors, and requires them to run it,” he said. “So, most people can’t get the benefits of financial planning&#8230;Our hope is to expand benefits to a lot more people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BodesWell will guide users in setting up a financial plan and will work even better if they sync with their other financial information via Plaid so it can “update in real time,” Huang said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tool “takes into account income, assets, expenses and liabilities &#8212; what cash flow looks like holistically so that users can drag &amp; drop to plan life events,” Bellow said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An estimated 85 million American households don’t have a financial, planner for a variety of reasons &#8212; including mistrust of a planner’s intentions or just feeling overwhelmed by the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The product is free during the pilot phase and American Express hasn’t yet determined if it will charge for it afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re gauging first for engagement and the power of the product for our customers,” Huang told TechCrunch. “We want to make sure the product resonates and that we iterate on the product to make sure it’s good for the broader population. Our primary goal is that our customers use it and find it valuable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amex Ventures has formed “some level of partnership” with more than two-thirds of its portfolio companies, she added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We try to engage with our portfolio in that way, to provide value with our startup ecosystem,” Huang said.</span></p>
<p>For its part, BodesWell had previously raised about $1.5 million from investors such as Cleo Capital, Ex Ventures, Riot.vc, GritCapital and Argon Capital and angels like HubSpot CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianhalligan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianhalligan/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626448853144000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFXPvXUtd-poQKbMwKiX1jEXA4Axg">Brian Halligan</a> and Kintent CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sravishsridhar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/sravishsridhar/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626448853144000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHB6o2j7LIb1gY7mzuLvwAC2oiTDg">Sravish Sridhar.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The General Services Administration has denied a senator&#8217;s request to review documents Zoom submitted to have its software approved for use in the federal government.</p>
<p>The denial was in response <a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/wyden-zoom-gsa.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to a letter</a> sent by Democratic senator Ron Wyden to the GSA in May, expressing concern that the agency cleared Zoom for use by federal agencies just weeks before a major security vulnerability was discovered in the app.</p>
<p>Wyden said the discovery of the bug raises &#8220;serious questions about the quality of FedRAMP’s audits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zoom was approved to operate in government in April 2019 after receiving its FedRAMP authorization, a program operated by the GSA that ensures cloud services comply with a standardized set of security requirements designed to toughen the service from some of the most common threats. Without this authorization, federal agencies cannot use cloud products or technologies that are not cleared.</p>
<p>Months later, Zoom was forced to patch its Mac app after a security researcher found <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/08/a-vulnerability-in-zooms-mac-client-could-allow-websites-to-turn-on-cameras-without-permission/">a flaw</a> that could be abused to remotely switch on a user&#8217;s webcam without their permission. Apple was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/10/apple-silent-update-zoom-app/">forced to intervene</a> since users were still affected by the vulnerabilities even after uninstalling Zoom. As the pandemic spread and lockdowns were enforced, Zoom&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/zooms-paid-usage-skyrockets-as-remote-work-takes-over/">popularity skyrocketed</a> — as did the scrutiny — including a technical analysis by reporters that found Zoom <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/03/31/zoom-meeting-encryption/">was not truly end-to-end encrypted</a> as the company long claimed.</p>
<p>Wyden wrote to the GSA to say he found it &#8220;extremely concerning&#8221; that the security bugs were discovered after Zoom’s clearance. In the letter, the senator requested the documents known as the &#8220;security package,&#8221; which Zoom submitted as part of the FedRAMP authorization process, to understand how and why the app was cleared by GSA.</p>
<p>The GSA declined Wyden&#8217;s first request in July 2020 on the grounds that he was not a committee chair. In the new Biden administration, Wyden was named chair of the Senate Finance Committee and requested Zoom&#8217;s security package again.</p>
<p>But in a new letter sent to Wyden&#8217;s office late last month, GSA declined the request for the second time, citing security concerns.</p>
<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
<blockquote><p>&#8220;GSA&#8217;s refusal to share the Zoom audit with Congress calls into question the security of the other software products that GSA has approved for federal use.&#8221; <cite>Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR)</cite></p></blockquote>
</div>
<p>&#8220;The security package you have requested contains highly sensitive proprietary and other confidential information relating to the security associated with the Zoom for Government product. Safeguarding this information is critical to maintaining the integrity of the offering and any government data it hosts,&#8221; said the GSA letter. &#8220;Based on our review, GSA believes that disclosure of the Zoom security package would create significant security risks.&#8221;</p>
<p>In response to the GSA&#8217;s letter, Wyden told TechCrunch that he was concerned that other flawed software may have been approved for use across the government.</p>
<p>“The intent of GSA&#8217;s FedRAMP program is good — to eliminate red tape so that multiple federal agencies don’t have to review the security of the same software. But it’s vitally important that whichever agency conducts the review do so thoroughly,&#8221; said Wyden. &#8220;I’m concerned that the government’s audit of Zoom missed serious cybersecurity flaws that were subsequently uncovered and exposed by security researchers. GSA’s refusal to share the Zoom audit with Congress calls into question the security of the other software products that GSA has approved for federal use.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of the people we spoke with who have first-hand knowledge of the FedRAMP process, either as a government employee or as a company going through the certification, FedRAMP was described as a comprehensive but by no means an exhaustive list of checks that companies have to meet in order to meet the security requirements of the federal government.</p>
<p>Others said that the process had its limits and would benefit from reform. One person with knowledge of how FedRAMP works said the process was not a complete audit of a product&#8217;s source code but akin to a checklist of best practices and meeting compliance requirements. Much of it relies on trusting the vendor, said the person, describing it like &#8221; an honor system.&#8221; Another person said the FedRAMP process cannot catch every bug, as evidenced by executive action taken by President Biden this week aimed at <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">modernizing and improving the FedRAMP process</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the people we spoke to weren&#8217;t surprised that Wyden&#8217;s office was denied the request, citing the sensitivity of a company&#8217;s FedRAMP security package.</p>
<p>The people said that companies going through the certification process have to provide highly technical details about the security of their product, which if exposed would almost certainly be damaging to the company. Knowing where security weaknesses might be could tip off cyber-criminals, one of the people said. Companies often spend millions on improving their security ahead of a FedRAMP audit but companies wouldn&#8217;t risk going through the certification if they thought their trade secrets would get leaked, they added.</p>
<p>When asked by GSA why it objected to Wyden&#8217;s request, Zoom&#8217;s head of U.S. government relations Lauren Belive argued that handing over the security package &#8220;would set a dangerous precedent that would undermine the special trust and confidence&#8221; that companies place in the FedRAMP process.</p>
<p>GSA puts strict controls on who can access a FedRAMP security package. You need a federal government or military email address, which the senator&#8217;s office has. But the reason for GSA denying Wyden&#8217;s request still isn&#8217;t clear, and when reached a GSA spokesperson would not explain how a member of Congress would obtain a company&#8217;s FedRAMP security package</p>
<p>&#8220;GSA values its relationship with Congress and will continue to work with Senator Wyden and our committees of jurisdiction to provide appropriate information regarding our programs and operations,&#8221; said GSA spokesperson Christina Wilkes, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;GSA works closely with private sector partners to provide a standardized approach to security authorizations for cloud services through the [FedRAMP]. Zoom’s FedRAMP security package and related documents provide detailed information regarding the security measures associated with the Zoom for Government product. GSA’s consistent practice with regard to sensitive security and trade secret information is to withhold the material absent an official written request of a congressional committee with jurisdiction, and pursuant to controls on further dissemination or publication of the information.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>GSA wouldn&#8217;t say which congressional committee had jurisdiction or whether Wyden&#8217;s role as chair of the Senate Finance Committee suffices, nor would the agency answer questions about the efficacy of the FedRAMP process raised by Wyden.</p>
<p>Zoom spokesperson Kelsey Knight said that cloud companies like Zoom &#8220;provide proprietary and confidential information to GSA as part of the FedRAMP authorization process with the understanding that it will be used only for their use in making authorization decisions. While we do not believe Zoom’s FedRAMP security package should be disclosed outside of this narrow purpose, we welcome conversations with lawmakers and other stakeholders about the security of Zoom for Government.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zoom said it has &#8220;engaged in security enhancements to continually improve its products,&#8221; and received FedRAMP reauthorization in 2020 and 2021 as part of its annual renewal. The company declined to say to what extent the Zoom app was audited as part of the FedRAMP process.</p>
<p>Over two dozen federal agencies use Zoom, including the Defense Department, Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the Executive Office of the President.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More details are beginning to emerge on Houston-based Axiom Space’s ambitious project to build and operate the world’s first commercial space station.</p>
<p>Thales Alenia Space, a European aerospace manufacturer, will develop the two pressurized modules of the Axiom Space Station. The two elements, which are scheduled to launch in 2024 and 2025, will dock to the International Space Station before eventually detaching and operating as a fully independent, commercial station.</p>
<p>The two companies announced the signing of the final contract, valued at €110 million ($130 million), on Thursday. Each module will be able to accommodate four people. Thales will also be designing the micrometeoroid and debris protection system for each module.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The modules are still in their design phase, Thales Alenia said. The company recently completed development of the first module’s four radial bulkheads at its facility in Turin, Italy. The bulkheads, once connected, will form a cylinder. That structure will attach to the common berth mechanisms, parts of the module that will connect to the ISS and hatches.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2178177" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2178177" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2178177" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC_1264.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC_1264.jpeg 5056w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC_1264.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC_1264.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC_1264.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC_1264.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC_1264.jpeg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC_1264.jpeg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/DSC_1264.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2178177" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://thalesgroup.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thales Alenia Space <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The two modules have a long road ahead of them. Thales Alenia, a joint venture between French company Thales Group and Italian conglomerate Leonardo, will begin welding on the first module this September through to next year. That module will be sent to Axiom’s Texas facilities in July 2023, where Axiom will then integrate the core systems and prepare it for launch in 2024.</p>
<p>NASA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/nasa-taps-startup-axiom-space-for-the-first-habitable-commercial-module-for-the-space-station/">tapped Axiom</a> to build the first commercial living quarters for the ISS in January 2020. Once the ISS is decommissioned, Axiom’s station will detach and function as a commercial center for future missions and scientific experiments. It’s a major part of NASA’s plans to encourage the growth of the burgeoning low Earth orbit economy and the buildout of other private orbital labs and commercial facilities.</p>
<p>Axiom will also operate the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/axiom-space-and-nasa-detail-first-fully-private-human-launch-to-the-space-station-set-for-january-2022/">first fully private</a> mission to the ISS, scheduled for January 2022. Axiom Mission 1 will send four private astronauts to space onboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon, for an eight-day mission.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM and its new EV business unit BrightDrop are launching a fleet charging service as the automaker aims to ramp up its bet on connected and electric commercial vehicles.</p>
<p>The service, branded Ultium Charge 360 fleet charging service in a nod to GM&#8217;s new electric architecture and batteries that will be the foundation of its future EV plans, offers many of the tools that a commercial delivery, sales or motor pool business might need. It also includes an effort to add home charging for drivers.</p>
<p>The charging service is the latest addition to BrightDrop, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/gm-targets-delivery-companies-with-new-ev-business-unit-brightdrop/">launched in January</a>. The business unit offers commercial customers — starting with FedEx — an ecosystem of electric and connected products. BrightDrop has said it will begin with two main products: an electric van called the EV600 with an estimated range of 250 miles and a pod-like electric pallet dubbed EP1. BrightDrop is part of GM&#8217;s aim to reach 1 million EV sales globally by 2025.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>GM and BrightDrop are launching the charging service with Duke Energy company eTransEnergy, EVgo, In-Charge Energy and Schneider Electric, four companies that can provide the infrastructure needed to keep the commercial vans properly powered.</p>
<p>On the home-charging front, GM said it will expand an existing agreement with Qmerit.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It's not super stupid to value Revolut far more richly with massively improved gross margins, profitability and more proven revenue growth.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">News broke this morning that Revolut, a U.K.-based consumer fintech player, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/revolut-confirms-a-fresh-800m-in-funding-at-a-33b-valuation-to-supercharge-its-financial-services-superapp/">raised a Series E round of funding worth $800 million</a> at a valuation of $33 billion. Those figures are breathtaking not only due to their sheer scale, but also thanks to their radical divergence from Revolut&#8217;s preceding funding event.</p>
<p><em>At times, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">The Exchange</a>, TechCrunch&#8217;s markets-and-startups column, runs into two topics worth exploring in a single day. Today is such a day. You can check out our earlier notes on the buy now, pay later startup market and Apple&#8217;s entrance into the BNPL space here. Now, let&#8217;s talk about</em> <em>neobanks</em>.</p>
<p>As TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/ingridlunden">Ingrid Lunden</a> wrote earlier today concerning the news:</p>
<blockquote><p>This latest Series E is being co-led by Softbank Vision Fund 2 and Tiger Global, who appear to be the only backers in this round. It comes on the heels of <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/klarna-effect-propels-digital-bank-revolut-to-30bn-valuation-in-softbank-talks-12347766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors earlier this month</a> Revolut was raising big. Revolut last raised about a year ago, when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/revolut-extends-series-d-round-to-580-million-with-80-million-in-new-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed out a Series D at $580 million</a>, but what is stunning is how much its valuation has changed since then, growing 6x (it was $5.5 billion last year).</p></blockquote>
<p>Stunning indeed.</p>
<p>Lunden also went on to report on the company&#8217;s changing financial picture based on Revolut&#8217;s recently released 2020 results. In this entry, we&#8217;re digging more deeply into those financial results and usage metrics detailed by the fintech megacorn.</p>

<p>The picture that emerges is one of a company with a rapidly improving financial image, albeit with some blank spaces regarding recent customer growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Shortly after the first  <a href="https://sighttechglobal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sighttechglobal.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626363395439000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGnejcRsz6jYLrLkHznqKjW4-FB2Q">Sight Tech Global</a> event, in December last year, Apple and Microsoft announced remarkable new features for mobile phones. Anyone could point the phone camera at a scene and request a “scene description.” In a flash, a cloud-based, computer vision AI determined what was in the scene and a machine-voice read the information. Learning that “a room contains three chairs and a table” might not seem like a big advance for the sighted, but for blind or visually impaired people, the new feature was a notable milestone for accessibility technology: An affordable, portable and nearly universal device could now “see” on behalf of just about anyone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Technologies like scene description will be on the agenda at the second annual Sight Tech Global event, December 1-2, 2021. The free, sponsor-supported, virtual and global event will convene many of the world’s top technologists, researchers, advocates and founders to discuss how rapid advances in technology, many centered on AI, are altering &#8212; both improving and complicating &#8212; accessibility for people with sight loss.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfberR7NW3F74cBNleiOVauGQ8wrSV0FcZqf1HH5X60mUrS6Q/viewform">Register</a> today &#8212; it’s free.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">At the heart of Sight Tech Global is the hard question: How do highly advanced, AI-based technologies actually become compelling, affordable products that folks who are blind or visually impaired readily adopt? It took 40 years, for example, for the $50,000 “Kurzweil reading machine,” a boxy desktop device, to evolve into what blind people take for granted today, a free app available on any mobile phone that can “read” just about any text. As anyone working in the field will tell you, shaping technologies into truly useful, everyday, affordable tools for people with vision loss is no less demanding than it was 40 years ago.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The overlapping in job roles is uncanny: The best investors and founders have to find focus through the noise, understand the weight of due diligence and pitch others with conviction.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At the TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising event last week, <a href="https://www.nvp.com/">Norwest Venture Partners</a>&#8216; <a href="https://www.nvp.com/team/lisa-wu/">Lisa Wu</a> took the stage to discuss how founders can think like venture capitalists in all facets of their business. The overlapping in job roles is uncanny: The best investors and founders have to find focus through the noise, understand the weight of due diligence and pitch others with conviction. Wu, who has investments in Plaid, Calm and Ritual, used anecdotes and exercises &#8212; such as the eyebrow test &#8212; in the tactical, engaging chat.</p>
<h2>Pitch deck or pitch blurb?</h2>
<p>Startup founders often turn to pitch decks when fundraising as a visual representation of their story &#8212; from the origins to total addressable market to those juicy metrics. While the format definitely works, the influx of pitch decks in a hot deal environment makes it harder to stand out.</p>
<p>Wu gave some pointers on how she reacts to cold pitch decks, and why founders may want to take some unconventional advice.</p>
<blockquote><p>I love it because I can quickly flip through the deck and generally form an opinion on it. And I think I&#8217;ve read some stat recently, which is that investors really spend 2 minutes and 47 seconds per deck. It&#8217;s an easy way for me to, in that short amount of time, just get a calibration of the business to decide whether to move forward.</p>
<p>But, as the founder, I&#8217;ll probably tell you don&#8217;t do [the cold pitch deck]. Because if you&#8217;re sending me the pitch deck, I&#8217;m quickly screening and then I&#8217;m making a decision of whether it makes sense to meet, but your goal is really just to try to get the meeting with me to tell the story and let that unfold. And so, give us enough of it &#8212; like a blurb to tease us to want to continue to engage is great. But if it is possible, I would suggest a late pullback of the pitch deck, even though I love to receive it in advance.<em><strong> (Timestamp: 21:50)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, she loves founders sliding into the DMs with pitch decks, but doesn&#8217;t think that strategy always gives the founder storytelling power.</p>
<p>This answer triggered a series of questions from attendees on whether pitch decks are even necessary in the first place. Here, Wu explains how the competitive venture market has impacted her preferences &#8212; and her interest in what I&#8217;d describe it as a private beta, except for fundraising rounds.</p>
<blockquote><p>So, everything is shifting these days. Because there&#8217;s so much capital [and competition] out there, sometimes if I&#8217;m chasing a really hot company, I actually prefer that they don&#8217;t have a deck, or they haven&#8217;t created one yet. Because once you have a deck, that means you can go and take it out to a bunch of other investors, too. And so it&#8217;s helpful to structure the conversation and to storytell around it. I think I like a deck more so than not, unless it&#8217;s in a competitive situation. If I&#8217;m trying to close the deal, I actually prefer just an open dialogue.<em><strong> (Timestamp: 23:30)</strong></em></p>
<p>We just have them come in and we just prepare our team internally to let them know that there&#8217;s no deck here. And so, it&#8217;s just up to the founders to really just tell the story to us. And, it&#8217;s worked.<em><strong> (Timestamp: 24:20)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need for more affordable housing has never been more urgent as a shortage in the U.S. housing market persists.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startups attempting to help address the shortage in a variety of ways abound. One such startup, </span><a href="http://www.abodu.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abodu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has raised $20 million in a Series A funding round led by Norwest Venture Partners. Previous backer Initialized Capital also participated in the financing, along with Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman, former Stockton, California Mayor Michael Tubbs, GGV investor Hans Tung and Paradox Capital’s Kyle Tibbitts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The California legislature changed laws in 2017 to make it easier to build Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs). Then on January 1, 2020, the state of California made it dramatically easier to add extra housing units to single-family home sites. Cities and local agencies have to quickly approve or deny ADU projects within 60 days of receiving a permit application. The state also now prevents cities from imposing minimum lot size requirements, maximum ADU dimensions or off-street parking requirements. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redwood City, California-based Abodu, which builds prefabricated ADUs, was founded in 2018 to serve as a “one-stop shop” for building an ADU, or as some describe it, a home in a backyard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What sets the company apart from others in the space, its execs claim, is that it not only builds and installs the units, it helps homeowners with the painful process of getting permits. <span class="il">Abodu</span> says it pre-approves its structural engineering with California state-level agencies to ensure its units can be built statewide and works with local agencies to pre-approve its foundation systems to ensure projects can proceed on predictable timelines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also claims to offer a cheaper and faster process than if one were to build an ADU from start to finish. Specifically, the startup claims that one of its backyard homes can be installed in just 10% of the time it would take for a traditional ADU to be built. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abodu has been active in the market, selling and building its ADUs since the fall of 2019. Since then, it has put “dozens and dozens” of units in the ground, and has multiple dozen units in production on top of that, according to CEO and co-founder </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">John Geary. So far, it’s operating in the Bay Area, Los Angeles and Seattle. The company claims it can deliver an ADU in as little as 30 days in San Jose and Los Angeles thanks to the cities’ pre-approval process. In other cities in California and Washington, turnaround is “as little as 12 weeks.” But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a standard bespoke project takes 4-5 months from start to finish, according to Geary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup’s three products include a 340-square foot studio; a 500-square foot one bedroom, one bath, and a 610-square foot two bedroom unit. All have kitchens and living space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pricing starts at $190,000, but the average project cost across all sizes is around $230,000, Geary said, inclusive of permits and site work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a variety of use cases for ADUs, the most popular of which is to house family and for rental income. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During the pandemic, multigenerational living has been at an all-time high. There are acute family needs that people are trying to solve for,” Geary said. “In addition, folks are earning extra money by renting them out to members of the community such as teachers or fireman, a single person or younger couple.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next, Abodu is eyeing the San Diego market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this week, we covered the recent raise of Mighty Buildings, another Bay Area-based startup building ADUs and other housing. The biggest difference between the two companies, according to Geary, is that Mighty Buildings is focused on innovation in construction with its 3D-printed method. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We decided early on that we didn&#8217;t want to reinvent the wheel from the construction standpoint,” Geary said. “Instead, we looked at ‘how can we solve for speed and ease?’ ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abodu operates with an asset-light model, and doesn’t own any factories. Instead, it has built a network of factory “partners” across the Western U.S. that builds its units depending on how their capacities look at any given time.</span></p>
<p>Naturally, the company&#8217;s investors are bullish on the company&#8217;s business model.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Crowe, managing partner of Norwest Venture Partners, believes that Abodu’s &#8220;beautifully crafted units&#8221; are just one of the company&#8217;s selling points. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;John, Eric, and their team manage the end-to-end process of permitting, building, and installing on behalf of their customers,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;And with the expedited permitting that Abodu has been granted in over two dozen cities, it has faster time-to-installation than other ADU market participants.  The result has been very high levels of customer satisfaction and rapid growth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Former Stockton Mayor Tubbs said Abodu is tacklin<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">g two of California’s most consequential issues: the statewide housing shortage and its impacts on racial and economic segregation in our neighborhoods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;By making it fast and accessible for normal homeowners to build high-quality backyard housing units, Abodu’s success will mean integrating options for both renters and homeowners in the same neighborhoods, while supporting small landlords and property owners in building equity in their homes,&#8221; he wrote via email.</span></p>
<div dir="auto">
<div dir="auto">
<div dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Tubbs went on to describe the speed that Abodu can deliver housing units to customers in certain parts of California &#8220;astounding.&#8221; </span></div>
<div dir="auto"></div>
<div dir="auto"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Abodu’s team has done some of the most difficult legwork for property owners by building local contractor relationships with reliable, vetted, high-quality partners,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As a homeowner myself, I know the challenges of permitting and finding contractors during construction. It’s this thoughtful attention to detail and customer trust that sets Abodu apart from other similar offerings.&#8221;</span></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alt-Bionics made waves back in late 2019 when the brand new startup competed at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) Tech Symposium. The company finished second to 3BM’s infrared paint-curing system, but Alt went on to capture national and international headlines on the strength of promising technology and a great story.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.utsa.edu/today/2019/11/story/tech-symposium-winner.html">A writeup on the school’s site</a> noted that, at $700, its prosthetic hand cost a mere fraction of the cost of standard systems. Most of the subsequent coverage has focused on the story of the team’s journey from good idea to marketable product, with CEO/co-founder (and USTA engineering grad) Ryan Saavedra noting that these sorts of products can range from $10,000-$150,000 a pop. The company is working to a price point around $3,500.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Alt-Bionics team has been chronicling product development on social media. Before we get this roundup stared in earnest, we wanted to check in with Saavedra about how the past three years have gone and what the future holds for the company. And bonus: We’ve got a couple of unreleased renderings that Alt notes are “not indicative of our final product. Just merely a celebratory rendering our team put together to announce the completion of our patent” &#8212; so take that as you will.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><strong>TechCrunch: Why are prosthetics prohibitively expensive?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll start by saying that they aren&#8217;t expensive to manufacture and they do not need to be so expensive to the user. At all. There is no one answer for this, but I will do my best to summarize the multiple reasons behind the exorbitant prices surrounding bionic hands. We have found that there are two parts to the end price/cost of <span class="il">prosthetic</span> devices. A third (but secondary reason) will also be discussed.</p>
<p>The manufacturer. The manufacturer develops and creates these bionic devices and then sells them to <span class="il">prosthetic</span> and orthotic clinics (one of the few places you can be fitted for and purchase these devices). The most affordable bionic <span class="il">prosthetic</span> <u>hand</u> sold to P&amp;O clinics starts at about $10,000 and can go up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Oddly enough, this cost doesn&#8217;t always reflect the functionality or performance of the devices. These manufacturers ultimately determine the prices of their devices. The larger among them cite overhead costs as the primary reason they cannot lower their price tags.</p>
<p>The <span class="il">prosthetic</span> &amp; orthotic clinic. We are still learning more about the specifics, but these clinics handle the medical insurance side of things. This means that they submit LCodes (insurance codes for bionic hands, suggested by the manufacturer) to the medical insurance company for reimbursement. These LCodes have floor and ceiling reimbursement amounts that the prosthetist can select. The reimbursement amount is commonly more than what they paid for the hand, and covers the time and effort the clinic and clinician put into procurement, fitting, testing, assembly and patient care. While normally a reasonable margin is obtained (through reimbursement amounts closer to the floor), we have seen reimbursement amounts exceed $124,000 for a $10,000 hand (from a 2018 patient receipt).</p>
<p>Technological stagnation. The technology for bionic hands has been stagnant for almost 15 years, with companies only just now emerging as competitors in this space. Larger companies in this space are tackling more than the one area of transradial (below elbow) bionic <span class="il">prosthetic</span> devices. This means that their attention is not solely focused on the development and affordability aspects of upper extremity <span class="il">prostheses</span>. The stagnation has meant that there are no external factors or forces being pressed on the existing devices and their manufacturers. Essentially, they have no reason to lower the prices, so they remain the same. This is more of an affirmation that reason No. 1 is a larger problem.</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: How has the reception been from the broader medical community?</strong></p>
<p>Wonderful! Clinics, clinicians, patients, potential users and other competing companies have all been incredibly supportive of our mission. The space and companies, while competitive, are all aiming for the same thing: using technological advancements to give people a better quality of life.</p>
<p>There is obviously some skepticism at first at how we are able to achieve our much lower price point ($3,500), but it is quickly assuaged when we talk with them about our technologies and processes. We are currently discussing partnerships with <span class="il">prosthetic</span> and orthotic clinics to help develop devices that not only help patients, but also lessen the burden of prosthetists in the repair and maintenance of these devices.</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: How far along is the project? What’s the current timeline for bringing it to market?</strong></p>
<p>The project is just emerging from its infancy and is about 42% complete. Some notable achievements are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Successful proof of concept with Army Ranger, Ryan Davis. December, 2019.</li>
<li>Alt-Bionics was formed. May 2020.</li>
<li>$42,000 SolidWorks grant from D&#8217;Assault Systems. July, 2020.</li>
<li>Provisional patent filed. June, 2021.</li>
<li>$50,000 investment from the city of San Antonio&#8217;s SAMMI Fund. July 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current timeline to bring our device to market is one year from the closing of our seed round of financing. We have, to date, raised $142,000 of our $200,000 goal and are looking to close out this round by September.</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: What have the biggest challenges been so far?</strong></p>
<p>Navigating the FDA regulatory space and raising capital. It is no secret that the FDA regulatory process is a fearsome beast. There are even companies dedicated to assisting those looking to bring medical devices to market, navigate the process and all its intricacies. Alt-Bionics was recently accepted into a biomedical accelerator program based out of San Antonio, Texas, and will be working with regulatory experts to ensure we have a smooth rest of the ride to market. While our mission is noble and our business plan sound, COVID has brought about many worries and fears from investors. The inability to pitch to a live audience has hindered us from being able to appear in front of investors and has made raising capital a little more difficult than it normally is for a company like ours.</p>
<p><b><strong>TechCrunch: </strong>What is your funding status? How much have you raised thus far and are you looking to raise more?</b></p>
<p>To date, Alt-Bionics has raised a total of $142,000 from a handful of investors and has received a $50,000 investment from the city of San Antonio&#8217;s SAMMI fund. We are looking for an additional $58,000 from accredited investors to help fill out our seed round. From there our timeline of one year to market begins (though we have a hefty head start) and Alt-Bionics will push into its Series A, which will allow us to bring on additional engineers, develop the technology further and expand into international markets.</p>
<p><b> <strong>TechCrunch: </strong>Are developing markets going to be a key target? </b></p>
<p>Developing countries will be a key market for Alt-Bionics, particularly through NGOs, and will play an important part in our international expansion. We see a large opportunity to provide our medical devices to these markets. Affordability is critical to our mission to provide access to these devices and therefore we believe we will be successful with this expansion.</p>

<p>I’ll cop to the fact that when Berkshire<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/07/12/2261170/0/en/Berkshire-Grey-Accelerates-With-New-Orders-And-Increased-Backlog.html"> Grey announced a “$23+” million deal</a> for grocery picking robots, I had one name in mind: Walmart. After talking a bit about Walmart’s mixed robotics play in this panel a couple of weeks back, I’d heard rumblings the company was getting set for a big new play in the category.</p>

<p>Granted, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/walmart-will-be-bringing-symbotic-robots-to-25-distribution-centers/">the Symbotic deal</a> doesn’t necessarily mean BG isn’t teaming with Walmart on this one, but it’s worth noting that the mega-retailer loves talking about its big spending on automation. From the outside, looking in, at least, it seems like these deals are often as much about the PR of looking like it’s ready to compete with Amazon as they are about actually competing with Amazon (win-win, I guess).</p>

<p>The deal will bring Symbotic’s tech to 25 additional Walmart distribution centers (the two have been running pilots since 2017) in a rollout that will take “several years,” per Walmart. I’ve speculated before (and will happily continue to do so) that one or several of these robotic fulfillment companies are a no-brainer acquisition for Walmart, though Symbotic is probably a bit tougher, given existing ties with competitors like Target.</p>

<p>A pair of cool research projects this week. Devin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/stumble-proof-robot-adapts-to-challenging-terrain-in-real-time/">wrote about a team from Facebook AI, UC Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon University</a> that is exploring Rapid Motor Adaptation, a method that allows quadrupedal robots to adapt to uneven terrain on the fly. This quote from one of the Berkley researchers gets to the heart of the matter: “We do not learn about sand, we learn about feet sinking.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Database technology can change the world, but the world in these parts changes very, very slowly. That’s made building a startup in the sector a tough equation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every application is a palimpsest of technologies, each layer forming a base that enables the next layer to function. Web front ends rely on JavaScript and browser DOM, which rely on back-end APIs, which themselves rely on databases.</p>
<p>As one goes deeper down the stack, engineering decisions become ever more conservative — changing the location of a button in a web app is an inconvenience; changing a database engine can radically upend an entire project.</p>
<p>It’s little surprise then that database technologies are among the longest-lasting engineering projects in the modern software developer toolkit. MySQL, which remains one of the most popular database engines in the world, was first released in the mid-1990s, and Oracle Database, launched more than four decades ago, is still widely used in high-performance corporate environments.</p>
<p>Database technology can change the world, but the world in these parts changes very, very slowly. That’s made building a startup in the sector a tough equation: Sales cycles can be painfully slow, even when new features can dramatically expand a developer’s capabilities. Competition is stiff and comes from some of the largest and most entrenched tech companies in the world. Exits have also been few and far between.</p>
<p>That challenge — and opportunity — is what makes studying Cockroach Labs so interesting. The company behind <b>CockroachDB</b> attempts to solve a long-standing problem in large-scale, distributed database architecture: How to make it so that data created in one place on the planet is <i>always</i> available for consumption by applications that are thousands of miles away, <i>immediately</i> and <i>accurately</i>. Making global data always available immediately and accurately might sound like a simple use case, but in reality it’s quite the herculean task. Cockroach Labs’ story is one of an uphill struggle, but one that saw it turn into a next-generation, $2-billion-valued database contender.</p>
<p>The lead writer of this EC-1 is <b>Bob Reselman</b>. Reselman has been writing about the enterprise software market for more than two decades, with a particular emphasis on teaching and educating engineers on technology. The lead editor for this package was <b>Danny Crichton</b>, the assistant editor was <b>Ram Iyer</b>, the copy editor was <b>Richard Dal Porto</b>, figures were designed by <strong>Bob Reselman</strong> and stylized by <strong>Bryce Durbin</strong>, and illustrations were drawn by <b>Nigel Sussman</b>.</p>
<p><i>CockroachDB had no say in the content of this analysis and did not get advance access to it. Reselman has no financial ties to CockroachDB or other conflicts of interest to disclose.</i></p>
<p>The CockroachDB EC-1 comprises four main articles numbering 9,100 words and a reading time of 37 minutes. Here’s what we’ll be crawling over:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Part 1: Origin story</b> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-origin/">CockroachDB, the database that just won’t die</a>&#8221; (2,100 words/8 minutes) — Looks at the origins of CockroachDB, from the creation of the popular open-source image editor GIMP to some of Google&#8217;s most well-known infrastructure products.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Part 2: Technical design </strong>&#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-technology/">How engineers fought the CAP theorem in the global war on latency</a>&#8221; (2,400 words/10 minutes) — Analyzes the key differentiation that CockroachDB offers the relational database market, particularly its focus on geography and data storage.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Part 3: Developer relations and business</strong> &#8220;&#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-developers/">Developers, as you know, do not like to pay for things</a>&#8216;&#8221; (2,200 words/9 minutes) — Explores how CockroachDB engages with developers while also pivoting to the cloud at a key inflection point in its business.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Part 4: Competitive landscape and future</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-future/">Scaling CockroachDB in the red ocean of relational databases</a>&#8221; (2,400 words/10 minutes) — Evaluates the future of the startup within the extremely competitive landscape of relational databases and what possible exit routes might look like.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There is an art to engineering, and sometimes engineering can transform art. For Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis, those two worlds collided when they created the widely successful open-source graphics program, GIMP, as college students at Berkeley.</p>
<p>That project was so successful that when the two joined Google in 2002, Sergey Brin and Larry Page personally stopped by to tell the new hires how much they liked it and explained how they used the program to create the first Google logo.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Cockroach Labs was started by developers and stays true to its roots to this day.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In terms of good fortune in the corporate hierarchy, when you get this type of recognition in a company such as Google, there’s only one way you can go — up. They went from rising stars to stars at Google, becoming the go-to guys on the Infrastructure Team. They could easily have looked forward to a lifetime of lucrative employment.</p>
<p>But Kimball, Mattis and another Google employee, Ben Darnell, wanted more — a company of their own. To realize their ambitions, they created Cockroach Labs, the business entity behind their ambitious open-source database CockroachDB. Can some of the smartest former engineers in Google’s arsenal upend the world of databases in a market spotted with the gravesites of storage dreams past? That’s what we are here to find out.</p>
<h2>Berkeley software distribution</h2>
<p>Mattis and Kimball were roommates at Berkeley majoring in computer science in the early-to-mid-1990s. In addition to their usual studies, they also became involved with the <a href="https://xcf.berkeley.edu/">eXperimental Computing Facility</a> (XCF), an organization of undergraduates who have a keen, almost obsessive interest in CS.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">CockroachDB was intended to be a global database from the beginning. The founders of Cockroach Labs wanted to ensure that data written in one location would be viewable immediately in another location 10,000 miles away. The use case was simple, but the work needed to make it happen was herculean.</p>
<p>The company is betting the farm that it can solve one of the largest challenges for web-scale applications. The approach it’s taking is clever, but it’s a bit complicated, particularly for the non-technical reader. Given its history and engineering talent, the company is in the process of pulling it off and making a big impact on the database market, making it a technology well worth understanding. In short, there’s value in digging into the details.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Using CockroachDB’s multiregion feature to segment data according to geographic proximity fulfills Cockroach Labs’ primary directive: To get data as close to the user as possible.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-origin/">In part 1 of this EC-1</a>, I provided a general overview and a look at the origins of Cockroach Labs. In this installment, I’m going to cover the technical details of the technology with an eye to the non-technical reader. I’m going to describe the CockroachDB technology through three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What makes reading and writing data over a global geography so hard?</li>
<li>How does CockroachDB address the problem?</li>
<li>What does it all mean for those using CockroachDB?</li>
</ol>
<h2>What makes reading and writing data over a global geography so hard?</h2>
<p>Spencer Kimball, CEO and co-founder of Cockroach Labs, describes the situation this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s lots of other stuff you need to consider when building global applications, particularly around data management. Take, for example, the question and answer website Quora. Let’s say you live in Australia. You have an account and you store the particulars of your Quora user identity on a database partition in Australia.</p>
<p>But when you post a question, you actually don&#8217;t want that data to just be posted in Australia. You want that data to be posted everywhere so that all the answers to all the questions are the same for everybody, anywhere. You don’t want to have a situation where you answer a question in Sydney and then you can see it in Hong Kong, but you can&#8217;t see it in the EU. When that’s the case, you end up getting different answers depending where you are. That&#8217;s a huge problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reading and writing data over a global geography is challenging for pretty much the same reason that it’s faster to get a pizza delivered from across the street than from across the city. The essential constraints of time and space apply. Whether it’s digital data or a pepperoni pizza, the further away you are from the source, the longer stuff takes to get to you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The company behind ubiquitous livestreaming software <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/streamlabs/">Streamlabs</a> is introducing a new way for streamers to share their gaming highlights to platforms well beyond Twitch. Streamlabs calls the new tool <a href="https://crossclip.com/">Crossclip</a>, and it&#8217;s available now as an <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crossclip-clip-post-grow/id1568560633">iOS app</a> and as a lightweight web tool.</p>
<p>With Crossclip, creators can easily convert Twitch clips into a format friendly to TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts and Facebook videos. Adapting a snippet from Twitch that you&#8217;d like to share is as simple as putting in the clip&#8217;s URL and choosing an output format (landscape, vertical or square) and a pre-loaded layout.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2178092" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png?w=680" alt="Crossclip iOS app" width="680" height="347" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png 2080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png?resize=300,153 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png?resize=768,391 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png?resize=680,347 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png?resize=1536,783 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png?resize=2048,1044 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You can crop the clip&#8217;s length within Crossclip, blur part of the background and choose from a handful of layouts that let you place the frames in different places (to show the facecam view and the stream view together in vertical orientation, for example).</p>
<p>Crossclip&#8217;s core functionality is free, but a premium subscription version ($4.99/month or $49.99/year) removes a branded watermark and unlocks exports in 1080/60fps, larger uploads, added layers and pushes your edits to the front of the processing queue.</p>

<p>Discovery on Twitch is tough. Established streamers grow their audiences easily but anybody just getting started usually has to slog through long stretches of lonely Stardew Valley sessions with only the occasional viewer popping in to say hi. The idea behind Crossclip is to make it easier for streamers to build audiences on other social networks that have better discoverability features, subcommunities and tags to make that process less grueling.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a creator, making your content more discoverable is a huge advantage,&#8221; Streamlabs Head of Product Ashray Urs told TechCrunch. &#8220;When you consider the most popular Twitch streamers, you will notice that they have extremely popular YouTube channels and actively post on Twitter, Instagram, TikTok. If you aren&#8217;t sharing content and building your audience with different platforms, you&#8217;re making things more difficult for yourself.&#8221;<b></b></p>
<p>Urs notes that creators are increasingly using TikTok&#8217;s algorithmic discovery abilities to grow their audiences. TikTok&#8217;s recent addition of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiktok-expands-max-video-length-to-3-minutes-up-from-60-seconds/"> longer, three-minute videos</a> is a boon for many kinds of creators interested in leveraging the platform, including gamers and other Twitch streamers.</p>
<p>Anyone with an established audience will find Crossclip a breeze to use too, making it dead-simple to share gaming highlights or Just Chatting clips wherever they&#8217;re trying to build up a following. The average clip conversation takes two to three minutes and is a simple one-click process. There are a few tools out there that have similar functionality, independent web tool <a href="https://streamladder.com/">StreamLadder</a> probably being the most notable, but Streamlabs takes the same idea, refines it and adds a mobile app.</p>
<p>Streamlabs, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/27/logitech-acquires-popular-game-streaming-tool-streamlabs-for-around-89m/">now owned by Logitech</a>, has released a few useful products in recent months. In February, the company launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/streamlabs-launches-a-link-in-bio-website-builder-that-includes-tipping/">Willow</a>, its own link-in-bio tool with built-in tipping. In May, Streamlabs <a href="https://streamlabs.com/content-hub/post/streamlabs-announces-integration-with-tiktok">deepened its relationship with TikTok</a> — an emerging hub for all kinds of gaming content — adding the ability to &#8220;go live&#8221; on TikTok into its core livestreaming platform, Streamlabs OBS.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cockroach Labs has many things going for it. The company’s approach to distributed database technology is novel, and it has the potential to gain significant market share internationally.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-technology/">In the previous part of this EC-1</a>, we looked at the technical details of CockroachDB and how it provides accurate data instantaneously anywhere on the planet. In this installment, we’re going to take a look at the product side of Cockroach, with a particular focus on developer relations.</p>
<p>As a business, Cockroach Labs has many things going for it. The company’s approach to distributed database technology is novel. And, as more companies operate on a global level, CockroachDB has the potential to gain some significant market share internationally. The company is seven years into a typical 10-year maturity model for databases, has raised $355 million, and holds a $2 billion market value. It’s considered a <a href="https://www.builtinnyc.com/2021/01/12/cockroach-labs-raises-160m-series-e-hiring">double unicorn.</a> Few database companies can say this.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The company is now aggressively expanding into the database-as-a-service space, offering its own technology in a fully managed package, expanding the spectrum of clients who can take immediate advantage of its products.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But its growth depends upon securing the love of developers while also making its product easier to use for new customers. To that end, I’m going to analyze the company’s pivot to the cloud as well as its extensive outreach to developers as it works to set itself up for long-term, sustainable success.</p>
<h2>Cockroach Labs looks to the cloud</h2>
<p>These days, just about any company of consequence provides services via the internet, and a growing number of these services are powered by products and services from native cloud providers. Gartner forecasted in 2019 that cloud services are growing at an annual rate of 17.5%, and there’s no sign that the growth has abated at all.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-origin/">Its founders’ history with Google back in the mid-2000s</a> has meant that Cockroach Labs has always been aware of the impact of cloud services on the commercial web. Unsurprisingly, CockroachDB could run cloud native right from its first release, given that its architecture presupposes the cloud in its operation — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-technology/">as we saw in part 2 of this EC-1</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[CockroachDB’s success is not guaranteed. It has to overcome significant hurdles to secure a profitable place among well-established database technologies owned by companies with very deep pockets.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most database startups avoid building relational databases, since that market is dominated by a few goliaths. Oracle, MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server have embedded themselves into the technical fabric of large- and medium-size companies going back decades. These established companies have a lot of market share and a lot of money to quash the competition.</p>
<p>So rather than trying to compete in the relational database market, over the past decade, many database startups focused on alternative architectures such as document-centric databases (like MongoDB), key-value stores (like Redis) and graph databases (like Neo4J). But Cockroach Labs went against conventional wisdom with CockroachDB: It intentionally competed in the relational database market with its relational database product.</p>
<p>While it did face an uphill battle to penetrate the market, Cockroach Labs saw a surprising benefit: It didn’t have to invent a market. All it needed to do was grab a share of a market that also happened to be growing rapidly.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Cockroach Labs has a bright future, compelling technology, a lot of money in the bank and has an experienced, technically astute executive team.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In previous parts of this EC-1, I looked at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-origin/">the origins of CockroachDB</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-technology/">presented an in-depth technical description of its product</a> as well as an analysis of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-developers/">the company’s developer relations and cloud service</a>, CockroachCloud. In this final installment, we’ll look at the future of the company, the competitive landscape within the relational database market, its ability to retain talent as it looks toward a potential IPO or acquisition, and the risks it faces.</p>
<p>CockroachDB’s success is not guaranteed. It has to overcome significant hurdles to secure a profitable place for itself among a set of well-established database technologies that are owned by companies with very deep pockets.</p>
<p>It’s not impossible, though. We’ll first look at MongoDB as an example of how a company can break through the barriers for database startups competing with incumbents.</p>
<h2>When life gives you Mongos, make MongoDB</h2>

<p>MongoDB is a good example of the risks that come with trying to invent a new database market. The company started out as a purely document-centric database at a time when that approach was the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>Web developers like document-centric databases because they address a number of common use cases in their work. For example, a document-centric database works well for storing comments to a blog post or a customer’s entire order history and profile.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The more specialized the BNPL startup, the less likely that Apple's foray into the BNPL space may prove combative; the more general the BNPL player, the more likely that Apple could snag its business.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bloomberg broke news earlier this week that Apple, the consumer hardware giant with a rising services focus, is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-13/apple-goldman-plan-buy-now-pay-later-service-to-rival-paypal">building a buy now, pay later (BNPL) service</a> that will integrate with its Apple Pay system. The news sent shares of Affirm down just over 10% by the end of the day, and it shed 2.5% of its value yesterday. It&#8217;s off a little more than 61% from the highs it set after debuting earlier this year.</p>
<p>In light of information that Apple could cut into Affirm&#8217;s business, investors decided the former consumer fintech unicorn and present-day public BNPL company was worth less. Why? Because rising competition from a player like Apple may limit its growth over time, impacting later profitability. Or more simply, public-market investors decided that the present value of its future cash flows had declined.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not fair to focus on Affirm, of course. Afterpay is also a public BNPL firm; its shares also fell this week, slipping a similar 10% since its close on July 12, the day before the Apple news broke.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Those are just two names. There are a host of rival BNPL concerns in the world, from small startups to private-market giants like Klarna. Affirm and Afterpay, however, as focused companies in the space that also float, make for a useful window into how investors&#8217; views on the sector are changing in light of the recent Apple announcement.</p>
<p>Our question is what impact the Apple news item may have on <em>startups, </em>given that Apple Pay itself already accounts for about 5% of global card transactions (<a href="https://qz.com/1799912/apple-pay-on-pace-to-account-for-10-percent-of-global-card-transactions/">according to one analysis at least</a>). The answer, I think, is that it will vary a lot based on the focus of the BNPL startup in question. The more specialized the BNPL provider, the less likely that Apple&#8217;s eventual foray into the BNPL space may prove combative; the more general the BNPL player, the more likely that Apple could cut into its business.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995212 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Why? Distribution and customer expertise.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t to say that Affirm, Afterpay and other BNPL players are set to follow the dodo; far from it. But if Apple wades into the BNPL market as anticipated, its Apple Pay service could provide a strong distribution network that may ease consumer onboarding. That Apple has also launched a credit card tied to its Apple Pay efforts and offers a lightweight cash-management solution in the United States could also lower the threshold for uptake of the product because consumers are already becoming comfortable with Apple as a banking player of sorts.</p>
<p>Apple also controls massive digital marketplaces, albeit places where BNPL services may prove less pertinent. But it controls brick-and-mortar stores for its own goods around the world, and a global e-commerce operation via its own websites that could provide extra distribution for BNPL services from the company. Simply: Apple sells a lot of pricey products that would be good candidates for BNPL purchases.</p>
<p>All of that will hit some startups. Let&#8217;s talk about which are going to dodge the incoming competitive bullet.</p>
