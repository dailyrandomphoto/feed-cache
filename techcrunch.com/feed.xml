					<description><![CDATA[In the past year, the company grew its number of Tier 1 enterprise customers by 10 times.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://elementaryml.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elementary</a>, an artificial intelligence machine vision company, closed on $30 million in Series B funding to continue developing its manufacturing quality and inspection tools.</p>
<p>We last profiled the Pasadena-based company last June when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/elementary-robotics-is-making-its-quality-assurance-robots-commercially-available/">raised $12.7 million</a> in a financing round led by Threshold Ventures. Elementary’s tools enable customers to create no-code inspection routines and train models to inspect produced goods, parts and assemblies that were previously impossible to inspect manually, in a repeatable and scalable way.</p>
<p>With the latest funding, Threshold is back and participating with other existing investors, including Fika Ventures, Fathom Capital, Riot VC and Toyota Ventures, in a round led by Tiger Global. In total, the company has raised $47.5 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248275" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Elementary’s rapidly deployable hardware and industrial machine vision software are powering modern factories,” said Mo Islam, Elementary board director and partner at Threshold Ventures, said via email. “I’m thrilled to welcome Tiger Global as a new partner for the company as they scale deployments with numerous customers in manufacturing, consumer packaged goods and logistics.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2248283" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2248283" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2248283" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image002.gif" alt="Elementary, manufacturing" width="480" height="270" /><p id="caption-attachment-2248283" class="wp-caption-text">Elementary&#8217;s automated inspection tools. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Elementary</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Arye Barnehama, founder and CEO of Elementary, explained via email that customer demand and market timing were the drivers for the company to go after new funding. Over 250 millions inspections have been performed to date, he said.</p>
<p>In the past year, the company grew its number of Tier 1 enterprise customers by 10 times. At the same time, Elementary’s team doubled its headcount and rounded out its executive suite with the hiring of Milind Karnik as vice president of engineering, Monique Apter, vice president of sales, Krishna Gopalakrishnan, senior director of vision and platform, and Greg McEntyre, vice president of implementation.</p>
<p>Barnehama intends the new funding to expand Elementary’s customer base globally. He also intends to double the company’s workforce over the next year by growing in engineering, sales, implementation and customer success teams. The company will also invest in technology development for additional AI inspection capabilities and cloud analytics and reporting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“During the pandemic, manufacturing and logistics have undergone major labor shortages that were already beginning before the pandemic but were significantly increased,” Barnehama said. “As companies look to continue to automate without having to rely on expensive and hard to find engineering talent, our business has scaled because we are able to provide them with no-code AI solutions. Overall, we’re enabling customers to move towards industry 4.0 cloud initiatives, and quality/sustainability initiatives in a fast and easy path.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/an-update-on-our-work-to-safeguard-and-diversify-recommendations">announced</a> this morning it&#8217;s taking a new approach to its &#8220;For You&#8221; feed &#8212; the short-form video app&#8217;s main feed, powered by its algorithmic recommendations. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/tiktok-explains-how-the-recommendation-system-behind-its-for-you-feed-works/">already detailed</a> how its algorithm works to suggest videos based on users&#8217; engagement patterns within its app, but admits that too much of a particular content category can be &#8220;problematic.&#8221; The company now says it&#8217;s working to implement new technology to interrupt &#8220;repetitive patterns&#8221; on its app and is also developing a tool that would allow users to have a say in the matter by letting them pick which topics they want to avoid.</p>
<p>The company explains in its announcement that &#8220;too much of anything, whether it&#8217;s animals, fitness tips, or personal well-being journeys, doesn&#8217;t fit with the diverse discovery experience we aim to create.&#8221; However, TikTok isn&#8217;t diversifying its algorithm because people are complaining of seeing one too many cute puppy videos &#8212; it&#8217;s doing so because regulators are cracking down on tech and questioning the harmful impacts of unchecked recommendation algorithms, particularly when it comes to teen mental health.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/instagrams-adam-mosseri-senate-hearing-teen-safety/">Instagram</a> execs, along with those from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-snap-youtube-hearing-congress/">other social platforms</a>, have been hauled into Congress and questioned about how their apps have been directing users to dangerous content &#8212; including to topics like pro-anorexia and eating disorder content, for example.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248711" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TikTok, in its announcement, makes mention of the types of videos that could be harmful if viewed in excess, including things like &#8220;extreme dieting or fitness,&#8221; &#8220;sadness,&#8221; and &#8220;breakups&#8221;-themed videos. While a user who shows interest in videos of this nature may find them interesting, the algorithm isn&#8217;t yet smart enough to know that directing the user to more of the same, repeatedly, could actually do the user harm. This problem is not limited to TikTok, of course. Across the board, it&#8217;s becoming clear that systems designed only to increase user engagement through automated means will do so at the expense of users&#8217; mental health. While Congress is currently most interested in how these systems impact young people, some studies,<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/not-youtubes-algorithm-radicalizes-people/"> though debated</a>, have indicated that unchecked recommendations algorithms may also play a role in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/08/technology/youtube-radical.html">radicalizing</a> users who could be drawn to extreme views.</p>
<p>TikTok says it will also test new ways to avoid recommending a series of similar content when users watch and engage with videos in these potentially harmful types of videos. But it only offered examples of the types of videos it would limit, not a full list.</p>
<p>In addition, the company said it&#8217;s developing technology that will help it to recognize when a user&#8217;s &#8220;For You&#8221; page isn&#8217;t very diverse. While the user may not be watching videos that actually violate TikTok&#8217;s policies, the company said that viewing &#8220;very limited types of content&#8230;could have a negative effect if that&#8217;s the majority of what someone watches, such as content about loneliness or weight loss.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Another strategy TikTok plans to roll out includes a new feature that would allow people to direct the algorithm themselves. They would be able to use this feature to choose words or hashtags associated with content they don&#8217;t want to see in their &#8220;For You&#8221; feed. This would be in addition to TikTok&#8217;s existing tools to flag videos you don&#8217;t like by tapping &#8220;Not Interested,&#8221; for example. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To be clear, TikTok&#8217;s announcement today is only about laying out a roadmap of its plans, not the actual launch of such changes and features. Instead, it&#8217;s an attempt to hold off regulators from further investigations into its app and its potentially harmful effects. its strategy was likely informed by the types of questions asked of it both during <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-snap-youtube-hearing-congress/">its own Congressional hearing</a> and those of its rivals.</p>
<p>TikTok notes that the actual implementation could take time and iteration before it gets things right.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll continue to look at how we can ensure our system is making a diversity of recommendations,&#8221; the company noted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanish proptech </span><a href="https://www.clikalia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clikalia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has secured $518 million in debt and equity in what is among the <a href="https://elreferente.es/ecosistema/las-25-rondas-de-inversion-mas-importantes-del-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largest venture capital rounds</a> raised in Spain to date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repeat entrepreneurs Alister Moreno and Pablo Fernandez founded the company in 2018 with the intent of providing Spaniards with digital options when buying and selling their homes. The iBuyer model that had proven popular in the United States by the likes of Opendoor and Redfin is also resonating with Europeans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clikalia is currently at a run rate of over 1,800 properties acquired, which represents 7x to 8x growth versus a year ago. It also has a team of over 600 people. It recently acquired Inmho, a Spanish property management company, in an effort to expand its capabilities in that area. The buy, execs said, will provide access to over 250,000 residential units.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2247990" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los Angeles-based Fifth Wall led the approximately $70 million equity financing for Clikalia, which also included participation from Luxor Capital and Mouro Capital. Deutsche Bank provided the nearly $450 million in debt financing. Interestingly, Fifth Wall is also an investor in Opendoor as well as Loft, a Latin American real estate tech unicorn. Luxor has invested in U.S. iBuyer Offerpad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In line with the iBuyer model, Clikalia guarantees sellers “immediate” liquidity through an offer on their property as quickly as within 24 hours and, if accepted, a sale within seven days. In about 70% of the cases, Clikalia then renovates a property and puts it back on the market. Its mission is to leverage its “proprietary” technology to digitize a historically slow and painful home selling process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you buy a home from us, you have all costs in the embedded price,” Moreno told TechCrunch. “If you buy an old home, get a mortgage for an old home and then hire a contractor and architect for a renovation, that will cost you 4x more than it costs us. And you have to get a  consumer loan to finance the renovation. With Clikalia, it’s just one mortgage and you’re ready to go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In November of 2020, the company raised about $14 million in equity. Today, it operates in Spain and Mexico, with plans to open in Portugal in January 2022 and expand across Europe over time. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is planning to use its new capital to do more acquisitions, and, naturally, do some hiring. Currently, about 70% of its executive team are women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miguel Nigorra, partner and head of Europe for Fifth Wall, said his firm was impressed by the founding team, which had a previous successful exit as well as the market opportunity, as well as the company’s “amazing” unit economics and metrics “compared to many other companies in the market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Spanish market is one of the largest markets in Europe when it comes to residential real estate &#8212; with the equivalent of over 300,000 transactions per year,” he told TechCrunch. “It’s a massive market, and the process of selling a home in Europe and Spain specifically is extraordinarily time consuming, expensive and inconvenient. We’re excited about the technology angle Clikalia is bringing to a very old fashioned vertical in the real estate market.”</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With the latest funding, ManageXR will support its expanding </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">team and go-to-market strategy as the company has experienced rapid growth since becoming available to beta users in November </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">2019 and officially launching in April 2021. The startup will continue to look for ways to expand its partner network of hardware and software companies across the globe, Luke Wilson, founder and CEO of ManageXR told TechCrunch. The company will focus more on large enterprises next year, he added. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ManageXR built an enterprise </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">device management platform designed for VR and AR devices to serve as the core infrastructure for organizations. Its platform looks to scale enterprises’ XR deployments, enabling them to control remotely every aspect of their XR device fleet, including distributing apps and files, customizing the home screen user experience, tracking device health and usage, and more. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248599" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Device management solutions have been around for years, but until recently, there hasn’t been a viable option for VR and AR devices. We’re solving that problem for businesses at an inflection point in the industry,” Wilson said. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Wilson founded ManageXR in 2018 with the intention of building VR experiences for pediatric patients in the hospital. At the time, the company had to develop its own rudimentary device management platform to deliver its content in the healthcare environments, Wilson told TechCrunch. In late 2019, the company realized that every other company, like ManageXR, would have to solve the same problems on its own, so it pivoted to focus solely on ManageXR in early 2020. Its team understands the challenges of using XR at scale on a deep, personal level, and it’s made a huge difference in how they </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">operate the company, Wilson said. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its competitors include incumbent mobile device management </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">companies, which build similar tools for mobile phones and laptops, and some device manufacturers. However, XR is a nascent and fast-moving market with different requirements that these companies are not equipped to handle, Wilson continued. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“These hardware manufacturers have created their own rudimentary device management systems, but they consistently miss the mark in terms of functionality and usability. These OEM management systems also force their users to only use one manufacturer’s hardware, which prevents customers from using the wide variety of hardware on the market,” Wilson said. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its customers pay a monthly or annual fee per device, Wilson noted. Depending on the product tier, the licenses cost $7-$10 per device per month. Its premium product tier, which costs monthly $10 per device, is by far the company’s most popular offering. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Between the recent investments in the space from the largest tech giants and businesses now using VR and AR for everything from employee training to patient care to sales enablement, extended reality in the enterprise is at the cusp of mass adoption and we’re thrilled to have Rally Ventures join us for the ride,” Wilson said. </span></p>
<p>“XR is set to fundamentally change how we conduct business, collaborate, and experience the world in our professional and personal lives, but as adoption increases, so do the challenges that businesses face in successfully implementing their programs,” said Jay Borenstein, venture partner at Rally Ventures. “I am very excited to support Luke and his growing team as they accelerate how corporations can manage and benefit from XR devices at scale and ultimately bring enterprise-wide XR to the mainstream.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Denver-based software startup <a href="https://gtmhub.com/">Gtmhub</a> announced this morning that it has closed a $120 million Series C. <a href="https://www.indexventures.com/">Index Ventures</a> led the round, with a number of prior investors contributing as well.</p>
<p>Before its new investment, Gtmhub had raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gtmhub/company_financials">just over $40 million in total</a>, making its Series C around triple its prior <em>aggregate</em> capital base.</p>
<p>The OKR software market that the startup competes in has had a busy year, helping make the huge round more understandable than it is when simply compared to Gtmhub&#8217;s far-smaller Series A and B rounds. Competitor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/microsoft-acquires-ally-io-okr-startup-that-raised-76-million/">Ally sold to Microsoft</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/workboard-raises-75m-as-the-okr-focused-startup-bets-on-a-growing-economy-changes-to-business-culture/">rival WorkBoard raised a $75 million round earlier in the year</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248695" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Most recently, smaller OKR player Koan shut down, <a href="https://www.koan.co/blog/koan-update-were-not-dead-yet">eventually selling to Gtmhub</a>. TechCrunch&#8217;s prior notes regarding the OKR software market&#8217;s rise <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/why-is-everyone-making-okr-software/">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/rapid-growth-in-2020-reveals-okr-software-markets-untapped-potential/">here</a> provide more context.</p>
<p>TechCrunch caught up with Gtmhub COO <a href="https://twitter.com/sethaelliott?lang=en">Seth Elliott</a> to chat about the round, and how quickly his startup may be able to grow next year.</p>
<h2>Why raise $120 million?</h2>
<p>Math, in part, per Elliott. It was time for Gtmhub to raise more capital, but given venture mathematics, it could not have raised a much smaller amount, he said. In a $50 million investment, Elliott explained, there wouldn&#8217;t have been &#8220;enough pie to go around.&#8221;</p>
<p>Translating that a bit: New lead investors like Index want to secure a material ownership position in their new portfolio company. And prior investors want to use up as much of their pro-rata rights &#8212; the ability to defend valuation percentages in successive venture rounds &#8212; as possible, which means that for companies of a certain valuation mark, smaller rounds become an impossibility.</p>
<p>No, Gtmhub is not sharing its valuation in this round. And sadly, Crunchbase and PitchBook lack other data points for us to lean on, but we&#8217;d be surprised if the startup wasn&#8217;t nearing unicorn status after its Series C. The implication of the math point and the round size itself imply that Gtmhub enjoyed a healthy new valuation in its latest round.</p>
<p>How did the company manage to raise more capital after announcing its Series B this January? Growth, according to Elliott.</p>
<p>The COO told TechCrunch that Gtmhub expects to triple its revenues this year, and perhaps achieve the same growth rate next year. The new capital will help support that goal.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the OKR space is diverging somewhat between players. WorkBoard spends its time discussing its enterprise clients, for example. Gtmhub, in contrast, told TechCrunch about its longer-term plans to grow from a corporate planning software concern &#8212; OKR stands for o<em>bjectives and key results,</em> a Silicon Valley-standard corporate planning process &#8212; into something more proactive, perhaps leveraging company data to help customers identify &#8220;inflection points&#8221; and become more guiding than merely supporting in time.</p>
<p>That work won&#8217;t come cheap given the cost of machine-learning talent in today&#8217;s market.</p>
<h2>The OKR market</h2>
<p>Along with corporate spend, the OKR market may be my favorite startup cluster to track these days. Not only does it feature a number of well-funded startups competing directly, but we&#8217;re also already seeing smaller players shake out and Big Tech firms take note. Tracking how WorkBoard and Gtmhub perform in 2022 will be fascinating.</p>
<p>Given their historical growth rates, if they have a good next year, each will become at least something near to an IPO candidate in 2023. Bring it on.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We spoke to three rocket makers who have either already launched, achieved orbit or are well on their way: Firefly Aerospace's Lauren Lyons, Astra's Benjamin Lyon and Launcher's Max Haot.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More private rocket companies are actually now coming online, after years of the field being left basically to SpaceX and Rocket Lab. At TC Sessions: Space 2021 this past week, we spoke to three rocket makers who have either already launched, achieved orbit or are well on their way: Firefly Aerospace&#8217;s Lauren Lyons, Astra&#8217;s Benjamin Lyon and Launcher&#8217;s Max Haot.</p>
<p>In our discussion, &#8220;New Kids on the Launch Block,&#8221; one common theme that quickly emerged was that vertical integration is a key driver of success in the rocket business is driving down costs, especially with smaller capacity launch vehicles. Just as, if not more important, is building a team that can execute with a focus on efficiency, iteration and flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>Lyon:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I think space tech is all about rapidly iterating, as opposed to working for seven to 10 years on a single product, and having that bespoke application, because it means you have to know perfectly what the future is. And nobody buys an iPhone and then 10 years later says this is the best thing in the world, you want the latest thing. And so similarly, when you think about iterating, and doing space tech, both again, launch as well as on orbit, you really want this iterative approach that&#8217;s very focused on customers, as opposed to kind of the old school way of doing aerospace. I think that&#8217;s a key way to think about the future. Similarly, when we think about how we operate inside Astra, we think very hard about where can we get this down to basically a robot, where the robots doing the work [ … ] Now, obviously, there&#8217;s a path, there&#8217;s a roadmap to get there. But getting down to just a few people in mission control, and just a few people on the ground where we do the launch, that&#8217;s been something we&#8217;ve worked hard on, and recently just made it to orbit with. So I think that is a strategy that is really working and paying dividends.</p></blockquote>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Startup markets around the world are heating up, and more investors are competing against each other for the best deals. In the scuffle, VCs are<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-what-its-like-being-a-venture-capital-scout-in-this-hot-market-2021-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> turning to scouts</a> to do the legwork, but that has meant being yet another step removed from their founders. Investors have already been signing the dotted line without meeting entrepreneurs in person.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve sat at both sides of the table as a founder and a VC, and I understand how difficult it is to get them on the same page. However, I believe that accelerators can be the glue bringing the two together.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve participated in a number of accelerators, including Disney and Techstars, and these programs gave me a noticeable advantage when I stepped into VC. It helped me understand how founders grow and what they&#8217;re looking for in their partnerships. I&#8217;ve also seen firsthand that investors have a greater appreciation for building from the ground up after spending time at an accelerator.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248110" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>VCs have to be a direct extension of the teams they support, but they can&#8217;t align and succeed with teams if they haven&#8217;t experienced one of the most crucial parts of their growth trajectory.</p>
<p>In my current position as executive director of<a href="https://prsciencetrust.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> PRSTRT&#8217;s</a> accelerator,<a href="https://parallel18.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> parallel18</a>, I&#8217;ve been inviting VCs to visit us and bridge the gap between business and capital. Here&#8217;s why I believe every investor should spend time with an accelerator:</p>
<h2>See diversity in action, and mirror it</h2>
<p>Over the past year, VCs have been quick to commit to diversity, with<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/vc-pledged-better-diversity-its-barely-changed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 40%</a> of firms putting D&amp;I strategies in place. To give those initiatives the best chance of success, VCs need to expose themselves to the communities they want to empower.</p>
<p>Accelerators are hubs for diversity. Most have quotas to ensure programs are made up of founders from all backgrounds, many pair with local organizations to support the communities where they&#8217;re based and some accelerators are specifically designed for minority founders (e.g.,<a href="https://www.techstars.com/accelerators/equitech" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Techstars Equitech Accelerator</a>) and women founders (e.g.,<a href="https://www.ogunte.com/innovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Ogunte</a>).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When investors spend time at an accelerator, they listen to brainstorming sessions, pitches and mentorship advice that includes a broad range of perspectives and opinions. They hear about the barriers that entrepreneurs from different groups face and learn what tools they need to overcome them. Likewise, they can take inspiration from the teams running accelerators, who are responsible for recruiting diverse founders, creating safe spaces and promoting equality through their programs.</p>
<p>At an accelerator, VCs not only get a more thorough understanding of the people they serve &#8212; they can also take the lessons around diversity back to their firms and implement them in the future. They can also bring more diverse startups into their portfolios <em>now</em>, because founders are more likely to trust their pledge for diversity if they&#8217;ve dedicated time and effort to an accelerator.</p>
<h2>Boost serendipitous, strategic meetings</h2>
<p>Investment is much like dating &#8212; VCs could go for 40 coffee meetings a week with founders, but only one or two really catch their eye. It&#8217;s not that there aren&#8217;t incredible startups out there, but VCs aren&#8217;t always placing themselves in the right crowd.</p>
<p>When a VC spends time at an accelerator, they&#8217;re in front of a number of talented founders at once. What&#8217;s more, they&#8217;re on an equal playing field as investors roll up their sleeves and take part in the accelerator activities. Investors can get a feel for founder personalities, hear soft pitches and share connections, ideas and commonalities that don&#8217;t naturally come up over Zoom. The same applies to founders, who can suss out investors&#8217; priorities and ways of communicating and determine whether there&#8217;s business compatibility.</p>
<p>Accelerators pre-screen all their startups, too, meaning investors don&#8217;t have to perform the same level of due diligence as when meeting a founder cold. The result is a much higher quality of deal flow for VCs.</p>
<p>Investors will also be introduced to the greater startup ecosystem where the accelerator is located and network with other players (governing bodies, NGOs, universities) that could offer valuable support to their portfolio companies. This kind of serendipity is much harder (almost impossible) to curate via a phone call.</p>
<h2>Reconnect with impact investing</h2>
<p>Spending time in an accelerator isn&#8217;t just educational for investors, but it can also offer a sense of personal fulfillment that many VCs seek. Despite increased claims of purpose-driven investment, corporate VC firms are often<a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/corporate-vcs-are-moving-the-goalposts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> more motivated</a> by strategic payoffs, leaving individual VCs feeling like they&#8217;re not creating the political, societal or environmental change they believe in.</p>
<p>By rubbing shoulders with the people who are building companies that can enact change, investors can reignite their passion for impact. I&#8217;ve seen investors come to parallel18 and be reminded of their core mission.</p>
<p>Their recent deals might have been oriented toward investment trends like online gaming, but being part of founders&#8217; discussion around niche areas like tech accessibility and cyberbullying can bring investors back to their ethical roots.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy as an investor to make arbitrary promises of impact. But an investor who spends time at an accelerator and connects with impact-driven founders has greater awareness and accountability. An accelerator offers a strong network of people that can keep investors honest.</p>
<p>VC is ultimately about people, not ideas, but in the current landscape, investors aren&#8217;t sufficiently getting to know founders or their experience. Being at an accelerator allows investors to empathize with entrepreneurs and establish a relationship beyond the checkbook &#8212; one that can encourage diversity, impact and success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just two and a half months after </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/weight-health-startup-found-comes-out-of-stealth-with-32m-in-funding-former-bumble-exec-as-new-ceo/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emerging from stealth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, weight care management startup </span><a href="https://joinfound.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Found</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced today that it has raised $100 million in a Series B funding round that values the company at $600 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WestCap &#8212; a growth equity firm founded by former Blackstone and Airbnb executive Laurence Tosi &#8212; led the investment, with participation from IVP, The Chernin Group, G9 Ventures and Able Partners. Existing backers GV, Define and founding investor Atomic also put money in the round, along with angel investors such as Instacart CEO Fidji Simo and Everly Health CEO Julia Cheek.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New CEO and former Bumble executive Sarah Jones Simmer described the round as oversubscribed and pre-emptive, considering the startup “had not planned” on the raise process.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248060" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think what was so interesting and exciting for investors is there is this really well understood TAM [total addressable market] &#8212; and it&#8217;s clear that this is the biggest problem facing healthcare today,” Jones Simmer told TechCrunch. “And here&#8217;s this company with a new, innovative approach and a clear product market fit with a business that has scaled very well, arguably operating under the radar without a whole lot of marketing channels fired up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the beginning of this year, Found has seen its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual run rate grow by 6x, according to Jones Simmer. To give some context around its growth, in late September, the company had told me that since its 2020 launch, it had helped “tens of thousands” of members lose over 200,000 pounds, and that it was currently available in 31 states at an average cost of $100 per month, with a variety of plans.</span></p>
<p>As of this month, Found has now helped members lose more than 300,000 pounds (so it&#8217;s up by 100,000) and is available in 37 states, with plans to reach the entire country by early 2022. <span style="font-weight: 400;">On average, Found members have lost 10% of their weight by month six and have kept it off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new capital will go toward continued </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">investment in the platform, its infrastructure and growing its user base.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Underpinning all that is hiring,” Jones Simmer said. To underscore that goal, the company recently made two executive hires, naming </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Rekha Kumar</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">as its chief medical officer and Dr. Acacia Parks as its chief behavioral health officer. Kumar previously served as the medical director of the American Board of Obesity Medicine. Parks was previously chief science officer at Happify Health. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Found</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was incubated at </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/atomic-which-only-funds-the-startups-it-launches-just-closed-its-newest-fund-with-260-million/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atomic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a San Francisco-based venture studio, in the spring of 2020. Earlier this year, it raised $24 million in a Series A round led by GV (formerly Google Ventures) and Atomic, with participation from Define Ventures. And over the course of the last year, it raised $8 million in previously unannounced seed funding, largely from Atomic, in addition to Define Ventures. With this latest round, Found has now raised $132 million since inception. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup aims to help people focus more on body positivity and what they can “find” — such as being able to finish a 5K or keeping up with their grandkids or a newfound confidence — during their weight management journey. And it does it by combining advice from clinicians, a community of others going through the same process and “prescription interventions” when deemed necessary. The company aims for a holistic, personalized and integrated approach that includes addressing sleep, “mindful” eating, movement, stress and a person’s biology.</span></p>
<p>Allen Mask, partner at WestCap and formerly of Sonos and Airbnb, is joining Found&#8217;s board as part of the financing. He believes there is a lack of knowledge around what is possible when it comes to weight loss.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That’s part of the reason why most people struggle and lose hope. Now, we know it takes more than willpower &#8212; it takes science and support,&#8221; Mask said in a written statement. &#8220;The Found team are leading the evolution of care with a unique vision and have developed a proven integrated weight loss program that combines dedicated medical care with personal health coaching.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Motional, a driverless technology company, is partnering with Uber to launch an autonomous delivery pilot in Santa Monica, according to Motional. Uber Eats customers will be able to order restaurant meal kits to be delivered to them via one of Motional&#8217;s retrofitted all-electric <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/motional-reveals-its-hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-robotaxi/">Hyundai Ioniq 5 robotaxis</a> by early next year.</p>
<p>The partnership will be both Motional&#8217;s first time delving into the driverless delivery space and Uber&#8217;s first delivery partnership with an autonomous vehicle fleet provider. Motional said this first foray into delivery signals its &#8220;evolution to a dual-purpose product strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We envision our delivery service to eventually be as ubiquitous as ride-hailing is today,&#8221; Eryk Nice, Motional&#8217;s VP of technology strategy, told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248570" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Uber&#8217;s not the first big app-based transportation company to partner with Motional. Last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/motional-and-lyft-to-launch-driverless-commercial-robotaxi-service-in-las-vegas-in-2023/">the AV startup shared plans to launch a driverless commercial robotaxi service with Lyft in Las Vegas by 2023</a>. Motional has historically had more of a presence in Nevada, where it&#8217;s been conducting driverless tests since November 2020. This summer, Motional<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/motional-to-begin-testing-autonomous-vehicles-in-la-as-part-of-california-expansion-plan/"> announced plans to expand its presence in California</a> with a new Los Angeles operations facility that would support testing on public roads, and this pilot with Uber makes good on those plans.</p>
<p>Motional would not share the number of vehicles it aims to put on the streets in Santa Monica with Uber, but it did say that a human safety operator would be present during rides.<a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-testing-permit-holders/"> Only a handful of AV companies have permits to test in California without a human safety operator</a>, including Cruise, Nuro, Waymo, Weride and Zoox, and of those, only Cruise, Waymo and Nuro are able to deploy AVs commercially.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cruise, Waymo get OK to launch robotaxi service in San Francisco&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/cruise-waymo-get-ok-to-launch-robotaxi-service-in-san-francisco/embed/#?secret=CTfZqCEL7s" data-secret="CTfZqCEL7s" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Motional said it would work closely with Uber to determine what the user experience would look like for Uber Eats customers, but wouldn&#8217;t go into much detail.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Motional takes an in-depth, research-backed approach to its user experience development,&#8221; said Nice. &#8220;This work is already in process for delivery use cases. Our goal is to enable a seamless and intuitive autonomous experience that is informed by end-user needs and delights the delivery customer. We look forward to continuing to refine the experience as we learn more from the pilot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Motional wouldn&#8217;t share details of the operational design domains of its vehicles in Santa Monica, like where specifically it would be conducting the pilot, what hours its vehicles would be on the road, or whether the AVs will be allowed to operate in fog or rain.</p>
<p>&#8220;We test the Ioniq 5 robotaxi against diverse driving environments and conditions to enable safe navigation during adverse conditions,&#8221; said Nice. &#8220;We also recently expanded our testing facility in Las Vegas, which will enable us to increase the volume of controlled closed-course testing (by 4X) and the complexity of the scenarios, including more complex urban settings, variable lighting, including nighttime, and light to heavy rain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both Motional and Uber said they see AVs playing an important role in the on-demand delivery ecosystem by increasing access to convenient and affordable deliveries, and that they would share more service details closer to launch next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.alitheiaidf.com/">Alitheia IDF</a> (AIF), a women-focused private equity fund in Africa has raised $100 million to invest in gender-diverse businesses across the continent.</p>
<p>The fund is looking to bridge the financing gap for women-led or owned businesses in Africa – where women startup founders are less likely to receive funding despite their increasing enterprise.</p>
<p>Women-only founders have received <a href="https://thebigdeal.substack.com/p/crumbs-basically">less than 1%</a> of the nearly $5 billion that has been raised by startups across Africa so far this year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248648" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Globally, women have tremendous purchasing power as consumers and controllers of household economics. In the same vein, women entrepreneurs have a significant presence in Africa&#8217;s SME sector with African women making up 58% of the continent’s self-employed population. However, despite this economic power and presence, they are underserved as consumers and producers,” said Alitheia’s principal partner in Nigeria, Tokunboh Ishmael.</p>
<p>Ishmael adds that the exclusion of women has had a huge impact on Africa’s economic growth as the potential of more than half of its population remains untapped due to structural and systemic issues.</p>
<p>“We are proactively working towards filling this gap with a clear mandate to support women-led businesses across the continent while raising awareness for gender smart investment as a path towards inclusive economic growth,” she said.</p>
<p>Alitheia invests in growth stage companies across Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Zambia, representing a small fraction of the <a href="https://au.int/en/member_states/countryprofiles2">55</a> countries in Africa.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>By investing in women, the fund hopes to unlock the potential of women-led businesses in Africa, and, ultimately, the economic transformation of their countries.</p>
<p>The fund’s investors include the African Development Bank, Bank of Industry Nigeria, FinDev Canada, Dutch Good Growth Fund and the European Investment Bank. European Investment Bank (EIB) joined the round as the closing investor, committing $24.6 million.</p>
<p>“Women-owned businesses still struggle to raise funding, although they have proven their performance. I am very pleased to support a true ‘by women for women’ 2X Flagship Fund, which invests in companies creating job opportunities while enhancing diversity in sub-Saharan Africa’s economy,” said EIB vice-president, Thomas Östros.</p>
<p>The EIB’s investment in Alitheia IDF is part of its SheInvest initiative which seeks to mobilize about $2.26b of investment to boost gender equality and women economic empowerment across Africa.</p>
<p>The new $100m funding for Alitheia comes after it raised $75 million in 2019, which it is using to finance women-led businesses across the target countries. Among the enterprises supported by the fund are Ghana’s Jetstream Africa, South Africa’s AV Light Steel and Nigeria’s ReelFruit Ltd, SKLD (formerly SchoolKits) and Chika’s Food.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/ghanas-jetstream-lands-3m-to-build-the-digital-infrastructure-for-africas-trade-corridors/">Jetstream Africa, which raised $3 million in July this year</a>, makes it possible for businesses across Africa to manage their cross-border supply chains by the aggregation of private sector logistics providers at African ports and borders.</p>
<p>AV Light Steel manufactures and supplies light steel structures while <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/indyventure/chika-snacks-russell-peanuts-dragons-den-nigeria-startup-entrepreneur-a7935446.html">Chika’s Food</a>, and ReelFruit, which <a href="https://reelfruit.com/reelfruit-raises-3-million-series-a-funding-to-expand-production-with-new-factory/">raised $3 million</a> in series A investment two months ago, are both snack manufacturers. SKLD supplies merchandise including educational, hygiene and office supplies.</p>
<p>“The historic inability to appropriately capture the economic potential of African women has affected Africa’s development. Alitheia IDF is on a mission to fill this gap by using a gender-smart approach, and financial capital to empower women as consumers and producers,” said Alitheia’s principal partner in South Africa, Polo Leteka.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Controversial facial recognition company, Clearview AI, which has amassed a database of some 10 billion images by scraping selfies off the Internet so it can sell an identity-matching service to law enforcement, has been hit with another order to delete people&#8217;s data.</p>
<p>France&#8217;s privacy watchdog said today that Clearview has breached Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/reconnaissance-faciale-la-cnil-met-en-demeure-clearview-ai-de-cesser-la-reutilisation-de">announcement</a> of the breach finding, the CNIL also gives Clearview formal notice to stop its &#8220;unlawful processing&#8221; and says it must delete user data within two months.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248668" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The watchdog is acting on complaints against Clearview received since May 2020.</p>
<p>The US company does not have an established base in the EU &#8212; meaning its business is open to regulatory action across the EU, by any of the bloc&#8217;s data protection supervisors. So while the CNIL&#8217;s order only applies to data it holds on people from French territories &#8212; which the CNIL estimates covers &#8220;several&#8221; tens of millions of Internet users &#8212; more such orders are likely from other EU agencies.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>CNIL notes that it has sought to work with fellow authorities by sharing the results of its investigations &#8212; which suggests Clearview is likely to face further orders to stop processing data from authorities in the other EU Member States and EEA countries that have transposed the GDPR into national law (some 30 countries in all).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This year Clearview&#8217;s service has already been ruled in breach of privacy rules in </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/clearview-ai-ruled-illegal-by-canadian-privacy-authorities/">Canada</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/clearview-ai-australia-privacy-breach/">Australia</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and the </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/clearview-ai-ico-view-to-fine/">UK</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> (which, post-Brexit, sits outside the EU but retains the GDPR in national law <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">for now</a>) &#8212; where it&#8217;s facing a possible fine and was also ordered to delete user data </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/clearview-ai-ico-view-to-fine/">last month</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. </span></p>
<h2>Two breaches of the GDPR</h2>
<p>France&#8217;s CNIL found that Clearview committed two breaches of the GDPR &#8212; violating Article 6 (the lawfulness of processing) by collecting and using biometric data without a legal basis; and breaching a variety of data access rights set out out in Articles 12, 15 and 17.</p>
<p>The Article 6 breach is because Clearview does not obtain consent from people to use their facial biometrics, nor can it rely on a legitimate interest legal basis for collecting and using this data either &#8212; given what CNIL describes as the massive scale and &#8220;particularly intrusive&#8221; nature of the processing it&#8217;s carrying out.</p>
<p>&#8220;These people, whose photographs or videos are accessible on various websites and social networks, would not reasonably expect their images to be processed by [Clearview AI] to feed a facial recognition system that can be used by states [such as for] police purposes,&#8221; CNIL writes (translated from French).</p>
<p>It also received complaints from individual over a number of &#8220;difficulties&#8221; encountered in trying to obtain their GDPR data access rights.</p>
<p>Here CNIL found Clearview is breaching the regulation in a number of ways &#8212; such as by limiting individual&#8217;s data access rights to twice a year &#8220;without justification&#8221;; or limiting it to data collected during the preceding 12 months; or only responding to certain requests after &#8220;an excessive number of requests from the same person&#8221;.</p>
<p>Clearview has been ordered to make sure it properly facilitates data subjects&#8217; rights, including complying with requests to delete people&#8217;s data.</p>
<p>If the company does not comply with the French order CNIL warns it could face further regulatory action &#8212; which would include the possibility of a fine.</p>
<p>Under GDPR, DPAs can issue fines as high as €20 million or up to 4% of a company&#8217;s annual global revenue, whichever is higher. Enforcing fines on companies without an EU base does present a regulatory challenge, however.</p>
<p>Clearview has been contacted for comment on the CNIL&#8217;s order.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The rise and impact of influencers has been one of the biggest forces in how the modern online social landscape has evolved in recent times. Now, a company that&#8217;s tapping into that influencer juggernaut, and specifically how it is playing out in the world of marketing, is announcing a huge round of funding to keep riding that wave.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.mavrck.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mavrck</a>, which has built a platform for brands and media companies to source and engage with influencers for marketing campaigns, has raised $120 million in growth equity from a single backer, <span class="s1">Summit Partners</span>. Mavrck will use the capital to continue investing in its platform, and for business development. It is not disclosing valuation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We are going to use this investment to double down on our industry leading platform and double our team,&#8221; Lyle Stevens, the co-founder and CEO, said in an interview over email. &#8220;In doing so, we will become the most intelligent platform in the market with the petabytes of historical data we have&#8230; This data will power recommendation engines in the Mavrck platform that help connect enterprise marketers with the right creators, the right way, at the right cost.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248665" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">The company today already has some strong traction and momentum.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stevens said that the company&#8217;s &#8220;Influencer Index&#8221; &#8212; as its directory is called &#8212; currently lists &#8220;millions of contactable macro- and micro- influencers around the globe and across all major social platforms.&#8221; Some 500 brands and 5,000 marketers are already using Mavrck to connect with those influencers. And in all, since being founded 2014, Mavrck has connected brands with more than 3 million influencers and creators, reaching more than 240 million consumers, primarily through &#8220;native&#8221; sponsored content across various media including videos and photos, blogs and podcasts.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><span class="im">Stevens said that the core of Mavrck&#8217;s technology is based around patented algorithms and first-party opt-in data, which brands use to find and connect with influencers that speak to the audiences that the marketers are hoping to reach. It has build some 25 different search filters &#8212; covering areas like </span>audience demographics, historical performance, fraud risk &#8212; to whittle down the wider directory to those that match what they need. It then provides a platform for them to engage with each other to work through projects and eventually pay them. &#8220;We also have the technology for our customers to invite or import their existing influencer and consumer relationships to develop their own ambassador network,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Influencer marketing spend has become a very big business in the wider area of marketing, rising 55% in the last year, with two-thirds of brands now deploying an influencer marketing strategy in some way. It&#8217;s now estimated to be a $100 billion industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alongside this, Stevens notes that the creator economy is &#8220;expanding rapidly, as more and more people have turned to content creation as a secondary or primary source of income.&#8221; He cites figures from eMarketer that estimated that in 2020, 50 million people identified themselves as “creators”. And if you have a child, you might nod a little wearily in recognition at the results of a Harris Poll last year that found some 30% of children said their ambition was to become a &#8220;YouTuber&#8221; (only 11% said &#8220;astronaut&#8221;).</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to support this new creative class by connecting them to the world’s enterprise consumer brands, allowing them to turn their passion into a possibility to earn a living,&#8221; said Stevens.</p>
<p>The role of a company like Mavrck is not just to connect marketers with influencers, but also to take a pulse on where influencer content is making the greatest impact. Although it&#8217;s a very fragmented space &#8212; blogs, for example, can still power, especially with certain kinds of products and consumers &#8212; when it comes to single platforms with the biggest scale, social apps are still at the top of the heap.</p>
<p>Stevens notes that Instagram remains the most popular platform today for influencer content, helped by the social app&#8217;s shift in 2016 to displaying content algorithmically instead of chronologically.  But while Instagram still dominates, that is starting to shift. &#8220;The Tiktok &#8216;For You&#8217; Page algorithm appears to be taking market share from Instagram, as we have seen a 400% increase year over year in the number of creators being activated on TikTok by our brand customers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If that trend continues, we anticipate TikTok to dominate influencer marketing over the next five years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whichever platform ends up on top, Stevens believes that influencers and influencer marketing are not a flash in the pan, but are here to stay.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;If you think about the last purchase you made, odds are you were influenced or persuaded by what other people say and display online, versus what a brand said to you directly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those other people can be friends, like-minded strangers or creators you choose to follow online. This concept of social proof has become an essential brand building tool for consumer enterprises. In the wake of COVID and the corresponding changes in consumer buying behavior, consumer engagement with creators has increased 70%. As a result, brands are investing more in social proof to not only thrive, but stay relevant and survive.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">That&#8217;s enough to influence investors, too.</p>
<div class="yj6qo ajU">
<p class="p4">“At Summit, we have invested across the commerce segment – in both brands and the technologies that support their growth – and we believe strongly in the impact and potential of authentic brand relationships as a means to build value,” said Michael Medici, MD at Summit Partners, in a statement.</p>
<p class="p4">“Brands are increasingly seeking to harness the power of the very long tail of content creators to help drive brand awareness and influence purchase activity,” added Sophia Popova, principal at Summit Partners. “Mavrck’s platform is purpose-built to support brands in these efforts. We are delighted to partner with Lyle and the Mavrck team for this next phase of growth.” Both of them have joined the board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Whip Around, a New Zealand-based SaaS company that aims to make fleet inspection and maintenance a much easier process, just closed a $14 million Series B round. The startup will use the funds to expand its New Zealand-based team while growing its reach in the United States, where most of its business resides, according to the company.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“The market is in the early innings of a transition from paper-based manual processes to the digital solution that Whip Around provides,&#8221; said CEO Noah Hickey in a statement. &#8220;There is a significant opportunity to help streamline the transport industry and grow the company.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The funding round was led by Punakaiki Fund, a NZ VC firm, and Amplo, a Texas-based VC firm with multiple software businesses in its portfolio, including Intercom, Robinhood and Sharesies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248164" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Many fleets in the U.S. are mandated by federal regulations to inspect assets daily and retain inspection and maintenance records for up to five years, and doing this by hand and on paper costs fleet operators valuable time, according to a spokesperson for Whip Around. To solve for that, Whip Around aims to replace the paper-based fleet inspection process with a digital one that makes it easier to track progress over time, hold employees accountable and predict future maintenance needs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">We believe that the digitization of these compliance and maintenance processes will only become more mission-critical as the regulators look for ways to follow on from the <a href="https://www.eroad.com/understanding-eld-compliance/">[electronic logging device] mandate</a> and other increased reporting requirements being put on fleet operators,&#8221; the spokesperson told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Whip Around provides its software solutions to customers ranging from small independents to larger fleets, including Imperfect Foods, Belknap, PODS moving and storage and 1-800-GOT-JUNK?. It currently has a team of 70 in Auckland, North Carolina and Texas, and hopes to use the funding to add onto its product and engineering team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Self-driving trucks developer TuSimple has reached a deal to integrate its autonomous vehicle technology into DHL Supply Chain&#8217;s operations. As part of the deal, the contract logistics giant has reserved 100 autonomous trucks that are being co-developed by TuSimple and Navistar. The agreement with DHL pushes TuSimple&#8217;s total reservations order to 6,875 trucks, the first of which will be delivered in 2024.</p>
<p>TuSimple disclosed that is it already using its self-driving trucks to haul freight daily for DHL on a San Antonio-to-Dallas route. That route is part of TuSimple&#8217;s so-called autonomous freight network. The trucks are in autonomous mod, but always have two safety operators within cab, including one behind thee wheel, in case it is necessary to take over.</p>
<p>This autonomous freight network, or AFN, is a mapped network of shipping routes and terminals designed for autonomous trucking operations that will extend across the United States by 2024. TuSimple’s AFN involves four pieces: its self-driving trucks, digital mapped routes, freight terminals and a system that will let customers monitor autonomous trucking operations and track their shipments in real-time. For now, TuSimple will operate the trucks and carry goods for its customers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248288" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TuSimple&#8217;s long-term goal is to sell its autonomous trucks along with a supporting subscription service it calls TuSimple Path so customers can operate their own fleets. Right now, TuSimple has to be its own operator President and CEO Cheng Lu told TechCrunch. The long-term goal is to become a provider of the autonomous vehicles and supporting services.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the way we believe we can scale the number of vehicles,&#8221; Lu said.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">DHL is one of a growing number of companies that include UPS, carrier U.S. Xpress, Penske Truck Leasing and Berkshire Hathaway’s grocery and food service supply chain company McLane Inc. that have joined the TuSimple AFN. </span></p>
<p>The autonomous freight network, which launched in 2020, now extends from Arizona to Florida. The company is aiming to  to create a nationwide freight transportation network over the next few years. TuSimple is also eyeing an expansion in Europe and Asia. The company is testing its autonomous trucks in Sweden and at the deepwater port in Shanghai.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TuSimple previously said the network would be rolled out in three phases, starting with a focus on a service area in the Southwest where it already operates. Phase 1, which launched in 2020 and into 2021, covers service between Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio. It has since expanded to Florida.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.cockroachlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cockroach Labs</a>, makers of CockroachDB, has been raking in money this year. It started the year with a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/cockroach-labs-scores-160m-series-e-on-2b-valuation/"> $160 million Series E</a> on a $2 billion valuation and ended it with a $278 million Series F on a $5 billion valuation, more than doubling the company value in less than 12 months.</p>
<p>Greenoaks led the latest round &#8212; they were a participant in the prior round &#8212; with participation from Altimeter, Bond, Benchmark, Coatue, FirstMark, GV, Index Ventures, J.P. Morgan, Lone Pine Capital, Redpoint Ventures and Tiger Global. The company reports it has raised a total of $633 million with over $550 million coming across three rounds that began with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/cockroach-labs-scores-86-6m-series-d-as-scalable-database-resonates/">an $86.6 million round</a> in May 2020.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of capital, and it&#8217;s probably because the database market is growing in leaps and bounds. Company co-founder and CEO Spencer Kimball says that there has been a ton of follow-on interest in investing in the company since the January round, and that&#8217;s how this one came together so quickly after the last one. What&#8217;s more, he says that there was an alignment between the investors and the company.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248302" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;You want to have investors that understand the business from their own perspective. They&#8217;re asking us to invest as opposed to us trying to convince them that our business is the right one to invest in. That gives a very, I say, complementary [relationship where] their perspective ultimately adds to our perspective,&#8221; Kimball told me.</p>
<p>The company reports it has 200 paying customers, with the cloud side of the business growing at 500% over the last year and ARR tripling YoY from Q3 to Q3. While the majority of revenue still comes from the self-hosted version, the company expects the hosted version to continue to grow faster over time. They also offer<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/cockroach-labs-announces-serverless-version-of-sql-database/"> a serverless product</a> they launched in October in beta.</p>

The company found that cloud-native companies were getting far more revenue growth out of their hosted versions than self-installed.</p>

<p>The company currently partners with Amazon and Google on the cloud install side, with plans to support Microsoft Azure in 2022.</p>
<p>Cockroach has actually had a complicated history with Amazon, particularly when<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/09/aws-gives-open-source-the-middle-finger/"> Amazon played fast and loose</a> with open source licenses, and several companies like Cockroach, Elastic and MongoDB changed their approach to licensing to protect against Amazon&#8217;s encroachment.</p>
<p>Today, however, the company sees Amazon much more as a partner, using Amazon&#8217;s services in-house, hosting its SaaS version on Amazon and even having Amazon as a go-to market partner where Amazon sells Cockroach to its customers when appropriate.</p>
<p>The company is focussed on keeping the momentum going while expanding the product family, and the new cash should help. Kimball reckons he has at least 3-4 years of runway with this round, and it&#8217;s a hedge against an economic downturn and money getting tighter (although there is clearly no sign of that at the moment).</p>
<p>Kimball expects this could be the last round the company raises, although he left the door open to raise more if the right opportunity presented itself. As for the future, he says that from day one his goal has been to be a public company and that could be the next step.</p>
<p>&#8220;​​So that&#8217;s our expectation. Certainly our TAM (total addressable market) is big enough and our growth points to it. What we&#8217;re looking at now as a management team is what will it take to get there,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company hired a CFO this year, often the first step before going public, so all the signals are there &#8212; the big round, the flashy valuation, the growth trajectory, the new CFO &#8212; the company just needs to decide when the time is right.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Enterprise SaaS for measuring company carbon emission is hot. Only recently Planetly was acquired by OneTrust for an undisclosed amount. And there are plenty of other startups in the space such as Plan A, Watershed, and Emitwise, all with their own take on the market.</p>
<p>Now France-based <a href="https://www.sweep.net/">Sweep</a>, which targets carbon management in large enterprises at the FTSE 500 level, is aiming to pull ahead of the pack with a $22 million Series A funding round &#8211; one of the largest to date compared with others in the space. The Uk’s Balderton Capital led the round, with participation from New Wave, La Famiglia and 2050. The company has now raised a total of $27 million, less than a year since its launch. </p>
<p>Sweep is pushing at an open door. Last month, BCG <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/over-90-of-firms-aren-t-measuring-emissions-correctly-bcg-says">reported</a> that over 90% of companies aren’t measuring their emissions accurately and regularly. As ESGs and carbon ramp up the corporate agenda, companies are scrambling for solutions, especially in light of the <a href="https://www.ipe.com/news/possible-ifrs-sustainability-standards-board-announcement-at-cop26/10050496.article">coming sustainable reporting regulations</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248663" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Rachel Delacour, CEO and co-founder of Sweep said: “Our enterprise-grade tool is here to make carbon data collection, security and analysis seamless and automated, so companies focus on reducing their carbon footprint and contributing to global net-zero efforts.” <br />
 <br />
Bernard Liautaud, Managing Partner at Balderton Capital, has joined Sweep’s board of directors. “Sustainability is a huge priority for us at Balderton and Sweep&#8217;s mission and vision are perfectly aligned with our Sustainable Future Goals. When we looked at the market, we were incredibly impressed with the strength of Sweep&#8217;s team, and the thoughtfulness and maturity of their product.” </p>
<p>Sweep, now an official B-Corp, was one of the few companies selected to present at COP26 at the UK Cabinet Office’s Tech for Our Planet <a href="https://together-for-our-planet.ukcop26.org/tech-for-our-planet/">program</a>.</p>
<p>It also worked with French investment bank Bpifrance to measure the footprints of two companies it’s investing in: telecommunications firm Orange and education tech company Openclassrooms.</p>
<p>Delacour was previously the co-founder of BIME Analytics which was acquired by Zendesk for $45M. Speaking to TechCrunch she added: “Carbon is a network problem. In addition to tracking and analyzing the right data, a company needs to engage with all the stakeholders contributing to its footprint, from a partner selecting manufacturing materials to staff turning off machines at night. To reach their climate goals, companies must continually track all the activities that make up their total carbon emissions, including those falling into Scope 3. The bigger the network, the bigger the impact. That’s why we’ve built Sweep to connect all stakeholders across the value chain, so they can work together to take reduction action efficiently.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to online payments, the front end of the system has seen a massive amount of disruption in the last several years, with companies like Stripe, Adyen, PayPal, Square and others building APIs that make it very simple for online merchants to integrate easy payment services into their checkout flows. But when it comes to the backend, the rails other tech used to actually pass on payment information and make the transactions are more often than not decades old.</p>
<p>Now that, too is starting to change: today, a company called <a href="https://www.silverflow.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silverflow</a> that&#8217;s built a new take on one aspect of that, with an API to enable data-based payment processing, is announcing $17 million in funding to capitalize on interest that it is seeing for its technology among payment service providers. The company, based in Amsterdam, is also going to use the investment to fuel its expansion to the U.S.</p>
<p>The crux of what it is doing is providing a super-charged alternative to legacy processing systems, with a wider scope for additional services wrapped around the payments, by rebuilding them as data-based networks in the cloud.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248649" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Payments processing technology has changed over the last decade,&#8221; Anne Willem de Vries, the CEO, said in an interview. &#8220;The cost of bandwidth has gone down tremendously. Older networks were not designed as data systems; they were designed to be efficient. But those limitations are no longer there, and in the data cloud we can do more. So that gives us a good opportunity to innovate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Series A is being led by Coatue Management, with past backers Crane Venture Partners and INKEF Capital, as well as new backer Global Paytech Ventures, also participating. The round also includes endorsement (and cash) from individuals that have made names for themselves in the payments business, including Jason Gardner, the founder and CEO of Marqeta, and Gokul Rajaram, the former head of product for Square who is now a board member at Coinbase. Silverflow is not currently disclosing its valuation, nor too many details about its customer base &#8212; it targets payment service providers, acquirers and large merchants building their own payment services &#8212; except to note that Deutsche Bank is among a handful of current customers and that it will be adding three more customers soon.</p>
<p>Founded by De Vries, Robert Kraal (CBDO), and Paul Buying (CTO), De Vries and Kraal previously worked together at Adyen, the Dutch digital payments powerhouse, where the former was running card acquiring and processing services and the latter was the company&#8217;s COO.</p>
<p>Although the two conceded that Adyen is one of the few companies that&#8217;s been tackling the payment processing space with a new approach, by and large they could see that the rest of the industry was running on legacy systems, which were slow, prone to a lot of downtime, and generally not fit for purpose. In the modern world, transactions are essentially just one aspect payments; equally important is the data that comes with that transaction, useful for accounting, for business intelligence, analytics, and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p6">&#8220;We’ve built a brand new cloud native platform for payment companies,&#8221; said De Vries. &#8220;Payment service providers and the retailers using them want more insights into data, risk management, loyalty and more. We can deliver these new functionalities quicker and more easily than legacy providers. We are replacing those legacy payment processors in the payment stack.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p6">Starting first with Visa and Mastercard transactions, the plan will be to extend to all card issuers over time. And then, potentially, to other kinds of payments: it&#8217;s a very fragmented and highly localized space, but Kraal said that overall cards are still the biggest and most-used common ground among them.</p>
<p class="p2">&#8220;The Founder-market fit is the first thing we noted when looking at the Silverflow team,&#8221; said Michael Gilroy, a general partner at Coatue, in a statement. &#8220;The depth of experience within payments gives this team a unique perspective from which to solve a problem plaguing the industry – outdated infrastructure. The platform is built for the payments industry of today, and has the scalability, flexibility and usability its partners need.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Parliament has agreed its negotiating position on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">draft legislation</a> to put limits on how Big Tech can operate with the aim of rebooting competition and fair dealing in digital markets.</p>
<p>The proposal also takes aim at so-called &#8216;killer acquisitions&#8217; where powerful platforms buy up smaller rivals or startups to choke off alternative services before they have a chance to scale, limiting competition and consumer choice.</p>
<p>MEPs overwhelmingly backed the legislative plan in a plenary vote yesterday &#8212; while also adding their own tweaks, including pushing provisions intended to tackle damaging default settings.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248611" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The European Council, the body made up of Member States&#8217; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">representatives, decided its negotiating position last month &#8212; meaning action now moves to trilogue discussions between the EU&#8217;s co-legislators in January, overseen by the French who hold the rotating Council presidency.</span></p>
<p>France <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/future-eu/news/macron-presents-frances-eu-council-presidency-priorities/">has said</a> that passing the legislation package is one of its digital priorities for the Council presidency.</p>
<h2>Big backing for tackling big tech</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/docs_autres_institutions/commission_europeenne/com/2020/0842/COM_COM(2020)0842_EN.pdf">Digital Markets Act </a>(DMA) was presented as a draft proposal by the Commission <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">a year ago</a>, alongside the Digital Services Act (DSA) &#8212; a broader update of the bloc&#8217;s ecommerce rules which also contains some requirements solely aimed at larger platforms, along with provisions that apply across the board to the in-scope digital services.</p>
<p>So while the DSA is expected to require time for all side to reach a compromise (and won&#8217;t now face a plenary vote until January), the DMA has been moving at a fair clip through the EU&#8217;s co-legislative process &#8212; as regional lawmakers find plenty of common ground over the need to rein in Big Tech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With the DMA, the bloc&#8217;s lawmakers are responding to concerns that the biggest tech companies hold an overly commanding &#8216;gatekeeper&#8217; role over digital markets and Internet users which has led to abusive business practices that harm competition and exploit consumers.</p>
<p>The Commission drew on its experience of antitrust enforcement against tech giants like Google in shaping the draft proposal &#8212; which has faced a string of penalties in the EU in recent years.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">EU lawmakers&#8217; hope is that a list of upfront &#8216;dos and don&#8217;ts&#8217; for tech giants &#8212; combined with centralized enforcement by the Commission itself &#8212; will be able to reset digital markets and ensure they are fair and open. </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s notable that the text approved by a plenary vote of the Parliament yesterday received 642 votes in favour, 8 against and 46 abstentions &#8212; suggesting there is broad backing across the political spectrum for clipping the wings of Big Tech.</p>
<p>For a little comparative context, <a href="https://www.euroforum.de/edpd/eu-parliament-eprivacy-regulation/">back in 2017</a>, a plenary vote in the Parliament on a different piece of digital legislation &#8212; the ePrivacy Regulation &#8212; draw far less support, with of the (then) 618 MEPs only 318 voting for the draft proposal vs 280 voting against. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, the ePrivacy update remains stalled even now.</p>
<p>Progress on updating ePrivacy has been blocked by ferocious lobbying from a number of sectors &#8212; and also by tech giants such as Google who, in a July 31, 2019 memo which recently came to light via antitrust litigation in the US, can be seen congratulating itself on its &#8220;success&#8221; at &#8220;slowing down and delaying&#8221; the regulation, including by &#8220;working behind the scenes hand in hand with the other [tech giants]&#8221;.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s perhaps rather fitting that the giants that make up &#8216;GAFAM&#8217; (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft) are now facing bespoke legislation aimed at reducing their market power and &#8212; ultimately &#8212; shrinking how much resource they have to lobby against laws they&#8217;d prefer not to exist.</p>
<p>Certainly it looks like a smart move by the Commission to put the DMA and DSA into separate legislative packages.</p>
<p>That has made it harder for tech giants to resort to their typical astroturfing techniques &#8212; whereby they draw on an extensive, opaque network of industry associations and thinktanks they help fund, cloaking direct lobbying against tighter regulation of their own business models by projecting their talking points through a litany of worthy sounding third parties.</p>

<h2>MEPs target damaging defaults</h2>
<p>MEPs have tweaked the Commission proposal in a number of ways &#8212; expanding the scope of the DMA so it will also apply to web browsers, virtual assistants and connected TVs, in addition to the original blend of online intermediation services, social networks, search engines, operating systems, online advertising services, cloud computing, and video-sharing services &#8212; or rather the subset of those companies that meet the relevant criteria to be designated “gatekeepers”.</p>
<p>Parliamentarians also beefed up the criteria for being designated a gatekeeper &#8212; increasing the quantitative thresholds to €8BN in annual turnover in the European Economic Area (EEA) and a market cap of €80BN. Which may be intended to avoid fewer European tech giants from falling into scope (e.g. Spotify).</p>
<p>To be considered gatekeepers under the DMA a company must also provide a core platform service in at least three EU countries and have at least 45M monthly end users, and/or 10,000+ business users.</p>

<p>The parliament gave it fulsome support to the roster of changes voted on by the IMCO committee <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/ep-imco-dma-vote/">last month</a> &#8212; which also includes restrictions on killer acquisitions in the case of systematic non-compliance; additional requirements on the use of data for targeted or micro-targeted advertising (but not a full prohibition on tracking-based ads, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-a-european-push-to-outlaw-creepy-ads/">some MEPs have been pushing for</a>); and some interesting looking interoperability provisions.</p>
<p>MEPs want users to have the option to be able to uninstall pre-installed software applications that big tech bundles with a core platform service &#8212; and crucially want that to be possible &#8220;at any stage&#8221;.</p>
<p>A number of Google search engine rivals had been pressing MEPs to beef up the DMA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/europes-final-push-on-the-digital-markets-act-must-include-default-settings/">to tackle damaging default settings</a>.</p>
<p>And in a <a href="https://twitter.com/yegg/status/1471113867493265419">tweet</a> yesterday DuckDuckGo founder, Gabe Weinberg, said the parliament had taken &#8220;a big step&#8221; by introducing what he billed as &#8220;a choice screen mandate&#8221; to the DMA&#8217;s mix.</p>
<p>In recent years, the non-tracking Google search engine rival has been pressing for regulatory intervention to ensure <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/duckduckgo-presses-the-case-for-true-one-click-search-competition-on-android/">true &#8220;one-click&#8221; competition</a>, arguing that regulation must ensure tech giants don&#8217;t simply stack the deck by making it ridiculously convoluted for users to switch away from their own services.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re now looking forward to the final stage of talks. If done right, the DMA will let people more easily choose their search engine default,&#8221; Weinberg added.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement on the plenary vote, DMA rapporteur and MEP Andreas Schwab, said: “Today’s adoption of the DMA negotiating mandate sends a strong signal: The European Parliament stands against unfair business practices used by digital giants. We will make sure that digital markets are open and competitive. This is good for consumers, good for businesses and good for digital innovation. Our message is clear: The EU will enforce the rules of the social market economy also in the digital sphere, and this means that lawmakers dictate the rules of competition, not digital giants.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With e-commerce becoming increasingly globalized, a company called <a href="https://www.taxdoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taxdoo</a>, which builds API-based tools to help e-commerce companies with tax compliance and other accounting needs, is announcing a round of funding: $64 million, a Series B that the Hamburg-based startup will be using to expand further across Europe and to build what it describes as the financial operating system for e-commerce businesses.</p>
<p class="p5">&#8220;We&#8217;re already helping customers shave off hours of manual [sales tax] work, and with newer features like pro forma invoices for tax compliance, we’ve built a lot of adjacent features,&#8221; said CEO Christian Königsheim in an interivew. &#8220;The long-term vision is that we want to enable our customers to have their financial data accelerate their growth rather than holding them back. We want to give them competitive edge by automating tedious tasks, so that they don&#8217;t have to pay that much attention to compliance and regulation. We see this as a financial operating system for commerce.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Tiger Global &#8212; part of the VC&#8217;s very aggressive foray into backing European startups &#8212; with previous backers Accel, Visionaries Club, and 20VC also participating. Taxdoo last announced funding less than a year ago &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/taxdoo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a $21 million Series A</a> &#8212; so this brings the total raised by it now to $84 million. I understand from sources close to the company that the valuation is now just north of $350 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248616" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Co-founded by three economics PhDs &#8212; Matthias Allmendinger, Roger Gothmann and Christian Königsheim &#8212; the three were doing research into VAT. They saw how complex sales tax regimes were for average merchants to follow, but they also identified that there was probably a way to solve that with automation technology.</p>
<p>The three have been very hands-on with how the company has developed and grown that vision: I mentioned to Königsheim that when he was talking to me it sounded like he was reading out his company&#8217;s press release &#8212; <em>not</em> what you want to happen when you&#8217;re interviewing someone! But it turned out that he actually wrote that press release himself, hence the identical cadence and diction. (I joked that he might have others on the team dedicated to doing that kind of work these days, he replied that he saw it as his &#8220;victory lap&#8221; after working so hard on closing the round.)</p>
<p>Taxdoo very much made its name around providing a set of APIs that European e-commerce companies, or really any organization doing business online, could use to calculate VAT (sales tax) and to track it to meet accounting compliance requirements. It currently works with over 1,700 marketplaces, online merchants, and enterprises, integrating with the platforms that they use in turn to sell online. (These include ERP providers like Xentral, as well as e-commerce site builders like Shopify, payment platforms like Afterbuy and marketplaces like eBay and Amazon.)</p>
<p>As e-commerce has continued to grow, so too have both the complexity of accounting around it, and the scrutiny of the space by financial regulators.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the accounting side, one of Taxdoo&#8217;s tools, for example, allows companies to automatically query and pull out transaction data needed to calculate VAT (some transactions are exempt, so that makes it more complicated). Another can pull records and send them for individual filing across different countries or tax juridictions.</p>
<p>On the regulatory front, new rules coming into force have presented more opportunities for Taxdoo to expand its own scope of services. Its APIs now include, in addition to a wider set of VAT calculators, tools to manage accounting and invoicing. It also has opened its platform so that third-party developers can build their own tools on top of Taxdoo for customers to use to fit their specific needs (Xentral is an example of one of the developers building apps on top of Taxdoo to make it easier to use the two platforms together).</p>
<p class="p3">This is dry work, and for many definitely not the most visible part of building an e-commerce business, but it&#8217;s essential, and hard, to get right. This also makes the company an attractive partner &#8212; or even target &#8212; for ambitious fintech companies that are building one-stop shops to service online businesses with all of their payment and financial needs. (Case in point, Stripe has made acquisitions and launched a new suite of services aimed to help calculate sales tax for its customers. It seems that a logical next step would be to dive deeper into accounting around those tax calculations.)</p>
<p>“Taxdoo is tackling the largest pain points faced today by e-commerce merchants and marketplaces,&#8221; said John Curtius, partner at Tiger Global, in a statement. &#8220;Taxdoo&#8217;s team uniquely combines deep expertise in e-commerce, automation, tax, accounting, and finance — along with a pervasive customer centricity. We’re excited to support Taxdoo in building the Financial Operating System for e-commerce.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Activity around African venture capital firms raising funds continues to increase as we head towards the end of the year. I</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n the latest development, Abuja- and Lagos-based <a href="https://venturesplatform.com/">Ventures Platform</a> is today announcing the first close of its $40 million pan-African fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund, founded by one of Nigeria’s most active early-stage investors, <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/kola-aina-vp">Kola Aina</a>, has made 69 investments since 2016</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Ventures Platform&#8217;s news is also coming a day after another pan-African VC firm 4DX Ventures secured the final close of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/4dx-ventures-closes-second-fund-with-60m-adds-dikembe-mutombo-as-senior-advisor/">$60 million fund</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aina, the firm’s founding and general partner, told TechCrunch on a call that when he started the firm, he used his own money for the first set of investments made</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Subsequently, Ventures Platform experimented with an accelerator model, where it gave out standardized checks of $20,000 to pre-seed to seed-stage startups in exchange for 10% equity.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248348" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, the firm took outside capital for the first time and formed syndicates. Within this two-year period, some</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the startups it invested in included Piggyvest, Paystack, Kudi and Thrive Agric</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">wanted to perfect our style of finding high-performing companies early before they become obvious and backing them with everything we bring to the table from our experience as operators ourselves,” Aina told TechCrunch over a call. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We didn’t want to go out and try to fundraise when we didn’t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have evidence that we could make money out of this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year October, Ventures Platform became one of the local investors that cashed out from<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/"> Paystack’s $200 million+ exit to Stripe</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With a few other secondary exits under its belt, Aina said he felt this was the perfect time for the firm “to go to the market and raise its first institutional fund.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first close of Ventures Platform’s first institutional fund </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is undisclosed but</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Aina noted that “it is a sizeable amount</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, most of the limited partners (LPs) involved are Nigerian- and African-based, which speaks to the growth in capacity of local investors in funding the region’s most innovative companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paystack CEO Shola Akinlade is one of the firm&#8217;s individual LPs which also includes Gbenga Oyebode. Others involved are organizations such as the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA), UAC Nigeria (its first time allocating to a VC) and VFD Group; and global investors such as Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel and Adam Draper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">proud that for this first close, a large part of our capital came from local funding. I gave a TED Talk titled ‘who would own our future unicorns’ and I’m so proud of this because it seems Africans are answering loud and clear that we would own them too. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this was a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nice mix of Nigerian corporates, family offices, institutions, as well as global investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ventures Platform was deliberate about wanting local capital in this fund, said Aina. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For us, it was strategic, getting local capital for our first close. But the second close, as you will see, will be from global fund of funds and DFIs where we’ve got commitments. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, ultimately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as much as foreign capital is critical, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it’s in the interest of foreign capital to be in bed with local capital from a derisking standpoint.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ventures Platform sees itself as a thesis-centred fund. Aina said the fund’s thesis </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is centred</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around funding market-creating innovations that solve non-consumption and create innovative new ways to deliver goods and services or services to low-income markets. The firm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is focused</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on six core verticals: fintech, edtech, agritech and food science, healthtech and bioscience, enterprise SaaS and digital infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the pan-African firm relied on syndicate and proprietary capital funds in the earlier stages of its lifecycle, it couldn’t take on follow-on rounds in its portfolio companies which also includes the likes of Tiger-backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/tiger-global-backs-african-fintech-mono-in-15m-series-a-round/">Mono</a>, SeamlessHR, PayHippo and Migo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These startups have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">cumulatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised more than $500 million in follow-on rounds, and Aina notes that his firm is keen on participating now that it has secured the first close of this fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a pretty robust pipeline of companies that we’ll be looking at across the continent, as well as our portfolio companies that have raised new rounds of financing. We’re looking for interesting companies that fit our thesis and what’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">compelling now is that we have a follow on capital to fund them,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ventures Platform </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focused on pre-seed and seed with an average check size of $50,000. But this new fund equips Ventures Platform to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">participate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Series A deals where it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be able to invest more than $1 million in a single company (including follow-on rounds)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Abuja-based venture capital firm is also deepening its activity in other countries outside Nigeria &#8212; Kenya’s MarketForce and Tambua Health, Zambia’s Union54 and Egypt’s MoneyHash to name a few. The firm plans to invest more in these regions and Francophone Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the firm’s 69 companies, 30% have passed through Y Combinator. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aina says that while part of this success can be attributed to Y</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">C being a partner, he believes his firm has a knack for picking quality companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;One of Nigeria&#8217;s high-profile angel investors is launching a fund for African startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/one-of-nigerias-high-profile-angel-investors-is-launching-a-fund-for-african-startups/embed/#?secret=6D15yNTPE8" data-secret="6D15yNTPE8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only a few venture capital firms in the Nigerian and African tech ecosystem can boast similar YC stats with Ventures Platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For startups, being part of these firms’ portfolios represents a marker of success, but some VC critics believe these sorts of numbers are assured for firms that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">employ</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2012/01/24/the-3-key-limitations-of-spray-and-pray-seed-investors/">spray and pray</a>” tactics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aina defends his firm, saying that as an “early-stage discovery fund,” Ventures Platform’s role involves identifying many companies to back early and invest in subsequent rounds of a few. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> every fund has its strategy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because of the stage at which we invest, a key part of our strategy is to fund a large batch of companies at the pre-seed stage, and what you see is that the funnel would narrow as time goes on. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this new fund, we now can double down on our winners, which is good for the companies and also good for us at the point of exit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ventures Platform said it would onboard well-known figures across African tech as venture partners as part of a move to deepen its expertise further. The first and only disclosed partner for now is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/senisulyman">Seni Sulyman</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the former vice president of global operations at Andela and CEO of BlackOps, a talent marketplace for African venture builders and operators</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
