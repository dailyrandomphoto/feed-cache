										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At AWS&#8217;s re:Invent conference this morning, the company announced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/aws-iot-twinmaker-build-digital-twins/">AWS IoT TwinMaker</a>, a new service that makes it easy to create and use digital twins of real-world systems<span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">.</span></p>
<p>For context, digital twins are virtual representations of things like buildings, factories, production lines, and equipment that are regularly updated with real-world data to mimic the behavior of the systems they represent.</p>
<p>The company outlines that with this new service, users can create digital twins by connecting data from sources like video feeds and applications without having to move the data into a single repository.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240946" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;You can use built-in data connectors for the following AWS services: AWS IoT SiteWise for equipment and time-series sensor data; Amazon Kinesis Video Streams for video data; and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) for storage of visual resources (for example, CAD files) and data from business applications. AWS IoT TwinMaker also provides a framework for you to create your own data connectors to use with other data sources (such as Snowflake and Siemens MindSphere),&#8221; AWS explained in a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/aws-iot-twinmaker-build-digital-twins/">blog post</a> about the new service.</p>
<p>The company notes that once the digital twin graph is created, users will likely want to visualize the data in the context of the physical environment. To address this, AWS IoT TwinMaker creates a digital twin graph that combines the relationships between virtual representations of users&#8217; physical systems and connected data sources. This allows users to accurately model their real-world environment. Users can also import existing 3D models to arrange 3D scenes of physical space, such as a factory. From there, you can also add interactive video and sensor data overlays along with insights from connected machine learning services.</p>
<p>AWS notes that the service comes with a plugin for Amazon Managed Grafana, which is a managed service for the open dashboard and visualization platform from Grafana Labs.</p>
<p>AWS IoT TwinMaker is available today in preview in Northern Virginia, Oregon, Ireland and Singapore, with availability in additional AWS Regions to come.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook parent company Meta is losing its top crypto executive later this year.</p>
<p>David Marcus who leads crypto unit Novi and previously helmed the company&#8217;s Messenger unit, announced Tuesday that he will be leaving the company later this year. Marcus joined Facebook in 2014. His departure marks another major exit from a long-time Facebook executive &#8212; in September, Facebook CTO Mike Scroepfer announced he was stepping down from his role after 13 years at the company.</p>
<p>Former Upwork CEO Stephane Kasriel who previously worked as the Head of Product for Novi will be taking over Marcus&#8217;s role at the top of the org.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240936" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Marcus has long been an important figure in the crypto community since his days as President of PayPal where he was among the first crop of tech leaders to embrace bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Marcus has previously served on the board of Coinbase.</p>
<p>His tenure leading crypto at Facebook has mostly been marred by setbacks as the company&#8217;s Diem cryptocurrency project has encountered widespread industry and regulatory pushback which have led the company to scale back the pace at which it rolled out new efforts in the crypto space. Earlier this year, the company launched a small pilot of its cryptocurrency wallet Novi allowing users in the United States and Guatemala to exchange &#8220;stablecoin&#8221; cryptocurrencies using the app.</p>
<p>Marcus hints that he may soon be starting his own venture.</p>
<p>&#8220;While there’s still so much to do right on the heels of launching Novi — and I remain as passionate as ever about the need for change in our payments and financial systems — my entrepreneurial DNA has been nudging me for too many mornings in a row to continue ignoring it,&#8221; Marcus wrote in a tweet thread.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AWS today <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-amazon-sagemaker-canvas-a-visual-no-code-machine-learning-capability-for-business-analysts/">announced</a> a new machine learning service, Amazon SageMaker Canvas. Unlike its existing machine learning services, the target audience here isn&#8217;t highly technical data scientists and engineers but any engineer or business user inside a company. The promise of SageMaker Canvas is that it will allow anybody to build machine learning prediction models, using a point-and-click interface.</p>
<p>If that sounds familiar, it may be because Azure and others offer similar tools, though AWS may have the advantage that a lot of companies already store all of their data in AWS anyway.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240944" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240944" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2240944" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sagemaker-canvas.png?w=680" alt="Amazon SageMaker Canvas screen shot." width="680" height="377" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sagemaker-canvas.png 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sagemaker-canvas.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sagemaker-canvas.png?resize=300,166 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sagemaker-canvas.png?resize=768,425 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sagemaker-canvas.png?resize=680,377 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sagemaker-canvas.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240944" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240927" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;SageMaker Canvas leverages the same technology as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">Amazon SageMaker</a> to automatically clean and combine your data, create hundreds of models under the hood, select the best performing one, and generate new individual or batch predictions,&#8221; writes AWS&#8217;s Alex Casalboni in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;It supports multiple problem types such as binary classification, multi-class classification, numerical regression, and time series forecasting. These problem types let you address business-critical use cases, such as fraud detection, churn reduction, and inventory optimization, without writing a single line of code.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the service is backed by SageMaker, AWS&#8217;s fully managed machine learning service.</p>
<p>The general idea here is that users can use any dataset, down to a basic CSV file, and then decide which of the columns in this dataset Canvas should predict. There&#8217;s no need to worry about how to train this model. Yet while this is a far easier user experience that using traditional ML tools, we&#8217;re still not quite talking drag-and-drop either. This is AWS, after all. The overall experience is more akin to working in the AWS console than a modern no-code application.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its re:Invent conference, AWS today announced that four of its cloud-based analytics services, Amazon Redshift, Amazon EMR, Amazon MSK and Amazon Kinesis, are now available as serverless and on-demand services. That&#8217;s something AWS&#8217;s customers have been asking for, AWS CEO Adam Selipsky said in today&#8217;s keynote. These new services are now available as public previews.</p>
<p>As Selipsky argued, some AWS competitors may argue that one database can just do it all, but he argues that different workloads need the right databases to back them &#8212; and he argued that the same is true for analytics services. But customers also don&#8217;t want to have to worry about the infrastructure that comes with running these services &#8212; and in addition to doing away with having to manage clusters, users will also only have to pay for the resources they use. For <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-redshift-serverless-run-analytics-at-any-scale-without-having-to-manage-infrastructure/">Redshift</a>, for example, that means uses will only pay when the data warehouse is in use, not when it sits idle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amazon Redshift Serverless automatically provisions the right compute resources for you to get started,&#8221; AWS&#8217;s Danilo Poccia explains in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;As your demand evolves with more concurrent users and new workloads, your data warehouse scales seamlessly and automatically to adapt to the changes. You can optionally specify the base data warehouse size to have additional control on cost and application-specific SLAs.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240901" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Similary, Kinesis, AWS&#8217;s service for handling streaming data, now offers a fully managed on-demand mode. With this new capacity mode, the sevice can automatically scale according to data traffic.</p>
<p>With this move today, AWS is clearly reacting to market pressure. A lot of its competitors now offer similar serverless analytics offerings, as do a number of well-funded startups.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more companies move to custom silicon for their customer&#8217;s workloads, Amazon has been busy on this front. They introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/aws-launches-its-custom-inferentia-inferencing-chips/">the Inferentia chip</a> in 2019 to help speed up inference learning. Then last year the company launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/aws-launches-trainium-its-new-custom-ml-training-chip/">a second Trainium chip</a>, designed specifically for machine learning models. Today, AWS continued to build on this previous work, introducing its latest machine learning chip, the Trn1.</p>
<p>Adam Selipsky, delivering his first AWS re:Invent keynote, dispatched the news about the latest chip on stage in Las Vegas this morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;So today, I&#8217;m excited to announce the new Trn1 instance powered by Trainium, which we expect to deliver the best price-performance for training deep learning models in the cloud and the fastest on EC2,&#8221; Selipsky told the re:Invent audience.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240913" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Trn1 is the first EC2 instance with up to 800 gigabytes per second bandwidth. So it&#8217;s absolutely great for large scale, multi node distributed training use cases.&#8221; He said that this should work well for use cases like image recognition, natural language processing, fraud detection and forecasting.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, you can network these chips together for even more powerful performance when they put them into &#8220;ultra clusters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can network these together and what we call Ultra clusters consisting of tens of thousands of training accelerators interconnected with petabyte scale networking. These training Ultra clusters are powered by a powerful machine learning supercomputer for rapidly training the most complex, deep learning models with trillions of parameters,&#8221; Selipsky said.</p>
<p>The company also plans to work with partners like SAP to take advantage of this new processing power, Selipsky said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At Amazon’s <a href="https://live.awsevents.com/reinvent2021keynote-us/">AWS re:Invent conference</a> this morning, the company announced the preview of &#8220;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/preview-aws-private-5g/">AWS Private 5G</a>,&#8221; which is a new service that aims to make it easy to deploy and manage your own private network. The launch is meant to address the challenges companies are facing with leveraging 5G. AWS CEO Adam Selipsky said that with AWS Private 5G, you can set up and scale a private mobile network in days instead of months.</p>
<p>&#8220;You get all the goodness of mobile technology without the pain of long planning cycles, complex integrations and the high upfront costs,&#8221; Selipsky stated during the company&#8217;s keynote. &#8220;You tell us where you want to build your network and specify the network capacity. We ship you all the required hardware, the software and the SIM cards.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selipsky outlined that AWS Private 5G automates the setup and deployment of the network and scales capacity on-demand to support additional devices and increased network traffic. There are no upfront fees or per-device costs with AWS Private 5G, and customers pay only for the network capacity and throughput they request.</p>
<p>&#8220;Customers want to build their own private 5G networks to address these limitations, but private mobile network deployments require customers to invest considerable time, money, and effort to design their network for anticipated peak capacity, and procure and integrate software and hardware components from multiple vendors. Even if customers are able to get the network running, current private mobile network pricing models charge for each connected device and make it cost prohibitive for use cases that involve thousands of connected devices,&#8221; the company said in a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/preview-aws-private-5g/">blog post</a> about the new service.</p>
<div class="aws-text-box">
<div>
<p>Amazon outlines that AWS Private 5G simplifies deployment allowing customers to deploy their own 4G/LTE or 5G quickly, scale up and down the number of connected devices rapidly, and benefit from a familiar on-demand cloud pricing model.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startups are often questions: <em>What</em> <em>if</em> we did things in a new way, instead of the way we have been?</p>
<p><a href="https://joinmassive.com/">Massive</a> is a good example of the genre: What if users could pay for apps or services not with money or attention, but with their spare compute power?</p>
<p>The general concept of distributed compute power sourced from individuals is not new. Anyone familiar with <a href="https://setiathome.berkeley.edu/">the SETI screensaver</a> has seen similar work before. But what Massive is building could take a somewhat known idea and bring it into the modern world as an alternative to charging users or pounding them with advertisements to generate revenue.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240788" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Massive announced an $11 million round this morning, led by Point72 Ventures with participation from crypto-themed entities, including CoinShares Ventures and Coinbase Ventures. Several angels also participated in the funding event.</p>
<p>The model is interesting, and Massive&#8217;s funding round is an indication that it has found some market traction. So, we get the company on the horn to learn more.</p>
<p>Massive <a href="https://twitter.com/mrjasongrad">co-founder and CEO Jason Grad</a> described the startup&#8217;s work as something akin to an Airbnb or Turo for users&#8217; computers, comparing its service to some of the more popular consumer-sharing startups that folks already know.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a reasonable comparison. Some 50,000 desktop computer users &#8212; nodes, in the company&#8217;s parlance &#8212; have opted into its service. Which is white hat, it goes without saying. Given that Massive is asking for compute power, it will have constant work to do to ensure that it is a good steward of user trust and partner selection; no one wants their spare CPU cycles to go to something illegal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has a good early stance toward caring for its nascent compute exchange, with a hard requirement of getting users to opt into its service before joining.</p>
<p>To start, Massive is working with crypto-focused companies. They have an obvious need for compute power, and the work they execute &#8212; running blockchain calculations &#8212; is monetized through block rewards and other fees, making them easy choices for partnerships. You can now see why the company&#8217;s investor list includes a number of crypto-focused venture capital firms.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s goal is broader, however. It wants to build a two-sided marketplace for compute power, Grad explained. That means lots more users offering up a slice of their computing power, future acceptance of mobile devices, and a broader partner list.</p>
<p>Part of the company&#8217;s perspective is rooted in the belief that the dominant business models of the internet today are lacking. &#8220;Shit,&#8221; to quote Grad directly.</p>
<p>He has a point. Today&#8217;s internet is a hybrid of free and lacking or paid and closed-access. The proliferation of paywalls wasn&#8217;t in the first draft of internet business models. But the ad inventory that most sites could offer wasn&#8217;t worth as much as expected, and with a few major platforms hoovering up a huge portion of the total online ad spend, there wasn&#8217;t enough money left over to pay for the rest. Hence, paywalls.</p>
<p>Perhaps Massive can get us back toward a more open web? I would trade a little compute time for more access to more things, frankly, provided that I have trust in the company sitting between me, and, say, a crypto-mining firm.</p>
<p>The company doesn&#8217;t think that its job is to replace revenues, however. Grad told TechCrunch that the company will be able to create revenue opportunities where they didn&#8217;t exist before, rather than supplant existing income streams. So, apps will still be paid for many folks, but in markets where payment can be hard to collect, for example, a compute-for-access trade could prove accretive for users and companies alike.</p>
<p>As we said up top, good startups are questions. For Massive, it is asking the market if there are enough users to build a large enough distributed computing base to offer enough aggregated power to entice companies to buy into service.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s find out!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At Amazon&#8217;s AWS re:Invent conference this morning, the company announced a new platform for mainframe migration and modernization called simply &#8220;AWS Mainframe Modernization,&#8221; which aims to help AWS customers get off their mainframes &#8220;as fast as they possibly can&#8221; in order to take better advantage of the cloud.</p>
<p>Today, customers may take a couple of different paths to get off their mainframes &#8212; either they take a &#8220;lift and shift&#8221; approach and bring their application pretty much as is, or they may refactor and break the application down as microservices in the cloud. But neither path is all that easy, and the process can take months or even years to complete as customers have to evaluate the complexity of the application&#8217;s source code, understand the dependencies on other systems, convert or recompile the code, and then everything has to be tested to make sure it all works.</p>
<p>&#8220;It can be a messy business and involves a lot of moving pieces. And it isn&#8217;t something that people really want to do on their own,&#8221; said Adam Selipsky, CEO of AWS, speaking at the press event. &#8220;And while AWS Partners can help with the transition, it can still take a long time,&#8221; he added.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240882" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new solution, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/introducing-aws-mainframe-modernization/">AWS Mainframe Modernization</a>, instead will make it faster to migrate, modernize and run mainframe applications on AWS. The company claims that it can cut the time it takes to move mainframe workloads to the cloud by as much as two-thirds, using its set of development, test, and deployment tools and a mainframe-compatible runtime environment. The solution will also help customers to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/migration-acceleration-program/mainframe/">assess and analyze</a> their mainframe applications for readiness then help them to choose which path they want to take &#8212; re-platforming or refactoring &#8212; and then comes up with a plan.</p>
<p>If the customer wants to replatform, the Mainframe Modernization solution will offer compilers to convert code as well as testing services to make sure no functionality is lost during the translation. If the customer wants to refactor or decompose the application &#8212; if the components could be run in EC2, in containers, or in Lambda, for instance &#8212; then they can use the Mainframe Modernization solution to automatically convert the COBOL code over to Java. A <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/migration-hub/">Migration Hub</a> lets customers track their migration progress across multiple AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mainframe/partner-solutions/">Partners</a> and solutions from a single location.</p>
<p>Amazon touts the system as being an agile and cost-efficient (with on-demand, pay-as-you-go resources) managed service that offers security and high availability, scalability, and elasticity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its annual re:Invent conference, AWS today announced the newest generation of its Arm-based Graviton processors: the Graviton 3. The company promises that the new chip will be 25 percent faster than the last-generation chips, with 2x faster floating-point performances and a 3x speedup for machine-learning workloads. AWS also promises that the new chips will use 60 percent less power.</p>
<p>These new chips will power the new EC2 C7g instances on the AWS cloud. These new instances will also be the first ones to use DDR5 memory, one of the reasons why the new instances will use less power. This new memory option will deliver 50 percent higher bandwidth than the DDR4 memory in the last generation of Graviton chips.</p>
<p>As AWS&#8217;s Jeff Barr notes in today&#8217;s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/join-the-preview-amazon-ec2-c7g-instances-powered-by-new-aws-graviton3-processors/">announcement</a>, these new chips and isntances should be quite useful for a wide variety of workloads, including compute-intensive &#8220;HPC, batch processing, electronic design automation (EDA), media encoding, scientific modeling, ad serving, distributed analytics, and CPU-based machine learning inferencing.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240833" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For now, these new chips are only available as a preview.</p>

<p>Not only is the Gen3 lighter and smaller than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/formula-e-gen2-evo-car-183000285.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><ins>the Gen2</ins></a>, Formula E and the Federation Internationale de l&#8217;Automobile (FIA) say that at least 40 percent of energy used in a race will be produced through regenerative braking. As such, Gen3 will be the first formula car without rear hydraulic brakes.</p>
<p>The Gen3 is also the first formula car with powertrains at both the front and the rear. The rear 350kW powertrain will be complemented by a 250kW one at the front. With a total of 600kW, they&#8217;ll more than double the regenerative capability of the Gen2.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240847" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In addition, the motor can provide up to 350kW of power (470 brake horsepower) and a top speed of 200mph. Formula E and the FIA say the power-to-weight ratio is twice as efficient as an equivalent combustion engine.</p>

<p>The Gen3 was designed for sustainability. It is net-zero carbon and broken carbon fiber parts will be recycled. Tires, meanwhile, will use 26 percent sustainable materials.</p>
<p>“In designing the Gen3 car, we set out to demonstrate that high performance, efficiency and sustainability can co-exist without compromise,&#8221; Formula E CEO Jamie Reigle said in a statement. &#8220;Together with the FIA, we have built the world’s most efficient and sustainable high performance race car. The Gen3 is our fastest, lightest, most powerful and efficient racing car yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Formula E hasn&#8217;t fully shown off the design of the Gen3 yet. It only released some teaser images. However, since teams will be testing the car in a few months, it shouldn&#8217;t be too long before we get a proper look at the vehicle.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.factorialenergy.com/">Factorial Energy</a>, a startup working on solid-state batteries for electric vehicles, has added two more major automakers to its investor sheet: Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis, both of which plan to co-develop batteries in separate joint collaboration agreements.</p>
<p>Mercedes, a brand of Daimler AG, said it invested a “double-digit million dollar” amount in Factorial. Stellantis declined to specify its investment. The news comes scarcely a month after Factorial announced a separate investment and partnership deal with Hyundai and Kia, to co-develop and test battery tech in Hyundai EVs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The first cell prototypes will likely be tested as early as next year. Looking longer-term, Mercedes aims to introduce the tech to series production within the next five years, and Stellantis wants to roll-out solid-state technology by 2026.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240762" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Many consider solid-state batteries to be the next forthcoming breakthrough in battery technology, not only for advantages in energy density but also safety. Liquid electrolyte solutions found in conventional batteries today are generally flammable, so solid-state batteries should pose less of a fire risk. Factorial says its technology, which includes a solid electrolyte material, increases range between 20% to 50%, relative to standard lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Bbu9z689Hq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/">Can solid state batteries power up for the next generation of EVs?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Can solid state batteries power up for the next generation of EVs?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/embed/#?secret=Bbu9z689Hq" data-secret="Bbu9z689Hq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The lure of a comparative battery advantage has proven irresistible to major automakers, who have poured billions into electrification and new startups that claim to be close to cracking the solid-state code. Factorial joins an increasingly competitive solid-state battery market, which until now has been populated chiefly by legacy battery makers like LG Chem, as well as new entrants like Quantumscape and Solid Power.</p>
<p>The latter two startups are also backed by major automakers. Quantumscape has received more than $300 million from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/16/volkswagen-sinks-another-200-million-into-solid-state-battery-company-quantumscape/">Volkswagen</a>, while Solid Power has landed backing from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/ford-bmw-lead-solid-powers-130m-series-b-round/">Ford and BMW</a>. This latest news from Factorial – which has garnered backing from three major automakers since emerging from stealth in April – is a sign that a new horse has entered the race.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[You can argue that HashiCorp deserves its 44x revenue run rate multiple, if you'd like. It wouldn't be impossible to make an argument that it's a bit rich, but this is 2021 and no one is doing that.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The HashiCorp IPO intends to shoot the narrows between Thanksgiving and Christmas, with its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001720671/000119312521342246/d205906ds1a.htm">first IPO pricing interval</a> set to give it among the richest valuations of any technology company with a strong open source component to its core business.</p>

<hr />
<p>In a recent S-1/A filing, the cloud infra management company indicated that it expects to sell shares in its public offering at a range of $68 to $72 apiece. That interval could move, of course, before the company prices. Nubank, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/is-nubanks-lower-ipo-pricing-bad-news-for-brazilian-startups/">reduced its IPO price range</a> this week ahead of its anticipated debut.</p>

The company&#8217;s debut, then, will put points on the board for more than just itself when it does trade. (For more on the company&#8217;s economics, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/hashicorps-ipo-filing-reveals-a-growing-business-but-at-a-slower-pace/">head here</a>.)</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about HashiCorp&#8217;s IPO valuation range, as well as how it stacks up to other public tech companies with robust revenue multiples.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s HashiCorp worth?</h2>
<p>HashiCorp&#8217;s IPO valuation at its current range can be calculated in one of two ways. The first employs a simple share count, or the number of shares that are currently anticipated to be outstanding after its debut. The second is a fully diluted share count, which includes shares that have been earned through options but not yet turned from pledges into shares.</p>
<p>The company expects to have 178,895,570 shares of Class A and B stock in circulation after its IPO. HashiCorp&#8217;s simple IPO share count rises to 181,190,570 if we count shares reserved for its underwriting entities.</p>
<p>Using the latter figure, at a $68 to $72 per-share IPO price interval, HashiCorp would be worth between $12.3 billion and $13.0 billion.</p>
<p>However, on a fully diluted basis, the company&#8217;s value is much higher. <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/89098/Cloud-infrastructure-platform-HashiCorp-sets-terms-for-$1.1-billion-IPO">Per Renaissance Capital</a>, at $70 per share, HashiCorp&#8217;s IPO, inclusive of a broader share count, would value it at $14.2 billion. Converting that to $72 per share, the company could be worth as much as $14.6 billion.</p>
<p>The unicorn was last valued at around $5 billion in March 2020, meaning its IPO pricing looks set to be a win.</p>

</ul>
<p>Now, about that giant cash payload. How can you find one for your startup? Start by spending time in these sessions where you can pick the brains of VCs who invest heavily in space tech — and write the ginormous checks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Fast Money, Team Space: Company Concept, Capital and</strong> <strong>Customer</strong> — Game-changing technology and entrepreneurial initiatives are the new space norm. However, a great technical design is not enough. Growing an idea across markets also takes capital and customers. Transitioning from concept to the development phase is more likely to succeed if a company obtains stable forms of capital and potential long-term customers. Harpoon Ventures’ Chris O’Connor focuses on a startup that identified the right venture partners to grow their business and secured opportunities to prototype and test their designs with the U.S. government.</p>
<p><strong>Backing the Brightest</strong> — There’s an art to later stage space company funding, especially as the exit picture for the sector is still only just starting to take shape. Tess Hatch (BVP), Shaun Maguire (Sequoia) and Lisa Rich (Hemisphere) discuss how they evaluate which companies are primed for growth.</p>
<p><strong>Being There When Stars Form</strong> — At the earliest stages, space companies are at their riskiest. But these investors are willing to wade in and write checks to help those companies gain their footing. Hear from Chad Anderson (Space Capital), Jonathan Fentzke (Techstars) and Jessica Robinson (Assembly Ventures) about how they pick their winners.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> takes place on December 14-15. Spare your budget — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#tickets">buy your pass</a> before <strong>the price goes up on December 3</strong> and save up to $100.</p>

It is an office subscription that gives employees access to a distributed network of office spaces, where the employer only pays for the actual use of the space through a payment as a service (PaaS) model. People can choose the closest space and book to use shared spaces, meeting rooms or private offices, according to Roberta Vasconcellos, CEO and co-founder of BeerOrCoffee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, customer i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Food offers the OfficePass benefit to its more than 4,500 employees and uses a total of 240 different spaces across 67 cities throughout Brazil. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the startup’s other clients are Itaú, Banco Inter, Creditas, QuintoAndar, Stellantis, Sodexo, MRV, Mapfre and Movile. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On one hand we improve people&#8217;s work/life balance and productivity and on the other, we optimize companies’ costs and time with an as a service model and centralize all their workspace management in a single dashboard,” she told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic, naturally, fueled the company’s growth as the world saw an increasingly distributed workforce. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We had a great leap in demand for our service,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Vasconcellos said. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re helping companies make the best use of workspaces and giving their employees the flexibility to work however they want.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That demand continues. In the third quarter of 2021, BeerOrCoffee said it saw the number of bookings made on its marketplace grow 243% compared to the previous quarter. It declined to reveal hard revenue figures, though.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2240542" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2240542" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2240542 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/beerorcoffee.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/beerorcoffee.jpg 953w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/beerorcoffee.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/beerorcoffee.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/beerorcoffee.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/beerorcoffee.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/beerorcoffee.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2240542" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BeerOrCoffee</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to OfficePass, the startup also offers private “hubs,” or office spaces, with flexible terms. The benefit to companies, it says, is that they don’t need to invest in infrastructure such as furniture, internet and cleaning. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BeerOrCoffee practices what it preaches. Its team (currently made up of 82 people) has operated in over five countries since day one, noted Vasconcellos. While it is currently focused on Brazil only, it eventually plans to expand across Latin America.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hernan Kazah, managing partner and co-founder of Kaszek, says his firm has “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">always been very impressed by the high-quality network of offices BeerOrCoffee was building and the great feedback they were getting” from some of its portfolio companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic convinced the firm that the trend towards a more flexible working model was here to stay so Kaszek reached out to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vasconcellos with interest in investing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s important to point out that BeerOrCoffee does not operate as a direct opponent with similar offerings such as coworking networks, noted Kazah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The co-working networks are partners and BeerOrCoffee is an asset light company,” he said. “As a marketplace, it does not own or directly operate its supply, but rather offer the product and technology necessary for its clients to find and manage their workspace and real estate solutions. This also allows them to bring new demand to the workspaces, providing a better and the cheapest channel of customer acquisition for them and allowing them to add value in their offering by being plugged into BeerOrCoffee’s network.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Civil society has been poring over the detail of the European Commission&#8217;s proposal for a risk-based framework for regulating applications of artificial intelligence which was proposed by the EU&#8217;s executive <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">back in April</a>.</p>
<p>The verdict of over a hundred civil society organizations is that the draft legislation falls far short of protecting fundamental rights from AI-fuelled harms like scaled discrimination and blackbox bias &#8212; and they&#8217;ve <a href="https://edri.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Political-statement-on-AI-Act.pdf">published a call for major revisions</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We specifically recognise that AI systems exacerbate structural imbalances of power, with harms often falling on the most marginalised in society. As such, this collective statement sets out the call of 11[5] civil society organisations towards an Artificial Intelligence Act that foregrounds fundamental rights,&#8221; they write, going on to identify nine &#8220;goals&#8221; (each with a variety of suggested revisions) in the full statement of recommendations.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240596" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Commission, which drafted the legislation, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/europe-sets-out-plan-to-boost-data-reuse-and-regulate-high-risk-ais/">billed the AI regulation</a> as a framework for &#8220;trustworthy&#8221;, &#8220;human-centric&#8221; artificial intelligence. However it risks veering rather closer to an enabling framework for data-driven abuse, per the civil society groups&#8217; analysis &#8212; given the lack of the essential checks and balances to actually prevent automated harms.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s statement was drafted by European Digital Rights (EDRi), Access Now, Panoptykon Foundation, epicenter.works, AlgorithmWatch, European Disability Forum (EDF), Bits of Freedom, Fair Trials, PICUM, and ANEC &#8212; and has been signed by a full 115 not-for-profits from across Europe and beyond.</p>
<p>The advocacy groups are hoping their recommendations will be picked up by the European Parliament and Council as the co-legislators continue debating &#8212; and amending &#8212; the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) proposal ahead of any final text being adopted and applied across the EU.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe lays out plan for risk-based AI rules to boost trust and uptake&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/embed/#?secret=12Yl150wPP" data-secret="12Yl150wPP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Key suggestions from the civil society organizations include the need for the regulation to be amended to have a flexible, future-proofed approach to assessing AI-fuelled risks &#8212; meaning it would allow for updates to the list of use-cases that are considered unacceptable (and therefore prohibited) and those that the regulation merely limits, as well as the ability to expand the (currently fixed) list of so-called &#8220;high risk&#8221; uses.</p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s proposal to categorizing AI risks is too &#8220;rigid&#8221; and poorly designed (the groups&#8217; statement literally calls it &#8220;dysfunctional&#8221;) to keep pace with fast-developing, iterating AI technologies and changing use cases for data-driven technologies, in the NGOs&#8217; view.</p>
<p>&#8220;This approach of ex ante designating AI systems to different risk categories does not consider that the level of risk also depends on the context in which a system is deployed and cannot be fully determined in advance,&#8221; they write. &#8220;Further, whilst the AIA includes a mechanism by which the list of ‘high-risk’ AI systems can be updated, it provides no scope for updating ‘unacceptable’ (Art. 5) and limited risk (Art. 52) lists.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition, although Annex III can be updated to add new systems to the list of high-risk AI systems, systems can only be added within the scope of the existing eight area headings. Those headings cannot currently be modified within the framework of the AIA. These rigid aspects of the framework undermine the lasting relevance of the AIA, and in particular its capacity to respond to future developments and emerging risks for fundamental rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>They have also called out the Commission for a lack of ambition in framing prohibited use-cases of AI &#8212; urging a &#8220;full ban&#8221; on all social scoring scoring systems; on all remote biometric identification in publicly accessible spaces (not just narrow limits on how law enforcement can use the tech); on all emotion recognition systems; on all discriminatory biometric categorisation; on all AI physiognomy; on all systems used to predict future criminal activity; and on all systems to profile and risk-assess in a migration context &#8212; arguing for prohibitions &#8220;on all AI systems posing an unacceptable risk to fundamental rights&#8221;.</p>
<p>On this the groups&#8217; recommendations echo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/ban-biometric-surveillance-in-public-to-safeguard-rights-urge-eu-bodies/">earlier calls</a> for the regulation to go further and fully prohibit remote biometric surveillance &#8212; including from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/eus-top-data-protection-supervisor-urges-ban-on-facial-recognition-in-public/">EU&#8217;s data protection supervisor</a>.</p>

<p>The civil society groups also want regulatory obligations to apply to <em>users</em> of high risk AI systems, not just providers (developers) &#8212; calling for a mandatory obligation on users to conduct and publish a fundamental rights impact assessment to ensure accountability around risks cannot be circumvented by the regulation&#8217;s predominant focus on providers.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">After all, an AI technology that&#8217;s developed for one ostensible purpose could be applied for a different use-case that raises distinct rights risks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Hence they want explicit obligations on users of &#8220;high risk&#8221; AIs to publish impact assessments &#8212; which they say should cover potential impacts on people, fundamental rights, the environment and the broader public interest.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;While some of the risk posed by the systems listed in Annex III comes from how they are designed, significant risks stem from how they are used. This means that providers cannot comprehensively assess the full potential impact of a high-risk AI system during the conformity assessment, and therefore that users must have obligations to uphold fundamental rights as well,&#8221; they urge.</p>
<p>They also argue for transparency requirements to be extended to users of high risks systems &#8212; suggesting they should have to register the specific use of an AI system in a public database the regulation proposes to establish for providers of such system.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EU database for stand-alone high-risk AI systems (Art. 60) provides a promising opportunity for increasing the transparency of AI systems vis-à-vis impacted individuals and civil society, and could greatly facilitate public interest research. However, the database currently only contains information on high-risk systems registered by providers, without information on the context of use,&#8221; they write, warning: &#8220;This loophole undermines the purpose of the database, as it will prevent the public from finding out where, by whom and for what purpose(s) high-risk AI systems are actually used.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another recommendations addresses a key civil society criticism of the proposed framework &#8212; that it does not offer individuals rights and avenues for redress when they are negatively impacted by AI.</p>
<p>This marks a striking departure from existing EU data protection law &#8212; which confers a suite of rights on people attached to their personal data and &#8212; at least on paper &#8212; allows them to seek redress for breaches, as well as for third parties to seek redress on individuals&#8217; behalf. (Moreover, the General Data Protection Regulation includes provisions related to automated processing of personal data; with Article 22 giving people subject to decisions with a legal or similar effect which are based solely on automation a right to information about the processing; and/or to request a human review or challenge the decision.)</p>
<p>The lack of &#8220;meaning rights and redress&#8221; for people impacted by AI systems represents a gaping hole in the framework&#8217;s ability to guard against high risk automation scaling harms, the groups argue.</p>
<p>&#8220;The AIA currently does not confer individual rights to people impacted by AI systems, nor does it contain any provision for individual or collective redress, or a mechanism by which people or civil society can participate in the investigatory process of high-risk AI systems. As such, the AIA does not fully address the myriad harms that arise from the opacity, complexity, scale and power imbalance in which AI systems are deployed,&#8221; they warn.</p>
<p>They are recommending the legislated is amended to include two individual rights as a basis for judicial remedies &#8212; namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) The right not to be subject to AI systems that pose an unacceptable risk or do not comply with the Act; and</li>
<li>(b) The right to be provided with a clear and intelligible explanation, in a manner that is accessible for persons with disabilities, for decisions taken with the assistance of systems within the scope of the AIA;</li>
</ul>
<p>They also suggest a right to an &#8220;effective remedy&#8221; for those whose rights are infringed &#8220;as a result of the putting into service of an AI system&#8221;. And, as you might expect, the civil society organizations want a mechanism for public interest groups such as themselves to be able to lodge a complaint with national supervisory authorities for a breach or in relation to AI systems that undermine fundamental rights or the public interest &#8212; which they specify should trigger an investigation. (GDPR complaints simply being ignored by oversight bodies is a major problem with effective enforcement of that regime.)</p>
<p>Other recommendations in the groups&#8217; statement include the need for accessibility to be considered throughout the AI system&#8217;s lifecycle, and they call out the lack of accessibility requirements in the regulation &#8212; warning that risks leading to the development and use of AI with &#8220;further barriers for persons with disabilities&#8221;; they also want explicit limits to ensure that harmonized product safety standards which the regulation proposes to delegate to private standards bodies should only cover &#8220;genuinely technical&#8221; aspects of high risks AI systems (so that political and fundamental rights decisions &#8220;remain firmly within the democratic scrutiny of EU legislators&#8221;, as they put it); and they want requirements on AI system users and providers to apply not only when the outputs are applied within the EU but also elsewhere &#8212; &#8220;to avoid risk of discrimination, surveillance, and abuse through technologies developed in the EU&#8221;.</p>
<p>Sustainability and environmental protection has also been overlooked, per the groups&#8217; assessment.</p>
<p>On that they&#8217;re calling for &#8220;horizontal, public-facing transparency requirements on the resource consumption and greenhouse gas emission impacts of AI systems&#8221; &#8212; regardless of risk level; and covering AI system design, data management and training, application, and underlying infrastructures (hardware, data centres, etc.</p>
<p>The European Commission frequently justifies its aim of encouraging the update of AI by touting automation as a key technology for enabling the bloc&#8217;s sought for transition to a &#8220;climate-neutral&#8221; continent by 2050 &#8212; however AI&#8217;s own energy and resource consumption is a much overlooked component of these so-called &#8216;smart&#8217; systems. Without robust environmental auditing requirements also applying to AI it&#8217;s simply PR to claim that AI will provide the answer to climate change.</p>
<p>The Commission has been contacted for a response to the civil society recommendations.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/european-parliament-backs-ban-on-remote-biometric-surveillance/">Last month</a>, MEPs in the European Parliament voted to back a total ban on remote biometric surveillance technologies such as facial recognition, a ban on the use of private facial recognition databases and a ban on predictive policing based on behavioural data.</p>
<p>They also voted for a ban on social scoring systems which seek to rate the trustworthiness of citizens based on their behaviour or personality, and for a ban on AI assisting judicial decisions — another highly controversial area where automation is already been applied.</p>
<p>So MEPs are likely to take careful note of the civil society recommendations as they work on amendments to the AI Act.</p>
<p>In parallel the Council is in the process of determining its <a href="https://twitter.com/mikarv/status/1465605600843341824">negotiating mandate</a> on the regulation &#8212; and current proposals are pushing for a ban on social scoring by private companies but seeking carve outs for R&amp;D and national security uses of AI.</p>
<p>Discussions between the Commission, Parliament and Council will determine the final shape of the regulation, although the parliament must also approve the final text of the regulation in a plenary vote &#8212; so MEPs&#8217; views will play a key role.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumer awareness of supply chain shortages and even earlier deals may have contributed to a slight decline in U.S. e-commerce sales during Cyber Week &#8212; the kickoff to the holiday shopping season that runs from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday. Last year, U.S. consumers spent a record <a href="https://business.adobe.com/blog/the-latest/cyber-week-online-shopping">$34.4 billion during Cyber Week</a>, up 20.7% from the year prior. But this year, that figure dropped by 1.4% to $33.9 billion in online spend, according to data from Adobe&#8217;s Digital Economy Index.</p>
<p>Adobe&#8217;s <a href="https://business.adobe.com/resources/holiday-shopping-report.html?sdid=L3XTTSTL&amp;mv=other">analysis</a> comes from data from over one trillion visits to U.S. e-commerce websites, which feature 100 million individual SKUs across 18 product categories, giving it a comprehensive window into holiday shopping trends.</p>
<p>The company noticed the declines this year starting on Black Friday. This year, retailers pulled in $8.9 billion in Black Friday online sales, down 1.3% from last year&#8217;s record of $9.03 billion &#8212; its <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/27/black-friday-shopping-in-stores-drops-28percent-from-pre-pandemic-levels.html">first-ever year-over-year decline</a>. Cyber Monday 2021 sales also dropped 1.4% year-over-year to $10.7 billion &#8212; just $100 million shy of what consumers spent last year, at $10.8 billion. Meanwhile, Thanksgiving Day online sales stayed flat at $5.1 billion.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240749" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>These declines, while relatively small, represent a reverse in the usual trend of holiday shopping sales that jump up with every subsequent year. For an industry supposedly accelerated several years by the pandemic,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/covid-19-pandemic-accelerated-shift-to-e-commerce-by-5-years-new-report-says/"> according to reports</a> from last year, it&#8217;s a notable demonstration of how the long-lasting impacts of the pandemic &#8212; which now include supply chain shortages &#8212; may have played out in consumers&#8217; psyches. Worried about possible shortages, consumers may have shopped even earlier this year, Adobe says.</p>
<p>The data seems to back this up. During the month of November (Nov. 1 to Nov. 29), consumers spent $109.8 billion, a significant jump of 11.9% over last year. That means 22 days of the month have exceeded $3 billion in online spending, Adobe notes. This is a new record, as only 9 days in 2020 hit that same milestone. Plus, consumers may have shopped last month, as well, the company points out.</p>
<p>&#8220;With early deals in October, consumers were not waiting around for discounts on big shopping days like Cyber Monday and Black Friday,&#8221; said Taylor Schreiner, Director at Adobe Digital Insights, in an announcement about the Cyber Week findings. &#8220;This was further fueled by growing awareness of supply chain challenges and product availability. It spread out e-commerce spending across the months of October and November, putting us on track for a season that still will break online shopping records,&#8221; Schreiner added.</p>
<p>In other words, sales aren&#8217;t necessarily going to be down in 2021 overall, they&#8217;re just not going to be as concentrated as before. In fact, the pandemic may have may online shopping such a regular habit that now consumers are placing their holiday purchases alongside their usual activity, instead of waiting for a big Black Friday or Cyber Monday sales event as in years past.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite the declines, the peak holiday shopping period otherwise looked a lot like it would have otherwise. Cyber Monday shoppers went for the usual categories in greater numbers compared with September 2021 sales, across categories like toys (sales were up by nearly 11x the pre-season levels in Sept. 2021), gift cards (up by 7x), books (up by 7x), video games (up by 6x), and baby and toddler products (up by 6x). Appliances, including microwave ovens and small kitchen appliances, were also up 9.6x and 7.1x respectively, leading to the category&#8217;s increase of 5.6x.</p>
<p>Smartphone-driven sales were also up this year, with Cyber Monday smartphone-driven sales up 8.4% year-over-year, for example. This actually represents a change in course, however. Pre-pandemic, smartphone sales were expected to top 50% of online sales. But consumers now working from home may not need to shop from their phones as much as before, Adobe noted.</p>
<p>Although the shopping patterns look different, Adobe says it expects the overall holiday season to break a new record. It forecasts that consumers will drive 10% year-over-year growth in sales to hit $207 billion from November 1 through December 31.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What’s going on with an IPO that was expected to be a key moment for Brazilian tech companies in particular, and fintech upstarts more broadly?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brazil’s Nu Holdings, the parent company of the popular Latin American neobank Nubank, announced a reduction to the expected price of its public offering this morning. The well-funded fintech is listing in the United States and its native Brazil, and is among the final companies that TechCrunch is tracking for a 2021 debut.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>In its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001691493/000119312521314359/d213207df1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first F-1 filing</a>, Nubank indicated that it expected to sell its shares at a price of up to $11 apiece, raising a maximum of $3.66 billion in its public-market flotation. The company <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001691493/000119312521342848/d213207df1a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now anticipates</a> a smaller $9 per-share IPO price maximum and a $2.86 billion max raise.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220366 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-blu-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>The downward pricing trend is a disappointment for the company, though it will still command a strong valuation when it raises billions in its IPO. Nubank <a href="https://www.bloomberglinea.com/2021/11/29/nubank-estaria-considerando-recortar-la-valoracion-de-su-opi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is expected</a> to price its IPO on December 8.</p>
<p>What’s going on with an IPO that was expected to be a key moment for Brazilian tech companies in particular, and fintech upstarts more broadly? We unpacked the company’s new public offering valuations and dug into whether Nubank’s downward revision will matter for Brazilian startups generally. Let’s talk about it.</p>
<h2>Calculating Nubank’s new IPO worth</h2>
<p>The Nubank IPO is a little bit complex, given that the company is selling Class A shares on the United States&#8217; New York Stock Exchange and BDRs, or <a href="https://www.b3.com.br/en_us/products-and-services/solutions-for-issuers/bdrs-brazilian-depositary-receipts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brazilian Depositary Receipts</a>, on its home market&#8217;s B3 stock exchange. That &#8212; and an indication of interest from a host of the company’s backers for more shares &#8212; makes for an interesting aggregate package.</p>
<p>But that cannot slow us down, so let’s get some valuations in hand to better understand the company’s new anticipated valuation.</p>
<p>In its latest filing, Nubank states that after its IPO it will have 4,608,684,459 ordinary shares outstanding, a figure that rises to 4,637,255,888 when we include equity reserved for underwriter purchase. Using that larger figure, at its IPO price range of $8 to $9, the company would be worth between $37.1 billion and $41.7 billion.</p>
<p>However, those valuations are only part of the picture. At its first IPO price range of $10 to $11, <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/88023/Leading-digital-banking-platform-Nu-Holdings-files-and-sets-terms-for-a-$3-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Renaissance Capital calculated</a> that on a fully diluted basis &#8212; inclusive of stock options that have vested, but have yet to be exercised, etc. &#8212; the company was worth $50.8 billion at $10.50 per share.</p>
<p>Converting that valuation to $9 per share, the top end of its new range, gives Nubank a $43.5 billion fully diluted valuation.</p>
<p>Is that number good?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As containers proliferate, developers are using them to deliver software, and depending on the environment, on prem or in the cloud, that can present a set of challenges for your users when it comes to installing the container. To help solve that issue, <a href="http://aws.com">AWS</a> announced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace">AWS Marketplace</a> for Containers Anywhere today at <a href="https://reinvent.awsevents.com/?trk=direct">AWS re:Invent</a> in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The name of the product may not be the most creative, but it does describe precisely what it does. You can offer your container in the marketplace and your users can deploy it anywhere. The idea is to use the AWS Marketplace to provide a way to discover containerized applications, then subscribe to them and deploy them in an easy way to a Kubernetes cluster in any environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this launch, you can deploy third party Kubernetes applications to on-premises environments using Amazon EKS Anywhere or any customer self-managed Kubernetes cluster in on-premises environments or in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), enabling you to use a single catalog to find container images regardless of where they eventually plan to deploy,&#8221; AWS&#8217;s Channy Yun wrote <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-marketplace-for-containers-anywhere-to-deploy-your-kubernetes-cluster-in-any-environment/">in a blog post</a> announcing the new feature.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240718" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As Yun points out, this gives users all of the advantages of using the marketplace including flexible billing options, the knowledge that your application has been run through a security scan and simplified administration. One of the big advantages is the flexible licensing, which lets you deploy across different environments with changing the license.</p>
<p>&#8220;After you have subscribed to an application using this feature, you can migrate your Kubernetes applications to AWS by deploying the independent software vendor (ISV) provided Helm charts onto their Kubernetes clusters on AWS without changing their licenses,&#8221; Yun wrote.</p>
<p>AWS reports that AWS Marketplace for Containers Anywhere is available now across all regions, so long as it supports the AWS Marketplace.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fundbox, a company that offers loans and financial products to small businesses, announced today it has raised $100 million in a Series D round at a valuation of $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Or more simply, the company aims to solve SMBs’ working capital needs through its credit and payments offerings. It is particularly focused on B2B-focused small businesses.</p>
<p>“We use artificial intelligence to deliver financial products that small business owners use to better run and grow their businesses,” CEO Prashant Fuloria told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240512" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP) led Fundbox’s Series D financing, which brings the company’s total equity raised to $410 million since its 2013 inception. Existing backers Allianz X, Khosla Ventures and The Private Shares Fund joined new investors including Arbor Waypoint Select Fund and a suite of BNY Mellon funds managed by Newton Investment Management North America.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based <a href="https://fundbox.com/">Fundbox</a> last raised in 2019 &#8212; a $175 million Series C that valued the company at $700 million post-money. That same year, the company also opened its Dallas office, now its largest in the U.S., “to capitalize on the talent pool there,” according to Fuloria.</p>
<p>Fundbox is refreshingly transparent about its financials, at least when it comes to revenue. The startup, which saw a pandemic-related boost in business, crossed $100 million in annual revenue run rate earlier this year. Today, it is “well and truly beyond” that, Fuloria said, although it is not yet profitable as it is focused on growth, he said.</p>
<p>Since the company launched its first product in 2013, it has “connected with” over 325,000 small businesses and transacted over $2.5 billion in working capital, the executive added. In 2021, Fundbox tripled its new customer acquisition rate. But the majority of its revenue comes from existing customers, who Fuloria describes as “incredibly loyal.” He believes one of the company’s biggest differentiators &#8212; besides its use of AI and data &#8212; is that it is focused on SMBs whose customers are other businesses, rather than consumers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For example, Fundbox works with SMBs that serve customers like restaurants, such as businesses supplying food or companies supplying cleaning and staffing services to these restaurants.</p>
<p>“These B2B SMBs have the same challenges as everybody else except that they invoice their clients and then they wait to get paid,” Fuloria told TechCrunch. “All of this capital tied up in unpaid receivables is a huge drag on those SMBs. So one of the things that Fundbox does is provide tools to unlock that working capital that&#8217;s tied up in unpaid invoices, which actually adds up to over a trillion dollars in the U.S. alone.” Customers, he added, can receive approval in minutes, with access to capital as soon as the next business day.</p>
<p>Khosla led Fundbox’s Series A in 2014 and founding partner and managing director David Weiden said his firm was initially &#8212; and remains &#8212; impressed with Fundbox’s founders’ ability to recognize there were “dramatic increases in the availability of relevant data in the small business market.”</p>
<p>“Many companies talk about data and using AI; ironically, only a few have any data that demonstrates the actual effectiveness of their approach,” he wrote via email. “Fundbox, including over the exceptional pandemic period, delivered strong results and are on a path to continued growth and scale.”</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s customers range from sole proprietors with a few dozen employees and as little as a few hundred thousand dollars a year or businesses with as much as a few million dollars a year in annual revenue. Fundbox asks its customers to connect with it via some aspect of their transactional system, such as their invoicing app or even their bank account.</p>
<p>“We look at these business transactions sitting in their systems and put together what we call a business graph where you can imagine the nodes of the graph being all these small businesses that are trading with each other, with the customers being their vendors and the connections being their transactions,” Fuloria explained. “And that graph becomes our picture of the small business economy to derive signals or features that can be used to assess the risk of a B2B transaction or a B2B small business.”</p>

<p>The company then uses those risk assessments to provide tools, such as working capital on tap or the ability to get instant funding against an invoice. It also integrates with other companies&#8217; technology. For example, it&#8217;s partnered with Intuit and is natively integrated inside of QuickBooks. It also shows up in places like FreshBooks&#8217; accounting software or in Synchrony&#8217;s merchant center (Synchrony is an investor in Fundbox).</p>
<p>The small end of the small businesses are often ignored by large banks, Fuloria contends, because the average bank spends over $3,500 (largely in human capital) in assessing a small business’s risk. For loans that aren’t much more than that, it’s not exactly worth it. However, to be clear, Fundbox says it offers up to $150,000 in lines of credit.</p>
<p>“Our focus on using AI to make these decisions really helps us shine because more than 99% of all our decisions are completely automated without any human involvement whatsoever,” Fuloria said. “And that lets us really scale and serve customers very, very efficiently.”</p>
<p>While primarily having served as a lender, Fundbox is now expanding into payments and membership-based offerings (with the intent to generate a subscription revenue stream). The company recently launched Flex Pay, which is designed to provide small business owners with additional payment options and greater flexibility for business expenses.</p>
<p>For example, Fundbox Line of Credit customers now get three extra days to pay those expenses. Repayment options include a bank account, credit card or Line of Credit draw, essentially providing small business owners with another tool to buy now, pay later, according to Fuloria.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, next year Fundbox plans to develop a product aimed specifically at entrepreneurs with multiple small businesses as well as new businesses that lack the financial history to access capital through traditional means.<br />
Shrirang Apte, VP of HOOPP, believes Fundbox’s performance this year speaks to the market opportunity “in disrupting the highly underserved world of small business financing, which has traditionally lagged behind consumer financing innovations.”</p>
<p>Fundbox plans to use its new capital to expand its 300-person team, customer acquisition and expanding its product offerings. It recently hired a handful of new execs, including two former Capital One veterans — Khary Scott and Shawn Haigh to serve as VP and head of partnerships and VP of growth marketing, respectively.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon today <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/introducing-the-aws-energy-competency-partners/">announced</a> a new program that will formally identify AWS Partners who develop specialized solutions aimed at the energy industry. The new <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/energy/partners/?partner-solutions-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.partnerNameLower&amp;partner-solutions-cards.sort-order=asc&amp;awsf.partner-solutions-filter-partner-type-storage=*all&amp;awsf.partner-solutions-filter-partner-usecase-storage=*all&amp;awsf.partner-solutions-filter-partner-location-storage=*all">AWS Energy Competency Program</a>, as it&#8217;s called, will identify these specialized partners who have already demonstrated the technical expertise and customer success that can help energy producers around the world build and implement AWS-powered solutions using the latest technology, while also navigating the transition to a more sustainable energy future.</p>
<p>Today, many AWS Partners work with the energy industry to help them take advantage of AWS technology, including for managing the operation of oil and gas assets from the exploration phases, to the gathering, processing, transportation, management, and maintenance of those operations, as well as those in the renewable and sustainable space. These industries are now accelerating the adoption of solutions like cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML), says Amazon.</p>
<p>The new AWS Energy Competency Program will help the industry better identify the AWS Partners who have the specific expertise when it comes to working with the world&#8217;s energy producers, including those that can help them develop a portfolio that includes sustainable and renewable energy assets.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2240708" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At launch, the program includes 32 global partners who also worked with AWS to help develop the new program for energy producers. This group includes those who can help with specialized solution areas, industry verticals, or workloads. This is now one of the toughest designations an AWS Partner can achieve, notes Amazon, as partners have to undergo a rigorous technical validation related to energy industry-specific best practices.</p>

<p>One partner, Slalom, has been helping North American energy company TC Energy manage 44,000 kilometers of natural gas pipelines. TC Energy worked with the partner to develop a business intelligence application that uses machine learning to help customers optimize gas scheduling and throughput. Another partner, Unleash Live, an AI video analytics provider, helped industrial engineering solutions provider Worley, which operates wind farms, solar parks, hydropower, natural gas projects, and more. Worsley is using Unleash Live to leverage drones and computer vision for its inspections.</p>
<p>Other partners can help provide solutions that include upstream, midstream, downstream, new energies, core business applications, health, safety, and environmental, and data and analytics, says Amazon. AWS Partners now interested in joining the program can view the Validation Checklists for both <a href="https://apn-checklists.s3.amazonaws.com/competency/energy/consulting/CTpftZxbZ.html">AWS Services Partners</a> and <a href="https://apn-checklists.s3.amazonaws.com/competency/energy/technology/CTfpLeXqi.html">AWS Software</a><a href="https://apn-checklists.s3.amazonaws.com/competency/energy/technology/CTfpLeXqi.html"> Partners</a> to get started.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
