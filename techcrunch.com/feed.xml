										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Long-running German audio company Sennheiser<a href="https://en-us.sennheiser.com/newsroom/sonova-acquires-sennheiser-consumer-business-wpc768"> today announced</a> that it has found a buyer for its consumer brand. Swiss holding company Sonova &#8212; a giant in the hearing aid business &#8212; will be acquiring the brand in a deal expected to close by end of year.</p>
<p>The deal will bring headphones and sound bars to Sonova’s existing portfolio, which is largely centered around healthcare products. Among other things, however, the deal could have interesting implications for the so-called hearables category, which can walk the line between headphones and healthcare products. Sennheiser, meanwhile, will shift the entirety of its focus to its pro products.</p>
<p>The company has been fairly open about its intentions. In February, <a href="https://en-us.sennheiser.com/newsroom/sennheiser-to-reposition-its-business-units-independently-of-each-other-s5jh2n">it publicly announced</a> that it was seeking a buyer for the division. “To be best able to exploit the potential in each of these markets, we are concentrating our own resources on the three business areas in the Professional division and are looking for a strong partner to invest in our Consumer business,&#8221; Co-CEO Daniel Sennheiser noted at the time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sennheiser describes the deal as a “permanent cooperation” between the two, including licensing the company’s name. The existing consumer wing, including many of its employees, will transfer to Sonovo. A press release announcing the news says there are currently 600 people employed by the brand, but no word on how many are expected the make that move.</p>
<p>“The combination of our strengths provides a very good starting point for future growth,” the company’s other co-CEO says in the release. “We are convinced that Sonova will strengthen the Sennheiser Consumer Business in the long term and capture the major growth opportunities.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sensor data from smartphones and wearables can meaningfully predict an individual&#8217;s &#8216;biological age&#8217; and resilience to stress, according to <a href="https://gero.ai">Gero AI</a>.</p>
<p>The &#8216;longevity&#8217; startup &#8212; which condenses its mission to the pithy goal of &#8220;hacking complex diseases and aging with Gero AI&#8221; &#8212; has developed an AI model to predict morbidity risk using &#8216;digital biomarkers&#8217; that are based on identifying patterns in step-counter sensor data which tracks mobile users&#8217; physical activity.</p>
<p>A simple measure of &#8216;steps&#8217; isn&#8217;t nuanced enough on its own to predict individual health, is the contention. Gero&#8217;s AI has been trained on large amounts of biological data to spots patterns that can be linked to morbidity risk. It also measures how quickly a personal recovers from a biological stress &#8212; another biomarker that&#8217;s been linked to lifespan; i.e. the faster the body recovers from stress, the better the individual&#8217;s overall health prognosis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A <a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/202816/text">research paper</a> Gero has had published in the peer-reviewed biomedical journal <em>Aging</em> explains how it trained deep neural networks to predict morbidity risk from mobile device sensor data &#8212; and was able to demonstrate that its biological age acceleration model was comparable to models based on blood test results.</p>
<p>Another paper, due to be published in the journal <em>Nature Communications</em> later this month, will go into detail on its device-derived measurement of biological resilience.</p>
<p>The Singapore-based startup, which has research roots in Russia &#8212; founded back in 2015 by a Russian scientist with a background in theoretical physics &#8212; has raised a total of $5 million in seed funding to date (in two tranches).</p>
<p>Backers come from both the biotech and the AI fields, per co-founder Peter Fedichev. Its investors include Belarus-based AI-focused early stage fund, Bulba Ventures (Yury Melnichek). On the pharma side, it has backing from some (unnamed) private individuals with links to Russian drug development firm, Valenta. (The pharma company itself is not an investor).</p>
<p>Fedichev is a theoretical physicist by training who, after his PhD and some ten years in academia, moved into biotech to work on molecular modelling and machine learning for drug discovery &#8212; where he got interested in the problem of ageing and decided to start the company.</p>
<p>As well as conducting its own biological<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> research into longevity (studying mice and nematodes), it&#8217;s focused on developing an AI model for predicting the biological age and resilience to stress of humans &#8212; via sensor data captured by mobile devices.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Health of course is much more than one number,&#8221; emphasizes Fedichev. &#8220;We should not have illusions about that. But if you are going to condense human health to one number then, for a lot of people, the biological age is the best number. It tells you &#8212; essentially &#8212; how toxic is your lifestyle&#8230; The more biological age you have relative to your chronological age years &#8212; that&#8217;s called biological acceleration &#8212; the more are your chances to get chronic disease, to get seasonal infectious diseases or also develop complications from those seasonal diseases.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gero has recently launched a (paid, for now) API, called <a href="https://gerosense.ai">GeroSense</a>, that&#8217;s aimed at health and fitness apps so they can tap up its AI modelling to offer their users an individual assessment of biological age and resilience (aka recovery rate from stress back to that individual&#8217;s baseline).</p>
<p>Early partners are other longevity-focused companies, AgelessRx and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/20/humanity-inc-raises-funding-to-allow-us-to-monitor-and-affect-our-rate-of-aging/">Humanity Inc</a>. But the idea is to get the model widely embedded into fitness apps where it will be able to send a steady stream of longitudinal activity data back to Gero, to further feed its AI&#8217;s predictive capabilities and support the wider research mission &#8212; where it hopes to progress anti-ageing drug discovery, working in partnerships with pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>The carrot for the fitness providers to embed the API is to offer their users a fun and potentially valuable feature: A personalized health measurement so they can track positive (or negative) biological changes &#8212; helping them quantify the value of whatever fitness service they&#8217;re using.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every health and wellness provider &#8212; maybe even a gym &#8212; can put into their app for example&#8230; and this thing can rank all their classes in the gym, all their systems in the gym, for their value for different kinds of users,&#8221; explains Fedichev.</p>
<p>&#8220;We developed these capabilities because we need to understand how ageing works in humans, not in mice. Once we developed it we&#8217;re using it in our sophisticated genetic research in order to find genes &#8212; we are testing them in the laboratory &#8212; but, this technology, the measurement of ageing from continuous signals like wearable devices, is a good trick on its own. So that&#8217;s why we announced this GeroSense project,&#8221; he goes on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ageing is this gradual decline of your functional abilities which is bad but you can go to the gym and potentially improve them. But the problem is you&#8217;re losing this resilience. Which means that when you&#8217;re [biologically] stressed you cannot get back to the norm as quickly as possible. So we report this resilience. So when people start losing this resilience it means that they&#8217;re not robust anymore and the same level of stress as in their 20s would get them [knocked off] the rails.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe this loss of resilience is one of the key ageing phenotypes because it tells you that you&#8217;re vulnerable for future diseases even before those diseases set in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In-house everything is ageing. We are totally committed to ageing: Measurement and intervention,&#8221; adds Fedichev. &#8220;We want to building something like an operating system for longevity and wellness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gero is also generating some revenue from two pilots with &#8220;top range&#8221; insurance companies &#8212; which Fedichev says it&#8217;s essentially running as a proof of business model at this stage. He also mentions an early pilot with Pepsi Co.</p>
<p>He sketches a link between how it hopes to work with insurance companies in the area of health outcomes with how Elon Musk is offering insurance products to owners of its sensor-laden Teslas, based on what it knows about how they drive &#8212; because both are putting sensor data in the driving seat, if you&#8217;ll pardon the pun. (&#8220;Essentially we are trying to do to humans what Elon Musk is trying to do to cars,&#8221; is how he puts it.)</p>
<p>But the nearer term plan is to raise more funding &#8212; and potentially switch to offering the API for free to really scale up the data capture potential.</p>
<p>Zooming out for a little context, i<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">t&#8217;s been almost a decade since Google-backed </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/19/wtf-is-calico-and-why-does-google-think-its-mysterious-new-company-can-defy-aging/">Calico</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> launched with the moonshot mission of &#8216;fixing death&#8217;. Since then a small but growing field of &#8216;longevity&#8217; startups has sprung up, conducting research into </span>extending <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">(in the first instance) </span> <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">human lifespan. (Ending death is, clearly, the moonshot atop the moonshot.) </span></p>
<p>Death is still with us, of course, but the business of identifying possible drugs and therapeutics to stave off the grim reaper&#8217;s knock continues picking up pace &#8212; attracting a growing volume of investor dollars.</p>
<p>The trend is being fuelled by health and biological data becoming ever more plentiful and accessible, thanks to open research data initiatives and the proliferation of digital devices and services for tracking health, set alongside promising developments in the fast-evolving field of machine learning in areas like predictive healthcare and drug discovery.</p>
<p>Longevity has also seen a bit of an upsurge in interest in recent times as the coronavirus pandemic has concentrated minds on health and wellness, generally &#8212; and, well, mortality specifically.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it remains a complex, multi-disciplinary business. Some of these biotech moonshots are focused on bioengineering and gene-editing &#8212; pushing for disease diagnosis and/or drug discovery.</p>
<p>Plenty are also &#8212; like Gero &#8212;  trying to use AI and big data analysis to better understand and counteract biological ageing, bringing together experts in physics, maths and biological science to hunt for biomarkers to further research aimed at combating age-related disease and deterioration.</p>
<p>Another recent example is AI startup Deep Longevity, which came out of stealth <a href="https://apnews.com/press-release/business-wire/289bd9a1aef046b8adc4934d499c817d">last summer</a> &#8212; as a spinout from AI drug discovery startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/11/insilico-medicine-longevity/">Insilico Medicine</a> &#8212; touting an AI &#8216;longevity as a service&#8217; system which it claims can predict an individual’s biological age &#8220;significantly more accurately than conventional methods&#8221; (and which it also hopes will help scientists to unpick which &#8220;biological culprits drive aging-related diseases&#8221;, as it put it).</p>
<p>Gero AI is taking a different tack toward the same overarching goal &#8212; by honing in on data generated by activity sensors embedded into the everyday mobile devices people carry with them (or wear) as a proxy signal for studying their biology.</p>
<p>The advantage being that it doesn&#8217;t require a person to undergo regular (invasive) blood tests to get an ongoing measure of their own health. Instead our personal device can generate proxy signals for biological study <em>passively</em> &#8212; at vast scale and low cost. So the promise of Gero&#8217;s &#8216;digital biomarkers&#8217; is they could democratize access to individual health prediction.</p>
<p>And while billionaires like Peter Thiel can afford to shell out for bespoke medical monitoring and interventions to try to stay one step ahead of death, such high end services simply won&#8217;t scale to the rest of us.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">If its digital biomarkers live up to Gero&#8217;s claims, its approach could, at the least, help steer millions towards healthier lifestyles, while also generating rich data for longevity R&amp;D &#8212; and to support the development of drugs that could extend human lifespan (albeit what such life-extending pills might cost is a whole other matter).</span></p>
<p>The insurance industry is naturally interested &#8212; with the potential for such tools to be used to nudge individuals towards healthier lifestyles and thereby reduce payout costs.</p>
<p>For individuals who are motivated to improve their health themselves, Fedichev says the issue now is it&#8217;s extremely hard for people to know exactly which lifestyle changes or interventions are best suited to their particular biology.</p>
<p>For example fasting has been shown in some studies to help combat biological ageing. But he notes that the approach may not be effective for everyone. The same may be true of other activities that are accepted to be generally beneficial for health (like exercise or eating or avoiding certain foods).</p>
<p>Again those rules of thumb may have a lot of nuance, depending on an individual&#8217;s particular biology. And scientific research is, inevitably, limited by access to funding. (Research can thus tend to focus on certain groups to the exclusion of others &#8212; e.g. men rather than women; or the young rather than middle aged.)</p>
<p>This is why Fedichev believes there&#8217;s a lot of value in creating a measure than can address health-related knowledge gaps at essentially no individual cost.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Gero has u</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">sed longitudinal data from the UK&#8217;s biobank, one of its research partners, to verify its model&#8217;s measurements of biological age and resilience. But of course it hopes to go further &#8212; as it ingests more data. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Technically it&#8217;s not properly different what we are doing &#8212; it just happens that we can do it now because there are such efforts like UK biobank. Government money and also some industry sponsors money, maybe for the first time in the history of humanity, we have this situation where we have electronic medical records, genetics, wearable devices from hundreds of thousands of people, so it just became possible. It&#8217;s the convergence of several developments &#8212; technological but also what I would call &#8216;social technologies&#8217; [like the UK biobank],&#8221; he tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine that for every diet, for every training routine, meditation&#8230; in order to make sure that we can actually optimize lifestyles &#8212; understand which things work, which do not [for each person] or maybe some experimental drugs which are already proved [to] extend lifespan in animals are working, maybe we can do something different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we will have 1M tracks [half a year&#8217;s worth of data on 1M individuals] we will combine that with genetics and solve ageing,&#8221; he adds, with entrepreneurial flourish. &#8220;The ambitious version of this plan is we&#8217;ll get this million tracks by the end of the year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fitness and health apps are an obvious target partner for data-loving longevity researchers &#8212; but you can imagine it&#8217;ll be a mutual attraction. One side can bring the users, the other a halo of credibility comprised of deep tech and hard science.</p>
<p>&#8220;We expect that these [apps] will get lots of people and we will be able to analyze those people for them as a fun feature first, for their users. But in the background we will build the best model of human ageing,&#8221; Fedichev continues, predicting that scoring the effect of different fitness and wellness treatments will be &#8220;the next frontier&#8221; for wellness and health (Or, more pithily: &#8220;Wellness and health has to become digital and quantitive.&#8221;)</p>
<p>&#8220;What we are doing is we are bringing physicists into the analysis of human data. Since recently we have lots of biobanks, we have lots of signals &#8212; including from available devices which produce something like a few years&#8217; long windows on the human ageing process. So it&#8217;s a dynamical system &#8212; like weather prediction or financial market predictions,&#8221; he also tells us.</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot own the treatments because we cannot patent them but maybe we can own the personalization &#8212; the AI that personalized those treatments for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>From a startup perspective, one thing looks crystal clear: Personalization is here for the long haul.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Long before the multimillion-dollar acquisitions and funding rounds pushed autonomous vehicles to the top of the hype cycle, <strong>Karl Iagnemma</strong> and <strong>Chris Urmson</strong> were researching and, later, developing the foundations of the technology.</p>
<p>These pioneers — Iagnemma coming from MIT, Urmson from Carnegie Mellon University — would eventually go on to launch their own autonomous vehicle startups in an aim to finally bring years of R&amp;D to the public.</p>
<p>That task isn&#8217;t over quite yet. Urmson, who is co-founder and CEO of Aurora, and Iagnemma, who is president and CEO of Motional, are still working on unlocking the technical and business problems that stand in the way of commercialization.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch is excited to announce that Urmson and Iagnemma will be joining us on the virtual stage of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=karlpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=karlpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a>. The one-day event, scheduled for June 9, is bringing together engineers and founders, investors and CEOs who are working on all the present and future ways people and packages will get from Point A to Point B. Iagnemma and Urmson will come to discuss the past, the present challenges and what both aim to do in the future. We&#8217;ll tackle questions about the technical problems that remain to be solved, the war over talent, the best business models and applications of autonomous vehicles and maybe even hear a few stories from the early days of testing and launching a startup.</p>
<p>Both guests have a long list of accolades and accomplishments — and too many to cover them all here.</p>
<p>Urmson has been working on AVs for more than 15 years. He earned his BSc in computer engineering from the University of Manitoba in 1998 and his PhD in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University in 2005. He was a faculty member of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where he worked with house-sized trucks, drove robots in the desert and was the technical director of the DARPA Urban and Grand Challenge teams. Urmson has authored more than 60 patents and 50 publications.</p>
<p>He left CMU and was one of the founding members of Google&#8217;s self-driving program, serving as its CTO. In 2017, Urmson co-founded Aurora with Sterling Anderson and Drew Bagnell.</p>
<p>Iagnemma is also considered an authority on robotics and driverless vehicles. He was the director of the Robotic Mobility Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where his research resulted in more than 150 technical publications, 50 issued or filed patents and numerous edited volumes, including books on the DARPA Grand Challenge and Urban Challenge autonomous vehicle competitions. He holds a BS from the University of Michigan, where he graduated first in his class, and MS and PhD degrees from MIT, where he was a National Science Foundation fellow.</p>
<p>In 2013, Iagnemma co-founded autonomous vehicle startup nuTonomy, one of the first to launch ride-hailing pilots. The company was acquired by Aptiv <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">in late 2017. Aptiv and Hyundai formed the joint venture, which he now heads, in 2020. </span></p>
<p>Iagnemma and Urmson are two of the many best and brightest minds in transportation who will be joining us on our virtual stage in June. Among the growing list of speakers are GM&#8217;s VP of Global Innovation <strong>Pam Fletcher</strong>, Scale AI CEO <strong>Alexandr Wang</strong>, Joby Aviation founder and CEO <strong>JoeBen Bevirt</strong>, investor and LinkedIn founder <strong>Reid Hoffman </strong>(whose special purpose acquisition company just merged with Joby), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/investors-clara-brenner-quin-garcia-and-rachel-holt-are-coming-to-tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">investors</a> <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/clara-brenner" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Clara Brenner</strong></a> of Urban Innovation Fund, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/quin-garcia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Quin Garcia</strong></a> of Autotech Ventures and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/rachel-holt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Rachel Holt</strong></a> of Construct Capital, Starship Technologies co-founder and CEO/CTO Ahti Heinla, Zoox co-founder and CTO <strong>Jesse Levinson</strong>, community organizer, transportation consultant and lawyer <strong>Tamika L. Butler</strong>, Remix co-founder and CEO <strong>Tiffany Chu</strong> and Revel co-founder and CEO <strong>Frank Reig</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walmart-owned Flipkart is exempting storage and cancellation fees for sellers on its marketplace and also providing them with insurance coverage as the top e-commerce platform in India looks to maintain cordial relationships with more than 300,000 sellers who are facing severe disruption amid an unprecedented rise in the spread of coronavirus infections in the South Asian nation.</p>
<p>The Bangalore-headquartered firm said Friday evening that it is exempting storage fees to sellers who use the company’s fulfilment centres, and also waiving off the cancellation fees until the end of the month. (Several Indian states, as they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/24/amazon-prioritizes-essential-products-in-india-temporarily-discontinues-lower-priority-items/">did during the first wave of the virus</a>, have imposed restrictions on sale and delivery of non-essential items.)</p>
<p>Flipkart will bear 100% premium of COVID insurance to all sellers that transact on the platform, covering any hospitalization and consultation fees between 50,000 Indian rupees ($685) to 300,000 Indian rupees ($4095).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The news today comes a week after Amazon, Flipkart’s chief rival in India, announced it was waiving 50% of the referral fee sellers are required to pay the e-commerce firm for this month, though not all sellers are qualified to avail this benefit. (The company said earlier this week that it was also postponing Prime Day in India and Canada due to the growing cases of the infection.)</p>

<p>Flipkart said it is also making it easier for sellers to access working capital from the firm without any incremental cost, though it did not specify the steps it had made.</p>
<p>It is also extending the window for the Seller Protection Fund to 30 days (from 14) to make claims on returned products. Flipkart said it will also ease its policies and performance metrics to ensure that they are not impacted by state-led lockdowns.</p>
<p>Flipkart, which as of last year was working to go public this year, said it has partnered with Vriddhi, Walmart’s Supplier Development Program in India, to organize webinars for small businesses to share best practices to ensure safety of workforce and provide insights to stay afloat amid the crisis.</p>
<p>“Through these testing times it is our constant effort to support our seller partners who face immense operational challenges as a result of the pandemic. As a democratic marketplace, we want to ensure that our lakhs [hundreds of thousands] of seller partners are able to continue operations and keep the economic engine running,” said Jagjeet Harode, senior director and head of Marketplace at Flipkart, in a statement.</p>
<p>“With them and their family’s financial and health safety in mind, we have rolled out these initiatives that will bring them the much-needed respite to keep their businesses active.”</p>
<p>India has been reporting over 400,00 daily infections this week, more than any other nation, as the world&#8217;s second-most populated nation struggles to contain the second wave of the virus. Scores of firms, startups, investors and people alike are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/donate-to-india-covid19/">uniting to help the nation fight the virus</a>, which has severely impacted the healthcare facilities.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today we're talking Square earnings and its bitcoin base, especially in how it relates to the results of other entities that offer bitcoin sales.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shares of Square are up more than 6% today after the American fintech company reported a staggering $5.06 billion in revenue in its <a href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/311240100/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Q1-2021-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">Q1 2021 earnings report</a>, far ahead of an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/06/square-sq-earnings-q1-2021.html">expected tally</a> of $3.36 billion.</p>
<p>By posting the huge revenue beat, Square grew 266% compared to its year-ago Q1. Because that&#8217;s the sort of growth that we generally expect to see from early-stage startups instead of maturing public companies, some exploration is in order. In short, bitcoin revenues from Square, and how they fit into its accounting, are responsible for much of its outsized growth.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s something we need to talk about.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Square&#8217;s performance apart from its bitcoin-driven results were strong. But its bitcoin incomes underscore not only rising consumer sentiment concerning bitcoin, but also an interesting angle on the question of Coinbase and its long-term fee structure.</p>
<p>Mix in the huge growth in bitcoin investment activity that Robinhood has seen and we can easily understand that, at least in the American market, consumers are not beholden to traditional cryptocurrency arguments regarding coin ownership. And the pace at which non-Coinbase entities are accreting trading volume could point to more competition at the now-public crypto exchange than some fans, backers and believers anticipated.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995213 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-orng.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>So today, we&#8217;re talking Square earnings and its bitcoin base, especially in how it relates to the results of other entities that offer bitcoin sales. Our broader question is whether consumers are going to behave as many expect, or if the less crypto-focused on-ramps to bitcoin and its brethren will prove more popular than many crypto-enthusiasts anticipate.</p>
<h2>A bitcoin boom</h2>
<p>If we remove the bitcoin top line from Square&#8217;s quarter, the company posted $1.55 billion in revenue, a figure that was up 44% compared to its year-ago period. That&#8217;s impressive.</p>
<p>But the company&#8217;s bitcoin-related revenue growth was far more so. From $306.1 million in Q1 2020 bitcoin revenue to $3.51 billion in Q1 2021, Square wrote in its report that it saw &#8220;significant growth in bitcoin revenue year over year,&#8221; up &#8220;approximately 11x.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Credit Karma Money, a new checking and savings account from the company best known for its credit monitoring service, recently launched a significant new feature. Called Instant Karma, the program rewards users by randomly refunding purchases. So far, since launching the feature, Credit Karma says it has rewarded 100,000 transactions, worth $5 million.</p>
<p>I spoke to Poulomi Damany, general manager at Credit Karma, who said the idea behind Credit Karma Money is to &#8220;change people&#8217;s relationship with money.&#8221; Credit Karma Instant Karma is an extension of that goal.</p>
<p>The process works differently from other cash-back offers. For one, this product is linked to a debt card rather than a credit card. Credit Karma Product Manger Kyle Thibaut says that&#8217;s by design, as their target demographic tends to stay away from credit cards. Second, the refund, though random, happens instantly. Swipe your card at a grocery store, and if selected, the money spent on the transaction is refunded instantly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Gen Z do not necessarily like credit cards,&#8221; Thibaut said. &#8220;When you talk to them, they like debit cards and debit cards are the way they spend. Debit card usage is higher than credit cards in the U.S., and it&#8217;s actually growing while credit card usage is declining.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Damany and Thibaut, a large portion of Credit Karma&#8217;s 110 million members are millennials and this product, along with Credit Karma Money, are targeted at this demographic. They say this model lines up better with the spending habits of this generation, who are generally not optimizing their spending to maximize credit card rewards.</p>
<p>At this time, the company is unwilling to share user numbers for Credit Karma Money and the amount of users who received a refund from Instant Karma. The company says it is saving those numbers for an upcoming earnings release &#8212; Credit Karma is owned by TurboTax maker, Intuit.</p>
<p><em>Update: A previous version of this article stated that Instant Karma works with Credit Karma&#8217;s savings account. The company says the programs are different, and the program for the saving&#8217;s account is being renamed Savings Boost.</em></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In non-aerobatic fixed-wing aviation, spins are an emergency. If you don’t have spin recovery training, you can easily make things worse, dramatically increasing your chances of crashing. Despite the life-and-death consequences, licensed amateur pilots in the United States are not required to train for this. Uncontrolled spins don’t happen often enough to warrant the training.</p>
<p>Startups can enter the equivalent of a spin as well. My startup, <a href="https://www.kolide.com/">Kolide</a>, entered a dangerous spin in early 2018, only a year after our Series A fundraise. We had little traction and we were quickly burning through our sizable cash reserves. We were spinning out of control, certain to hit the ground in no time.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Kolide had a lot going for it that enabled me to recover the company, but by far the most important was that we recognized we were in a spin very early, and we had enough cash remaining (and therefore sufficient time) to execute a recovery plan.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>All spins start with a stall &#8212; a reduction in lift when either the aircraft is flying too slowly or the nose is pointed too high. In Kolide’s case, we were doing both.</p>
<p>First, we raised too much money too fast. In order to justify the post-money valuation that came with the raise, we set unattainable goals. To make matters worse, we lacked the confidence in our product and strategy, so we developed our solution with hesitancy, underspending in critical areas. As a result, we were flying too steep and too slow. We stalled.</p>
<p>If a stall isn’t corrected promptly, a spin can develop. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lThUWB81i4g">Flat spins</a> are one of the worst. Once the flat spin starts, there are a number of techniques experienced pilots should perform to recover the aircraft. Nearly all of these techniques require a critical resource, altitude &#8212; or, put another way, time.</p>
<p>Just like amateur pilots, startup CEOs don’t receive spin recovery training. When Kolide was spinning out of control, the vast majority of the advice I received was to cut our losses and sell the company or return the money to the investors.</p>
<p>At the time, I didn’t find <em>any</em> promising examples of companies with these same problems successfully recovering; I found only smoldering wreckage. By February 2019, my co-founders departed.</p>
<p>Despite this tell-tale sign of imminent demise, I was ultimately able to recover and put us on track for a great fundraise. Here’s how I recreated the engineering process.</p>
<h2>Buying time</h2>
<p>Kolide had a lot going for it that enabled me to recover the company, but by far the most important was that we recognized we were in a spin very early, and we had enough cash remaining (and therefore sufficient time) to execute a recovery plan. Even waiting just a few more months would have likely changed the outcome.</p>

<p>The all-virtual nature of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021">Disrupt 2021</a> means that you can connect, network and collaborate with people across the globe — and in Silicon Valley. Still on the fence? Listen to what past attendees have told us about their Disrupt experiences:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Tech startups go to Disrupt to show off their stuff. It’s the perfect place to scope out the competition, network with potential investors, get a feel for how other companies position themselves and to see what&#8217;s trending.&#8221; — Jessica McLean, director of marketing and communications, Infinite-Compute.</p>
<p>&#8220;I attend TechCrunch Disrupt every year because it’s different every time. It’s inspiring every single time. I&#8217;m never bored. Ever. I always learn something, whether it’s a new company, a new topic or a deeper exploration of a familiar technology. It&#8217;s great. I love stuff like that.&#8221; — Rachael Wilcox, creative producer, Volvo Cars.</p>
<p>&#8220;The virtual platform’s chat feature made it easy to connect with participants. People got creative using it to promote their business, like posting a LinkedIn profile or offering 15-minute time slots to review business pitches. I even saw a product-naming competition. You could find lots of opportunity rolling through the chat area.&#8221; — Ada Lau, manager of market development, Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>The whole team was aboard for this recording, with <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall">Grace</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> behind the scenes, and <a href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton">Danny</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> on the mics. We had to cut more than we included this week, which should give you a good idea of how busy the startup and VC worlds are of late.</p>
<p>Make sure that you are <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">following the podcast on Twitter</a>, where we post all sorts of memes and cuts and, perhaps, the occasional video here and there. That aside, here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Investing legend <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/yales-longtime-and-legendary-endowment-chief-david-swensen-has-passed-away-at-age-67/">David Swenson</a> passed away.</li>
<li>Twitter is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/twitter-acquires-distraction-free-reading-service-scroll-to-beef-up-its-subscription-product/">buying Scroll</a> (neat, very cool) as part of its subscription push, but also killing Nuzzel in the process (bad, very uncool). Natasha and Danny fill us in on why Nuzzel will be missed. Alex has thoughts on why Twitter-Scroll is good.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/epic-games-buys-artist-community-artstation-drops-commissions-to-12/">Epic bought ArtStation</a> and cut its marketplace take rate. This is the future, says Danny, who throws his own estimates in, too.</li>
<li>Sony and Discord are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/sony-announces-investment-and-partnership-with-discord-to-bring-the-chat-app-to-playstation/">tying up</a> after the Microsoft-Discord deal fell apart.</li>
<li>Edtech is doing the edtech thing in which it raises money and consolidates, as shown by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/kahoot-acquires-clever-the-us-based-edtech-portal-for-up-to-500m/">Kahoot&#8217;s latest scoop.</a></li>
<li>A friend of the pod, Jomayra Herrera, <a href="https://twitter.com/jomayra_herrera/status/1389581630361190401">is joining Reach Capital</a> as its first-ever outside-partner hire.</li>
<li>Uber is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/uber-and-arrival-partner-to-create-an-ev-for-ride-hail-drivers/">teaming up with Arrival</a> for ride-hailing-designed electric vehicles. We&#8217;re pretty bullish on the idea. Also Alex likes to say &#8220;microfactories.&#8221;</li>
<li>IVF startups are raising venture capital, and this time<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/alifehealth-seed/"> it&#8217;s Alife Health that we&#8217;re talking about. </a></li>
<li>WorkBoard <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/workboard-raises-75m-as-the-okr-focused-startup-bets-on-a-growing-economy-changes-to-business-culture/">raised again</a>. Alex once again made us talk <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/what-can-the-okr-software-sector-tell-us-about-startup-growth-more-generally/">about OKR-focused startups</a>. He needs to get a life, and so does the rest of the Equity team, which fought to do the transition into this segment.</li>
<li>To end, we spoke about Leda Health, a new startup focused on at-home rape kits for sexual assault survivors. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/radical-ethereum-entrepreneurs-are-redefining-what-rape-kit-means/">It&#8217;s a controversial company</a>, and we discuss critiques and opportunities,</li>
</ul>
<p>And that&#8217;s our show! No private equity deal can slow the Equity team down, so we&#8217;ll see you Monday!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Income-share agreements, or ISAs, are a way to bring flexibility to the often steep financial costs of higher education. The financial model allows a student to learn at zero upfront cost, and then pay any costs through a percentage of future income over time.</p>
<p>While the model has caught fire from a variety of trade schools and bootcamps, it’s a hard service to offer at scale. It required underwriting a risky group of people &#8212; and that costs money. Just last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/lambda-school-lays-off-65-employees-amid-restructuring/">a leader in the ISA space</a> Lambda School laid off 65 employees amid a broader restructuring.</p>
<p>It’s here that a startup like Blair, which graduated Y Combinator in 2019, could be of use. The startup today helps universities finance and offer income-share agreements, or ISAs, to students. The startup has two services: a capital arm (Blair Capital) for which it secured a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/blair-launches-100m-facility-to-fund-isas-for-students/"> $100 million debt facility</a>, and a services arm (Blair Servicing) that helps manage the flow of money, which just got a new tranche of capital to expand</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company told TechCrunch that it has raised a $6.3 million round led by Tiger Global. Other investors include Rainfall and 468 Capital, along with angels such as Teachable’s Ankur Nagpal and Vouch’s Sam Hodges. The raise came on top of a $1.1 million pre-seed round, bringing Blair’s total capital raised to date at $7.4 million.</p>
<p>A big portion of the venture capital money will go toward doubling or tripling Blair’s San Francisco team, said CEO Mike Mahlkow. It is especially investing in engineering and product, as well as a few senior hires in finance, compliance and the service side.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2149018" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2149018" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2149018" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC_Blair.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC_Blair.jpg 3205w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC_Blair.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC_Blair.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC_Blair.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC_Blair.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC_Blair.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC_Blair.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/TC_Blair.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2149018" class="wp-caption-text">The Blair founding team. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Blair</p></div></p>
<p>Notably, Blair&#8217;s eight person team is fully male. The lack of gender diversity, even as an early-stage startup with a handful of employees, could hurt its competitive advantage, recruiting prospects, and performance over time. About 25 percent of the employees are LGBT and 37.5% identify as non-white.</p>
<p>Blair started as a tool to underwrite students with loans that would pay for college, a sum that would eventually be repaid through an income-share agreement. It was similar to an Affirm for Education, where it could help students get access with low or nonexistent upfront costs.</p>
<p>“The model worked very well until March last year,” Mahlkow said. “And then the debt market was fairly dead, so we needed to shift our focus to a more software-like approach.” Now, Blair focuses on building ISA-based programs for schools, and underwrites loans based on certain programs at certain schools that have historical returns.</p>
<p>Most companies use its servicing piece &#8212; aka an operating system for offering ISAs &#8212; but a number of companies turn to Blair to help finance the costs of offering an ISA. Either colleges and bootcamps finance the ISA themselves and put it on the balance sheet, or they sell it to a company like Blair to get the money upfront and get repaid eventually.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Blair launches $100M facility to fund ISAs for students&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/blair-launches-100m-facility-to-fund-isas-for-students/embed/#?secret=dN3URw5V8r" data-secret="dN3URw5V8r" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Blair Servicing takes a percent of money from an ISA once a student is employed post-graduation, and Blair Capital takes a base fee plus a portion for the ISA as well.</p>
<p>While the company did not share exact numbers, it did say it has doubled its customers since February, tripling revenue during the same time period. Of course, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">a bet from the ever-ravenous Tiger Global is a statement. And, unlike his new investor, Mahlkow plans to keep growth sustainable and lean. Long-term, Blair is betting that outcome-based financing could get traction in more than just a savvy startup bootcamp but in how recruiting and placement works in various industries. The startup is in talks with a sports association and large companies that are working on upskilling and reskilling their workforces. Incentives are key in edtech, and Blair speaking that language as an early-stage startup is key as the sector moves more into the spotlight.</span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Twitch evidently has no issues getting people to spend time on its platform — even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/aocs-among-us-stream-topped-435000-concurrent-viewers/">politicians can draw huge crowds</a> by streaming themselves playing games. But monetizing video content is hard, and Twitch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/twitch-breaks-records-again-in-q2-topping-5b-total-hours-watched/">missed revenue targets</a> for the last few years.</p>
<p>So how does Twitch make money? And more importantly, what subtle psychology does it use within its iOS app to encourage viewers to spend more?</p>
<p>I’m a UX analyst and the founder of UX community <a href="https://builtformars.com">Built for Mars</a> — where I regularly tear down some of the best products in the world, showing you how they’re made, and, more importantly, <em>how they could be improved</em>.</p>
<p>I recently published my <a href="https://builtformars.com/spending-money-on-twitch/">analysis of Twitch</a>. But for Extra Crunch subscribers, I wanted to go a little deeper and bridge the gap between what Twitch does and how you can make meaningful changes to your product’s UX.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			In general, you should encourage the user to make the hard decision (i.e., to commit to subscribing), after understanding all the benefits.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>So here are three UX tips to discuss during your next team Zoom call.</p>
<h2>The Anchor Effect</h2>
<p>In short: The Anchor Effect is a heuristic bias whereby people will become attached (anchored) to an initial piece of information. For example, spending $1,000 on an iPhone may not seem like a bad deal if you saw an ad for the $1,500 one first — by comparison, it looks “cheap.”</p>
<p>On Twitch, when a new user subscribes to a channel for the first time, they’re shown the benefits of subscribing, and then asked how long they want those benefits for before being shown a price.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148511" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148511" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2148511" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/twitch-ux-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="673" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/twitch-ux-1.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/twitch-ux-1.png?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/twitch-ux-1.png?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/twitch-ux-1.png?resize=768,505 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/twitch-ux-1.png?resize=680,447 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/twitch-ux-1.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2148511" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitch</p></div></p>
<p>This type of bias is everywhere. For example, the order of your pricing tiers will affect conversions — which is likely why Mailchimp shows its pricing tiers in <a href="https://mailchimp.com/pricing/">reverse order</a>.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The Biden Administration has reportedly proposed significant changes to the capital gains tax, aiming to target the wealthiest Americans to help fund his historic aid programs.</p>
<p>If the current proposal goes into effect, it will have an impact on startup employees who aren&#8217;t (yet) wealthy. And it’s unlikely the Biden Administration has considered the consequences, because many of these employees aren’t yet in the highest tax bracket. But startup employees need to pay close attention to these changes when planning what to do with their stock options.</p>
<p>We don’t yet know what will end up in a passed bill, which may look very different from the originally proposed plan. This shouldn’t cause alarm for employees or cause them to avoid exercising options, but it is something they should be thinking about when planning their equity strategy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			When it comes to employee equity, the worst decision is always not having a plan of action.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As always, employees should work with their advisers to plan accordingly and get ahead of any changes.</p>
<h2>How changes in capital gains tax impact startup stock options</h2>
<p>Historically, long-term capital gains, or gains on assets held for over a year, have enjoyed preferential tax rates in comparison to short-term capital gains, which are assets held for less than a year. In Biden’s original proposal, he suggests raising the long-term capital gains rate to the highest ordinary income tax rate on income over $1 million.</p>
<p>If Biden’s changes are enacted, it means that there would no longer be preferential tax rates for those that make over $1 million on the sale of their shares post-IPO or as part of an acquisition. Many employees “go long” with their equity, selling them a year after exercising to benefit from long-term capital gains tax. Under this change, they may be limited to the amount of upside they can convert to preferential capital gains tax depending on their income levels and when they sell.</p>
<p>As with any tax legislation, the devil is in the details, many of which are still to be determined. These are the questions employees should be asking if the legislation moves forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the first $1 million in capital gains still taxed at preferential rates or do I factor in other sources of income to determine the $1 million threshold?</li>
<li>How can I plan around the sale of my shares to stay under the $1 million threshold?</li>
<li>Is there any impact on qualified small business stock (QSBS)?</li>
</ul>
<p>Clarity on these questions and details of the plan will provide critical information for employees looking to exercise if Biden’s tax plan advances in Congress.</p>
<h2>Capital gains tax rules have always been political</h2>
<p>Many presidents have expressed interest in changing the capital gains laws in the past. President Obama, for example, wanted to raise the capital gains tax. President Trump campaigned on capital gains rules, suggesting the carried interest rules, which are possible because of capital gains tax rules, be eliminated.</p>
<p>The questions now are: Will Biden be successful in addressing capital gains tax rules? And will the Democrats risk backlash or potential downsides driven by increased capital gains tax? Many experts suggest that the final legislation, if passed, will result in a capital gains tax increase, but much less than Biden’s original proposal. Some are suggesting Congress will settle on no more than 30% as the highest capital gain rates for those who earn more than $1 million.</p>
<p>Only time will tell, but the suggested tax plan may create a significant, if unintended, burden to startup employees more than anyone else.</p>
<h2>Planning around your equity</h2>
<p>There’s still a lot of uncertainty around what new tax legislation may look like or if it will happen at all. At this point, startup employees may not necessarily need to act on these potential changes, but they should be taking it into account when planning what to do with their equity and, more specifically, when they are planning to exercise.</p>
<p>Either way, employees should still strongly consider exercising their stock options (it’s a key benefit of working at a startup, after all). Taxes are just one consideration. For example, many companies have exercise deadlines after employees leave a company.</p>
<p>Even if rates to capital gains taxes change, exercising early may still have its benefits, as many employees may still be able to create a plan to sell up to a certain number of shares at preferential rates every year.</p>
<p>While Biden’s proposed plan is focused on changing the federal tax rates, state income tax considerations remain. Startup employees have been moving away from high-tax states such as California and New York in favor of no-income tax states such as Texas and Florida. Those that are planning a move may have a big incentive to exercise their options to limit California and New York’s reach on the shares.</p>
<p>It’s important that employees understand the advantages and disadvantages of exercising today versus waiting until after an IPO. When it comes to employee equity, the worst decision is always not having a plan of action.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX is fresh off a high for its Starship spacecraft development program, but according to CEO Elon Musk, it&#8217;s already looking ahead to potentially repeating its latest success with an unplanned early reusability experiment. Earlier this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/spacex-successfully-launches-and-lands-its-starship-prototype-rocket/">SpaceX flew the SN15 (i.e. 15th prototype) of its Starship from its development site near Brownsville, Texas, and succeeded in landing it upright for the first time</a>. Now, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1390569345361883136">Musk says they could fly the same prototype a second time</a>, a first for the Starship test and development effort.</p>
<p>The successful launch and landing on Wednesday included an ascent to around 30,000 feet, where the 150-foot-tall spacecraft flipped onto its &#8220;belly&#8221; and then descended back to Earth, returning vertical and firing its engines to slow its descent and touch down softly, standing upright. This atmospheric testing is a key step meant to help prove out the technologies and systems that will later help Starship return to Earth after its orbital launches. The full Starship launch system is intended to be completely reusable, including this vehicle (which will eventually serve as the upper stage) and the Super Heavy booster that the company is also in the process of developing.</p>
<p>A second test flight of SN15 is an interesting possibility among the options for the prototype. SpaceX will obviously be conducting a number of other check-outs and gathering as much data as it can from the vehicle, in addition to whatever it collected from onboard sensors, but the options for the craft after that basically amounted to stress testing it to failure, or dismantling it and studying the pieces. A second flight attempt is an interesting additional option that could provide SpaceX with a lot of invaluable data about its planned re-use of the production version of Starship.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Whether or not SpaceX actually does re-fly SN15 is still up in the air, but if it does end up being technically possible, it seems like a great learning opportunity for SpaceX that could help fast-track the overall development program.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We spoke to five investors to find out more about RPA. The general consensus? We're just getting started. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robotic process automation (RPA) has certainly<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/rpa-market-surges-investors-vendors-capitalize-pandemic-tech-shift/"> been getting a lot of attention</a> in the last year, with startups, acquisitions and IPOs all coming together in a flurry of market activity. It all seemed to culminate <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/as-uipath-closes-above-its-final-private-valuation-cfo-ashim-gupta-discusses-his-companys-path-to-market/">with UiPath&#8217;s IPO</a> last month. The company that appeared to come out of nowhere in 2017 eventually had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-meteoric-rise-from-unknown-startup-to-35b-rpa-juggernaut/">a final private valuation of $35 billion.</a> It then had the audacity to match that at its IPO. A few weeks later, it still has a market cap of over $38 billion in spite of the stock price fluctuating at points.</p>
<p>Was this some kind of peak for the technology or a flash in the pan? Probably not. While it all seemed to come together in the last year with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/no-code-workflow-and-rpa-line-up-for-their-automation-moment/">a big increase in attention</a> to automation in general during the pandemic, it&#8217;s a market category that has been around for some time.</p>
<p>RPA allows companies to automate a group of highly mundane tasks and have a machine do the work instead of a human. Think of finding an invoice amount in an email, placing the figure in a spreadsheet and sending a Slack message to Accounts Payable. You could have humans do that, or you could do it more quickly and efficiently with a machine. We&#8217;re talking mind-numbing work that is well suited to automation.</p>
<p>In 2019, Gartner found RPA was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/24/gartner-finds-rpa-is-fastest-growing-market-in-enterprise-software/">the fastest-growing category</a> in enterprise software. In spite of that, the market is still surprisingly small, with IDC estimates finding it will reach just $2 billion in 2021. That&#8217;s pretty tiny for the enterprise, but it shows that there&#8217;s plenty of room for this space to grow.</p>
<p>We spoke to five investors to find out more about RPA, and the general consensus was that we are just getting started. While we will continue to see the players at the top of the market &#8212; like UiPath, Automation Anywhere and Blue Prism &#8212; jockeying for position with the big enterprise vendors and startups, the size and scope of the market has a lot of potential and is likely to keep growing for some time to come.</p>
<p>To learn about all of this, we queried the following investors:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mallun/">Mallun Yen</a>, founder and partner, Operator Collective</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaidas/">Jai Das</a>, partner and president, Sapphire Ventures</li>
<li><a href="https://www.madrona.com/team-profiles/s-somasegar/">Soma Somasegar</a>, managing director, Madrona Venture Group</li>
<li><a href="https://capitalg.com/team/laela-sturdy/">Laela Sturdy</a>, general partner, CapitalG</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edsim/">Ed Sim</a>, founder and managing partner, Boldstart Ventures</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We have seen a range of RPA startups emerge in recent years, with companies like UiPath, Blue Prism and Automation Anywhere leading the way. As the space matures, where do the biggest opportunities remain?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mallun Yen</strong>: One of the fastest-growing categories of software, RPA has been growing at over 60% in recent years, versus 13% for enterprise software generally. But we’ve barely scratched the surface. The COVID-19 pandemic forced companies to shift how they run their business, how they hire and allocate staff.</p>
<p>Given that the workforce will remain at least partially permanently remote, companies recognize that this shift is also permanent, and so they need to make fundamental changes to how they run their businesses. It’s simply suboptimal to hire, train and deploy remote employees to run routine processes, which are prone to, among other things, human error and boredom.</p>
<p><strong>Jai Das</strong>: All the companies that you have listed are focused on automating simple repetitive tasks that are performed by humans. These are mostly data entry and data validation jobs. Most of these tasks will be automated in the next couple of years. The new opportunity lies in automating business processes that involve multiple humans and machines within complicated workflow using AI/ML.</p>
<p>Sometimes this is also called process mining. There have been BPM companies in the past that have tried to automate these business processes, but they required a lot of services to implement and maintain these automated processes. AI/ML is providing a way for software to replace all these services.</p>
<p><strong>Soma Somasegar</strong>: For all the progress that we have seen in RPA, I think it is still early days. The global demand for RPA market size in terms of revenue was more than $2 billion this past year and is expected to cross $20 billion in the coming decade, growing at a CAGR of more than 30% over the next seven to eight years, according to analysts such as Gartner.</p>
<p>That’s an astounding growth rate in the coming years and is a reflection of how early we are in the RPA journey and how much more is ahead of us. A recent study by Deloitte indicates that up to 50% of the tasks in businesses performed by employees are considered mundane, administrative and labor-intensive. That is just a recipe for a ton of process automation.</p>
<p>There are a lot of opportunities that I see here, including process discovery and mining; process analytics; application of AI to drive effective, more complex workflow automation; and using low code/no code as a way to enable a broader set of people to be able to automate tasks, processes and workflows, to name a few.</p>
<p><strong>Laela Sturdy</strong>: We’re a long way from needing to think about the space maturing. In fact, RPA adoption is still in its early infancy when you consider its immense potential. Most companies are only now just beginning to explore the numerous use cases that exist across industries. The more enterprises dip their toes into RPA, the more use cases they envision.</p>
<p>I expect to see market leaders like UiPath continue to innovate rapidly while expanding the breadth and depth of their end-to-end automation platforms. As the technology continues to evolve, we should expect RPA to penetrate even more deeply into the enterprise and to automate increasingly more &#8212; and more critical &#8212; business processes.</p>
<p><strong>Ed Sim:</strong> Most large-scale automation projects require a significant amount of professional services to deliver on the promises, and two areas where I still see opportunity include startups that can bring more intelligence and faster time to value. Examples include process discovery, which can help companies quickly and accurately understand how their business processes work and prioritize what to automate versus just rearchitecting an existing workflow.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://gajigesa.com/">GajiGesa</a>, a fintech startup that provides earned wage access (EWA) and other services for workers in Indonesia, has added strategic investors to help it launch new services and expand its user base. Its new backers include OCBC NISP Ventura, the venture capital arm of one of Indonesia’s largest banks, and the founders of grab-and-go coffee chain Kopi Kenangan. GajiGesa also recently expanded beyond the enterprise space with a new employee management system for SMEs and micro-SMEs. Called GajiTim, the app is aimed at businesses with between five to 100 workers and has gained more than 50,000 active users since it was launched in mid-March.</p>
<p>The amount of GajiGesa’s latest funding was undisclosed. The startup, launched last year by husband-and-wife team Vidit Agrawal and Martyna Malinowska, announced a $2.5 million seed round led by Defy.vc and Quest Ventures in February. Over the last quarter, GajiGesa’s enterprise customer base has doubled to more than 60 companies, representing tens of thousands of workers.</p>

<p>GajiGesa is part of a new wave of startups focused on digitizing the <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2020/07/17/smes-bailout-not-enough-demand-is-key.html">60 million small businesses </a>in Indonesia. Others include digital bookkeeping apps like BukuWarung and BukuKas for very small businesses, including neighborhood stores; Moka and Jurnal for larger companies; and CrediBook, which focuses on B2B businesses.</p>
<p>Before starting GajiGesa, Agrawal’s experience included serving as Uber’s first employee in Asia, while Malinowska was former product lead at Standard Chartered’s SC Ventures and alternative credit-scoring platform LenddoEFL. They created GajiGesa to give workers an alternative to payday and other high-interest lenders by allowing them to access their earned wages immediately, instead of waiting for semi-monthly or monthly paychecks. (Other companies that offer similar services around the world include <a href="https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/7066-square-payroll-getting-started-with-on-demand-pay">Square</a>, London-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/20/wagestream-closes-51m-series-a-to-plug-the-payday-gap-without-putting-workers-in-debt/">Wagestream</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/21/gusto-flexible-pay/">Gusto</a>). Based on a recent survey, GajiGesa said more than 75% of workers at companies that use its EWA feature have stopped using informal lenders for short-term needs.</p>

Its strategic partnership with Bank OCBC NISP, meanwhile, will help it launch more services.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2148970" style="width: 420px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Founder_Photo_1.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2148970" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2148970" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Founder_Photo_1.jpeg?w=510" alt="GajiGesa co-founders Vidit Agrawal and Martyna Malinowska" width="410" height="547" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Founder_Photo_1.jpeg 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Founder_Photo_1.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Founder_Photo_1.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Founder_Photo_1.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Founder_Photo_1.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2148970" class="wp-caption-text">GajiGesa co-founders Vidit Agrawal and Martyna Malinowska. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> GajiGesa</p></div></p>
<p>“One thing we are realizing is that a lot of employees who use the earned wage aspect of GajiGesa are expecting more kinds of products, either a loan product or an insurance product, and that’s where an opportunity arises to partner with a bank,” Agrawal told TechCrunch. About <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-apac/future-of-marketing/machine-learning/all-eyes-e-money-race-reach-180m-unbanked-indonesians/">two-thirds of Indonesia’s population is “unbanked,”</a> meaning they don’t have a bank account, so this also gives Bank OCBC NISP a chance to onboard new customers.</p>
<p>“Having a bank as a partner allows us to structure the right interest rate, the right size of products and create a larger impact,” said Malinowska.</p>
<p>GajiGesa does not charge interest rates or require collateral, as users are pre-approved by their employers. Instead, companies can decide to charge fees or offer GajiGesa as part of a benefits package. When a worker withdraws money, GajiGesa asks why they are using the Earned Wage Access feature, and presents that data to companies in an anonymized and aggregated format.</p>
<p>This allows employers to see what needs their work base has and potentially develop new benefits. For example, one of the top three reasons workers use EWA is to pay medical bills. “This is a strong signal to an employer that if you’re trying to retain employees, especially a blue-collar employee, even a basic insurance product might be very attractive for the family,” said Agrawal.</p>

<p>GajiGesa also discovered that many workers, especially in Tier 2 to Tier 3 cities, use its EWA to fund family businesses instead of taking out loans for working capital.</p>
<p>“A lot of families in Indonesia often have one member working in a factory with fixed salaries, and they have micro-industries at home, for example making wafers or stickers to sell in their communities or online,” said Agrawal. “They were going to loan sharks previously or private lenders for very expensive rates so they can run their business, and now the family member who is working in a factory can withdraw capital to support the family business so they don’t need to go to loan sharks.”</p>
<p>GajiTim was launched because the startup saw many inbound inquiries from SMEs, like restaurants, small factories and general stores, that have a lot of part-time workers. These businesses often rely on paper systems, including punch time cards, to track working hours and calculate paychecks. But this often results in disputes, so having an app that counts working hours and earned wages in real time gives workers more transparency and helps companies save time. GajiTim also has access to GajiGesa’s flagship EWA service and allows it to bring more clients onto the platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the past several years, institutional investors had largely shied away from China&#8217;s e-cigarette makers, an industry that was teeming with shoddy workshops and lacked regulatory oversight. But investors&#8217; attitude is changing as China sets in motion its strictest-ever regulation on electronic cigarettes.</p>
<p>Myst Labs, a Chinese e-cigarette maker co-founded in 2019 by Chenyue Xing, a chemist who was part of the team at Juul <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/27/myst-labs-profile/">that invented nicotine salts</a>, a key ingredient in vaping, recently raised &#8220;tens of thousands of dollars&#8221; from a Series B funding round. The financing was led by its existing investor, IMO Ventures. Thomas Yao, CEO and another co-founder of Myst, is a founding partner of IMO Ventures.</p>
<p>In March, one of China&#8217;s top tech policy makers <a href="https://www.miit.gov.cn/jgsj/zfs/gzdt/art/2021/art_e233af8bb3484ed59e98dbb79e49a0bd.html">published</a> a set of draft rules that would bring e-cigarettes under the same regulatory scope as traditional tobacco, which means vaping companies will need licenses for production, wholesale and retail operations in the world&#8217;s largest manufacturer and exporter of e-cigarettes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These changes will deal a blow to small producers with poor quality control, leaving the industry with a handful of established and compliant players, Fang Wang, head of marketing at Myst, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>For one, standardizing production is costly, Li said. From ceramic coils, to batteries, to fragrance, every component and ingredient of a vape will need to meet stringent requirements. E-cigarette companies will also need to pay tobacco taxes, an important source of tax revenue for the Chinese government.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0oXZESOi5F"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/from-surviving-to-thriving-as-a-hardware-startup/">From surviving to thriving as a hardware startup</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;From surviving to thriving as a hardware startup&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/from-surviving-to-thriving-as-a-hardware-startup/embed/#?secret=0oXZESOi5F" data-secret="0oXZESOi5F" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The other challenge is how to lower nicotine content. Many current products on the market have a relatively high nicotine concentration at 3-5%, so if China is in line with the European Union standard of<a href="https://seas.yale.edu/news-events/news/study-significant-differences-juul-s-chemical-make-and-health-risks-us-and-europe"> 1.7%</a>, many small brands will be forced out of business because they lack the know-how to produce low-nicotine vapes that still satisfy users&#8217; crave, suggested Li.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve received a lot of investor interest in the past few months. Before that, professional, institutional investors often avoided e-cigarette companies, but they are showing more willingness now as regulations take shape,&#8221; Li added.</p>
<p>Myst declined to list its other investors but said they include high-profile individuals involved in the e-bike sharing company Lime, Facebook and the bitcoin industry.</p>
<p>Most of Myst&#8217;s current sales are from China, where it has opened 600 stores and plans to reach a footprint of 1,000 stores in the next few quarters. Overseas, the startup has a retail footprint in Malaysia, Russia, Canada and the United Kingdom, where it&#8217;s selling in over 30 shopping malls and a few hospitals through its distribution partner, Ecigwizard.</p>
<p>The new funding will allow Myst to further expand its sales network and strengthen its research and development. The company prides itself on its product containing 1.7% nicotine, which it claims can deliver the effect of a 3% counterpart. At her lab, Xing is currently working on e-liquids with &#8220;natural tobacco contents&#8221; and without organic acids, additives that allow nicotine salts to vaporize and be absorbed.</p>
<p>Myst is still a relatively small player compared to China&#8217;s market dominator Relx, which went public in New York earlier this year and is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/china-relx-gears-up-for-us-entry/">applying for a license to sell in the U.S.</a> But Yao is optimistic about Myst&#8217;s future. Vaping, he said, is one of the fastest-growing consumer categories in China. Myst&#8217;s recent sales are tripling every three months.</p>
<p>&#8220;In other consumer areas, you rarely see a top player commanding 60-70% of the market, so there is still a lot of room for the top 10 players to grow,&#8221; the CEO said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coinbase shares tumbled today to their <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/coinbase-stock-price-lowest-since-ipo-crypto-exchange-2021-5-1030398413">lowest point</a> since the company began trading publicly on April 14. The market often moves in mysterious ways, but several drivers could be at play, including Coinbase&#8217;s high opening price at the time of its direct listing, its reliance on margins that are all but certain to drop owing to growing competition and the lack of a lock-up period, meaning more insiders might now be offloading some of their highly valued shares, driving down their price in the process.</p>
<p>Whether Coinbase&#8217;s shares fall further still is an open question, but one early investor, Garry Tan, believes what outsiders misunderstand about Coinbase is its potential going forward. Indeed, Tan has said previously that a major revenue driver for the company could ultimately tie to a startup called <a href="https://bisontrails.co/">Bison Trails</a> (also backed by Tan) that Coinbase <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/19/coinbase-acquires-bison-trails-crypto-builder-deal/">quietly acquired</a> late last year for an estimated $80 million in stock and that Tan recently likened to an AWS inside of the cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
<p>Curious to learn more, we talked recently with Joe Lallouz, the co-founder and CEO of Bison Trails, which raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/kleiner-perkins-joins-24-5m-funding-led-by-blockchain-capital-for-bison-trails">$35 million from investors</a> and is now being run as an independent product line by Coinbase. We asked Lallouz &#8212; who previously co-founded and <a href="https://blog.etsy.com/news/2014/etsy-acquires-grand-st/">sold a company to Etsy</a> &#8212; about the opportunity he&#8217;s chasing and how his 70-person team fends off what appears to be a growing number of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/alchemy-raises-80m-at-a-505m-valuation-to-be-the-aws-for-blockchain/">direct competitors</a>. Our conversation has been edited for length below. To listen to our full conversation, including more specifics about Bison&#8217;s operations, you can <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/850276/8438468">do that here</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: Your last company connected hardware makers with buyers. What led you to start a crypto infrastructure business?</strong></p>
<p>JL: First, I often speak in the plural &#8216;we&#8217; because I have a co-founder [Aaron Henshaw] who I&#8217;ve worked with on every company for about 20  years. Prior to Bison Trails, the company that was acquired by Etsy was a pretty large marketplace and I [remained] on the leadership team for a few years, and it was actually there that my interest in crypto and Bitcoin and the blockchain space was really piqued &#8212; mostly in the form as an investor. I do have a technical background, I&#8217;m an engineer. Aaron is an engineer. And so this idea of programmable money was really interesting to me, and I start doing some angel investing, and suddenly, some of the weirdest and smartest people I&#8217;ve ever met were switching careers and focusing on building blockchains or blockchain technology. And [Aaron] and I couldn&#8217;t get away from this idea that blockchains and the technology that powers blockchains &#8212; crypto protocols &#8212; were going to be super influential in every piece of software that&#8217;s built over the next 20 years.</p>
<p><strong>TC: What was the next step?</strong></p>
<p>JL: It was a whole lot of experimentation. [Aaron and I] probably each built about three or four different products that weren&#8217;t Bison Trails before we built Bison Trails. For one reason or another, they probably weren&#8217;t valuable or viable as products, but they did give us an incredible amount of insight into what the blockchain ecosystem needed. There was a huge gap in the blockchain market in the infrastructure space. Just really simple things like connecting to a blockchain network, reading from the blockchain network, writing to that blockchain network, doing very blockchain-native things like staking and mining &#8212; all that stuff that you may have heard about or read about, it just took a tremendous amount of time.</p>

<p><strong>TC: So you created this company to make it easier for folks to not have to spend time on those things. But you&#8217;re not alone. Last week, a company called Alchemy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/alchemy-raises-80m-at-a-505m-valuation-to-be-the-aws-for-blockchain/">raised money</a> from Coatue and Addition to do something similar. Are you direct rivals?</strong></p>
<p>JL: Not exactly. This isn&#8217;t a zero sum community. Everyone who&#8217;s focused on building blockchain products &#8212; whether they&#8217;re new blockchains, or infrastructure, or companies around it &#8212; is incredibly collaborative.</p>
<p>I do know Alchemy and another company that does similar stuff called <a href="https://infura.io/">Infura</a> and a couple other companies that maybe haven&#8217;t raised financing recently so [haven&#8217;t been in the news] but are doing really great work in the space to make it easier for people to build. And this isn&#8217;t uncommon in a nascent technology space, where companies come in and say, &#8216;This is a really hard piece of technology to work.&#8217; With blockchains, in particular, we need to make it easier, and different companies are doing that from different angles.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Whose life are you making easier?</strong></p>
<p>JL: We&#8217;ve seen a lot of success in supporting the world&#8217;s biggest crypto companies. Prior to Coinbase acquiring Bison Trails, we&#8217;d announced partnerships with Coinbase to help power their staking nodes proof-of-stake protocols, which is a paradigm shift in the blockchain space. But we&#8217;ve also been helping a lot of the other companies that are getting into the space, everyone from that one person who has a smart contract and a dream, all the way to the world&#8217;s biggest financial institutions that are building new crypto products. Whether banks or neobanks, all of them are trying to build on top of these blockchains and a lot of them have been Bison Trail customers for years.</p>

<p><strong>TC: You mentioned the shift to proof of stake from proof of work. Proof of work centers on mining cryptocurrency and proof of stake sounds a little like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/10/wanted-founders-in-favor-of-tenured-voting/">tenured voting</a>, meaning people are getting rewarded for holding on to currencies longer than others and having a bigger position in them. Is that anywhere near accurate?</strong></p>
<p>JL: It&#8217;s almost simpler than that. At its core, the blockchain is a ledger, and a whole lot of people who don&#8217;t work together maintain that ledger, which is how mining works. Proof of stake works the same way, but if you hold currency in that blockchain, you vote on what the state of the ledger is. So rather than relying on complex mining algorithms and these large mining operations like Bitcoin does, it relies on people who are incentivized for the state of the blockchain to be right to be correct, because they hold the currency to vote. So really all it is, is a mechanism to incentivize everyday holders of any token to vote on the blocks that are being produced.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And this is already happening.</strong></p>
<p>JL: So it&#8217;s already happening. One of the major blockchains that&#8217;s in the middle of this shift is Ethereum 1.0 to Ethereum 2.0. Ethereum has obviously become a very popular blockchain because it was one of the first to enable very intricate, smart contracts, which enables folks to build applications on top of it. And the reason Ethereum has been making the shift is to help it scale. The process of proof of work &#8212; mining &#8212; can bog down the scalability of a blockchain, meaning how fast it is, how expensive it is, how easy it is to post transactions, and to update the ledger and to maintain the ledger. So this has been a pretty serious trend because it enables blockchains to reach more people and power more intricate applications. It&#8217;s a really key piece to blockchain adoption.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And to underscore what Bison Trails is offering to do, what are the features exactly that you&#8217;re promising your customers, and do you charge a conventional monthly subscription for these features and services?</strong></p>
<p>JL: We&#8217;re a platform not unlike Google Cloud or an AWS where if you&#8217;re a builder or someone who wants to participate in a chain, you come to us and instead of needing a team of engineers to spin up nodes and run those and make sure that they&#8217;re up and running so that, say, your wallet app is able to connect to a blockchain or that you can take on a new chain or stake on Ethereum, you can instead just click a few buttons in our interface and do that really easily.</p>
<p>The business model is really what we call crypto-native SaaS, so folks will pay us in a combination of U.S. dollars, or the crypto equivalent &#8212; in some cases like a stablecoin. But also each of the proof-of-stake protocols, as you participate in them, you&#8217;re rewarded for participating them, and Bison Trails as a company takes a small cut of that reward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank has picked its bet in China&#8217;s flourishing industrial robotics space. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/youibot">Youibot</a>, a four-year-old startup that makes autonomous mobile robots for a range of scenarios, said it has notched close to 100 million yuan ($15.47 million) in its latest funding round led by SoftBank Ventures Asia, the Seoul-based early-stage arm of the global investment behemoth.</p>
<p>In December, SoftBank Ventures Asia led the financing round for another Chinese robotics startup called KeenOn, which focuses on delivery and service robots.</p>
<p>Youibot&#8217;s previous investors BlueRun Ventures and SIG also participated in the round. The startup, based in Shenzhen where it went through SOSV&#8217;s HAX hardware accelerator program, <a href="https://www.youibot.com/newsinfo/1066790.html?templateId=1133604">secured three financing rounds</a> during 2020 as businesses and investors embraced industrial automation to minimize human contact. Youibot has raised more than 200 million yuan to date.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by a group of PhDs from China&#8217;s prestigious Xi&#8217;an Jiaotong University, Youibot develops solutions for factory automation and logistics management, as well as inspection and maintenance for various industries. For example, its robots can navigate around a yard of buses, inspect every tire of the vehicles and provide a detailed report for maintenance, a feature that helped it rack up Michelin&#8217;s contract.</p>

<p>Youibot&#8217;s &#8220;strongest suits&#8221; are in electronics manufacturing and electric power patrol, the company&#8217;s spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The startup is also seeing high growth in its semiconductor business, with customers coming from several prominent front-end wafer fabs, which use the firm&#8217;s robots for chip packaging, testing and wafer production. Youibot declined to disclose their names due to confidentiality.</p>
<p>Chinese clients that it named include CRRC Zhuzhou, a state-owned locomotive manufacturer; Huaneng Group, a state-owned electricity generation giant; Huawei and more. China currently comprises 80% of Youibot&#8217;s total revenues, while overseas markets are rapidly catching up. The firm&#8217;s revenues tripled last year from 2020.</p>
<p>Youibot plans to spend the fresh proceeds on research and development in its mobile robots and proprietary software, team building and market expansion.</p>
