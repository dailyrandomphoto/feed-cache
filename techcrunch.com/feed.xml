										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the same day that Deliveroo&#8217;s IPO <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/what-to-make-of-deliveroos-rough-ipo-debut/">fizzled at the start of trading</a>, Compass announced via a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001563190/000119312521101664/d36119ds1a.htm">fresh S-1 filing</a> that it will reduce the number of shares in its impending flotation and sell them at a lower price.</p>
<p>The move by Compass, a venture-backed residential brokerage, to lower its implied public-market valuation and sell fewer shares is a rebuke of the company&#8217;s earlier optimism regarding its valuation and ability to raise capital. The company&#8217;s IPO is still slated to generate as much as a half-billion dollars, so it can hardly be called a failure if it executes at its rejiggered price range, but the cuts matter.</p>
<p>Especially when we consider several other factors. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/deliveroo-prices-its-shares-on-the-lse-at-3-90-at-the-lower-end-of-the-range-with-a-market-cap-of-7-59b/">Deliveroo IPO</a>, as discussed this morning, was impacted by more than mere economics. And there are questions regarding how interested seemingly more conservative countries&#8217; stock exchanges will prove in growth-oriented, unprofitable companies.</p>
<p>But added to the mix are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/the-technology-selloff-is-getting-to-be-somewhat-material/">recent declines</a> in the valuation of public software companies, effectively repricing the value of high-margin, recurring revenue. The reasons behind that particular change are several, but may include a rotation by public investors into other asset categories, or an air-letting from a sector that may have enjoyed some valuation inflation in the last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The killer use case for AR/VR might just be warfare.</p>
<p>Today, Microsoft announced that it has received a contract to outfit the United States Army with tens of thousands of augmented reality headsets based on the company&#8217;s HoloLens tech. This contract could be worth as much as $21.88 billion over 10 years, the company says.</p>
<p>Microsoft will be fulfilling an order for 120,000 AR headsets for the Army based on their Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) design. The modified design upgrades the capabilities of the HoloLens 2 for the needs of soldiers in the field.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The program delivers enhanced situational awareness, enabling information sharing and decision-making in a variety of scenarios,&#8221;  a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/03/31/army-moves-microsoft-hololens-based-headset-from-prototyping-to-production-phase/">blog post</a> from Microsoft&#8217;s Alex Kipman reads.</p>
<p>The contract builds on the two-year $480 million contract that Microsoft won back in 2018 to outfit the U.S. Army with augmented reality tech. At the time, the contract detailed that the deal could potentially result in follow-on orders of more than 100,000 headsets. “Augmented reality technology will provide troops with more and better information to make decisions. This new work extends our longstanding, trusted relationship with the Department of Defense to this new area,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement sent to TechCrunch at the time.</p>
<p>Microsoft says this announcement marks the transition from prototyping these designs to producing and rolling them out in the field.</p>
<p>This is a massive scaleup for augmented reality tech that has seen few large-scale rollouts and gives Microsoft a government contractor budget to tackle base technology problems that could scale down to consumer and enterprise-level devices in the future. Many of the industry&#8217;s biggest players in augmented reality have been reluctant or outspoken in their avoidance of military contracts but Microsoft has remained undeterred in competing for these contracts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Trump&#8217;s daughter-in-law Lara Trump <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CND8tIwrfc4/">promoted a new interview</a> with the former president on Facebook and Instagram Tuesday, but a workaround to Trump&#8217;s ban on two of the world&#8217;s most popular social networks wasn&#8217;t long for this world.</p>
<p>She was apparently swiftly cautioned by Facebook that anything posted &#8220;in the voice of President Trump&#8221; is not currently allowed on Facebook or Instagram and would be subject to removal. Trump himself remains banned on Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/facebook-oversight-board-trump-facebook-suspension/">pending a decision by the Oversight Board</a>, the external governing body the company set up to tackle it thorniest platform policy decisions.</p>
<p>Those rules apply to any accounts or pages associated with the Trump campaign as well as any belonging to former surrogates for the campaign, two categories that Lara Trump&#8217;s account falls into. Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch that <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LaraLTrump/posts/1547529562119509">screenshots depicting emails</a> from the company were legitimate.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Facebook does still make a news exemption for Trump, presumably for something more akin to a &#8220;60 Minutes&#8221; interview, but in this case he was being interviewed by someone involved in his campaign who then planned to promote the video on a campaign-associated account.</p>
<p>While Facebook won&#8217;t host the video itself, Lara Trump opted for a workaround to the workaround, linking to the interview on Rumble, a video sharing website that saw an<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90574842/what-is-rumble-meet-the-video-platform-trumps-supporters-are-flocking-to"> influx of Trump supporters late last year</a>.</p>
<p>She also posted to the video on The Right View, a web-based show previously produced by the Trump campaign that the Washington Post describes as &#8220;a sort of pro-Trump answer to ABC’s &#8216;The View.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Fox News announced this week that it would bring <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2021/03/29/fox-lara-trump-hire/">Lara Trump into the fold</a>, hiring the member of the Trump family on as a paid contributor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last year wasn&#8217;t an easy one for just about anybody, but <a href="https://projectinclude.org/remote-work-report/">a new report from Project Include</a> shows that the shift to remote work affected some groups more negatively than others. Unsurprisingly, it was people already struggling against harassment and bias, particularly women of color and those identifying as LGBTQ, who saw the biggest jumps in those behaviors.</p>
<p>The report is based on a survey of about 2,800 people and interviews with tech workers and subject matter experts in numerous countries and industries. There&#8217;s not a lot of good news in it, but why should there be? Sadly, the unprecedented confluence of multiple disasters in 2020 has spawned another, quieter disaster in working conditions.</p>
<p>Remote work has changed how people interact, and the result of that has been, among other things, significant increases to gender- and race-based harassment. Over a quarter of those surveyed reported an increase in harassment and workplace hostility — and of those experiencing increases, 98% were women or nonbinary and 99% were nonwhite.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Trans people were much more likely to experience harassment and hostility, as were were all Black respondents, especially women and nonbinary people. Asian, Latinx, and multiracial respondents also reported more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132803" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/include-harassment.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132803" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2132803" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/include-harassment.png" alt="Graphs illustrating the numbers of various demographics experiencing harassment." width="1024" height="1093" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/include-harassment.png 1405w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/include-harassment.png?resize=141,150 141w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/include-harassment.png?resize=281,300 281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/include-harassment.png?resize=768,820 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/include-harassment.png?resize=637,680 637w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/include-harassment.png?resize=47,50 47w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2132803" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Project Include</p></div></p>
<p>The switch to remote productivity and communication seems to have made this harassment difficult to avoid. An increase in reliance on 1:1 communication via chat, email and video calls meant working directly with harassers was inescapable and difficult to report. &#8220;Respondents noted that individual harassers would follow them across online spaces to where they were,&#8221; the report adds.</p>
<p>People with mental health conditions, particularly those with PTSD, were twice as likely to report experiencing harassment than those without.</p>
<p>Changes to expectations and tools meant big increases to anxiety and drops in work-life balance. Nearly two-thirds of respondents reported being expected to work longer days, and more than half said they felt pressure (or were plainly expected) to be online outside of official working hours. The survey reported that 10% said managers were checking in daily, and 5% reported two or more times per day. Others complained about surveillance software like keystroke and screen monitoring.</p>
<p>Workers with disabilities found that companies often chose productivity and collaboration tools that had inadequate accessibility features — for example, Zoom calls without automatic captioning that required lip-reading to keep up.</p>
<p>As for reporting harassment, most said they did not do so because they didn&#8217;t trust their HR department or company at large to handle the complaints properly or respond fairly. One person even reported that it was a person within HR itself that was harassing them. Less than half of respondents said they trusted their company to respond to these issues properly; about a third said they did <em>not</em> trust the company to do so; about the same number said their workplace doesn&#8217;t even have the tools to intervene or solve any issue they might bring up.</p>
<p>These and more statistics are available in the report, which goes into detail on a number of other issues and behaviors, as well as making a number of suggestions as to what companies can do to step up. Of course if your company has waited until now to take action, that&#8217;s a problem right there. But in general the idea is to actually listen to workers, hold leadership accountable and take actions with measurable impact like no-meeting days and generous time-off policies.</p>
<p>Most of all, don&#8217;t expect things to just &#8220;go back to normal.&#8221; CEO of Vaya Consulting Nicole Sanchez puts it best as quoted in the report:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most companies are not ready to bring people back together physically, even electively. People at the executive level are going to be shocked to find out that what they’re actually dealing with is a whole lot of live active trauma. A lot of companies that go back and try and make it like it was before will wonder, &#8220;Why aren’t these pieces fitting together anymore?&#8221; And the answer, I hope, that we get collective agreement on is: Those pieces never fit together. They just fit together for you. Now, you’re seeing all the seams and all of the vulnerabilities, and now you have to reinvent your company.</p></blockquote>
<p>The authors of the report include Ellen Pao of <a href="https://projectinclude.org/">Project Include itself</a>, Yang Hong of Shoshin Insights, and Caroline Sinders of Convocation Design + Research.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://datapeople.io/">Datapeople</a>, a startup that sells software designed to make recruiting more equitable, announced that it has raised $8 million across two funding events, including a $5 million round in mid-2020.</p>
<p>The company, which counts <a href="https://uncorkcapital.com/">Uncork Capital</a>, <a href="https://nextviewventures.com/">NextView Ventures</a> and <a href="https://firstround.com/">First Round Capital</a> as backers, does two things. Its initial product, what Datapeople calls &#8220;Language Analytics,&#8221; scans job postings, offering suggested edits to customers to help them attract a more diverse group of applicants.</p>
<p>And, coming shortly, Datapeople is rolling out what it calls &#8220;Recruiting Analytics,&#8221; a service that provides a high-level view of a company&#8217;s aggregate recruiting efforts. The recruiting side of its software service will keep tabs on diversity data such as the pace at which a company&#8217;s job posting attracts women against related jobs&#8217; own performance, among other bits of data-focused reporting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Per a release that TechCrunch viewed ahead of publication, Datapeople&#8217;s view isn&#8217;t that there aren&#8217;t products in the market that provide charts of how a company&#8217;s recruiting process may be performing at a surface level. Instead its view is when it comes to asking more complex questions about the treatment of different groups of people, current solutions fall short. That&#8217;s the space it intends to place its new product.</p>

<p>TechCrunch caught up with Datapeople co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reyland/">Phillip Reyland</a> to chat about its recent capital raises and business performance.</p>
<p>According to Reyland, his startup&#8217;s language product is sold to in-house recruiting teams at mid-market through Fortune 100 companies. Related startup <a href="http://Textio.com">Textio</a> <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/textio-raises-12m-seattle-startup-looks-reach-job-candidates-writing-technology/">raised more capital last spring</a>, implying that there&#8217;s enough market demand for job-focused language tooling to support at least two venture-backed companies.</p>
<p>On the recruiting analytics side of the Datapeople house, Reyland told TechCrunch that the recruiting industry is today where marketing was 20 years ago. Given the rise in marketing software that we&#8217;ve seen over that time frame, Datapeople sees a long, broad market for new tooling in its target market.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to track how well Datapeople&#8217;s new product performs, as Reyland told TechCrunch that 2020 was the best year in its history. That, plus the capital it raised last year, means that the startup has a high bar to clear this year. Perhaps the new service will help it meet said goals.</p>
<p>The company intends to roughly double its mid-30s staff number to meet those expectations. It&#8217;s off to a good start, with Reyland telling TechCrunch that its Q1 2021 was &#8220;awesome.&#8221; As the company is, per its fundraising history, pretty early-stage, we&#8217;re willing to wait one more round to hammer it for more specifics.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">In 2019, my colleague Matt Harris coined the term “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewharris/2019/11/19/fintech-the-fourth-platform-part-one/?sh=1b757166cb28">embedded fintech</a>” to describe how virtually all software-driven companies will soon embed financial services into their applications, from sending and receiving payments to enabling lending, insurance and banking services, an idea that quickly spread within the fintech community.</p>
<p>Vertical apps such as Toast for restaurants, Squire for barbershops and Shopmonkey for car repair shops will deliver financial services to businesses in the future rather than traditional, stodgy financial institutions.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">

			Embedded procurement is the natural evolution of embedded fintech.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The embedded fintech movement has just begun, but there is already a sister concept percolating: embedded procurement. In this next wave, businesses will buy things they need through vertical B2B apps, rather than through sales reps, distributors or an individual merchant’s website.</p>
<p>If you own a coffee shop, wouldn’t it be convenient to schedule recurring orders for beans and milk from the same software portal where you process payments, manage accounting and handle payroll? The companies that figured out how to monetize financial services via embedded fintech are well positioned to monetize through procurement, too.</p>
<p>Embedded procurement is the natural evolution of embedded fintech. The salon software company Fresha is a typical embedded fintech story. Fresha’s platform is an online and mobile platform specially designed for spas and salons, encompassing appointment scheduling, reporting and analytics, marketing promotions, and point-of-sale capabilities. The software is free for salons; Fresha monetizes through payment processing.</p>
<p>In the future, Fresha will undoubtedly turn to embedded procurement, becoming a logical place for business owners to order and manage inventory like shampoo, scissors, brushes and other supplies. In turn, Fresha can aggregate demand from thousands of spas to place orders with its suppliers, leveraging its scale to negotiate more favorable pricing on behalf of its customers. Borrowing a concept from the healthcare world, vertical software companies will become group purchasing organizations in every sector.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Picture it. It’s September, and you’re at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleyplus&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> about to present your virtual elevator pitch to thousands of attendees around the world. In the short span of 120 seconds, your company will become known to a rapt audience of early-startup influencers including potential customers, investors, tech icons and the media.</p>
<p>An awesome opportunity, amirite? Don’t just picture it — make it happen by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleyplus&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=">exhibiting in Startup Alley</a>. Yes, it really is that easy. Every early-stage startup that exhibits in Startup Alley gets to pitch to the Disrupt audience.</p>
<p>It’s not only a tremendous opportunity to practice, pitching at Disrupt can have long-term benefits. Don’t just take our word for it. Jessica McLean, the director of marketing and communications at Infinite-Compute, talks about her company’s experience pitching last year at Disrupt 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Startup Alley exhibitors got to pitch to attendees, and we were thrilled with how it went. I recorded the pitch, and now we just shoot potential investors a quick video saying, “take a look at our CEO pitching at Disrupt 2020.” It’s a great piece of marketing collateral.”</p>
<p>Along with the epic exposure that comes from pitching at Disrupt, Startup Alley exhibitors also have a shot at being interviewed during one of the many hour-long Startup Alley Crawls. Each tech category gets its own crawl — we’ll post the specific times in the agenda closer to the show’s opening — and TechCrunch journalists will interview a select number of exhibiting founders from each category.</p>
<p>Here’s yet another reason to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleyplus&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=TRUE">buy a Startup Alley Pass</a> sooner rather than later. Your pass makes you eligible to participate in Startup Alley+, a curated experience designed to help founders increase their opportunities for exposure and business growth. Only 50 companies — chosen by TechCrunch — will form this cohort, and there&#8217;s no additional cost. Here’s the kicker — the benefits start months before Disrupt 2021 begins. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalleyplus&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=&amp;display=">Learn more about the Startup+ experience here</a>.</p>
<p>Did you know that TechCrunch editors award two Startup Alley exhibitors with a Startup Battlefield Wild Card? Those founders get to compete for $100,000 in the always epic Startup Battlefield competition. Who knows? You might follow in the steps of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/15/recordgram-thinks-your-phone-is-the-new-recording-studio/?_ga=2.255114062.739798790.1561385469-21262877.1546616128&amp;_gac=1.128542206.1559149543.CjwKCAjw27jnBRBuEiwAdjQXDPwyBPHjxvb8oEViYRSrVto53q8pleF-kUlsDn9V24VnEGPCqfrR2BoCsvQQAvD_BwE">RecordGram</a>. That startup, chosen from Startup Alley as a Wild Card, went on to win the Startup Battlefield competition.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Exhibiting in Startup Alley is a savvy strategy. You’ll pitch your company to a global audience, gain valuable exposure, meet and connect with influencers and potential customers. Win-win-win.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram today is officially launching a new feature called Remix, which offers a way to record your Reels video alongside a video from another user. The option is similar to TikTok&#8217;s existing Duets feature, which also lets users to react to or interact with another person&#8217;s video content while creating their own. Instagram&#8217;s new feature has been in public testing before today, so some Instagram users may have already gained access.</p>
<p>We recently reported on Instagram&#8217;s plans with Remix, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/snapchat-is-developing-its-own-take-on-tiktok-duets-with-a-new-remix-feature/">when noting that Snapchat was developing a Remix feature</a> of its own. In fact, Snapchat is also using the name &#8220;Remix&#8221; for its TikTok Duets rival that&#8217;s currently in development.</p>
<p>On TikTok, Duets are a key part to making the app feel more like a social network and less of just a passive video-watching experience. Users take advantage of Duets to sing, dance, joke or act alongside another user&#8217;s video. They will do things like cook someone else&#8217;s recipe, record a reaction video, or even just watch a video from a smaller creator to give them a boost.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, TikTok competitors &#8212; like Instagram Reels, Snapchat&#8217;s Spotlight or YouTube&#8217;s Shorts, for example &#8212; have launched their short-form video experiences without a full set of engagement or editing features like TikTok has, making their apps feel like pale knock-offs of the original. Remix on Reels is a first step towards changing that perception, by giving users at least one important option to engage and collaborate with their fellow creatives.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Now you can use the Remix feature in Reels to create your own reel next to one that already exists <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f3ad.png" alt="🎭" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Whether you’re capturing your reaction, responding to friends or bringing your own magic to trends, Remix is another way to collab on Instagram <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/eU8x74Q3yf">pic.twitter.com/eU8x74Q3yf</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>To use the new Remix feature, you&#8217;ll first tap on the three-dot menu on a Reel and select the new &#8220;Remix this Reel&#8221; option. The screen will then split into the original Reel and your own new one, where you can begin to record side-by-side with the original. When you&#8217;ve finished, you can tweak other aspects of the recording like the volume of the original video or your audio and you can optionally add a voiceover. After applying these or any other edits, you can publish the Remix.</p>
<p>The feature will only be available on newly uploaded Reels &#8212; so unfortunately, if you want your older Reels to be duetted, you either need to reupload them or go back to your old Reel and specifically enable Remix.</p>

<p>Your Remixes will appear alongside any other Reels you&#8217;ve recorded on the Reels tab on your Instagram profile, and you&#8217;ll be able to track who has remixed your content through Instagram&#8217;s Activity tab.</p>
<p>The feature is rolling out, starting today, says Instagram. It will be enabled by default on all new Reels published from a public account.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Everyone is scrambling to build a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/twitter-spaces-arrives-on-android-ahead-of-clubhouse/">Clubhouse</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/">clone</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/facebooks-clubhouse-rival-looks-a-lot-like-clubhouse-right-now/">right now</a>, but for Discord it makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>With everyone stuck at home searching for safe ways to rekindle their social lives over the last year, Discord&#8217;s appeal exploded. The company cites new behavior it observed during the pandemic as the inspiration for Stage Channels, a new feature that will facilitate more structured voice chats with designated speakers and listeners.</p>
<p>Voice chat is already Discord&#8217;s core feature. It&#8217;s been that way for years, offering gamers a crystal clear, seamless voice chat service that blew the functionality of in-game chat services out of the water. But there&#8217;s no denying the Clubhouse-inspired voice event zeitgeist at the moment, even if ultimately Discord was there first in many ways.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2132346" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132346" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2132346 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png?w=680" alt="Discord Stage Channels" width="680" height="484" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png?resize=1536,1092 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png?resize=2048,1456 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Invited.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2132346" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Discord</p></div></p>
<p>Discord says the new kind of channel will be useful for stuff like voice-based AMAs and interviews, book clubs and even karaoke. The new channels will capture activity that&#8217;s already happening on Discord, making it way easier for anyone who runs a server to host formalized conversations without needing to mess around with a bunch of granular user permissions stuff.</p>
<p>The new channel type fits right in with Discord&#8217;s existing vibe. Stage Channels do what&#8217;s on the label, allowing anyone who runs a Discord to curate a speaker experience and use moderator tools to control who gets the mic and when. Much like Clubhouse (or Zoom), participants can raise their hand to speak. They can also slink out quietly.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132356" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132356" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2132356 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="484" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png?resize=1536,1092 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png?resize=2048,1456 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Welcome.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2132356" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Discord</p></div></p>
<p>Stage Channels will be specific to community servers, which are geared around larger groups on Discord. To enable the new kind of channel, server owners will need to convert a channel to a community server if it isn&#8217;t one already.</p>
<p>Because Discord is Discord, discovery for voice-based events won&#8217;t work like it does on Clubhouse, which serves up user-created live events front and center to anyone who opens the app. Community servers on Discord can apply to be featured in the server discovery menu, but the app&#8217;s focus remains on private, intimate groups and larger interest-based communities that you&#8217;re already a part of.</p>

<p>Given its healthy user base and existing utility as the go-to app for casual, seamless voice chat, Discord is well positioned to capture a completely different market for voice-based events. The app is a mainstay of the gaming community and generally skews young, putting it in contrast with the entrepreneurs, VCs and brands that flocked to Clubhouse&#8217;s early buzz.</p>
<p>Discord&#8217;s gaming DNA isn&#8217;t holding it back. In recent years, Discord has grown beyond its gaming roots without betraying them, expanding into a seamless chat experience for everything from college study groups to influencer fan hubs. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/filing-discord-is-raising-up-to-140m-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-7b/">Discord doubled its valuation</a> within <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/discord-now-has-a-3-5b-valuation-and-100m-for-a-sales-pitch-lighter-on-the-gaming/">six months.</a> Just a quarter later, Microsoft is reportedly in talks with the company on a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/23/technology/microsoft-discord-deal.html">$10 billion deal</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Finance for Founders</strong></p>
<p><em>As a founder, you not only have to master your company’s finances, but you also have to tackle your own personal finances. Managing your money as a founder comes with a unique set of questions (see: QSBS). Leveraging her expertise from LearnVest and as a Certified Financial Planner<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, Alexa von Tobel (founder/managing partner, Inspired Capital Partners) will share financial planning best practices so founders can remove this layer of stress from the pressure of building a business.</em></p>
<p><strong>Building and Leading a Sales Team</strong></p>
<p><em>Contrary to popular opinion, even the very best products don’t sell themselves. Salespeople do. Hear from Zoom’s Chief Revenue Officer, at the helm of the company’s sales team during the biggest period of growth of any software company ever, lay out how to build a stellar sales team.</em></p>
<p><strong>Bootstrapping and the Power of Product-Led Growth</strong></p>
<p><em>Building a bootstrapped company forces you to be creative. For Calendly, it pointed the company toward a product-led growth model built on virality. Hear from Calendly’s Tope Awotona and OpenView’s Blake Bartlett, as they cover pro tips on bootstrapping, PLG and when a profitable company should consider raising capital.</em></p>
<p>There’s plenty more to explore, and TC Early Stage offers something for everyone. Here’s what Chloe Leaaetoa, founder of Socicraft, told us about her experience at Early Stage last year.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This conference caters to early stage founders no matter where you are in your process. Maybe your pitch deck is set but you need to hire internationally — they had a session on that. The range of topics was all-encompassing.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Don’t worry about missing out. Your ticket includes access to video on demand, so you can catch any presentation you miss once the conference ends.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">We’re living in a phenomenal moment for machine learning (ML), what<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sonali-sambhus/"> Sonali Sambhus</a>, head of developer and ML platform at Square, describes as “the democratization of ML.” It’s become the foundation of business and growth acceleration because of the incredible pace of change and development in this space.</p>
<p>But for engineering and team leaders without an ML background, this can also feel overwhelming and intimidating. I regularly meet smart, successful, highly competent and normally very confident leaders who struggle to navigate a constructive or effective conversation on ML &#8212; even though some of them lead teams that engineer it.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Integrating ML teams effectively into the business starts with an understanding of what makes the right candidate and how to structure the team for maximum velocity and focus.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>I’ve spent more than two decades in the ML space, including work at Apple to build the world&#8217;s largest online app and music store. As the senior director of engineering, anti-evil, at Reddit, I used ML to understand and combat the <a href="https://redditblog.com/2019/07/29/the-benefits-of-machine-learning-to-study-small-dataset-of-social-conversations/">dark side of the web</a>.</p>
<p>For this piece, I interviewed a select group of successful ML leaders including Sambhus; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lgavish/">Lior Gavish</a>, co-founder at Monte Carlo; and<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yotamhadass/"> Yotam Hadass</a>, VP of engineering at Electric.ai, for their insights. I’ve distilled our best practices and must-know components into five practical and easily applicable lessons.</p>
<h2>1. ML recruiting strategy</h2>
<p>Recruiting for ML comes with several challenges.</p>
<p>The first is that it can be difficult to differentiate machine learning roles from more traditional job profiles (such as data analysts, data engineers and data scientists) because there’s a heavy overlap between descriptions.</p>
<p>Secondly, finding the level of experience required can be challenging. Few people in the industry have substantial experience delivering production-grade ML (for instance, you’ll sometimes notice resumes that specify experience with ML models but then find their models are rule-based engines rather than real ML models).</p>
<p>When it comes to recruiting for ML, hire experts when you can, but also look into how training can help you meet your talent needs. Consider upskilling your current team of software engineers into data/ML engineers or hire promising candidates and provide them with an ML education.</p>

<p>The other effective way to overcome these recruiting challenges is to define roles largely around:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product: Look for candidates with a technical curiosity and a strong business/product sense. This framework is often more important than the ability to apply the most sophisticated models.</li>
<li>Data: Look for candidates that can help select models, design features, handle data modeling/vectorization and analyze results.</li>
<li>Platform/Infrastructure: Look for people who evaluate/integrate/build platforms to significantly accelerate the productivity of data and engineering teams; extract, transform, load (ETLs); warehouse infrastructures; and CI/CD frameworks for ML.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The gaming sector has never been hotter or had higher expectations from investors who are dumping billions into upstarts that can adjust to shifting tides faster that the existing giants will.</p>
<p>Bay Area-based <a href="https://www.manticoregames.com/">Manticore Games</a> is one of the second-layer gaming platforms looking to build on the market&#8217;s momentum. The startup tells TechCrunch they&#8217;ve closed a $100 million Series C funding round, bringing their total funding to $160 million. The round was led by XN, with participation from Softbank and LVP alongside existing investors Benchmark, Bitkraft, Correlation Ventures and Epic Games.</p>
<p>When Manticore closed its Series B back in September 2019, VCs were starting to take Roblox and the gaming sector more seriously, but it took the pandemic hitting to really expand their expectations for the market. &#8220;Gaming is now a bonafide super category,&#8221; CEO Frederic Descamps tells TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Manticore&#8217;s Core gaming platform is quite similar to Roblox conceptually, the big difference is that the gaming company is aiming to quickly scale up a games and creator platform geared towards the 13+ crowd that may have already left Roblox behind. The challenge will be coaxing that demographic faster than Roblox can expand its own ambitions, and doing so while other venture-backed gaming startups like Rec Room, which recently raised at a $1.2 billion valuation, race for the same prize.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Z21IiStLyS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/rec-room-raises-at-1-25b-valuation-from-sequoia-and-index-as-vcs-push-to-find-another-roblox/">Rec Room raises at $1.25B valuation from Sequoia and Index as VCs push to find another Roblox</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rec Room raises at $1.25B valuation from Sequoia and Index as VCs push to find another Roblox&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/rec-room-raises-at-1-25b-valuation-from-sequoia-and-index-as-vcs-push-to-find-another-roblox/embed/#?secret=Z21IiStLyS" data-secret="Z21IiStLyS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Like other players, Manticore is attempting to build a game discovery platform directly into a game engine. They haven&#8217;t built the engine tech from scratch, they&#8217;ve been working closely with Epic Games which makes the Unreal Engine and made a $15 million investment in the company last year.</p>
<p>A big focus of the Core platform is giving creators a true drag-and-drop platform for game creation with a specific focus on &#8220;remixing&#8221; allowing users to pick pre-made environments, drop pre-rendered 3D assets into them, choose a game mode and publish it to the web. For creators looking to inject new mechanics or assets into a title, there will be some technical know-how necessary but Manticore&#8217;s team hopes that making the barriers of entry low for new creators means that they can grow alongside the platform. Manticore&#8217;s big bet is on the flexibility of their engine, hoping that creators will come on board for the chance to engineer their own mechanics or create their own path towards monetization, something established app store wouldn&#8217;t allow them to.</p>
<p>&#8220;Creators can implement their own styles of [in-app purchases] and what we&#8217;re really hoping for here is that maybe the next battle pass equivalent innovation will come out of this,&#8221; co-founder Jordan Maynard tells us.</p>
<p>This all comes at an added cost, developers earn 50% of revenues from their games, leaving more potential revenue locked up in fees routed to the platforms that Manticore depends on than if they built for the App Store directly, but this revenue split is still much friendlier to creators that what they can earn on <a href="https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/developer-economics">platforms like Roblox</a>.</p>
<p>Building cross-platform secondary gaming platforms is host to plenty of its own challenges. The platforms involved not only have to deal with stacking revenue share fees on non-PC platforms, but some hardware platforms that are reticent to allow them all, an area where Sony has been a particular stickler with PlayStation. The long-term success of these platforms may ultimately rely on greater independence, something that seems hard to imagine happening on consoles and mobile ecosystems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic&#8217;s remarkable impact on the app industry has not slowed down in 2021. In fact, consumer spending in apps has hit a new record in the first quarter of this year, <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/consumers-spent-32-billion-on-apps-in-q1-2021-the-biggest-quarter-since-records-began/">a new report from App Annie</a> indicates. The firm says consumers in Q1 2021 spent $32 billion on apps across both iOS and Google Play, up 40% year-over-year from Q1 2020. It&#8217;s the largest-ever quarter on record, App Annie also notes.</p>
<p>Last year saw both app downloads and consumer spend increase, as people rapidly adopted apps under coronavirus lockdowns &#8212; including apps for work, school, shopping, fitness, entertainment, gaming and more. App Annie <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">previously reported</a> a record 218 billion in global downloads and record consumer spend of $143 billion for the year.</p>

<p>These trends have continued into 2021, it seems, with mobile consumers spending roughly $9 billion more in Q1 2021 compared with Q1 2020. Although iOS saw larger consumer spend than Android in the quarter &#8212; $21 billion vs. $11 billion, respectively &#8212; both stores grew by the same percentage, 40%.</p>
<p>But the types of apps driving spending were slightly different from store to store.</p>
<p>On Google Play, Games, Social and Entertainment apps saw the strongest quarter-over-quarter growth in terms of consumer spending, while Games, Photo &amp; Video, and Entertainment apps accounted for the strongest growth on iOS.</p>
<p>By downloads, the categories were different between the stores, as well.</p>
<p>On Google Play, Social, Tools, and Fiance saw the biggest download growth in Q1, while Games, Finance and Social Networking drove download growth for iOS. Also on Google Play, other top categories included Weather (40%) and Dating (35%), while iOS saw Health and Fitness app downloads grow by a notable 25% &#8212; likely a perfect storm as New Year&#8217;s Resolutions combined with continued stay-at-measures that encouraged users to find new ways to stay fit without going to a gym.</p>

<p>The top apps in the quarter remained fairly consistent, however. TikTok beat Facebook, in terms of downloads, and was followed by Instagram, Telegram, WhatsApp and Zoom. But the short-form video app only made it to No. 2 in terms of consumer spend, with YouTube snagging the top spot. Tinder, Disney+, Tencent Video, and others followed. (Netflix has dropped off this chart as it now directs new users to sign up directly, rather than through in-app purchases).</p>

<p>Though Facebook&#8217;s apps have fallen behind TikTok by downloads, its apps &#8212; including Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram &#8212; still led the market in terms monthly active users (MAUs) in the quarter. TikTok, meanwhile, ranked No. 8 by this metric.</p>
<p>Up-and-comers in the quarter included privacy-focused messaging app Signal, which saw the strongest growth in the quarter by both downloads and MAUs &#8212; a calculation that App Annie calls &#8220;breakout apps.&#8221;  Telegram closely followed, as u<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/following-riots-alternative-social-apps-and-private-messengers-top-the-app-stores/">sers bailed from mainstream social after the Capitol riot.</a> Another &#8220;breakout&#8221; app was MX TakaTak, which is filling the hole in the market for short-form video that resulted from India&#8217;s ban  of TikTok.</p>

<p>Gaming, meanwhile, drove a majority of the quarter&#8217;s spending, as usual, accounting for $22 billion of the spend &#8212; $13 billion on iOS (up 30% year-over-year) and $9 billion on Android (up 35%). Gamers downloaded about a billion titles per week, up 15% year-over-year from 2020.</p>
<p>Among Us! dropped to No. 2 in the quarter by downloads, replaced by Join Clash 3D, while DOP 2: Delete One Part jumped 308 places to reach No. 3.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132688" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132688" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2132688" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Top-Games-Rankings.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="385" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Top-Games-Rankings.png 2002w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Top-Games-Rankings.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Top-Games-Rankings.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Top-Games-Rankings.png?resize=768,435 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Top-Games-Rankings.png?resize=680,385 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Top-Games-Rankings.png?resize=1536,869 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-2021-WW-Top-Games-Rankings.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2132688" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie</p></div></p>
<p>Roblox led by consumer spend, followed by Genshin Impact, Coin Master, Pokemon Go and others. And although Among Us! dropped on the charts by downloads, it remained No. 1 by monthly active users in the quarter, followed by PUBG Mobile, Candy Crush Saga, Roblox and others.</p>
<p>App Annie notes that the pandemic also accelerated the mobile gaming market, with game downloads outpacing overall downloads by 2.5x in 2020. It predicts that mobile gaming will reach  $120 billion in consumer spending this year, or 1.5x all other gaming formats combined.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is adding two new voices to Siri&#8217;s English offerings, and eliminating the default &#8216;female voice&#8217; selection in the latest beta version of iOS. This means that every person setting up Siri will choose a voice for themselves and it will no longer default to the voice assistant being female, a topic that has <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/05/22/female-by-default/">come up quite a bit</a> with regards to bias in voice interfaces over the past few years.</p>
<p>The beta version should be live now and available to program participants.</p>
<p>I believe that this is the first of these assistants to make the choice completely agnostic with no default selection made. This is a positive step forward as it allows people to choose the voice that they prefer without the defaults bias coming into play. The two new voices also bring some much needed variety to the voices of Siri, offering more diversity in speech sound and pattern to a user picking a voice that speaks to them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In some countries and languages Siri already defaults to a male voice. But this change makes the choice the users’ for the first time.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to introduce two new Siri voices for English speakers and the option for Siri users to select the voice they want when they set up their device,&#8221; a statement from Apple reads. &#8220;This is a continuation of Apple’s long-standing commitment to diversity and inclusion, and products and services that are designed to better reflect the diversity of the world we live in.”</p>
<p>The two new voices use source talent recordings that are then run through Apple&#8217;s Neural text to speech engine, making the voices flow more organically through phrases that are actually being generated on the fly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard the new voices and they sound pretty fantastic, with natural inflection and smooth transitions. They&#8217;ll be a welcome addition of choice to iOS users. I&#8217;ll embed some samples here after the beta drops.</p>
<p>This latest beta also upgrades the Siri voices in Ireland, Russia and Italy to Neural TTS, bringing the total voices using the new tech to 38. Siri now handles 25 billion requests per month on over 500M devices and supports 21 languages in 36 countries.</p>
<p>The new voices are available to English speaking users around the world and Siri users can select a personal preference of voice in 16 languages.</p>
<p>It seems very likely that these two new voices are just the first expansion in Siri&#8217;s voice selections. More diversity in voice, tone and regional dialect can only be a positive development for how inclusive smart devices feel. Over the past few years we have finally begun to see some movement from Amazon, Google and Apple to aggressively correct situations where the assistants have revealed bias in their responses to queries that use negative or abusive language. Improvements there, as well as in queries on social justice topics and overall accessibility improvements are incredibly key as we continue to see an explosion of voice-first or voice-native interfaces. These kinds of choices matter, especially at a scale of hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Article updated to note that in some countries and languages Siri currently defaults to a male voice. </i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast-growing fintech <a href="https://www.pipe.com/">Pipe</a> has raised another round of funding at a $2 billion valuation, just weeks after </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/this-pipe-ing-hot-startup-just-raised-50m-to-be-the-nasdaq-for-revenue/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raising $50M in growth funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to sources familiar with the deal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the round is still ongoing, Pipe has reportedly raised $150 million in a “massively oversubscribed” round led by Baltimore, Md.-based <a href="http://www.greenspringassociates.com">Greenspring Associates</a>. While the company has signed a term sheet, more money could still come in, according to the source. Both new and existing investors have participated in the fundraise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increase in valuation is “a significant step up” from the company’s last raise. Pipe &#8212; which only launched its platform last June &#8212; has declined to comment on the deal.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A little over one year ago, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/pipe-a-financing-platform-for-saas-companies-raises-6m-seed-led-by-craft-ventures/">Pipe raised a $6 million seed round led by Craft Ventures</a> to help it pursue its mission of giving SaaS companies a funding alternative outside of equity or venture debt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The buzzy startup’s goal with the money was to give SaaS companies a way to get their revenue upfront, by pairing them with investors on a marketplace that pays a discounted rate for the annual value of those contracts. (Pipe describes its buy-side participants as “a vetted group of financial institutions and banks.”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just a few weeks ago, Miami-based Pipe announced a new raise — $50 million in “strategic equity funding” from a slew of high-profile investors. Siemens’ Next47 and Jim Pallotta’s Raptor Group co-led the round, which also included participation from Shopify, Slack, HubSpot, Okta, Social Capital’s Chamath Palihapitiya, Marc Benioff, Michael Dell’s MSD Capital, Republic, Alexis Ohanian’s Seven Seven Six and Joe Lonsdale.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="XajkIV9Oy3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/this-pipe-ing-hot-startup-just-raised-50m-to-be-the-nasdaq-for-revenue/">This Pipe-ing hot startup just raised $50M to be the &#8216;Nasdaq for revenue&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;This Pipe-ing hot startup just raised $50M to be the &#8216;Nasdaq for revenue&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/this-pipe-ing-hot-startup-just-raised-50m-to-be-the-nasdaq-for-revenue/embed/#?secret=XajkIV9Oy3" data-secret="XajkIV9Oy3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that time, Pipe co-CEO and co-founder Harry Hurst said the company was also broadening the scope of its platform beyond strictly SaaS companies to “any company with a recurring revenue stream.” This could include D2C subscription companies, ISP, streaming services or a telecommunications companies. Even VC fund admin and management are being piped on its platform, for example, according to Hurst.</span></p>
<p>“When we first went to market, we were very focused on SaaS, our first vertical,” he told TC at the time. “Since then, over 3,000 companies have signed up to use our platform.” Those companies range from early-stage and bootstrapped with $200,000 in revenue, to publicly-traded companies.</p>
<p>Pipe’s platform assesses a customer’s key metrics by integrating with its accounting, payment processing and banking systems. It then instantly rates the performance of the business and qualifies them for a trading limit. Trading limits currently range from $50,000 for smaller early-stage and bootstrapped companies, to over $100 million for late-stage and publicly traded companies, although there is no cap on how large a trading limit can be.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 2021, tens of millions of dollars were traded across the Pipe platform. Between its launch in late June 2020 through year’s end, the company also saw “tens of millions” in trades take place via its marketplace. Tradable ARR on the platform is currently in excess of $1 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the world changes rapidly, so too do the most traditional of industries. That includes property tech and insurtech. Luckily for us, two of the top minds in those spaces are joining us on an upcoming episode of Extra Crunch Live.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-fifth-wall-and-hippo">April 21 at noon PT/3pm ET, Fifth Wall&#8217;s Brendan Wallace and Hippo&#8217;s Assaf Wand will hang out with us</a> to discuss fundraising across these evolving verticals and explain specifically how fundraising went down for Hippo. The duo will also take a look at pitch decks sent in by the audience and give their live feedback. (If you&#8217;d like your deck to be featured on a future episode of Extra Crunch Live, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">hit up this link</a>.)</p>
<p>But first, a little more information on our guests.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Brendan Wallace is cofounder and managing partner at Fifth Wall, one of the top VC firms dealing in property tech, future of work, new retail and more. Fifth Wall portfolio companies include OpenDoor, Classpass, AllBirds, Clutter, Eden, Lime, and Lyric, among others.</p>
<p>Before Fifth Wall, Wallace was an entrepreneur himself, cofounding Identified (acquired by Workday) and Cabify, a huge ridesharing service in Latin America. He was also an angel investor, with investments in Bonobos, Dollar Shave Club, Lyft, and SpaceX, to name a few.</p>
<p>The TL;dr version on Wallace is that he&#8217;s been around the block in the tech world plenty of times, and has experience across a variety of sectors. There&#8217;s lots to learn here.</p>
<p>Assaf Wand is cofounder and CEO of Hippo, a home insurance provider for the digital age. Wand is also a serial entrepreneur, founding a company that designed and developed consumer products called Sabi. It was acquired in 2015.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Wand has also worn the hat of an investor, serving as strategic investor for Intel Capital and also spending time at McKinsey as a consultant.</p>
<p>Hippo has raised more than $700 million from investors that include Bond, Felicis, Comcast and Horizons.</p>
<p>Wallace invested in Hippo&#8217;s Series B round, and we&#8217;re anxious to hear why Wand and Wallace chose each other, how they work together today, and what advice they have for founders looking to raise capital and scale their businesses.</p>
<p>The episode goes down at noon PT/3pm ET on April 21 and is free to all who want to check it out live. On-demand access to the content is reserved for Extra Crunch members only. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-fifth-wall-and-hippo">Register to come hang out with us here.</a></p>

<p><b>Dear Sophie: </b></p>
<p><b>I’m a founder of a startup on an E-2 investor visa and just got engaged! My soon-to-be spouse will sponsor me for a green card. </b></p>
<p><b>Are there any minimum salary requirements for her to sponsor me? Is there anything I should keep in mind before starting the green card process?</b></p>
<p><b>— Betrothed in Belmont</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear Betrothed,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Congratulations on your engagement and thanks for reaching out!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several things to keep in mind before you tie the knot. These important considerations are particularly relevant since you’re a startup founder, currently on an </span><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/016-e-2-visa-for-founders-and-employees/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-2 visa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and if you’ll continue to live in California. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My law partner, </span><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/member/anita-koumriqian/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anita Koumriqian</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who is an expert in family immigration law, recently interviewed </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lydiaehsu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lydia Hsu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kara-foster-86572825/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kara Foster</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the co-founders of </span><a href="https://www.fosterhsu.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foster Hsu, LLP</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a California family law firm, on our </span><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/064-immigration-prenups-divorce-with-lydia-hsu-and-kara-foster/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">podcast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They cover the ins and outs of family law and prenups, and what to know before you tie the knot and pursue the green card process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">California is a community property state, which means if your marriage doesn’t work out, all of the assets acquired by you and your spouse during the marriage will be divided up equally unless you have a prenuptial agreement (prenup) in place before you get married. Since you are an </span><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/e-2-visa-treaty-investors/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-2 investor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and I imagine you have significant assets, it’s beneficial to consider entering into a prenup before you become legally married. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is especially important for you in pursuing a </span><a href="https://www.alcorn.law/marriage-based-green-cards/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">marriage-based green card</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) often looks to see whether couples are commingling funds in a joint bank account when assessing if your marriage is good-faith to approve your green card.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2100312" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="1024" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A prenup may not be right for you,” says Kara, “but at least you should be educated going into a marriage and know what you’re going to be responsible for, what your obligations are going to be, and how California is going to treat your property, assets and income during the marriage. We have a lot of people coming in later for a divorce saying, ‘If I had known this, I would have done everything differently.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to California, there are several other community property states in the U.S., including Arizona, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the immigration side of things, keep in mind that the Affidavit of Support (</span><a href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-864"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Form I-864</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), which is required for a marriage-based green card, will remain in effect even in the event of a divorce — and takes precedence over any spousal support designated in a prenup.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Abel Tesfaye, the Super Bowl-headlining musician known as The Weeknd, is the latest artist to embrace the excitement around NFTs (non-fungible tokens).</p>
<p>Specifically, he&#8217;s teaming up with <a href="https://niftygateway.com">Nifty Gateway</a>, the same marketplace that worked with Beeple to auction off a piece of digital art <a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/beeple-nft-artwork-nifty-gateway-sale-1234584701/">for $6.6 million earlier this year</a> (a very impressive number, though quickly overshadowed by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/beeples-69-million-nft-sale-marks-a-potentially-transformative-moment-for-the-art-world/">the $69 million that another Beeple piece sold for</a> through Christie&#8217;s).</p>
<p>The Weeknd and Nifty Gateway will be holding a sale on Saturday with two main components, both of them involving a previously unreleased song — which will not be available on any other platforms in the future — plus visual art developed by Strange Loop Studios in consultation with The Weeknd.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There will be a flash sale of three different pieces of art, each with different filtered clip of the song. These pieces will be available in unlimited quantities, albeit for a limited amount of time. And there will be a 24-hour exclusive auction of a one-of-a-kind piece — accompanied by the song, in full and unfiltered.</p>

<p>“Blockchain is democratizing an industry that has historically been kept shut by the gatekeepers,&#8221; The Weeknd said in a statement. &#8220;I’ve always been looking for ways to innovate for fans and shift this archaic music biz and seeing NFT’s allowing creators to be seen and heard more than ever before on their terms is profoundly exciting. I intend to contribute to this movement and can see that very soon it will be weaved into the music industry&#8217;s mechanics.”</p>
<p>NFTs are basically assets on the blockchain tied to digital art, whether that&#8217;s images, audio, video or another format. The art itself is usually reproducible, but the NFTs indicate the true ownership.</p>
<p>Interest has exploded in recent months, thanks to auctions at eye-popping prices, as well as hopes that the technology will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/explosive-inclusive-potential-nfts/">bring more financial benefits to artists in the digital world</a>. At the same time, they&#8217;ve also faced criticism for factors including their energy usage and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change">resulting impact on climate change</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://niftygateway.com/profile/theweeknd">The auction</a> will begin at 11am Pacific on Saturday, April 3.</p>

<p>From finding product market fit to recruiting your early team to building and leading a successful sales team, there&#8217;s something for everyone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Take a look at some of our sessions:</p>
<h3>Finding Your Product Market Fit &#8211; Sean Lane, Olive</h3>
<p><em>Olive AI founder and CEO is no stranger to the pivot. Hear how he practiced patience in the search for product market fit, how he knew it when he finally found it, and tactics he used to build on it. </em></p>
<h3>How to Get Into an Accelerator &#8211; Neal Sales-Griffin, TechStars</h3>
<p><em>Accelerators provide an incredible launch pad for early stage startups, offering a built-in network, accessible advisors, and of course, capital. But first, you&#8217;ve got to be accepted. Hear Techstars Neal Sales-Griffin outline how to get into an accelerator and make the most of the experience. </em></p>
<h3>How to Build Your Early Team for Future Growth &#8211; Sarah Smith, Bain Capital Ventures</h3>
<p><em>More than your investors, or even you as a founder, your early employees will have a tremendous influence on the trajectory of your company. You hire them, and often times, they hire everyone else. Hear Bain Capital Ventures partner Sarah Smith talk through how to recruit a top-notch early team that sets up your startup for future growth. </em></p>
<h3>What Startups Need To Know About Bug Bounties &#8211; Katie Moussouris</h3>
<p><em>Should all startups launch a bug bounty program to improve their security? Learn about the good, the bad, and the ugly that startups will encounter when managing vulnerability disclosures and considering bug bounty programs.</em></p>
<h3>Fundraising Terms That Affect Your Business &#8211; Dawn Belt, Fenwick</h3>
<p><em>With each funding round, there is an exciting opportunity for growth, but it’s important to fully understand the implications of those terms. Fenwick partner, Dawn Belt, will discuss the key legal terms to focus on in your Seed and Series A rounds and how they affect the control and operational freedom of your company.</em></p>
<h3>Finance for Founders &#8211; Alexa von Tobel, Inspired Capital</h3>
<p><em>As a founder, you not only have to master your company&#8217;s finances, you also have to tackle your own personal finances. Managing your money as a founder comes with a unique set of questions (see: QSBS). Leveraging her expertise from LearnVest and as a Certified Financial Planner<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, Alexa will share financial planning best practices so founders can remove this layer of stress from the pressure of building a business.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">President Joe Biden has earmarked $174 billion from his ambitious infrastructure plan to build out domestic supply chains for electric vehicles, noting the imperative for United States automakers to “compete globally” to win a larger share of the EV market.</p>
<p>The funds are just one part of Biden’s plan, which calls for an ambitious $2 trillion infrastructure investment across multiple sectors. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/">The Fact Sheet</a> for the plan includes six references to China – one of these in reference to the size of the Chinese EV market, which is two-thirds larger than the domestic U.S. market. Chinese manufacturer Foxconn, Apple’s main supplier, said in February it was considering producing EVs at its Wisconsin plants – just weeks after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/apple-supplier-foxconn-reaches-tentative-agreement-to-build-fiskers-next-electric-car/">tentatively agreeing</a> to manufacture an EV for startup-turned-SPAC Fisker.</p>
<p>To ensure Americans actually purchase these domestically manufactured EVs, Biden also plans to establish sales rebates and tax incentives for the purchase of American-made EVs, though the size of the credit has not been released. Customers can already cash in a $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs, but it is not available to automakers that have sold more than 200,000 electric cars – people looking to purchase a Tesla, for instance, would not qualify for the credit. It’s unclear whether the new tax credit would raise or abolish the sales limit for automakers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The plan also proposes using some of the funds to build a national EV charging network of 500,000 stations by 2030. A <a href="https://article.images.consumerreports.org/prod/content/dam/surveys/Consumer_Reports_Electric_Vehicles_Fuel_Economy_National_August_2020">recent survey from Consumer Reports</a> found that the availability of public charging stations was a major concern deterring people from looking into an EV for their next vehicle purchase.</p>
<p>On the transit side, Biden’s administration said the funds will also go towards replacing 50,000 diesel transit vehicles and electrifying at least 20 percent of school busses, through a new program administered by the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p>The plan places a huge emphasis on providing good-paying jobs to American workers, but it still has a long way to go. It must be approved by Congress before becoming law.</p>
