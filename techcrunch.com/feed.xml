										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German startup Wingcopter has launched a new autonomous delivery drone designed to remove a technical bottleneck hindering the growth of drone transport services.</p>
<p>The Wingcopter 198, which was revealed Tuesday, is capable of making three separate deliveries per flight, the company said. Wingcopter has couched this multi-stop capability as a critical feature that will allow it to grow a cost-efficient — and hopefully profitable — drone delivery as a service business.</p>
<p>The company, which was founded in 2017, got its start manufacturing drones. It used the revenue to scale and now expand its business model to include drone-delivery-as-a-service. “That’s actually our next mission, to not just build drones, but to build networks,” CEO Tom Plümmer told TechCrunch. The company&#8217;s website is now promoting the delivery business, which aims to provide healthcare, e-commerce and grocery delivery among other services. It&#8217;s ultimate aim is to create “logistical highways in the sky,” according to a statement by Plümmer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The key to this delivery nirvana, the company claims, is its patented tilt-rotor propellant mechanism that combines the advantages of two drone types — the multicopter, which gives drones their smooth vertical take-off and landing capabilities and the ability to hover precisely in the air, with the fixed wing, which provides fast flight times over long distances.</p>
<p>The new model Wingcopter 198 has a top speed of 93 miles an hour and can carry payloads up to 13 pounds for a distance of about 47 miles from a single battery charge. It can travel up to 68 miles when carrying lighter cargo, the company said.</p>
<p>Plümmer explained that the tilt-rotors can also automatically respond to gusts of wind and other inclement weather conditions. Its architecture includes eight motors for redundancy and safety reasons.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2144071" style="width: 3850px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144071" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2144071 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wingcopter-198_Slow-Drop.png" alt="" width="3840" height="2061" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wingcopter-198_Slow-Drop.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wingcopter-198_Slow-Drop.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wingcopter-198_Slow-Drop.png?resize=300,161 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wingcopter-198_Slow-Drop.png?resize=768,412 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wingcopter-198_Slow-Drop.png?resize=680,365 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wingcopter-198_Slow-Drop.png?resize=1536,824 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wingcopter-198_Slow-Drop.png?resize=2048,1099 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Wingcopter-198_Slow-Drop.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2144071" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Wingcopter</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The drones, which are equipped with sensors and software to avoid obstacles and drop parcels at designated sites, are all automated. This level of automation allows one human operator to monitor and control up to 10 of these new drones from a computer equipped with Wingcopter&#8217;s control station software anywhere in the world. Plümmer explained that running the drones is a simple as the operator pressing &#8216;start&#8217; on the software program from anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Plümmer also touted the scalability of the tilt-rotor system, noting that it could be applied (theoretically) to a larger aircraft to carry cargo, or even human passengers.</p>
<p>“It’s just a cost factor,” Plümmer said, noting that the company already employs people who have the experience in aviation and aerial engineering required to one day take the tilt-rotor aircraft to scale. “However, we thought, let’s start with the smaller version &#8230; get these 1000s of [flight] hours, 1000s of kilometers, and take these learnings into every next generation of Wingcopter so they will constantly get bigger, first for cargo, later for mobility.”</p>
<p>Plümmer said they’ve drawn a hard line at working with any company or government institution that would use their drones for military or surveillance purposes.</p>
<p>“It’s mainly moral,” he said of the objection. “We believe it would be really not fitting to our vision. Our vision is to save lives and improve life by using drone technology and drone solutions.”</p>
<p>Looking to the future, the company is currently pursuing a type certification from the Federal Aviation Administration, which would allow it to operate commercial flights in the United States. If they receive this certification, they will be one of only a handful of competitors operating in the space. They&#8217;ve also set their sights on another funding round, fresh of the heels of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/24/wingcopter-raises-22-million-to-expand-to-the-u-s-and-launch-a-next-generation-drone/">$22 million Series A round</a> in January. The company has around 120 employees but with an additional injection of capital in a Series B, it could hire people with expertise in AI, piloting and production.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S.-based challenger bank <a href="https://current.com/">Current</a>, which has now grown to nearly 3 million users, announced this morning it has raised a $220 million round of Series D funding, led by new investor Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). The funding swiftly follows Current&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/mobile-banking-app-current-raises-131m-series-c-tops-2-million-members/">$131 million Series C</a> at the end of last year, at which point the company had doubled its user base over just six months to over 2 million users.</p>
<p>As a result of the new roud, the fintech company has roughly tripled its valuation in five months&#8217; time to $2.2 billion.</p>
<p>Other participants in the round include returning investors Tiger Global Management, TQ Ventures (the fund managed by media executive Scooter Braun), Avenir, Sapphire Ventures, Foundation Capital, Wellington Management and EXPA. David George, who led the round with a16z, will become a Current board member.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Current began its life as a teen debit card controlled by parents, but later expanded to offer personal checking accounts powered by the same underlying banking technology. Like a range of modern-day &#8220;neobanks,&#8221; or digital banks, the Current app offers a baseline of standard features like free overdrafts, no minimum balance requirements, faster direct deposits, instant spending notifications, banking insights, free ATMs, check deposits using your phone’s camera and more. It also last year launched<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/mobile-bank-current-launches-a-points-rewards-program-for-debit-card-users/"> a points rewards program</a> in an effort to better differentiate its service from the growing number of competitors and became one of the first banks to transfer the early round of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/vc-daily-fintechs-step-in-to-help-deliver-another-round-of-stimulus-checks-11615899257">stimulus payments</a> during the pandemic.</p>
<p>These days, Current is <a href="https://current.com/current-creator">partnering with creators</a>, like the recently <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2021/04/26/mrbeast-invests-current-banking-app-giveaway/">announced</a> MrBeast (aka Jimmy Donaldson), who said last week <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQHEJj68Jew&amp;t=375s">on his YouTube channel</a> that he will personally send $1 to every 100,000 people who sign up using his Creator code. MrBeast is also an investor.</p>
<p>Like other fintechs in its same space, Current has benefitted from the younger generation&#8217;s adoption of mobile banking apps instead of larger, traditional banks, who they feel don&#8217;t serve their interests. Its average <a href="https://www.alleywatch.com/2020/11/current-banking-challenger-digital-bank-stuart-sopp/">customer age</a> is 27, for example. Digital banks can keep costs down by not having to pay for the overhead of brick-and-mortar locations, allowing them to roll out benefits like reduced or zero account fees and other consumer-friendly protections.</p>
<p>Current today continues to offer teen banking, in a challenger to mobile banking app Step, which has also leveraged social media influencers to get the word out with a younger demographic. But Step today is appealing to the 13 to 18-year old crowd directly, offering banking services and a secured card. Current, meanwhile, targets its service to the <a href="https://support.current.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003712113-How-do-I-link-my-teen-to-my-account-">parents</a>.</p>
<p>Its teen account costs $36 per year, while personal checking is available both as a free and premium ($4.99/mo) service. The company <a href="https://www.alleywatch.com/2020/11/current-banking-challenger-digital-bank-stuart-sopp/">in the past has said</a> its primary focus is the over 130 million Americans who live paycheck to paycheck.</p>
<p>Current says the new funds will be used to grow the company and its member base as it expands it range of banking products. One key area of new investment will be cryptocurrency, it says.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new generation of customers doesn&#8217;t want to bank in physical branches,&#8221; said a16z&#8217;s David George, in a statement. &#8220;We believe there will be a shift in the next 10 years to mobile and consumer-focused banking services powered by innovation in technology, and with Current&#8217;s exceptional growth over the past year, they&#8217;ve clearly demonstrated they&#8217;re at the forefront of this trend. Their product is among the best in the market, and they have proven an ability to reach customers who previously were unserved or underserved by traditional banks,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been a very tough year for <a href="https://www.placer.ai/">Placer.ai</a>’s core customer segments of retail and commercial real estate, to put it mildly. But the foot traffic and location analytics startup saw growth in new categories, including consumer packaged goods (CPG) and hedge funds that use its tech to perform due diligence. The Los Altos, California-based company announced today that has raised a $50 million Series B led by Josh Buckley, the chief executive officer of Product Hunt. Participants included Fifth Wall, Rahul Vohra and returning investors JBV Capital and Aleph VC.</p>
<p>The new capital will be used on research and development and expanding Placer.ai’s sales and marketing teams. Its last funding announcement was in January 2020 for a $12 million Series A.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Placer.ai, a location data analytics startup, raises $12 million Series A&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/placer-ai-a-location-data-analytics-startup-raises-12-million-series-a/embed/#?secret=2jLMuytQq9" data-secret="2jLMuytQq9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Placer.ai collects geolocation and proximity data from devices that are enabled to share that information by their users, and creates anonymized and aggregated consumer profiles. Since its launch, the company’s key customers have been offline retail businesses, shopping centers, hotels and other brick-and-mortar businesses that use it to analyze foot traffic, the success of marketing campaigns and location performance. Placer.ai’s co-founder and chief executive officer Noam Ben-Zvi said he expected the COVID-19 pandemic to be challenging as people stayed away from stores and purchased online instead.</p>
<p>But adoption of Placer.ai’s tech increased among several new segments, including CPG and hedge funds, and it is continuing to expand in retail and commercial real estate as companies plan ahead.</p>
<p>The company’s CPG clients use its tools for market analysis, refining category management or promotion strategies and tracking product performance. Ben-Zvi expects its CPG customer base to continue growing as more brands, like direct-to-consumer labels, open their own stores.</p>

<p>Placer.ai’s hedge fund clients use it to research potential investments. “Because data is in near real-time, reliable and very granular, it allows investors to quickly identify signals that speak to the true offline health of any brand. But there is also a qualitative data element that allows strategic initiatives to be thoroughly analyzed,” Ben-Zvi said in an email.</p>
<p>“For example, we looked at CVS Health Hubs when they were in their pilot stage in a handful of locations. When the company announced that they would be rolling this out to over a thousand branches, investors had a strong sense of the potential,” he added. “The ability of the data to fuel both quantitative and qualitative analysis at a very high level is a powerful combination.”</p>
<p>For retail and commercial real estate users, “the situation ahead is going to be turbulent, and data is going to play a fundamental role in confidently navigating the changing environment and driving effective decision making,” said Ben-Zvi. Commercial real estate owners need to make sure the mix of tenants in their properties are compelling enough to draw in shoppers, and understand how they are faring against competitors. Some retailers are focused on expansion, while others are testing new concepts and formats.</p>
<p>In a press statement about his investment, Buckley said, “Placer allows businesses that operate offline to make data-driven decisions, fundamentally improving the way they operate. This is the same type of tooling that online businesses have used to grow, moving from hunches to definitive answers. I’m excited to be partnering with the company’s next phase of growth and product development.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Getting actionable business information into the hands of users who need it has always been a challenge. If you have to wait for experts to help you find the answers, chances are you&#8217;re going to be too late. Enter <a href="https://www.tellius.com/">Tellius</a>, an early stage startup building a solution to help business users find the information they need when they need it.</p>
<p>Today the company announced an $8 million Series A led by Sands Capital Ventures with participation from Grotech. Today&#8217;s investment brings the total raised to $17 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>CEO and founder Ajay Khanna says the company is attempting to marry two technologies that have traditionally lived in silos: business intelligence and artificial intelligence. He believes that bringing them together <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/28/finding-the-elusive-big-wisdom-in-big-data/">can lead to greater wisdom</a> and help close the insight gap.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Tellius is an AI-driven decision intelligence platform, and what we do is we combine machine learning &#8212; AI-driven automation &#8212; with a Google-like natural language interface, so combining the left brain and the right brain to enable business teams to get insights on the data,&#8221; Khanna told me.</p>
<p>The idea is to let the machine learning teams and the business analysts continue to do their thing, but provide an application where business users can put all of that to work. &#8220;We believe that to go from data to decisions, you need to know not only what happened, but why things change and how you can improve your company,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The product takes aim at three employee groups. The first is the business user, who can simply query the data with a natural language question to get results. The second is a data analyst, who can get more granular by choosing a specific model to base the query on, and finally a data scientist who can enhance the query with Python or Spark code.</p>
<p>It connects to various data sources including Salesforce and Google Analytics, data lakes like Snowflake, csv files to take advantage of Excel data or cloud storage tools like Amazon S3. It comes in two versions: one that the customer can connect to the cloud infrastructure provider of choice, and one which they run as a service and manage for the customers.</p>
<p>Khanna says that as companies struggled to change the way they do business in during the pandemic, they needed the kind of insights his company provides and business grew 300% last year as a result.</p>
<p>The startup launched in 2016 after Khanna sold a previous company, which allowed him to bootstrap while in stealth. They spent a couple of years building the product and brought the first version of Tellius to market in Q3 2018. That&#8217;s when they took a $7.5 million seed round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify today is officially rolling out paid podcast subscriptions, after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-test-paid-podcast-subscriptions-this-spring-via-new-anchor-feature/">first unveiling</a> its new subscription platform at the company&#8217;s &#8220;Stream On&#8221; event in February. Through Spotify&#8217;s podcast creation tool Anchor, podcasters will be able to mark select episodes as subscriber-only content, then publish them to Spotify and other platforms. The service was initially tested with a dozen independent creators, and is now expanding to creators who had previously registered for the waitlist.</p>
<p>For the time being, Spotify is only opening up paid subscriptions to creators in the U.S., but it aims to expand internationally in the months ahead, it says.</p>
<p>The launch comes at time when the market for podcasts, and paid podcasts in particular, is heating up. Last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/">Apple announced</a> its own plan for paid podcast subscriptions through its Apple Podcasts platform, still a top destination for podcasts today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But one key difference between Spotify&#8217;s efforts and Apple&#8217;s plan is how subscription revenue is shared.</p>
<p>Apple said it&#8217;s taking a 30% cut of the podcast revenue in year one, dropping to 15% in year two &#8212; the same as its cut for streaming services on its App Store. Spotify, meanwhile, says its program will come at no cost to creators for the next two years, which means creators will keep 100% of revenues. Then, in Spring 2023, Spotify plans to introduce only a 5% fee for access to the tool.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2116160" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2116160" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2116160" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="337" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg 2242w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=300,149 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=768,381 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=680,337 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=1536,762 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1016 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-3.29.44-PM.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2116160" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>The first group of 12 creators will now begin publishing the paid, subscriber-only bonus episodes to their feeds, which will be discoverable and searchable just like any other podcast episode on the platform. These paid episodes will appear in the podcast&#8217;s main feed, where they&#8217;re marked with a lock icon on the Play button. Early adopters include Wild Thing; Tiny Leap, Big Changes; and The Mindful Minute.</p>
<p>The cost to subscribe is determined by the creator, but will be one of thee tiers: $2.99, $4.99, or $7.99 per month.</p>
<p>While Spotify will allow Anchor creators to mark entire feeds as paid, if they choose, it believes the lure of the free episodes to first attract listeners is a smarter idea. Then you can upsell them bonus content. However, larger podcasts may take a different approach.</p>
<p>For example, Spotify has inked a deal with NPR for paid subscriptions which involves entire paid feeds. NPR will publish five shows  &#8212; <em>How I Built This with Guy Raz, Short Wave, It&#8217;s Been a Minute with Sam Sanders, Code Switch</em> and <em>Planet Money</em> &#8212; that will be sponsor-free for paid subscribers starting on May 4. These shows will be branded as &#8220;Plus&#8221; (e.g. <em>Planet Money Plus</em>) and will live alongside the free feeds. In this case, listeners aren&#8217;t getting bonus material, but they&#8217;re supporting NPR. More NPR shows will roll out their own Plus versions the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-spotify-and-the-new-battle-over-who-wins-podcasting-11619170206">Wall St. Journal article</a> on Friday broke the news that Spotify&#8217;s paid subscriptions would arrive this week. And it noted that iOS users who wanted to subscribe would be routed to a website to process the transaction, avoiding Apple&#8217;s in-app purchase requirements. This could potentially be a tricky line for Spotify to toe. The company has been a chief Apple critic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/senate-antitrust-hearing-apple-tile-spotify-match-epic/">testifying just last week</a> before Congress about Apple&#8217;s anticompetitive behavior when it comes to the App Store.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s bypassing in-app purchases by directing users to go to a website and buy a subscription. The company, however, says it&#8217;s leaving the explanation up to the podcast creators.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s basically up to every creator to educate their their listeners about how and where to subscribe to the podcast, and the actual subscription happens on an Anchor webpage &#8212; on the creator&#8217;s profile page on Anchor. But once you do that and you authenticate it and you come back to Spotify, it&#8217;ll be unlocked,&#8221; says Anchor co-founder Michael Mignano. He notes that the Spotify app will not actually open this webpage due to App Store rules. (Also, because Spotify isn&#8217;t take a cut of the subscription revenue for the time being, it would be protected via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/16/16896008/apple-wechat-tips-agreement">the carve-out for creator donations</a> that Apple established a few years ago even if it had adopted in-app purchases.)</p>
<p>To use the paid podcasts feature, creators will mark their episodes within Anchor after first recording or uploading their episodes. For listeners who want to access the content on a different podcasting app, a private RSS feed will be provided after they subscribe.</p>
<p>Spotify is also announcing, for the first time, the Spotify Open Access Platform (OAP). This will allow creators who already have paid subscribers on other platforms &#8212; including competing services or private RSS feeds &#8212; to provide that content to current subscribers using their existing logins and billing solutions. Spotify says would help creators retain direct control over the relationship However, Spotify will re-host the content on its servers, which would give it insights into the broader paid podcasts market as a result.</p>
<p>The company isn&#8217;t yet ready to announce the complete details on this solution, but says it will have some news in the week ahead.</p>
<p>In addition to the roll out of paid podcasts, Spotify says it&#8217;s opening up its audio ads marketplace, the Spotify Audience Network (SPAN), to independent podcasters using Anchor. This is another area where Spotify is differentiated from Apple. On Apple Podcasts, creators are responsible for selling their own ads, so they keep 100% of the revenue.</p>
<p>Spotify, by comparison, has invested in ad technologies with the goal of serving the podcast audience. The company had previously unlocked Megaphone&#8217;s inventory (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spotify-buying-podcast-hosting-and-ad-company-megaphone-for-235m/">a 2020 acquisition</a>) via the network, but is now making SPAN available to select Anchor creators, as well. The company says it will begin with a group of 50 creators on May 1, then expand over time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.clio.com/">Clio</a>, a software company that helps law practices run more efficiently with its cloud-based technology, announced Tuesday it has raised a $110 million Series E round co-led by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. and OMERS Growth Equity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The round propels the Vancouver, British Columbia-based company to unicorn status, valuing it at $1.6 billion. Clio last raised in September of 2019 when it brought in $250 million in a Series D financing. With the latest funding, Clio claims that it’s the “first legal practice management unicorn” globally. The investment also brings its total capital raised since its 2008 inception to $386 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Founder and CEO Jack Newton says he and Rian Gauvreau launched Clio during the 2008 recession after seeing the struggles solo lawyers and small firms faced when running a business. Historically, legal practice management software was limited to server-based solutions designed for enterprise businesses &#8212; not small law firms, Newton said. Clio was formed to change that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p id="speakable-summary"><div id="attachment_2144183" style="width: 576px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2144183" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2144183" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Clio-Founders.jpeg?w=300" alt="" width="566" height="378" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Clio-Founders.jpeg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Clio-Founders.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Clio-Founders.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Clio-Founders.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Clio-Founders.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Clio-Founders.jpeg?resize=1536,1023 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Clio-Founders.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2144183" class="wp-caption-text">Clio co-founders Jack Newton and Rian Gauvreau; Image courtesy of Clio</p></div></p>
<p dir="ltr">“Much like how Microsoft Windows defined the operating system for personal computers decades ago, Clio has developed a software platform for law firms and their clients that is cloud-based and client-centric by design,” Newton said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company’s platform aims to serve as “an operating system” for lawyers, offering cloud-based legal practice management, client intake and legal CRM software. Clio has more than 150,000 customers across 100 countries. Many of the lawyers using Clio are smaller and solo practitioners, but the company also serves larger firms such as Locks Law and King Law.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Newton said his vertical SaaS company helps legal professionals be more productive, grow their firms and “make legal services more accessible.” It also aims to help clients find lawyers more easily and vice versa.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2143950" style="width: 241px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2143950" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2143950" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Clio-product-image.jpg?w=200" alt="" width="231" height="348" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Clio-product-image.jpg 399w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Clio-product-image.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Clio-product-image.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Clio-product-image.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2143950" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clio</p></div></p>
<p dir="ltr">Newton was tight-lipped about the company’s financials, saying only that since its 2019 raise, the company has seen “explosive” growth. That growth was only fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic and its push toward all things digital. He added that its current valuation was “fair,” and achieved through a “thorough” vetting process.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Clio has focused on building out its core technology to an industry that has historically relied on pen and paper in many cases. It has also aimed to make legal technology more affordable for lawyers to use.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While change has been gradual, COVID-19 forced lawyers to fundamentally reevaluate how they run their law firms and how they deliver legal services to their clients, Newton said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Many firms realized that storing client data at the office was no longer an option as teams became distributed during COVID-19,” he added. “Lawyers and legal professionals who had hesitated to adopt technology in the past were suddenly forced to rapidly adapt to this new reality. While this technological change is in response to the crisis, it’s an enduring change.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2018, Clio made its first acquisition with its buy of Lexicata, a Los Angeles-based legal tech startup. The company plans to do more acquisitions with the capital, according to Newton. The company plans to use its new capital to continue investing in its platform as well as toward strategic partnerships. (Clio currently has partnered with over 150 apps.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Clio also plans to, naturally, do some hiring. Specifically, it plans to boost its headcount by 40%, or 250 employees, with a focus on bolstering its product and engineering teams. (Clio currently has 600 employees.)</p>

<p dir="ltr">“Over the next few years we intend to completely redefine the way legal services are delivered and democratize access to legal aid by way of the cloud,” Newton told TechCrunch. “This investment allows us to expedite our plans and offer even more to our existing customers.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Clio in particular is growing in the EMEA markets with a current focus on the United Kingdom and Ireland.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a written statement, OMERS Growth Equity managing director Mark Shulgan said his firm has been following Clio for a number of years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“We believe Clio has clearly established itself as a market-leading legal tech firm, and will deliver growth for decades to come,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.guesty.com/">Guesty</a>, which has created property management software for hosts on short-term rental platforms like Airbnb and Vrbo, is announcing that it has raised $50 million in Series D funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the public markets, there are many players in hospitality property management,&#8221; said co-founder and CEO Amiad Soto. &#8220;The same thing goes with residential property management. In short-term rentals, there&#8217;s no public player — you can bet your money that we are eyeing that target.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the past year, Guesty expanded to support other types of property, including multi-unit listings and &#8220;aparthotels.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And just as Airbnb executives are <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56204079?utm_source=Nevistas">predicting a travel rebound this year</a>, co-founder and Soto said things are looking pretty good for Guesty&#8217;s business; in fact, he predicted that this is going to be &#8220;a hell of a year.&#8221; For example, summer reservation volume in the United States is 282% higher than in summer 2020, and even 32% higher than summer 2019. In the U.K., summer reservations are up 180% from last year (though down 19% from 2019).</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the pandemic changed travel, but not necessarily in bad ways across the board,&#8221; Soto said. &#8220;Definitely for major hotels, there are going to be big changes, but for vacation rentals and boutique-style hotels that offer different experience, this a lot more accessible and a lot more appealing. This is what our investors believe in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are incredibly excited to partner with the team at Guesty to help accelerate their mission to bring sophisticated property management solutions to a rapidly shifting global ecosystem,” O&#8217;Keefe said in a statement.</p>
<p>Soto added that the money will allow Guesty to continue investing in both growth and technology. For one thing, he said the company already uses machine learning to classify and route 80% of guest messages, and he sees opportunities to expand the use of artificial intelligence in the platform. The startup also plans to continue building out its marketplace of third-party integrations.</p>
<p>And Guesty has been busy on the acquisition front. Earlier this month, it announced <a href="https://www.guesty.com/blog/guesty-has-acquired-myvr/">acquiring fellow Y Combinator-backed property management platform MyVR</a>, and today it&#8217;s revealing that it has also bought another property management company, <a href="https://yourporter.com">Your Porter</a>. Soto said that with Your Porter&#8217;s technology, Guesty will be able to serve hosts from family-run businesses with a few units to enterprise-scale property management companies.</p>
<p>He added that there will likely be more acquisitions in Guesty&#8217;s future: &#8220;Instead of all of us duplicating resources, why won’t we share resources [&#8230;] and create a much broader product?&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.doordash.com">DoorDash</a> is announcing new pricing plans for the restaurants who use the platform for pickups and deliveries.</p>
<p>Before this, the company did not offer standardized pricing across restaurants. However, the question of how high delivery app fees might go (and how parsimonious the payments might be for restaurants as a result) prompted DoorDash to publish <a href="https://blog.doordash.com/understanding-merchant-fees-cbdfe057d15c">a long blog post</a> about its fee structure last fall.</p>
<p>In fact, Oregon and Washington have passed caps on delivery fees, while lawmakers in California, New York and Texas have <a href="https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/technology/calif-ny-texas-consider-delivery-fee-caps">proposed similar caps</a>. On a call with reporters to discuss the new pricing, DoorDash COO Christopher Payne denied that the company changed its pricing to appease lawmakers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This is not designed in response to legislation,&#8221; Payne said. &#8220;It&#8217;s designed in response to listening to restauranteurs and learning what they need.&#8221;</p>
<p>DoorDash now offers three plans to restaurants: DoorDash Basic, where restaurants only pay a 15% commission on deliveries, which shifts &#8220;a higher portion of the delivery cost to the customer&#8221; and supports a smaller delivery area; DoorDash Plus, where restaurants pay 25% to be part of DoorDash&#8217;s DashPass subscription program and get increased visibility in the DoorDash app; and DoorDash Premier, where restaurants pay 30% in exchange for the lowest customers fees, the largest delivery area and a growth guarantee of at least 20 orders per month across pickup, delivery and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/doordash-is-buying-caviar-from-square/">DoorDash-owned Caviar</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="aT1i7fY5mc"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/doordash-acquires-salad-making-robotics-startup-chowbotics/">DoorDash acquires salad-making robotics startup, Chowbotics</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;DoorDash acquires salad-making robotics startup, Chowbotics&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/doordash-acquires-salad-making-robotics-startup-chowbotics/embed/#?secret=aT1i7fY5mc" data-secret="aT1i7fY5mc" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Across all plans, DoorDash says it will now charge only a 6% commission on pickup orders.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s announcement includes statements from restaurant owners who are adopting the new plans. For example, here&#8217;s Sherry Copeland, owner of <a href="https://www.jaimeals.com">Jai Meals</a> in Plano, Texas:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jai Meals operates out of a local mall, so delivery has been an important part of how I have made up for lost income over the past year of dine-in closures. Despite this, my previous commission didn&#8217;t work for my business; it was hard to absorb that high of a cost, especially when delivery became a large percentage of my orders. With the Basic plan, I can offer delivery to customers, who increasingly enjoy the convenience delivery provides, but at a cost that is more aligned with my products, my goals and my customers’ needs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Payne said these plans will become available to all restaurants on DoorDash today, although it may take up to five days for the new pricing to fully take effect.  He added that DoorDash has been testing these plans over the past few months and that &#8220;we believe this will have negligible impact — no impact, really — on our economics, nor on Dasher earnings.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok will open a center in Europe where outside experts will be shown information on how it approaches content moderation and recommendation, as well as platform security and user privacy, it announced today.</p>
<p>The European Transparency and Accountability Centre (TAC) follows the opening of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/tiktok-to-open-a-transparency-center-where-outside-experts-can-examine-its-moderation-practices/">U.S. center last year</a> &#8212; and is similarly being billed as part of its &#8220;commitment to transparency&#8221;.</p>
<p>Soon after announcing its U.S. TAC, TikTok also created a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/tiktok-brings-in-outside-experts-to-help-it-craft-moderation-and-content-policies/">content advisory council</a> in the market &#8212; and went on to replicate the advisory body structure in Europe this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/tiktok-calls-in-outside-help-with-content-moderation-in-europe/">March</a>, with a different mix of experts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s now fully replicating the U.S. approach with a dedicated European TAC.</p>
<p>To-date, TikTok said more than 70 experts and policymakers have taken part in a virtual U.S. tour, where they&#8217;ve been able to learn operational details and pose questions about its safety and security practices.</p>
<p>The short-form video social media site has faced growing scrutiny over its content policies and ownership structure in recent years, as its popularity has surged.</p>
<p>Concerns in the U.S. have largely centered on the risk of censorship and the security of user data, given the platform is owned by a Chinese tech giant and subject to Internet data laws defined by the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>While, in Europe, lawmakers, regulators and civil society have been raising a broader mix of concerns &#8212; including around issues of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/tiktok-hit-with-consumer-child-safety-and-privacy-complaints-in-europe/">child safety and data privacy</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="aHVf72ObB4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/tiktok-hit-with-consumer-child-safety-and-privacy-complaints-in-europe/">TikTok hit with consumer, child safety and privacy complaints in Europe</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TikTok hit with consumer, child safety and privacy complaints in Europe&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/tiktok-hit-with-consumer-child-safety-and-privacy-complaints-in-europe/embed/#?secret=aHVf72ObB4" data-secret="aHVf72ObB4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In one notable development <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/tiktok-has-until-friday-to-respond-to-italys-order-to-block-users-it-cant-age-verify-after-girls-death/">earlier this year</a>, the Italian data protection regulator made an emergency intervention after the death of a local girl who had reportedly been taking part in a content challenge on the platform. TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/tiktok-will-recheck-the-age-of-every-user-in-italy-after-dpa-order/">agreed to recheck the age</a> of all users on its platform in Italy as a result.</p>
<p>TikTok said the European TAC will start operating virtually, owing to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. But the plan is to open a physical center in Ireland &#8212; where it bases its regional HQ &#8212; in 2022.</p>
<p>EU lawmakers have recently proposed a swathe of updates to digital legislation that look set to dial up emphasis on the accountability of AI systems &#8212; including content recommendation engines.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">draft AI regulation presented by the Commission last week</a> also proposes an outright ban on subliminal uses of AI technology to manipulate people&#8217;s behavior in a way that could be harmful to them or others. So content recommender engines that, for example, nudge users into harming themselves by suggestively promoting pro-suicide content or risky challenges may fall under the prohibition. (The draft law suggests fines of up to 6% of global annual turnover for breaching prohibitions.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly interesting to note TikTok also specifies that its European TAC will offer detailed insight into its recommendation technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Centre will provide an opportunity for experts, academics and policymakers to see first-hand the work TikTok teams put into making the platform a positive and secure experience for the TikTok community,&#8221; the company writes in a press release, adding that visiting experts will also get insights into how it uses technology &#8220;to keep TikTok&#8217;s community safe&#8221;; how trained content review teams make decisions about content based on its Community Guidelines; and &#8220;the way human reviewers supplement moderation efforts using technology to help catch potential violations of our policies&#8221;.</p>
<p>Another component of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">EU&#8217;s draft AI regulation</a> sets a requirement for human oversight of high risk applications of artificial intelligence. Although it&#8217;s not clear whether a social media platform would fall under that specific obligation, given the current set of categories in the draft regulation.</p>
<p>However the AI regulation is just one piece of the Commission&#8217;s platform-focused rule-making.</p>
<p>Late last year it also proposed broader updates to rules for digital services, under the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">DSA and DMA</a>, which will place due diligence obligations on platforms &#8212; and also require larger platforms to explain any algorithmic rankings and hierarchies they generate. And TikTok is very likely to fall under that requirement.</p>
<p>The UK &#8212; which is now outside the bloc, post-Brexit &#8212; is also working on its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/uk-online-harms-bill-coming-next-year-will-propose-fines-of-up-to-10-of-annual-turnover-for-breaching-duty-of-care-rules/">Online Safety regulation</a>, due to present this year. So, in the coming years, there will be multiple content-focused regulatory regimes for platforms like TikTok to comply with in Europe. And opening algorithms to outside experts may be hard legal requirement, not soft PR.</p>
<p>Commenting on the launch of its European TAC in a statement, Cormac Keenan, TikTok&#8217;s head of trust and safety, said: <em>&#8220;</em>With more than 100 million users across Europe, we recognise our responsibility to gain the trust of our community and the broader public. Our Transparency and Accountability Centre is the next step in our journey to help people better understand the teams, processes, and technology we have to help keep TikTok a place for joy, creativity, and fun. We know there&#8217;s lots more to do and we&#8217;re excited about proactively addressing the challenges that lie ahead. I&#8217;m looking forward to welcoming experts from around Europe and hearing their candid feedback on ways we can further improve our systems.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swedish digital health startup <a href="https://www.kry.se/en/">Kry</a>, which offers a telehealth service (and software tools) to connect clinicians with patients for remote consultations, last raised just before the pandemic hit in Western Europe, netting a €140M Series C in January 2020.</p>
<p>Today it&#8217;s announcing an oversubscribed sequel: The Series D raise clocks in at $312M (€262M) and will be used to keep stepping on the growth gas in the region.</p>
<p>Investors in this latest round for the 2015-founded startup are a mix of old and new backers: The Series D is led by CPP Investments (aka, the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board) and Fidelity Management &amp; Research LLC, with participation from existing investors including The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, as well as European-based VC firms Index Ventures, Accel, Creandum and Project A.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The need for people to socially distance during the coronavirus pandemic has given obvious uplift to the telehealth category, accelerating the rate of adoption of digital health tools that enable remote consultations by both patients and clinicians. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/kry-launches-free-service-for-doctors-to-do-video-consultations-during-covid-19-crisis/">Kry quickly stepped in</a> to offer a free service for doctors to conduct web-based consultations last year, saying at the time that it felt a huge responsibility to help.</p>
<p>That agility in a time of public health crisis has clearly paid off. Kry&#8217;s year-over-year growth in 2020 was 100% &#8212; meaning that the ~1.6M digital doctors appointments it had served up a year ago now exceed 3M. Some 6,000 clinicians are also now using its telehealth platform and software tools. (It doesn&#8217;t break out registered patient numbers).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="I7xG6BdHZ8"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/kry-launches-free-service-for-doctors-to-do-video-consultations-during-covid-19-crisis/">Kry launches free service for doctors to do video consultations during COVID-19 crisis</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Kry launches free service for doctors to do video consultations during COVID-19 crisis&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/kry-launches-free-service-for-doctors-to-do-video-consultations-during-covid-19-crisis/embed/#?secret=I7xG6BdHZ8" data-secret="I7xG6BdHZ8" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Yet co-founder and CEO, Johannes Schildt, says that, in some ways, it&#8217;s been a rather quiet 12 months for healthcare demand.</p>
<p>Sure the pandemic has driven specific demand, related to COVID-19 &#8212; including around testing for the disease (a service Kry offers in some of its markets) &#8212; but he says national lockdowns and coronavirus concerns have also dampened some of the usual demand for healthcare. So he&#8217;s confident that the 100% growth rate Kry has seen amid the COVID-19 public health crisis is just a taster of what&#8217;s to come &#8212; as healthcare provision shifts toward more digital delivery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Obviously we have been on the right side of a global pandemic. And if you look back the mega trend was obviously there long before the pandemic but the pandemic has accelerated the trend and it has served us and the industry well in terms of anchoring what we do. It&#8217;s now very well anchored across the globe &#8212; that telemedicine and digital healthcare is a crucial part of the healthcare systems moving forward,&#8221; Schildt tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Demand has been increasing during the year, most obviously, but if you look at the broader picture of healthcare delivery &#8212; in most European markets &#8212; you actually have healthcare usage at an all time low. Because a lot of people are not as sick anymore given that you have tight restrictions. So it&#8217;s this rather strange dynamic. If you look at healthcare usage in general it&#8217;s actually at an all time low. But telemedicine is on an upward trend and we are operating on higher volumes&#8230; than we did before. And that is great, and we have been hiring a lot of great clinicians and been shipping a lot of great tools for clinicians to make the shift to digital.&#8221;</p>
<p>The free version of Kry&#8217;s tools for clinicians generated &#8220;big uplift&#8221; for the business, per Schildt, but he&#8217;s more excited about the wider service delivery shifts that are happening as the pandemic has accelerated uptake of digital health tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me the biggest thing has been that [telemedicine is] now very well established, it&#8217;s well anchored&#8230; There is still a different level of maturity between different European markets. Even [at the time of Kry&#8217;s Series C round last year] telemedicine was maybe not something that was a given &#8212; for us it&#8217;s always been of course; for me it&#8217;s always been crystal clear that this is the way of the future; it&#8217;s a necessity, you need to shift a lot of the healthcare delivery to digital. We just need to get there.&#8221;</p>
<p>The shift to digital is a necessary one, Schildt argues, in order to widen access to (inevitably) limited healthcare resources vs ever growing demand (current pandemic lockdown dampeners excepted). This is why Kry&#8217;s focus has always been on solving inefficiencies in healthcare delivery.</p>
<p>It seeks to do that in a variety of ways &#8212; including by offering support tools for clinicians working in public healthcare systems (for example, more than 60% of all the GPs in the UK market, where most healthcare is delivered via the taxpayer-funded NHS, is using Kry&#8217;s tools, per Schildt); as well as (in a few markets) running a full healthcare service itself where it combines telemedicine with a network of physical clinics where users can go when they need to be examined in person by a clinician. It also has partnerships with private healthcare providers in Europe.</p>
<p>In short, Kry is agnostic about how it helps deliver healthcare. That philosophy extends to the tech side &#8212; meaning video consultations are just one component of its telemedicine business which offers remote consultations for a range of medical issues, including infections, skin conditions, stomach problems and psychological disorders. (Obviously not every issue can be treated remotely but at the primary care level there are plenty of doctor-patient visits that don&#8217;t need to take place in person.)</p>
<p>Kry&#8217;s product roadmap &#8212; which is getting an investment boost with this new funding &#8212; involves expanding its patient-facing app to offer more digitally delivered treatments, such as Internet Cognitive Based Therapy (ICBT) and mental health self-assessment tools. It also plans to invest in digital healthcare tools to support chronic healthcare conditions &#8212; whether by developing more digital treatments itself (either by digitizing existing, proven treatments or coming up with novel approaches), and/or expanding its capabilities via acquisitions and strategic partnerships, according to Schildt.</p>
<p>Over the past five+ years, a growing number of startups have been digitizing proven treatment programs, such as for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/21/big-health/">disorders like insomnia</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/18/joyable-launches-online-tools-to-help-you-overcome-social-anxiety/">anxiety</a>, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/kaia-health-gets-26m-to-show-it-can-do-more-with-digital-therapeutics/">musculoskeletal and chronic conditions</a> that might otherwise require accessing a physiotherapist in person. Options for partners for Kry to work with on expanding its platform are certainly plentiful &#8212; although it&#8217;s developed the ICBT programs in house so isn&#8217;t afraid to tackle the digital treatment side itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given that we are in the fourth round of this massive change and transition in healthcare it makes a lot of sense for us to continue to invest in great tools for clinicians to deliver high quality care at great efficiency and deepening the experience from the patient side so we can continue to help even more people,&#8221; says Schildt.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of what we do we do is through video and text but that&#8217;s just one part of it. Now we&#8217;re investing a lot in our mental health plans and doing ICBT treatment plans. We&#8217;re going deeper into chronic treatments. We have great tools for clinicians to deliver high quality care at scale. Both digitally and physically because our platform supports both of it. And we have put a lot of effort during this year to link together our digital healthcare delivery with our physical healthcare delivery that we sometimes run ourselves and we sometimes do in partnerships. So the video itself is just one piece of the puzzle. And for us it&#8217;s always been about making sure we saw this from the end consumer&#8217;s perspective, from the patient&#8217;s perspective.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a patient myself and still a lot of what we do is driven by my own frustration on how inefficient the system is structured in some areas,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;You do have a lot of great clinicians out there but there&#8217;s truly a lack of patient focus and in a lot of European markets there&#8217;s a clear access problem. And that has always been our starting point &#8212; how can we make sure that we solve this in a better way for the patients? And then obviously that involves us both building strong tools and front ends for patients so they can easily access care and manage their health, be pro-active about their health. It also involves us building great tools for clinicians that they can operate and work within &#8212; and there we&#8217;re putting way more effort as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of clinicians are using our tools to deliver digital care &#8212; not only clinicians that we run ourselves but ones we&#8217;re partnering with. So we do a lot of it in partnerships. And then also, given that we are a European provider, it involves us partnering with both public and private payers to make sure that the end consumer can actually access care.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another batch of startups in the digital healthcare delivery space talk a big game about &#8216;democratizing&#8217; access to healthcare with the help of AI-fuelled triage or even diagnosis chatbots &#8212; with the idea that these tools can replace at least some of the work done by human doctors. The loudest on that front is probably <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/babylon-health-confirms-550m-raise-to-expand-its-ai-based-health-services-to-the-us-and-asia/">Babylon Health</a>.</p>
<p>Kry, by contrast, has avoided flashy AI hype, even though its tools do frequently incorporate machine learning technology, per Schildt. It also doesn&#8217;t offer a diagnosis chatbot. The reason for its different emphasis comes back to the choice of problem to focus on: Inefficiencies in healthcare delivery &#8212; with Schildt arguing that decision-making by doctors isn&#8217;t anywhere near the top of the list of service pain-points in the sector.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re obviously using what would be considered AI or machine learning tools in all products that we&#8217;re building. I think sometimes personally I&#8217;m a bit annoyed at companies screaming and shouting about the technology itself and less about what problem you are solving with it,&#8221; he tells us. &#8220;On the decision-support [front], we don&#8217;t have the same sort of chatbot system that some other companies do, no. It&#8217;s obviously something that we could build really effortlessly. But I think &#8212; for me &#8212; it&#8217;s always about asking yourself what is the problem that you&#8217;re solving for? For the patient. And to be honest I don&#8217;t find it very useful.</p>
<p>&#8220;In many cases, especially in primary care, you have two categories. You have patients that already know why they need help, because you have a urinary tract infection; you had it before. You have an eye infection. You have a rash &#8212;  you know that it&#8217;s a rash, you need to see someone, you need to get help. Or you&#8217;re worried about your symptoms and you&#8217;re not really sure what it is &#8212; and you need comfort. And I think we&#8217;re not there yet where a chatbot would give you that sort of comfort, if this is something severe or not. You still want to talk to a human being. So I think it&#8217;s of limited use.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then on the decision side of it &#8212; sort of making sure that clinicians are making better decisions &#8212; we are obviously doing decision support for our clinicians. But if it&#8217;s one thing clinicians are really good at it&#8217;s actually making decisions. And if you look into the inefficiencies in healthcare the decision-making process is not the inefficiency. The matching side is an inefficiency side.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gives the example of how much the Swedish healthcare system spends on translators (circa €200M) as a &#8220;huge inefficiency&#8221; that could be reduced simply &#8212; by smarter matching of multilingual clinicians to patients.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of our doctors are bilingual but they&#8217;re not there at the same time as the patient. So on the matching side you have a lot of inefficiency &#8212; and that&#8217;s where we have spent time on, for example. How can we sort that, how can we make sure that a patient that is seeking help with us ends up with the right level of care? If that is someone that speaks your native language so you can actually understand each other. Is this something that could be fully treated by a nurse? Or should it be directly to a psychologist?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With all technology it&#8217;s always about how do we use technology to solve a real problem, it&#8217;s less about the technology itself,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Another &#8216;inefficiency&#8217; that can affect healthcare provision in Europe relates to a problematic incentive to try to shrink costs (and, if it&#8217;s private healthcare, maximize an insurer&#8217;s profits) by making it harder for patients to access primary medical care &#8212; whether through complicated claims processes or by offering a bare minimum of information and support to access services (or indeed limiting appointment availability), making patients do the legwork of tracking down a relevant professional for their particular complaint and obtaining a coveted slot to see them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a maddening dynamic in a sector that should be focused on making as many people as healthy as they possibly can be in order that they avoid as much disease as possible &#8212; obviously as that outcome is better for the patients themselves. But also given the costs involved in treating really sick people (medical and societal). A wide range of chronic conditions, from type 2 diabetes to lower back pain, can be particularly costly to treat and yet may be entirely preventable with the right interventions.</p>
<p>Schildt sees a key role for digital healthcare tools to drive a much needed shift toward the kind of preventative healthcare that would be better all round, for both patients and for healthcare costs.</p>
<p>&#8220;That annoys me a lot,&#8221; he says. &#8220;That&#8217;s sometimes how healthcare systems are structured because it&#8217;s just costly for them to deliver healthcare so they try to make it as hard as possible for people to access healthcare &#8212; which is an absurdity and also one of the reasons why you now have increasing costs in healthcare systems in general, it&#8217;s exactly that. Because you have a lack of access in the first point of contact, with primary care. And what happens is you do have a spillover effect to secondary care.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see that in the data in all European markets. You have people ending up in emergency rooms that should have been treated in primary care but they can&#8217;t access primary care because there&#8217;s no access &#8212; you don&#8217;t know how to get in there, it&#8217;s long waiting times, it&#8217;s just triaged to different levels without getting any help and you have people with urinary tract infections ending up in emergency rooms. It&#8217;s super costly&#8230; when you have healthcare systems trying to fend people off. That&#8217;s not the right way doing it. You have to &#8212; and I think we will be able to play a crucial role in that in the coming ten years &#8212; push the whole system into being more preventative and proactive and access is a key part of that.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to make it very, very simple for the patients &#8212; that they should be able to reach out to us and we will direct you to the right level of care.&#8221;</p>
<p>With so much still to do tackling the challenges of healthcare delivery in Europe, Kry isn&#8217;t in a hurry to expand its services geographically. Its main markets are Sweden, Norway, France, Germany and the UK, where it operates a healthcare service itself (not necessarily nationwide), though it notes that it offers a video consultation service to 30 regional markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now we are very European focused,&#8221; says Schildt, when asked whether it has any plans for a U.S. launch. &#8220;I would never say that we would never go outside of Europe but for here and now we are extremely focused on Europe, we know those markets very, very well. We know how to manoeuvre in the European systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a very different payer infrastructure in Europe vs the US and then it&#8217;s also so that focus is always king and Europe is the mega market. Healthcare is 10% of the GDP in all European markets, we don&#8217;t have to go outside of Europe to build a very big business. But for the time being I think it makes a lot of sense for us to stay focused.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Wunder Mobility built its business selling software to shared scooter, e-bike and even short-term car rental startups. Now, it&#8217;s banking on a new — and once secret — lending division to bring in more revenue that&#8217;ll giving micromobility operators another option to access capital without having pitch venture capitalists and other investors.</p>
<p>The company announced the official launch of Wunder Capital, a subsidiary that <span style="font-weight: 400;">provides micromobility operators with fleet financing solutions. Wunder Capital, which has been </span>operating in stealth mode for two years, has already provided financing to more than 25 businesses, according to the company.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As shared micromobility becomes the norm, the industry has the chance to scale dramatically, Gunnar Froh, Wunder Mobility’s founder and CEO, said in a recent interview. He believes traditional VC-backed funding rounds are too slow to keep up with the level of growth required to keep up with increasing demand.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Now you can now basically launch in a few weeks on our software platform and also get vehicles through us that are optimized for the sharing case, and then pay for them entirely through revenue share,&#8221; Froh told TechCrunch.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wunder Capital aims to become a one-stop-shop for shared operators looking for operational software, high-quality vehicles and the money to purchase them. Froh estimates that such a package deal would cost an operator about 40% of monthly revenue. </span></p>
<p>The founder originally saw the potential to diversify Wunder&#8217;s portfolio when he noticed how much influence his sales team had on operators&#8217; vehicle purchasing decisions. After his team would set up new operators with an app and software, operators would inevitably ask for vehicle manufacturer recommendations.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wunder Mobility said Tuesday it is also </span>partnering with <span style="font-weight: 400;">Yadea, a dominant manufacturer of light-duty electric vehicles in China, to co-develop an e-moped that&#8217;s been refitted for shared use. The company also intends to co-develop and finance e-bikes and kick scooters this year, but did not specify which manufacturers it would work with. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;We put reseller agreements in place, so we would always recommend this Yadea moped and then get a margin on it,&#8221; said Froh. &#8220;Then we&#8217;d talk to Yadea and give them modifications to make the mopeds sharing ready, and then we&#8217;d have an opportunity to talk to the operators about how they&#8217;re going to finance this purchase, what limitations are you facing, and so on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wunder Capital most recently added German electric moped sharing company emmy as a financing customer. Wunder Capital will finance 1,500 refitted Yadea G5L e-mopeds for emmy&#8217;s locations in Munich, Hamburg and Berlin. In contrast to Yadea&#8217;s consumer models, these mopeds will have a sturdier base, more intuitive controls, doubled range and improved battery management systems.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some companies go through venture capital, but it’s very costly in terms of return expectations and the control they want to have, and it’s holding people back from expanding their fleets,” Froh said. </span>&#8220;We refinance through banks that would not usually look at a single operator and feel comfortable about the resale of these vehicles. We combine several operators into one portfolio and then we have access to a liquid secondary market.&#8221;</p>
<p>In order to ascertain risk and inform loan decisions, Wunder Capital uses APIs to <span style="font-weight: 400;">collect anonymized trip data from operators that compares operational efficiency between companies. This data collection also allows the division to flag if an operator isn&#8217;t doing well and is at risk of coming up short on payments, in which case Wunder Capital can proactively reach out about restructuring loans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If a default happens, we can take vehicles from one operator and send them to another one somewhere else in the world,&#8221; said Froh. &#8220;So with this model, we can refinance relatively cheaply.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla&#8217;s relationship with bitcoin is not a dalliance, according to the comments made by the company&#8217;s CFO and dubbed &#8220;master of coin&#8221; Zach Kirkhorn during an earnings call Monday. Instead, the company believes </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the longevity of bitcoin, despite its volatility.</span></p>
<p>Tesla invested $1.5 <span style="font-weight: 400;">billion in bitcoin this quarter and then trimmed its position by 10%, Kirkhorn said during the company quarterly earnings call. That sale made a $101 million </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“positive impact” to the company’s profitability in the first quarter, he added. Tesla also allows customers to make vehicle deposits and final vehicle purchases using bitcoin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla turned to bitcoin as a place to store cash and still access it immediately, all while providing a better return on investment than more traditional central bank-backed safe havens. Of course, the higher yields provided by the volatile digital currency comes with higher risk. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla bucks the trend of the more cautionary Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell who noted back in March at virtual summit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5bVtzQt4Uc">hosted by the Bank for International Settlements</a> that the Fed considers crypto speculative assets that are highly</span> volatile and therefore not useful stores of value. That matters because the basic function of currency is its ability to store value. He also noted that digital currencies are not backed by anything and compared it to gold and not the dollar.</p>
<p>From Kirkhorn:</p>
<blockquote><p>Elon and I were looking for a place to store cash that wasn&#8217;t being immediately used, try to get some level of return on this, but also preserve liquidity, you know, particularly as we look forward to the launch of Austin and Berlin and uncertainty that&#8217;s happening with semiconductors and port capacity, being able to access our cash very quickly is super important to us right now.</p>
<p>And, you know, there aren&#8217;t many traditional opportunities to do this or at least that we found and and talking to others that we could get good feedback on, particularly with yields being so low and without taking on additional risk or sacrificing liquidity. Bitcoin seemed at the time, and so far has proven to be a good decision, a good place to place some of our cash that&#8217;s not immediately being used for daily operations or maybe not needed till the end of the year, and be able to get some return on that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tesla is watching the digital currency closely, Kirkhorn said, noting that there is a lot of reason to be optimistic.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, thinking about it from a corporate treasury perspective, we&#8217;ve been quite pleased with how much liquidity there is in the bitcoin market,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our ability to build our first position happened very quickly.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla CEO Elon Musk wants to turn every home into a distributed power plant that would generate, store and even deliver energy back into the electricity grid, all using the company&#8217;s products.</p>
<p>While the company has been selling solar and energy storage products for years, a new company policy to only sell solar coupled with the energy storage products, along with Musk&#8217;s comments Monday, reveal a strategy that aims to scale these businesses by appealing to utilities.</p>
<p>“This is a prosperous future both for Tesla and for the utilities,” he said. “If this is not done, the utilities will fail to serve their customers. They won’t be able to do it,” Musk said during an investor call, noting the rolling blackouts in California last summer and the more recent grid failure in Texas as evidence that grid reliability has become a bigger concern.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last week, the company changed its website to prevent customers from only buying solar or its Powerwall energy storage product and instead required purchasing a system. Musk later announced the move <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1385042598692147204">in a tweet</a>, stating “solar power will feed exclusively to Powerwall&#8221; and that &#8220;Powerwall will interface only between utility meter and house main breaker panel, enabling super simple install and seamless whole house backup during utility dropouts.”</p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s pitch is that the grid would need more power lines, more power plants and larger substations to fully decarbonize using renewables plus storage. Distributed residential systems — of course using Tesla products — would provide a better path, in Musk&#8217;s view. His claim has been backed up in part by recent studies from the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2542435120305572">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, which found that the U.S. can reach a zero-carbon grid by more than doubling its transmission capacity, and another from <a href="https://netzeroamerica.princeton.edu/img/Princeton_NZA_Interim_Report_15_Dec_2020_FINAL.pdf">Princeton University</a> showing that the country may need to triple its transmission systems by 2050 to reach net-zero emissions.</p>

<p>Musk is imagining a radically different electricity grid system than the one we have today, which is centrally controlled and run by grid operators, independent organizations such as the California Independent System Operator or the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. It&#8217;s a vision that is riddled with bureaucratic and logistical challenges. Utilities and regulatory policy would need to solve how to handle a large influx of so-called &#8220;distributed energy resources,&#8221; such as solar panels on residential roofs, which may run contrary to utilities’ long-established business models.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that whether renewables-plus-storage will be alone sufficient to decarbonize the energy grid is a contentious question. Many experts believing that the land use demands, storage requirements and intermittency issues of renewables may make their role as the country’s primary electricity generator a pipe dream. But Musk has long been bullish on the renewables-plus-storage model, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1276959792876011520">tweeting</a> last July that “physics favors electric transport, batteries for stationary storage &amp; solar/wind for energy generation.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a years-long crypto winter, it been the spring of NFTs, but as digital art prices sober up after an explosion in sales, blockchain founders are looking to find more stable opportunities in the space that can grow over time even as speculative interest in NFTs shifts.</p>
<p>One particular interest has been using NFTs to reshape the creator economy in a manner that actually benefits artists more than the platforms that host their work. A new flavor of this pursuit comes from the recently launched <a href="https://sing.link/">S!NG</a> (pronounced sing), which has built a platform around simply letting users upload files to their servers and time-stamp those uploads on the Ethereum blockchain. It&#8217;s a dead-simple mechanic with an ambitious framing, ensuring that artists maintain credit for their work as they create it.</p>
<p>The team behind the app sees a future where artists use the platform as an autosave for their intellectual property during the creative process, enabling them to scribble down notes or upload a quick demo and save those moments on the blockchain, a step that they hope can eliminate or expedite rights disputes for creators that can point to a clearly time-stamped breadcrumbs trail. By virtue of the app&#8217;s name, it&#8217;s clear that they are aiming to attract songwriters and musicians in particular, but the company&#8217;s onboarding also showcases wider ambition in the creator world, enabling users to designate if they are a photographer, writer or programmer as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have the best of both worlds with very public witnesses to a very private event,&#8221; says CEO Geoff Osler. &#8220;Your content is never out there, but you can have this massive attestation to the fact that it exists at a certain point in time.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The NFT market is just getting started, but where is it headed?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/the-nft-market-is-just-getting-started-but-where-is-it-headed/embed/#?secret=dFY7X7DxM7" data-secret="dFY7X7DxM7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The iOS app itself is pretty straightforward. After uploading a piece of media, be it a photo, video, audio or text file, users can tack on additional files, make note of additional collaborators or add notes before submitting it and christening the work on the blockchain. The file itself is private with a hash hosted on the blockchain while the encrypted files are stored on S!NG&#8217;s AWS servers, so creators don&#8217;t need to worry about their early ideas being served up to a public audience. A concern here for early adopters is what happens if the blockchain startup eventually goes under and those servers go with it, but that&#8217;s an issue facing plenty of startups that are backing the underlying media files of NFTs on centralized servers.</p>

<p>Rights disputes might be something more top-of-mind to those who have spent substantial time in their specific creative industry, compared to budding artists who are likely wholly concerned with getting their work seen in the first place. While public links allow a work&#8217;s origins to be tracked down once it&#8217;s complete and ready for public consumption, S!NG&#8217;s aim is to develop those moments earlier in the development of a work and aid artists who might be involved with more collaborative creative processes where ownership of ideas can appear more obfuscated from a legal standpoint.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I get something stolen from me, I&#8217;ve got a team that&#8217;s going to defend me and they&#8217;re probably going to win or settle any claims, but if you&#8217;re a 16-year-old kid, you don&#8217;t have that ability so that&#8217;s what we want to provide, but more as a deterrent,&#8221; musician and advisor Raine Maida tells TechCrunch. &#8220;I think when you see the S!NG watermark or you see that it&#8217;s saved and shared through the wallet&#8230; you don&#8217;t have to understand blockchain but you&#8217;ll know S!NG is that company that protects you.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the time being, non-fungible token-based legal defenses are probably a bit unusual, but the team&#8217;s founders believe that blockchain-based ownership proofs will be entering case law organically just as technology like DocuSign has been accepted.</p>
<p>If the company can successfully push creators to weave the S!NG platform into their toolkits, the startup will have plenty of opportunities on which to capitalize in the incredibly young blockchain creator space. While many artists may see the NFT space as a speculative cash grab, the company&#8217;s founders seem publicly focused on sidestepping hype for the time being.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frankly I don&#8217;t give a shit about all of this crazy NFT stuff with things selling for a bazillion dollars,&#8221; Osler says. &#8220;I&#8217;m interested in the small artist who has 1,000 fans who will eagerly pay up $15 to keep that person in business.&#8221;</p>

<p>We sat down last week with Brendan Wallace, co-founder and general manager of Fifth Wall, and Hippo CEO Assaf Wand for an episode of Extra Crunch Live to discuss all of the above.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> goes down every Wednesday at 3 p.m. EDT/noon PDT. Our next episode is with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/extra-crunch-live-forerunner-and-oura/">Forerunner&#8217;s Eurie Kim and Oura CEO Harpreet Rai</a>, and you can check out the upcoming schedule right <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/check-out-the-tech-leaders-joining-us-on-extra-crunch-live-in-may/">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, dive into the wide-ranging conversation we had with Wallace and Wand. You can find the full video, including the EC Live pitch-off, below.</p>
<h2>Investing in the board</h2>
<p>The first step in running a useful and beneficial board is determining who should be on that board, and that starts with the first round of capital investment and carries on forever.</p>
<p>One of the strategic benefits of Fifth Wall as an investor, according to Wallace, is that the firm was built specifically with strategic LPs in the real estate realm, allowing the firm to connect portfolio companies with massive incumbent players in the industry. Incumbents get access to new tools and software, portfolio companies get big customers, and Fifth Wall gets to reap the benefits of both. It&#8217;s a rare win-win-win.</p>
<p>We asked Wand about how he chose his investors, and how to weigh the value of a top-tier VC firm and a strategic angel investor, for example.</p>
<p>He explained that there is no right answer to a question like that, but it should always be thoroughly discussed by the team. One of the benefits of having a top-tier VC firm on board is that it has a signaling effect, helping you to recruit early team members and open doors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another week, another big tech hearing in Congress. With a flurry of antitrust reform bills <a href="https://www.axios.com/tech-antitrust-facebook-google-amazon-apple-275f122d-b3f5-49cb-b223-f77c95a49252.html">on the way</a>, Democratic lawmakers are again bringing in some of the world&#8217;s most powerful tech companies for questioning.</p>
<p>In the next hearing, <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/algorithms-and-amplification-how-social-media-platforms-design-choices-shape-our-discourse-and-our-minds">scheduled for Tuesday, April 27 at 10 AM ET</a>, the Senate Judiciary&#8217;s subcommittee on privacy and technology will zero in on concerns about algorithmic amplification. Specifically, the hearing will explore how algorithms amplify dangerous content and shape user behavior on social platforms.</p>
<p>The subcommittee&#8217;s chair Sen. Chris Coons <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/18/chris-coons-facebook-twitter-hearing-477080">previously indicated</a> that he would bring in tech CEOs, but Tuesday&#8217;s hearing will instead feature testimony from policy leads at Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The hearing might prove a unique opportunity to hold YouTube&#8217;s feet to the fire. In spite of being one of the biggest social networks in the world — one without much transparency about its regular failures to control extremism and misinformation — YouTube seldom winds up under the microscope with Congress. The company will be represented by Alexandra Veitch, YouTube&#8217;s regional director of public policy.</p>
<p>In past big tech hearings, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has generally appeared on behalf of YouTube&#8217;s parent company while YouTube’s chief executive Susan Wojcicki inexplicably escapes scrutiny. Google is a massive entity and concerns specific to YouTube and its policies generally get lost in the mix, with lawmakers usually going after Pichai for concerns around Google&#8217;s search and ads businesses.</p>

<p>In a stylistic repeat of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/senate-antitrust-hearing-apple-tile-spotify-match-epic/">last week&#8217;s adversarial app store hearing</a>, which featured Apple as well as some of its critics, misinformation researcher Dr. Joan Donovan and ex-Googler and frequent big tech critic Tristan Harris will also testify Tuesday. That tension can create deeper questioning, providing outside expertise that can fill in some lapses in lawmakers&#8217; technical knowledge.</p>
<p>Policy leads at these companies might not make the same flashy headlines, but given their intimate knowledge of the content choices these companies make every day, they do provide an opportunity for more substance. Tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Dorsey have been dragged in to so many hearings at this point that they begin to run together, and the top executives generally reveal very little while sometimes playing dumb about the day-to-day decision making on their platforms. The subcommittee&#8217;s ranking member Ben Sasse (R-NE) <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/23/facebook-youtube-twitter-testify-senate-484456">emphasized that point</a>, stating that the hearing would be a learning opportunity and not a &#8220;show hearing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Democrats have been sounding the alarm on algorithms for some time. While Republicans spent the latter half of the Trump administration hounding tech companies about posts they remove, Democrats instead focused on the violent content, extremism and sometimes deadly misinformation that gets left up and even boosted by the secretive algorithms tech companies rarely shed light on.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We haven&#8217;t seen much in the way of algorithmic transparency, but that could change. One narrowly targeted <a href="https://eshoo.house.gov/media/press-releases/reps-eshoo-and-malinowski-introduce-bill-hold-tech-platforms-liable-algorithmic">Section 230 reform bill in the House</a> would strip that law&#8217;s protections from large companies when their algorithms amplify extremism or violate civil rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has also hinted that a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-and-facebooks-senate-judiciary-hearing-philosophies/">different approach might be on the horizon</a>, suggesting that users could hand-pick their preferred algorithms in the future, possibly even selecting them from a kind of third-party marketplace. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Needless to say, Facebook didn&#8217;t indicate any plans to give its own users more algorithmic control. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">With any major changes to the way platforms decide who sees what likely a long ways off, expect to see lawmakers try to pry open some black boxes on Tuesday.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today after the bell, American electric car company Tesla <a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/R3GJMT_TSLA_Q1_2021_Update_5KJWZA.pdf?xseo=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q1-2021-Update.pdf%22">reported its Q1 2021 financial performance</a>. The company lost modest ground on the stock market after its news broke.</p>
<p>For the broader electric vehicle and battery startup market that has pursued <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/lucid-motors-strikes-spac-deal-to-go-public-with-24-billion-valuation/">many SPAC-led combinations</a> in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/battery-companies-are-the-latest-spac-target-as-evs-get-a-huge-regulatory-boost/">recent months</a>, the generally positive Tesla trailing results could prove a boon, underscoring continued market demand for their category&#8217;s hardware.</p>
<p>Turning to the numbers, in the first three quarters of the year, Tesla generated revenues of $10.389 billion, gross profit of $2.215 billion and net income of $438 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tesla earned adjusted net income of $1.052 billion, leading to diluted, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.93. The street had <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/analysis?p=TSLA">expected</a> the company to report $10.29 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $0.79. Shares of Tesla are off around 1% in after-hours trading, after the company reported its top and bottom-line beat.</p>
<p>Tesla grew sharply compared to its year-ago period, in which the company generated $5.985 billion in top-line revenue, leading to just $68 million worth of net income. Compared to that year-ago period, Tesla&#8217;s Q1 2021 saw its revenues expand by 74%, its automotive gross margin improve by just under 1% (95 basis points), its aggregate gross margins better themselves by slightly less (70 basis points), and its net income explode 1,850% while its adjusted net income grew by an also impressive 304%.</p>
<p>In the same three-month period, Tesla&#8217;s operating cash flow came to $1.641 billion. The company can comfortably self-fund at that pace of cash generation. That&#8217;s underscored by the fact that Tesla closed its first quarter with cash and cash equivalents worth a total of $17.1 billion.</p>
<p>Tracking neatly with its 75% revenue growth was automotive production growth of 76% in the first quarter, with the company producing 180,338 cars, far above its year-ago Q1 tally of 102,672 units. Deliveries of vehicles rose 109%, to 184,877, over the same timeframe.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s solar and energy storage businesses also posted material growth: Solar deployments rose 163% to 92 megawatts, while storage deployment rose 71% to 445 megawatt hours.</p>
<p>Turning to outlook, Tesla told investors in its deck that &#8220;over a multiyear horizon, [the company expects] to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries.&#8221; The company added that it anticipates Tesla Semi deliveries to commence this year, adding another revenue line to the company&#8217;s product mix.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, investors expect Tesla adjusted net income to rise to $0.99 per diluted share this quarter, off of revenues totaling $11.39 billion.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">There’s a disconnect between reality and the added value investors are promising entrepreneurs. Three in five founders who were promised added value by their VCs <a href="https://forwardpartners.com/more-than-money/">felt duped</a> by their negative experience.</p>
<p>While this feels like a letdown by investors, in reality, it shows fault on both sides. Due diligence isn’t a one-way street, and founders must do their homework to make sure they’re not jumping into deals with VCs who are only paying lip service to their value-add.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Looking into an investor’s past, reputation and connections isn’t about finding the perfect VC, it’s about knowing what shaking certain hands will entail &#8212; and either being ready for it or walking away.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs are increasingly demanding more than a blank check: They want mentorship, product understanding and emotional support, as well as industry connections and expertise. If VCs can’t bring that value, founders now have plenty of other funding routes to choose from, like crowdfunding, angel syndicates, tokenization and SPACs.</p>
<p>To stay competitive, VCs have to at least <em>advertise </em>that they have more than deep pockets. But what if it stops there? Founders have to know exactly what they’re looking for in a VC, which means looking past the front page and vetting their investors.</p>
<p>The ideal investor for modern startups is an operator VC &#8212; someone who was a founder or operator at a company before becoming an investor. But even then, ticking boxes isn’t enough to ensure the investor won’t come with their own<a href="https://avc.com/2017/05/investor-vcs-and-operator-vcs/"> challenges</a>, like being too hands-on or less strategically minded.</p>
<p>Looking into an investor’s past, reputation and connections isn’t about finding the perfect VC, it’s about knowing what shaking certain hands will entail &#8212; and either being ready for it or walking away. There is no single solution to this issue, but here are my recommendations to founders seeking a successful investor relationship in 2021.</p>
<h2>Have a guiding framework</h2>
<p>No founder-investor relationship can survive misalignment. Because you share responsibility on so many processes, both parties have to be on the same page. So before you even start fundraising, nail down the expectations you need your future investor to meet. What do you need the most? What does your dream investor look like?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ride-hailing company Lyft has sold off its autonomous vehicle unit to Toyota&#8217;s Woven Planet Holdings subsidiary for $550 million, the latest in a string of acquisitions spurred by the cost and lengthy timelines to commercialize autonomous vehicle technology.</p>
<p>Under the acquisition agreement announced Tuesday, Lyft&#8217;s so-called Level 5 division will be folded into Woven Planet Holdings. Lyft will receive $550 million in cash, with $200 million paid upfront. The remaining $350 million will be made in payments over five years. About 300 people from Lyft Level 5 will be integrated into Woven Planet. The Level 5 team, which in early 2020 numbered more than 400 people in the U.S., Munich and London, will continue to operate out of its office in Palo Alto, California.</p>
<p>The transaction, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021, officially ends Lyft&#8217;s nearly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/21/lyft-launches-a-new-self-driving-division-called-level-5-will-develop-its-own-self-driving-system/">four-year effort</a> to develop its own self-driving system.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The transaction will remove a costly annual expense from Lyft&#8217;s budget. The ride-hailing company said that by offloading Level 5 it expects to be able to remove $100 million of annualized non-GAAP operating expenses on a net basis. Those savings will be critical for Lyft as it pursues profitability — a point co-founder and president John Zimmer made special note of in the announcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Assuming the transaction closes within the expected timeframe and the COVID recovery continues, we are confident that we can achieve Adjusted EBITDA profitability in the third quarter of this year,&#8221; Zimmer said in a statement.</p>
<p>Free from this annual expense, Lyft will dedicate its resources to what the company says it was really was aiming for all along: to become the go-to ride-hailing network and fleet management platform used by any and all commercial robotaxi services. Lyft already has partnerships with AV developers, notably the $4 billion Hyundai-Aptiv joint venture known as Motional, as well as Waymo. The intent is to lock up the rest. As part of the acquisition agreement, Woven Planet signed commercial agreements to use the Lyft platform and fleet data.</p>
<p>Lyft said that the agreement with Woven Planet is not exclusive, and it will continue its partnership with Motional and others. Motional and Lyft have been partners for more than three years, a relationship that kicked off with what was supposed to be a weeklong pilot program to offer rides in autonomous vehicles on the Lyft network in Las Vegas during the 2018 CES tech trade show (the partnership actually predated the joint venture with Hyundai.) That temporary experiment, which has always included a human safety driver, was extended and still exists today. As of February 2020, the program had given more than 100,000 paid self-driving rides in Aptiv’s — now Motional’s — self-driving vehicles, per the Lyft app. Motional announced in December plans to launch fully driverless robotaxi services in major U.S. cities in 2023 using the Lyft ride-hailing network.</p>
<p>Lyft is making some structural organizational changes to reflect this renewed focus. Lyft will retain its team of engineers, product managers, data scientists and UX designers that have been working on the consumer experience of hailing and then riding in an autonomous vehicle, which will be headed up by Jody Kelman. This team, now known as Lyft Autonomous, will be folded into the company&#8217;s fleet division that manages more than 10,000 vehicles via its rental and express drive programs. Lyft Fleet, which was founded in 2019 and is led by Cal Lankton, is also the group spearheading the company&#8217;s transition to 100% electric vehicles on the network by 2030. The idea is to bring all of these efforts — shared, electric and self-driving — under one roof.</p>
<p>Other strategic shuffling is happening over at Toyota&#8217;s Woven Planet. The Level 5 workforce, researchers from Toyota Research Institute and Woven Planet will be combined into one team of about 1,200 employees. The company said the acquisition of Level 5 is a carve-out of Lyft&#8217;s self-driving division with a specific focus on accelerating the safety of automated driving technology and does not directly affect Toyota&#8217;s relationship with other partnerships such as AV startup Aurora.</p>
<p>Woven Planet Holdings is a new entity that has already made a splash. The holding company, which folded in Toyota Research Institute &#8212; Advanced Development Inc. or TRI-AD, also includes an investment arm known as Woven Capital and Woven City, a testing ground for new technologies set in an interconnected smart city prototype. In February, Toyota broke ground at the Higashi-Fuji site in Susono City, Japan, at the base of Mount Fuji.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Woven Capital kicked off off its new<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/woven-capital-kicks-off-portfolio-with-investment-in-autonomous-delivery-company-nuro/"> $800 million strategic fund</a> by announcing an investment into autonomous delivery vehicle company Nuro.</p>
