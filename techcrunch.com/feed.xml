Clint Barton (aka Hawkeye) just wants to spend Christmas with his family, but his enemies have other plans.</p>
<p>The series marks the return of Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. This time around, he has a new partner: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvels-avengers-kate-bishop-hawkeye-release-date-182816765.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">Kate Bishop</a> (Hailee Steinfeld), the self-professed &#8220;world&#8217;s greatest archer.&#8221; <em>Hawkeye</em> is said to center on the relationship between the two toxophilites, with Clint training Kate to take over as Hawkeye, as the character does in the comics. There are hints of that passing of the torch in the trailer. It shows the pair meeting for the first time and forming a bond as they work together to battle some goons.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VYb3B1ETlk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>There are a few nods to other parts of the MCU here, including the existence of a Broadway musical about Steve Rogers (aka Captain America) and a tip of the cap toward the &#8220;masked vigilante&#8221; Hawkeye battled in <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>. Something we <em>don&#8217;t </em>see in the trailer is an appearance by Florence Pugh, who made her MCU bow as assassin Yelena Belova in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/black%20widow" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1"><em><ins>Black Widow</ins></em></a><em> </em>this summer. She was <a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/hawkeye-disney-plus-florence-pugh-vera-farmiga-cast-1234845371/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="25" data-v9y="1"><ins>cast</ins></a> in <em>Hawkeye</em> last December.</p>
<p>In any case, you won&#8217;t have to wait too long to see what happens when Yelena, Clint and Kate encounter each other. The eight-episode first season of <em>Hawkeye</em>will debut on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hawkeye-disney-plus-november-24-premiere-155812908.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="26" data-v9y="1"><ins>November 24th</ins></a> on Disney+.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One. More. Week. Just seven days until more than 10,000 people around the world storm the internet to attend <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> on September 21-23. We’re talking three event- and programming-packed days focused on anything — and everything — related to early-stage tech startups.</p>
<p>You’ll hear from iconic founders, unicorn makers, boundary-benders — all of it served up with a gigantic side of DIY tips, actionable advice, encouragement and inspiration. And, because Disrupt is highly interactive, you’ll have plenty of opportunity to engage, ask questions and receive answers.</p>
<p><strong>Admit one:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets/">Buy your TC Disrupt 2021 pass</a> — for less than $100 — and go find or create the opportunities that can help you move your business forward.</p>
<p>We’ll hit a few of the highlights, but be sure to check the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">Disrupt 2021 agenda</a> for all the interviews, panel discussions, breakout sessions and events. Your pass includes video-on-demand, so you can catch any sessions you miss when your schedule allows.</p>
<p>Disrupt always brings <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#eb919231-f3e4-4def-8dd0-afb0bc7c9c6e">world-class speakers</a> to the stage, and this year is no exception. We have more than 80 presentations (and counting) on tap. Talk about something for everyone. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/discover-all-things-biotech-with-mayfield-at-disrupt-2021/">Biotech</a>? Covered. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/were-focusing-on-fintech-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2021/">Fintech</a>? Also covered. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/fundraising-for-your-startup-weve-got-you-covered-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2021/">Fundraising</a>? Well, of course. Robots, healthtech, space — heck, there’s so much more we can’t cover it here. Head to the agenda and plan your strategy.</p>
<p>Explore hundreds of innovative startups exhibiting in Startup Alley, our expo area. Visit their virtual booths, get a product demo and start a conversation. You can also catch Startup Alley founders pitching to TechCrunch staff. Look for the Startup Pitch Feedback Sessions scheduled over all three days.</p>
<p>Who’s ready for Startup Battlefield? Watch as 20 of the top early-stage founders compete for the coveted championship title and $100,000 in equity-free prize money.

Don’t miss your chance to see the future of tech take the stage.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>The Startup Battlefield translated easily to the virtual format. You could see the excitement, enthusiasm and possibility of the young founders, and I loved that. You could also ask questions through the chat feature, and you don&#8217;t always have time for questions at a live event. — Rachael Wilcox, creative producer, Volvo Cars.</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember we said you’ll find plenty of actionable advice? Don’t miss the expert VC guidance in these two sessions: <strong>Crafting a Pitch Deck that Can’t Be Ignored</strong> and <strong>Pitch Deck Teardown</strong>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Disrupt is a great sweet spot, and highly valuable, for anyone in the idea stage all the way through to having raised some angel money. Soak up the pitch deck teardowns and the VC presentations. They’re telling you what they&#8217;re looking for, what motivates them, what pushes them to contact you for a meeting. And that’s exactly what every startup raising capital needs to know. — Michael McCarthy, CEO, Repositax.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://jumpcloud.com">JumpCloud</a>, the late-stage startup that is modernizing the notion of corporate directories in a cloud context, announced a $159 million Series F investment on a healthy $2.56 billion valuation today.</p>
<p>Sapphire Ventures led the round with new investors participating including Owl Rock, Whale Rock Capital, Sands Capital and Endeavor Catalyst along with existing investors General Atlantic, BlackRock and H.I.G. Growth Partners. The company has now raised almost $356 million with $259 million coming over the most recent two rounds.</p>
<p>JumpCloud CEO Rajat Bhargava says that investor interest in the company is driven by his belief that the directory structure is the center of an IT organization, especially as it relates to identity, and that includes mobile device management, single sign-on, multi-factor authentication, privileged access management and identity governance. He sees all these approaches coming together in the directory structure.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that those are all part of one core directory platform. So when you think of a directory very holistically and broadly, it is really about securely and frictionlessly connecting users and their identities to whatever they may need to access,&#8221; Bhargava told me.</p>
<p>They do this by going after SMBs and mid-market companies with a cloud product that simplifies the management of these complex systems. Jai Das, who is managing director at lead investor Sapphire Ventures, believes that this part of the market was being mostly left out of directory services because of that complexity before JumpCloud and others attempted to fill the void.</p>
<p>&#8220;Large enterprises have put in place various directory and security solutions to solve these problems, but with large investments in tech outlays and IT support teams. SMBs and mid-sized enterprises don’t have the big budgets or large staff to replicate the large enterprise model,&#8221; Das said. He adds that developing for this market is a huge challenge because it requires &#8220;building a product with all of the features large enterprises require, plus it has to be easy to use, easy to deploy and not [be] terribly expensive.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the company is not revealing any revenue metrics, Bhargava did say that they have added 2000 customers since we last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/jumpcloud-raises-75m-series-e-as-cloud-directory-service-thrives-during-pandemic/">spoke in November</a> for a total of 5000, and he said that the company should double head count by the end of the year from the 300 last November.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He also said that he has been making progress at building a diverse company, and one way he does that is just asking every hiring manager if they interviewed historically underrepresented candidates.</p>
<p>&#8220;The simple act of just asking that question makes such a massive difference inside of an organization. We&#8217;ve encouraged all of our hiring managers to interview diverse candidates but we also when there&#8217;s an offer about to be made, or when they&#8217;re in the [interview] process, we are asking them did you talk to [diverse] candidates. And then if you didn&#8217;t, we&#8217;re going to ask you to go, search for those folks [before making a hiring decision],&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Bhargava didn&#8217;t want to talk about and IPO when we spoke last year, and not much changed this time around. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see. It&#8217;s just not part of what we&#8217;re worried about or focused on,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He did indicate however, that with such a substantial amount of money on the balance sheet, he would consider some strategic acquisitions. &#8220;We will focus on M&amp;A and where it makes sense will integrate different components and teams into our business,&#8221; he said. With a tight labor market, that could be about adding engineering, as well as adding functionality to the platform, he said.</p>

<p>Vacation was good, and a big thanks to Mary Ann and Natasha &#8212; not to mention Grace and Chris! &#8212; for keeping things flowing while I mostly sat around reading books and playing video games. But enough being maudlin! To the news!</p>
<ul>
<li>Investors <a href="https://twitter.com/SamRo/status/1437373171892637697">are kinda thinking</a> that the run-up in stocks needs to take a breather. And that the reset could land between 5% and 10%, with another 10% of respondents expecting a correction of <em>more</em> than 10%. Yowza.</li>
<li>China <a href="https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3148556/alipay-operator-ant-group-create-separate-app-lending-business">may break up Ant</a>, keeping the pace of its regulatory deluge going as this week starts. And the Chinese government thinks that its country has <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-vows-consolidate-bloated-electric-040922526.html">too many EV companies</a>. If the market or central planning will wind up taking point on solving the &#8220;problem&#8221; is not clear.</li>
<li>The Apple v. Epic decision is still driving conversation. Here&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">TechCrunch&#8217;s coverage</a>, and here&#8217;s <a href="https://500ish.com/apple-won-a-battle-to-lose-the-war-3ce6c3701918">the MG piece</a> I mentioned.</li>
<li>Toast and Freshworks have new filings up. Which is good news if you want to dig into new S-1/A reports. Forge is going public via a SPAC.</li>
<li>And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/babyscripts-secures-12m-to-roll-out-its-virtual-maternity-care-model/">Babyscripts</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/commercetools-raises-140m-at-a-1-9b-valuation-as-headless-commerce-continues-to-boom/">Commercetools</a> raised rounds, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/southeast-asia-focused-jungle-ventures-announces-225m-first-close-for-its-fourth-fund/">while Jungle Ventures raised a fund</a>.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber has lost another legal challenge in Europe over the employment status of drivers: The Court of Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, <a href="https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2021:5029&amp;showbutton=true&amp;keyword=uber">has ruled</a> that drivers for Uber are employed, rather than self employed contractors.</p>
<p>The court also found drivers are covered by an existing collective labor agreement in the country &#8212; which pertains to taxi drivers &#8212; meaning<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Uber faces increased costs to comply with the agreement which sets pay requirements and covers benefits like sick pay. (And it may be liable</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> for paying driver back pay in some cases.)</span></p>
<p>The court also ordered Uber to pay €50,000 in costs.</p>
<p>The ride hailing giant has some 4,000 drivers working on its platform in the Dutch capital.</p>
<p>The Amsterdam court rejected Uber&#8217;s customary defence that it&#8217;s just a technology platform that connects passengers with taxi service providers &#8212; finding instead that drivers are only self employed &#8216;on paper&#8217;.</p>
<p>The judges highlighted the nature of the service being provided by drivers and the fact Uber exerts controls over how they can work and earn through its app and algorithms.</p>
<p>Europe&#8217;s top court <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/20/blow-to-uber-in-europe-as-top-court-rules-its-a-transport-service/">already ruled</a> back in 2017 that Uber is a transport provider and must comply with local transport laws &#8212; so you&#8217;d be forgiven for deja vu.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Dutch lawsuit was filed by the national trade union center, FNV, last year &#8212; with the hearing kicking off at the end of June.</p>
<p>In a statement today, the FNV&#8217;s VP, Zakaria Boufangacha, said: &#8220;This statement shows what we have been saying for years: Uber is an employer and the drivers are employees, so Uber must adhere to the collective labor agreement for Taxi Transport. It is also a signal to The Hague that these types of constructions are illegal and that the law must therefore be enforced.&#8221;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Uber has been contacted for a response to the ruling.</p>
<p>At the time of writing the company had not responded &#8212; but, per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/dutch-court-rules-uber-drivers-are-employees-not-contractors-newspaper-2021-09-13/">Reuters</a>, Uber said it intends to appeal and &#8220;has no plans to employ drivers in the Netherlands&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the UK, Uber lost a string of tribunal rulings over its employment classification over a number of years &#8212; going on to lose in front of the UK supreme court this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">February</a>.</p>
<p>Following that Uber said it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/uber-says-it-will-treat-uk-drivers-as-workers-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling/">would treat drivers in the UK as workers</a>, although disputes remain (such as over its definition of working time). In <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-57254962">May</a>, Uber also said it would recognize a UK trade union for the first time.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Europe, however, the company continues to fight employment lawsuits &#8212; and to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/uber-lobbies-for-prop-22-style-gig-work-standards-in-the-eu/">lobby European Union lawmakers</a> to deregulate platform work&#8230;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The EU has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/europe-kicks-off-bid-to-find-a-route-to-better-gig-work/">said it wants to find a way to improve platform work</a>. However it&#8217;s not yet clear what any pan-EU &#8216;reform&#8217; may look like. </span></p>
<p>The Commission has been contacted with questions on its platform work initiative.</p>
<p>&#8220;Digital labour platforms are clearly worried, evident through investing heavily on their lobbying power and throwing more resources on the EU level. These companies &#8212; including Uber of course &#8212; have also recently come together to create a new funding lobby group that specifically targeting to influence policies on platform work,&#8221; said <a href="https://twitter.com/jilltoh">Jill Toh</a>, a PhD researcher in data rights at the University of Amsterdam, talking to TechCrunch after the Amsterdam ruling.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw how Uber wielded and amended laws in their Prop 22 campaign in California, and together with other companies in Europe, they&#8217;re attempting to do so again. It&#8217;s disheartening to see that the Commission in its two consultations on platform worker regulation has only been talking to tech companies and has held no meetings with trade unions or other platform work representatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All of this is incredibly problematic and concerning especially if the EC consultations result in a directive on platform work. Overall, the wins in the courts are important for workers, but there remains the issue of corporate power and influence in Brussels, as well as the lack of public enforcement to these court decisions,&#8221; she added.</p>

The DoD wants to launch missions venturing beyond Earth orbit, and existing electric and solar spacecraft are neither suitable for that job nor suitable to smaller vehicles, the department&#8217;s Defense Innovation Unit said.</p>
<p>The nuclear propulsion system will ideally offer &#8220;high delta-V&#8221; (above 33ft/s) while scaling down to less than 2,000kg in dry mass (4,409lbs on Earth). On top of providing electricity for the payload, the technology will hopefully keep the spacecraft warm when in shadow and minimize radiation both on the ground and to other components. Responses are expected by September 23rd, with contracts handed out as quickly as 60 to 90 days afterward.</p>
<p>Officials acknowledged they were making the request as a matter of expediency. NASA and other agencies are already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/darpa-lockheed-martin-blue-origin-nuclear-spacecraft-100547792.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">developing or backing nuclear spacecraft</a>, but those won&#8217;t be ready for a long while. The DoD is hoping for a prototype within three to five years — this technology would serve as a stopgap that puts nuclear propulsion into service relatively quickly for near-term projects.</p>
<p>While the request didn&#8217;t provide clues as to what spacecraft were in the works, the focus on smaller spacecraft suggests it could involve probes, satellites or other vehicles with modest goals. You won&#8217;t see this power human trips to Mars. All the same, it&#8217;s clear the DoD is frustrated by the limitations of existing spacecraft engines and wants a fast track to more powerful designs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With supply chains under constant stress because of the pandemic, freight forwarding has become one of the hottest startup sectors in the last two years. Indeed, International freight forwarding is now a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1066803/freight-forwarding-market-size-worldwide/">$199 billion market</a>. And the evidence is mounting.</p>
<p>In November last year, digital freight forwarder Forto raises <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/digital-freight-forwarder-forto-raises-another-50m-in-round-led-by-inven-capital/">another $50M</a> in a round led by Inven Capital. In April this year, Nuvocargo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/nuvocargo-raises-12m-to-digitize-the-freight-logistics-industry/">raised</a> $12M to digitize the freight logistics industry. In May, Zencargo, with a freight forwarding platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/zencargo-raises-42m-to-expand-its-digital-first-freight-forwarding-platform-internationally/">raised</a> $42 million. In June, freight forwarder sennder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/freight-forwarder-sennder-raises-80m-at-a-1b-valuation/">raised</a> $80M at a $1B+ valuation. In July Freightify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/freightify-lands-2-5m-to-make-rate-management-easier-for-freight-forwarders/">landed</a> $2.5M to make rate management easier for freight forwarders.</p>
<p>And today, <a href="http://Vector.ai">Vector.ai</a>, which says it helps freight forwarders improve productivity via its AI platform, has raised $15 million in a Series A led by US VC Bessemer Venture Partners. It was joined by existing investors Dynamo Ventures and Episode 1. Bessemer’s investment is yet another sign that US VC continues to make incursions into the UK and European tech scene.</p>
<p>Vector now plans to accelerate its international expansion plans as an automated system for freight forwarders.</p>
<p>The problem it’s tackling is this: Freight forwarders lose time to repetitive administrative tasks as they execute shipments, such as hunting through customer emails etc, rather than concentrating on higher-value activities. Vector.ai says it’s machine learning platform can automate these tasks.</p>
<p>Its customers now include Fracht, EFL, NNR Global Logistics, The Scarbrough Group, Steam Logistics and Navia Freight, as well as other top-10 freight forwarders.</p>
<p>James Coombes, Co-Founder, and CEO of Vector.ai, commented: “Most employees within freight forwarders spend the majority of their time communicating with the 10-25 different entities that might be associated with a given shipment and coordinating freight movement and documentation. Communication usually runs through email and attachments… The volume of freight continues to rise globally – and with the <a href="https://www.export.org.uk/news/579204/Is-the-UK-being-disproportionately-impacted-by-soaring-freight-prices-due-to-Brexit-.htm">added burden of Brexit</a> and pandemic disruptions such as the recent port closure in China – freight forwarders are facing staffing shortages, steep wage increases, and shipping delays that continue to cost companies money in lost revenue and spoiled goods. They cannot afford to keep wasting time on low-level processing, which is why we created the technology to automate basic tasks.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mike Droesch, Partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, said: “Vector.ai is one of the early leaders in an emerging category of freight forwarding workflow automation and digitization tools. It has built an intuitive and industry-focused product – which is already winning over some of the largest freight forwarders.”</p>
<p>Vector competes with <a href="https://www.shipamax.com/">Shipamax</a> out of the UK which has raised $9.5M, <a href="https://rpalabs.com/">RPA Labs</a> out of the US which has raised $1.2M and <a href="http://slync.io">slync.io</a> also in the US which has raised $75.9M.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Security operations teams face a daunting task these days, fending off malicious hackers and their increasingly sophisticated approaches to cracking into networks. That also represents a gap in the market: building tools to help those security teams do their jobs. Today, an Israeli startup called <a href="https://www.rezilion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rezilion</a> that is doing just that &#8212; building automation tools for DevSecOps, the area of IT that addresses the needs of security teams and the technical work that they need to do in their jobs &#8212; is announcing $30 million in funding.</p>
<p>Guggenheim Investments is leading the round with JVP and Kindred Capital also contributing. Rezilion said that unnamed executives from Google, Microsoft, CrowdStrike, IBM, Cisco, PayPal, JP Morgan Chase, Nasdaq, eBay, Symantec, RedHat, RSA and Tenable are also in the round. Previously, the company had raised $8 million.</p>
<p>Rezilion&#8217;s funding is coming on the back of strong initial growth for the startup in its first two years of operations.</p>
<p>Its customer base is made up of some of the world&#8217;s biggest companies, including two of the &#8220;Fortune 10&#8221; (the top 10 of the <a href="https://fortune.com/fortune500/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fortune 500</a>). CEO Liran Tancman, who co-founded Rezilion with CTO Shlomi Boutnaru, said that one of those two is one of the world&#8217;s biggest software companies, and the other is a major connected device vendor, but he declined to say which. (For the record, the top 10 includes Amazon, Apple, Alphabet/Google, Walmart and CVS.)</p>
<p>Tancman and Boutnaru had previously co-founded another security startup, CyActive, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/10/paypal-confirms-acquisition-of-cyactive-plans-to-open-new-security-hub-in-israel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by PayPal in 2015</a>; the pair worked there together until leaving to start Rezilion.</p>
<p>There are a lot of tools out in the market now to help automate different aspects of developer and security operations. Rezilion focuses on a specific part of DevSecOps: large businesses have over the years put in place a lot of processes that they need to follow to try to triage and make the most thorough efforts possible to detect security threats. Today, that might involve inspecting every single suspicious piece of activity to determine what the implications might be.</p>
<p>The problem is that with the volume of information coming in, taking the time to inspect and understand each piece of suspicious activity can put enormous strain on an organization: it&#8217;s time-consuming, and as it turns out, not the best use of that time because of the signal to noise ratio involved. Typically, each vulnerability can take 6-9 hours to properly investigate, Tancman said. &#8220;But usually about 70-80% of them are not exploitable,&#8221; meaning they may be bad for some, but not for this particular organization and the code it&#8217;s using today. That represents a very inefficient use of the security team&#8217;s time and energy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Eight of out ten patches tend to be a waste of time,&#8221; Tancman said of the approach that is typically made today. He believes that as its AI continues to grow and its knowledge and solution becomes more sophisticated, &#8220;it might soon be 9 out of 10.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rezilion has built a taxonomy and an AI-based system that essentially does that inspection work as a human would do: it spots any new, or suspicious, code, figures out what it is trying to do, and runs it against a company&#8217;s existing code and systems to see how and if it might actually be a threat to it or create further problems down the line. If it&#8217;s all good, it essentially whitelists the code. If not, it flags it to the team.</p>
<p>The stickiness of the product has come out of how Tancman and Boutnaru understand large enterprises, especially those heavy with technology stacks, operate these days in what has become a very challenging environment for cybersecurity teams.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are using us to accelerate their delivery processes while staying safe,&#8221; Tancman said. &#8220;They have strict compliance departments and have to adhere to certain standards,&#8221; in terms of the protocols they take around security work, he added. &#8220;They want to leverage DevOps to release that.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said Rezilion has generally won over customers in large part for simply understanding that culture and process and helping them work better within that: &#8220;Companies become users of our product because we showed them that, at a fraction of the effort, they can be more secure.&#8221; This has special resonance in the world of tech, although financial services, and other verticals that essentially leverage technology as a significant foundation for how they operate, are also among the startup&#8217;s user base.</p>
<p>Down the line, Rezilion plans to add remediation and mitigation into the mix to further extend what it can do with its automation tools, which is part of where the funding will be going, too, Boutnaru said. But he doesn&#8217;t believe it will ever replace the human in the equation altogether.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will just focus them on the places where you need more human thinking,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re just removing the need for tedious work.&#8221;</p>
<p>In that grand tradition of enterprise automation, then, it will be interesting to watch which other automation-centric platforms might make a move into security alongside the other automation they are building. For now, Rezilion is forging out an interesting enough area for itself to get investors interested.</p>
<p>“Rezilion’s product suite is a game changer for security teams,” said Rusty Parks, senior MD of Guggenheim Investments, in a statement. “It creates a win-win, allowing companies to speed innovative products and features to market while enhancing their security posture. We believe Rezilion has created a truly compelling value proposition for security teams, one that greatly increases return on time while thoroughly protecting one’s core infrastructure.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.marginedge.com/">MarginEdge</a> announced Monday it raised $18 million in Series B funding to give restaurant operators a real-time view into their costs.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Bo Davis founded the company with Roy Phillips and Brian Mills in 2015. Both Davis and Phillips are veterans of the restaurant industry: Davis was previously the founder of conveyor belt sushi restaurant chain Wasabi, while Phillips was an executive at Bloomin Brands.</p>
<p>What they recognized with independent restaurants was that they struggled with workflow like invoices and tracking food costs and were either building internal tools to help them stay on top of things or were still operating with pen and paper or spreadsheets.</p>
<p>“We focused on building something our friends would like,” Davis told TechCrunch. “We spent three years on the product and worked with 20 restaurants to use the software and focus on getting it right instead of rushing to market.”</p>

<p>MarginEdge’s tool is a restaurant management app that works with a business’ point of sale to streamline inventory, cost-tracking, ordering and recipes to eliminate the paperwork. It also captures all invoices, receipts or bills and converts them to line-item details within 24 hours. It is designed for independent restaurant owners that have under 50 units, Davis said.</p>
<p>Since launching its app in 2018, the Virginia-based company is seeing its platform used in over 2,500 restaurants. It raised a Series A in 2019, then an A2 in 2020 and with the latest round, led by IGC Hospitality, has raised $25 million in total.</p>
<p>IGC Hospitality, which operates restaurant properties, is not only an investor, but is also a customer, said Jeffrey Brosi, founder and managing partner. The company was using some different technology platforms to manage inventory and sales, but was looking for something to manage its whole inventory process.</p>
<p>“Bo came in and did a presentation, and it was amazing,” Brosi added. “The biggest thing for us is [being] user friendly. MarginEdge also has great customer service. We’ve invested in a few companies in the hospitality industry, and know the pain points and what we want to fix. If it makes sense financially, we will invest. This was one pain point that we didn’t have, and Bo filled that void.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Like all restaurants over the past 18 months, Davis said the global pandemic caused MarginEdge to step back and evaluate. Despite many restaurants going out of business, he credits his business taking off again to restaurants rethinking their processes.</p>
<p>“We were lucky enough to be in a good position with capital that we could keep our team,” he added. “Revenue decreased for the first time, but we grew 45% even with COVID and as of Q1 was seeing 200% annual growth.”</p>
<p>MarginEdge has over 400 employees and its platform processes 45,000 invoices a week. Davis intends to invest the new funding in building out the leadership team, product development, building new features for the back office and on data science, an area he just received an advanced degree in, he said.</p>
<p>The company is using benchmark data around sales, food costs and labor costs and would like to provide more insights to its customers as it relates to inflation, which affects all of those aspects, and as a result, the menu prices.</p>
<p>“A lot of it is using data to understand menu pricing and what other people are doing so you are not pricing yourself out of the market or operating on margins where you can’t survive,” Davis added. “It will be all about predicting rather than reporting. The two things in the kitchen that are hardest are the startup prep list and the inventory late at night, and we make both easier.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Freshworks <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1544522/000162828021018417/freshworkss-1a1.htm">disclosed</a> on Monday that it is aiming for a valuation of up to $9 billion in its US initial public offering in which it is hoping to raise over $800 million.</p>
<p>The California-based firm, which started its journey in India and rivals Salesforce, said it plans to sell 28.5 million shares at a price range of $28 to $32. If the firm is able to sell its shares at the top range, it will raise $912 million. Freshworks had originally filed paperworks for its IPO in late August, but hadn&#8217;t disclosed several figures.</p>
<p>The 11-year-old firm was last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/13/freshworks-raises-150m-series-h-on-3-5b-valuation/">valued at $3.5 billion in a financing round in November 2019</a>. The startup considered raising a pre-IPO round earlier this year at a valuation of over $5 billion but decided against it, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Freshworks, which counts Accel, Sequoia Capital India, Tiger Global, and CapitalG among its existing investors, develops and offers a variety of business software tools, from CRM to help-desk software. In recent years, it has built enterprise SaaS platform to give customers a set of integrated business tools and aggressively pursued broadening its products offering.</p>
<p>The startup, which has applied to list its shares on Nasdaq under the symbol FRSH, serves over 50,000 customers and its revenue in the first six months of the year grew to $169 million, up from $11 million during the same period last year. At the same time, its net loss dropped to $9.8 million from $57 million a year ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;First, based on industry research from International Data Corporation (IDC), we believe we have a large addressable market of approximately $120 billion,&#8221; the firm said in an updated S-1 filing on Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Second, based on our internal data and analysis, we estimate the annual potential market opportunity for our products to be $77 billion. [&#8230;] We expect our estimated market opportunity will continue to expand as customers onboard more or expand usage of our products, increasing the weighted average ARR per customer for use of our products.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch recently spoke with Freshworks co-founder and chief executive Girish Mathrubootham about the business. Mathrubootham is one of the most respected entrepreneurs in India. Along with three friends, Mathrubootham <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/high-profile-entrepreneurs-launch-85-million-fund-to-back-indian-saas-startups/">launched an $85 million venture fund</a> in late July this year to back early-stage SaaS startups in the world&#8217;s second largest internet market.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company focuses on providing small to mid-size CPG companies with an automated way to manage their trade promotion in retail stores.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cresicor.ai/">Cresicor</a>, a consumer packaged goods trade management platform startup, raised $5.6 million in seed funding to further develop its tools for more accurate data and analytics.</p>
<p>The company, based remotely, focuses on small to midsize CPG companies, providing them with an automated way to manage their trade promotion, a process co-founder and CEO Alexander Whatley said is done primarily manually using spreadsheets.</p>
<p>Here’s what happens in a trade promotion: When a company wants to run a discount on one of their slower-selling items, the company has to spend money to do this — to have displays set up in a store or have that item on a certain shelf. If it works, more people will buy the item at the lower price point. Essentially, a trade promotion is the process of spending money to get more money in the future, Whatley told TechCrunch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="GpgRCxoNsQ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/whos-building-the-grocery-store-of-the-future/">Who&#8217;s building the grocery store of the future?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Who&#8217;s building the grocery store of the future?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/whos-building-the-grocery-store-of-the-future/embed/#?secret=GpgRCxoNsQ" data-secret="GpgRCxoNsQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Figuring out all of the trade promotions is a complicated process, Whatley explained. Companies receive data feeds on the promotions from several different places, revenue data from retailers, accounting source data to show how many units were shipped and then maybe data directly from retailers. All of that has to be matched against the promotion.</p>
<p>“No API is bringing this data back to brands, so our software helps to automate and track these manual processes so companies can do analytics to see how the promotions are doing,” he added. “It also helps the finance team understand expenses, including which are valid and those that are not.”</p>
<p>What certain companies spend on trade promotions can represent their second-largest cost behind manufacturing, and companies often end up reinvesting between 20% and 30% of their revenue into trade promotions, Whatley said. This is a big market, representing untapped growth, especially with U.S. <a href="https://www.revtrax.com/cpg-marketing-strategies-to-maximize-holiday-sales/">CPG sales topping $720 billion</a> in 2020.</p>
<p>“You can see how messy the whole industry is, which is why we have a bright future and huge TAM,” he added. “With this new funding, we can target other parts of the P&amp;L like supply chain and salaries. We also provide analytics for their strategy and where they should be spending it — which store, on which supply. By allocating resources the right way, companies typically see a 10% boost in sales as a result.”</p>
<p>Whatley started the company in 2017 with his brother, Daniel, Stuart Kennedy and Nikki McNeil while a Harvard undergrad. Since raising the funding back in February, the company has grown 2.5x in revenue, while employee headcount grew 4x over the past 12 months to 20.</p>
<p>Costanoa Ventures led the investment and was joined by Torch Capital and a group of angel investors including Fivestars CTO Matt Doka and Hu’s Kitchen CEO Mark Ramadan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>John Cowgill, partner at Costanoa, said though Cresicor raised a seed round, the company was already acquiring brands and capital before releasing a product and grew to almost a Series A company without any outside capital, saying it “blew me away.”</p>
<p>Cresicor is the “perfect example” of a company that Costanoa would get excited about — a vertical software company using data or machine learning to augment a pain point, Cowgill added.</p>
<p>“The CPG industry is in the middle of a rapid change where we see all of these emerging, digital native and mission-driven brands rapidly eating share from incumbents,” he added. “For the next generation of brands to compete, they have to win in trade promotion management. Cresicor’s opportunity to go beyond trade is significant. It is just a starting point to build a company that is the core enabler of great brands.”</p>
<p>The new funding will be used mainly to hire more talent in the areas of engineering and customer success so the company can hit its next benchmarks, Alexander Whatley said. He also intends to use the funding to acquire new brands and on software development. Cresicor boasts a list of customers including Perfect Snacks, Oatly and Hint Water.</p>
<p>The retail industry is valued at $5.5 trillion, and one-fifth of it is CPG, Whatley said. As a result, he has his eye on going after other verticals within CPG, like electronics and pet food, and then expanding into other areas.</p>
<p>“We are also going to work with enterprise companies — we see an opportunity to work with companies like P&amp;G and General Mills, and we also want to build an ecosystem around trade promotion and launch into other profit and loss areas,” Whatley said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Babyscripts can automate 40% to 50% of prenatal care and alert doctors as health problems occur so that both mother and baby are healthy.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Obstetrics virtual care company <a href="https://babyscripts.com/">Babyscripts</a> raised $12 million in the first round of a Series B investment that will enable the company to accelerate the roll out of its virtual maternity care tool platform to providers.</p>
<p>MemorialCare Innovation Fund led the investment and was joined by Philips Ventures and the CU Healthcare Innovation Fund. The new round of funding gives Babyscripts around $26 million raised to date, Babyscripts co-founder and president Juan Pablo Segura told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>We last checked in on Washington, D.C-based Babyscripts two years ago when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/electronics-giant-philips-invests-in-monitoring-and-information-platform-for-expecting-mothers/">Phillips led a $6 million investment</a> into the company. A lot has happened since 2019, Segura said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Electronics giant Philips invests in monitoring and information platform for expecting mothers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/electronics-giant-philips-invests-in-monitoring-and-information-platform-for-expecting-mothers/embed/#?secret=wWVirPNCv6" data-secret="wWVirPNCv6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>At the time, the company had one product and was working with hospitals and healthcare providers to distribute a medical device and mobile app to expecting mothers for monitoring blood pressure and providing neonatal care information.</p>
<p>Today, the company has multiple kits that can be targeted to patients, including blood pressure monitoring, weight and captured blood sugars. Babyscripts can automate 40% to 50% of prenatal care and alert doctors as health problems occur so that both mother and baby are healthy. At one physician site, use of Babyscripts helped open up close to 1,000 appointments in a year so obstetricians there could focus on higher-risk patients, Segura said.</p>
<p>It also has larger population health focuses — driven mainly by the pandemic — to help higher-risk expecting mothers with remote patient monitoring and virtual care, as well as work to solve health inequity issues.</p>
<p>More than 70% of patients using Babyscripts are on Medicaid, which may be the only safety net provider in the patient’s geography, Segura said. As a result, the company began forming partnerships with public health departments, managed Medicaid plans and providers, like <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/leading_pregnancy_app_babyscripts_announces_collaboration_with_privia_health/prweb18102627.htm">Priva Health</a>, so that Babyscripts could be paid for at the local level.</p>
<p>“Right now, one of the biggest challenges for a pregnant patient on Medicaid and working an hourly job is asking moms to choose between prenatal care and putting food on the table,” he added. “Fifty percent of maternal complications can be avoided, but a lot of these issues come from the fact that the model of delivery care hasn’t changed in 40 years. About 12% to 15% of deaths come from blood pressure complications. If we could monitor via Babyscripts or more coordinated care to get intervention faster, we could eliminate massive swaths of delivery events in maternity and reduce mortality events in this country.”</p>
<p>Amid the pandemic, Babyscripts saw enrollments grow 10x. Segura decided to go after a new round of funding to meet that need and opportunities that could be addressed. Babyscripts’s program is now being used by 75 health systems in 32 states, and the company is monitoring 250,000 women each year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company continues to receive inquiries from markets and payers that are looking to do more for pregnant patients, so Segura wants to be able to grow to meet that demand and invest in a go-to-market strategy to get its kits into as many hands as possible.</p>
<p>The new funding will also enable the company to release new features. It recently launched a mental health product and is developing a substance use disorder experience amid others, he said. Babyscripts is also working on a national level with payers and is building an infrastructure around that as well.</p>
<p>The company has 45 employees currently, and Segura expects to double that in the next 12 to 18 months in the areas of product, payer growth, clinical expertise, implementation and customer success. Babyscripts is also working toward being available in all 50 states and bringing in more public health departments and payers as partners to get more health systems working together, he added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Caleb Winder, managing director of MemorialCare Innovation Fund, said he was attracted to both Babyscripts’ outcomes data and addressing the high rates of complications in pregnancies. It also not only eliminates waiting for hours at the doctor’s office just to be seen for five minutes, but also closes some gaps in care, he added.</p>
<p>“One of the problems in this space is that providers, as much as they want to help, are stretched thin,” Winder said. “There are also access problems. Something like 50% of counties in this country lack one OB, so in-person care is difficult. Babyscripts can help patients anywhere be monitored and their health managed virtually. It can also alert a clinician when there is a real problem. We saw their data, for example, that showed preeclampsia was diagnosed 13 days faster than the standard of care.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Numan.com">Numan</a>, the European subscription service covering erectile dysfunction (ED) and men’s wellness/health needs more generally, has raised $40 million in a Series B funding round led by <a href="https://whitestarcapital.com/">White Star Capital</a>, with participation from existing investors Novator, Vostok New Global, Anthemis Exponential, Colle Capital, and new investor Hanwha Group. The new round will be used to fuel expansion.</p>
<p>Numan’s current roster of services cover ED, premature ejaculation, hair loss, gut and lung health, and nutritional deficiencies. But they can also do blood tests for general health needs which don’t require in-person appointments.</p>
<p>Post-pandemic, the digitization of health and wellness continues apace. Had we not had a pandemic, vitamins, and the like, delivered through the letterbox, would almost certainly have continued to grow steadily as a business. But with the pandemic, businesses that can speak to our health needs remotely have exploded.</p>
<p>Who would have considered taking a blood test remotely a ‘normal thing’ two years ago? Now it’s practically required. Into this space, wellness companies have uncovered an extremely lucrative nexus of trends: an aging male population with a desire to remain sexually active, increasing awareness of their own health, the convenience of subscription, and the imperative of the pandemic to keep things remote has proven to be a powerful combination of forces.</p>
<p>Numan is not alone in this space. Roman and Hims, for example, are two big players in the US. The open door Numan is pushing against is more this wider movement around male health, which men themselves are becoming more open to. As well as growing organically, Numan has also made two strategic acquisitions of companies in the UK and Sweden to expand its footprint. It’s likely this new round will lead to similar strategic plays.</p>
<p>With sexual health a tricky subject for men, digital services are stepping in to mitigate any embarrassment around having to sit in front of the family GP. Numan is also regulated by the Care Quality Commission as a registered healthcare provider, giving it a further stamp of approval.</p>
<p>Numan claims men now prefer its model to in-person healthcare meetings. In its own survey of 800 subscribers, 88% said that using the service has improved their confidence, while 68% say that using Numan has also improved their relationships, and over half said the effects of the pandemic had given them a more positive impression of using digital healthcare.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement Sokratis Papafloratos, CEO &amp; founder, Numan said: “This funding is a significant milestone on our journey to help millions of men be healthier. White Star Capital is one of the best investors in our space, and I’m delighted to be working together along with a wider team of brilliant investors.”</p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call, Papafloratos added that despite there being a lot of competition in the space “this is not a winner-takes-all-market. We have 25 languages on the team so we understand the market, patients, regulation, we understand it more in-depth than many competitors.”</p>
<p>Eric Martineau-Fortin, Founder and Managing Partner, White Star Capital: “Men’s health has been under-served by traditional services and needs innovative businesses to break down barriers and ensure taboos don’t prevent men from being happy and healthy. Numan’s digital offering helps men take charge of their health discreetly and decisively. We’re incredibly excited by Sokratis and his team, and look forward to working with them as they grow.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding startups that help manufacturers and sellers distribute products and merchants access them on a single platform keeps increasing across Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Cairo-based B2B e-commerce startup <a href="https://www.capiter.net/">Capiter</a> continues that trend by raising a $33 million Series A round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment was co-led by Quona Capital and MSA Capital. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other participating investors include Savola, Shorooq Partners, Foundation Ventures, Accion Venture Lab, and Derayah Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capiter </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in July 2020 by <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/mahmoud-nouh-363a2b119">Mahmoud Nouh</a> and <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/ahmed-nouh">Ahmed Nouh</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking with TechCrunch, CEO Mahmoud Nouh says Capiter solves problems around reach and insights for suppliers and manufacturers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the manufacturers in Egypt today do not have the right infrastructure of the supply chain in place to reach merchants. Nouh says that manufacturers can only reach 30% of merchants in the market, but with Capiter, that number goes up between 80% to 100%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, a large portion of the manufacturers&#8217; end trade happens via traditional channels where there is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> no transparency over data or market insights</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using machine learning, Capiter says it helps these manufacturers gain critical insights into the markets they serve, the products they sell, and how they fair with competition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then for merchants, Capiter attends to three problems. The first is the inconvenience merchants have to deal with engaging several suppliers to find the right product. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second is transparency which involves some back and forth between merchants and manufacturers on pricing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The third is that merchants often have little or no access to working capital to get the right product and the right time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Capiter, merchants can order products from FMCGs and wholesalers while the company delivers them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capiter also provides fair pricing and matching techniques that showcases a wide range of inventory for merchants</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then it affords working capital to them to buy more products even when they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are strapped</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with cash. Capiter partners with local banks in Egypt and the Central Bank to perform this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capiter has over 12 merchant types on its platform, including mom-and-pop stores, hotels, restaurants, cafes, electronic shops, supermarkets, grocery shops, and catering companies, each with its own customized solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re able to get the data from the products they buy. So we offer them the best solution on what they should sell, at what time and peak seasons, including when are the offerings happening. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> these </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are customized</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solutions that we offer,&#8221; said Mahmoud Nouh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s revenues </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are derived</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from little margins on the products bought from manufacturers and sold to merchants</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then on rebates for the suppliers and commission from the working capital provided to merchants. Capiter also makes money from providing market insights and data services to manufacturers and FMCGs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> B2B e-commerce platforms operate either asset-light, inventory-heavy models.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nouh tells me that Capiter chose to use a hybrid model &#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> making deliveries without owning any trucks to ensure scalability and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">owning inventory, especially for high turnover products helping the company with high availability and better pricing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This way has enabled us to scale the business in a very fast manner and at the same time, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">efficiently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">reliably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> warehouses and trucks, we don&#8217;t own them; we rent them. We deal with third-party logistics for transportation and we manage them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 50,000 merchants and 1,000 sellers use Capiter. According to CEO Nouh, the company has provided up to 6,000 SKUs. He also adds that the company is targeting an annualized revenue of $1 billion by next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re on a very good trajectory for achieving this,&#8221; he added. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team members, we have a team of more than 1000 people at the moment, including in warehouses, delivery, etc. So we&#8217;ve seen good traction across all board,&#8221; he answered when asked about Capiter&#8217;s traction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quona Capital, the co-lead investor in this round, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to have made some B2B e-commerce bets over the past years, for instance, Kenya&#8217;s Sokowatch. The investment in Capiter adds to the firm&#8217;s portfolio in that regard and a growing presence in the MENA region being its first check made in Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Quona co-founder and managing partner Monica Brand Engel said, “Capiter’s embedded finance model, combined with its expertise and strong user engagement, can have a dramatic impact on the financial lives of SMEs, helping them optimize their income which helps communities to thrive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“SME supply chain inefficiencies are massive throughout the Middle East. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the key blocker is the lack of working capital in the system. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Capiter has built an asset-light way to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aggregate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> retailers and suppliers and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilitate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> credit into the system through a comprehensive multi-product offering such as commerce, credit financing, digital payments, bookkeeping and inventory management for SMEs, leveraging on the ecosystem built by the local banks and financial institutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” adds Ben Harburg, partner at MSA Capital, a global VC that has invested in fintechs like Nubank and Klarna.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Ahmed Nouh, the company&#8217;s COO, Capiter will expand into new verticals like agriculture and pharmaceutical offerings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The co-founder brings experience from the shipping and logistics space. Both he and Mahmoud are serial entrepreneurs. The latter&#8217;s journey is quite prominent, having worked in the mobility space as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the co-founder and COO of Egyptian ride-hailing company SWVL. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/egyptian-ride-sharing-company-swvl-plans-to-go-public-in-a-1-5b-spac-merger/">announced a potential SPAC deal valuing it at $1.5 billion</a> and is one of the few African startups breeding a tech mafia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Ahmed Sabbah, another co-founder of the company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/sequoia-leads-5m-pre-seed-in-egypts-1-month-old-digital-bank-telda/">now runs early-stage fintech startup Telda</a>.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hi readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Twenty years and one week ago, I was riding the monorail system at the Newark airport and pointed to the twin skyscrapers looming in the distance. &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe you&#8217;ve never been to the top of the World Trade Center,&#8221; I said to my then fiancé and now husband. Days later, I would walk into a restaurant in a Slovenian town and see a report on the TV about a plane crashing into one of those towers. Like so many of us, we spent the rest of that day watching the news and wondering what would happen next.</p>
<p>In all, four aircraft were hijacked the morning of September 11, two of which crashed into the World Trade Center, one into the Pentagon and the fourth in a field in Pennsylvania. In all, 2,996 people were killed.</p>
<p>The September 11 terrorist attacks triggered a series of events that would change the world forever, including how we move about it. My September 6, 2001 flight to Newark and then onto to Europe was the last time I would experience what now seems unimaginable: getting to an airport less than 45 minutes before my plane took off.</p>
<p>My trip home from Europe provided a forecast of what air travel would look and feel like, although some measures like when we were separately interviewed two different times prior to boarding, ended up being temporary.</p>
<p>Within months of my arrival home, passenger screening and security at airports would be handled by a new federal agency called the Transportation Security Administration. Security wasn&#8217;t the only aspect of air travel that changed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The airline industry experienced skyrocketing losses that sparked a wave of cost-cutting, new fees for travelers and consolidation. According <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-04-836.pdf">to the GAO</a>, the U.S. airline industry lost $23 billion between 2001 and 2003 and some of the nation&#8217;s biggest airlines including USAir and United Airlines filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The airline industry would suffer financial losses during the Great Recession of 2008, causing more bankruptcies and consolidation. Today, most domestic flights are controlled by four airlines: American, Delta, Southwest and United.</p>
<p>After recovering and stringing together a few years of profitability, the airline industry (and how we travel) would get hit again: this time from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1999054 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>We&#8217;ve talked before about the possibilities of shared micromobility to help cities create more equitable and accessible transit ecosystems. Shared operators have expanded this idea to support activism.</p>
<p>Agencies and operators <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/shared-micromobility-can-help-build-communities-residents-deserve/">provided free or discounted trips</a> for demonstrators to get to events, according to the <strong>North American Bikeshare and Scootershare Association&#8217;s</strong> 2020 report on the state of the shared micromobility industry, Many even donated or fundraised for racial justice nonprofits.</p>
<p>Not only are they aiding the fight on the ground, the report also shows that nearly three-quarters of all operators stated that diversity was a part of every hiring decision, and 69 percent reported that women and POC are represented at all levels of the organization.</p>
<h3>Operator update</h3>
<p><strong>Lime</strong> is back in Oakland with 500 scooters and plans to scale up to 1,000 over the coming weeks. The company pulled out of the city last year during the pandemic. This time, it&#8217;s focusing on &#8220;Communities of Concern&#8221; as designated by the city, and will deploy half its fleet to these neighborhoods that have been traditionally underserved by transportation.</p>
<p><strong>Tier</strong> is hooking up with Irish computer vision startup <strong>Luna.</strong> Tier is adding Luna&#8217;s cameras and smart city technology to its shared e-scooter fleets across Europe and the Middle East. To handle the increase in work, Luna is hiring 15 new staffers to cover computer vision/AI, hardware, IoT and project management roles in Ireland. Interestingly, the partnership comes from an Ireland trade mission to Germany to better understand how the two countries could work together within the e-mobility and automotive industry. Luna just recently launched a pilot with <strong>Vo</strong>i in England, and Ford-backed micromobility operator <strong>Spin</strong> is slowly pushing out <strong>Drover AI&#8217;s</strong> similar tech on scooters in the United States.</p>
<p>Speaking of <strong>Voi</strong>, the Swedish company is working with the UK government&#8217;s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/kickstart-scheme">Kickstart Scheme</a> to help create jobs for people ages 16 to 24 years old on Universal Credit who are at risk of long term unemployment. Voi is recruiting 25 young people across the country to work as Warehouse Operatives and Fleet Specialists. The young ones will be ensured a job for at least six months and will hopefully learn a thing or two about a growing transport industry.</p>
<p><strong>Bird</strong> has tweaked its branding. It recently announced its scooters and bikes will now be made in <a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/electric-sky-why-bird-has-new-blue-look/">&#8220;Electric Sky&#8221; blue</a>, as opposed to its black, white and silver color scheme. The color evokes eco-friendly transportation, clear skies and cheerful days. It&#8217;s reminiscent of Revel&#8217;s blue mopeds and Swapfiets&#8217; bikes.</p>
<h3>Taking liberties with the term &#8220;micromobility&#8221;</h3>
<p>Chinese EV maker <strong>Xpeng</strong> says it&#8217;s going to make a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/a-chinese-ev-startup-wants-to-build-a-ridable-robot-unicorn-for-kids/">robot unicorn</a> for children to ride. The quadruped will navigate multiple types of terrain, recognize objects and provide &#8220;emotional interaction.&#8221; The robot pulls from Xpeng&#8217;s experiences with AI and automated driving development. The rendering looks cute and soft, for a metal beast, but the horn could be a bit longer IMO. Bonus: it&#8217;s not creepy-looking like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/oh-hey-xiaomi-has-its-own-creepy-robot-dog-now/">Xiaomi&#8217;s robot dog</a>.</p>
<p>Dutch startup <strong>Squad Mobility</strong> has introduced details for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/squad-mobility-eyes-shared-platforms-as-target-for-its-compact-solar-electric-quadricycle/">small, low-cost electric city car</a> that&#8217;s equipped with solar panels which drip feed the battery throughout the day. The company hopes to come out with a prototype for the solar-assisted quadricycle by October this year and begin deliveries by the end of next year. While it would be a fun passenger vehicle for city folks, the end game is to get in good with one of the car-sharing or shared micromobility operators and sell fleets of the Squad car for shared use.</p>
<p>At the Munich Motor Show, <strong>BMW</strong> revealed a couple of electric bike concepts that look pretty wicked. The Motorrad Vision AMBY looks like a motorcycle, but is probably more along the class of off-road motorbike, complete with fat tires and a seat-to-footrest ratio that brings to mind all the shredding that can be had. The <a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0341396EN/the-bmw-i-vision-amby">i Vision AMBY</a> is more of a traditional road e-bike, but maybe one that&#8217;s inspired by Back to the Future, such is its retrofuturistic vibe and, I&#8217;ll say it, postal service-beige frame.</p>
<h3>ADAS in scooters</h3>
<p>The desire to keep shared electric scooters off sidewalks has driven the development of advanced technology in the micromobility industry. Once the province of geofencing, scooter companies are so eager to get a leg up on the competition that they&#8217;re now implementing technology similar to advanced driver assistance systems usually found in cars. Check out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/advanced-rider-assistance-systems-tech-spawned-by-the-politics-of-micromobility/">my story in Extra Crunch</a> that digs into this trend.</p>
<h3>Micromobility America event</h3>
<p>The folks who write our <a href="https://micromobility.substack.com/">other favorite micromobility newsletter</a> are going to be hosting a micromobility event in the SF Bay Area. On September 23, a range of experts, founders, investors and builders will be sharing top insights about the world of lightweight electric vehicles and their potential to disrupt transportation, including:<br />
Brazilian racing driver Lucas Di Grassi, American entrepreneur and former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, senior writer at Wired Lauren Goode, analyst and founder of the term &#8220;micromobility&#8221; Horace Dediu</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Investors continue to sink money into ride-hailing companies. <strong>Cao Cao Mobility</strong>, the ride-hailing unit of Chinese automaker <strong>Geely Automobile Holdings</strong>, is the latest example.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/geelys-ride-hailing-unit-cao-cao-mobility-raises-589m-series-b-to-upgrade-tech-and-expand-fleet/">raised $589 million</a> (RMB 3.8 billion) in a Series B round led by Suzhou Xiangcheng Financial Holding Group, an investment company backed by the Xiangcheng district government of Suzhou. Suzhou High-Speed Rail New City Group and three other state-controlled enterprises also participated.</p>
<p>The raise brings the company&#8217;s total funding to around $773.2 million (RMB 5 billion).</p>
<p>As TechCrunch reporter Rebecca Bellan notes, Cao Cao is positioned for further growth and a larger market share, as long as the Chinese government believes the company is operating fairly. Its competitors Didi Global and Amap have come under increased government scrutiny that has hurt their business, while giving Cao Cao a boost.</p>
<p>A cybersecurity investigation prompted the Chinese government to temporarily remove Didi Global from Chinese app stores. As a result, Cao Cao, which is currently available in 62 cities in China, saw ride volume increase 32% in July.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Accure</strong>, the Aachen, Germany-based battery safety software company <a href="https://tech.eu/brief/battery-analytics-startup-accure-banks-8-million/">raised $8 million</a> in a Series A round led by Blue Bear Capital. Capnamic Ventures and 42CAP also participated.</p>
<p><strong>BP Ventures</strong>, the investing arm of oil and gas giant BP, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/bp-ventures-invests-11-9m-in-in-car-payments-provider-ryd-to-support-expansion/">made a €10 million</a> ($11.9 million) investment in Ryd, a German in-car digital payments provider. The funds will be used to help Ryd expand its service into international markets and build out its offering.</p>
<p><strong>Delhivery</strong>, the Indian logistics firm, courted Lee Fixel&#8217;s Addition as an investor before its expected IPO in the next two quarters: The Gurgaon-headquartered firm disclosed in a regulatory filing that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/lee-fixels-addition-invests-over-75-million-in-delhivery/">Addition invested $76.4 million</a> in the startup as part of a Series I round. Delihivery hasn&#8217;t disclosed the total raise or other investors.</p>
<p><strong>Delimobil</strong>, the Russian car sharing company, has chosen banks to organize its IPO listing and is seeking to raise around $ 350 million, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-russian-car-sharing-firm-delimobil-eyes-350-mln-new-york-ipo-autumn-2021-09-07/">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Skydweller Aero</strong>, the U.S.-Spanish aerospace startup, received an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/solar-powered-aircraft-developer-skydweller-aero-adds-8m-to-series-a-partners-with-palantir/">additional $8 million</a> in oversubscribed funding led by Leonardo S.p.A, Marlinspike Capital and Advection Growth Capital. The funds were added to its Series A round, which had previously reached $32 million. The company said it has also partnered with Palantir Technologies to use its Foundry analytics platform to process information at-scale and onboard the aircraft designed for telecommunications, government operations and emergency services.</p>
<p><strong>Tritium Holdings</strong>, the Australian developer of DC fast-charging technology for electric vehicles, <a href="https://tritiumcharging.com/tritium-announces-aud40-million-private-placement-financing-by-cigna-investments-inc/">raised A$40 million</a>  ($29.4 million) from the investment arm of Cigna.</p>
<p><strong>WattE</strong>, a company trying to develop a network of truck stops and run a fleet of 12,000 electric trucks to share, will receive a $5 million grant from the California Energy Commission. The grant is for the construction of the state&#8217;s first electric truck stop. The company also recently closed a $6 million Series A round led by Canon Equity.</p>
<h2>A little bird</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896211 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif" alt="blinky cat bird green" width="1600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>I hear things. But I&#8217;m not selfish. Let me share what the little birds are telling me.</p>
<p>You likely spotted the widespread coverage, including by TechCrunch, that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/ford-hires-apple-executive-who-led-its-secret-car-project/"><strong>Ford Motor</strong> hired <strong>Doug Field</strong></a><strong>,</strong> the engineering executive who was VP of Apple&#8217;s special projects team and its secret, not-very-secret car program.</p>
<p>Field, who also once worked as senior vice president of engineering at Tesla, was named as Ford&#8217;s chief advanced technology and embedded systems officer. Soon after the news broke, reports came out that Kevin Lynch, who led development on the Apple Watch, had taken over Field&#8217;s role on the car project.</p>
<p>All of this had TC readers wondering (at least according to my DMs and emails) whether Apple&#8217;s car program was at risk. I reached out to some folks and one source told me that Apple employees were in Korea meeting with battery manufacturers as early as last week, which suggests that the game is on. You might recall, <a href="https://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/313622.html?gosh">The Korea Times</a> reported back in early August a team from Apple was visiting battery manufacturers LG Chem, SK, and Hanwha as part of &#8220;early talks.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems those talks are still happening.</p>
<h2>Policy corner</h2>

<p>Welcome back to policy corner! Big news out of the aviation industry this week, as major airlines pledged to make 3 billion gallons of &#8220;sustainable aviation fuel&#8221; available to aircraft carriers by 2030, in line with a federal goal of reducing aviation emissions by 20% by the start of the next decade.</p>
<p>The announcement was made by industry group <strong><a href="https://www.airlines.org/news/u-s-airlines-announce-3-billion-gallon-sustainable-aviation-fuel-production-goal/">Airlines for America</a> </strong>(A4A), whose members include <strong>United Airlines</strong>, <strong>Delta</strong>, <strong>American Airlines</strong> and <strong>Southwest</strong>. The group had previously set a target of 2 billion gallons by 2030 back in March. (Also yesterday, United made a separate announcement that it would purchase 1.5 billion gallons of SAF from startup Alder Fuels, pending certain conditions are met. Check out my <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/sustainable-jet-fuel-company-alder-fuels-seals-investments-from-united-honeywell/">story on the deal here</a>.</p>
<p>A4A stressed the importance of federal action to support the development of SAF, including a &#8220;blender&#8221; tax credit for SAF mixed with conventional fuel and public-private research partnerships into SAF tech.</p>
<p>But this would be just the beginning, if <strong>President Joe Biden</strong> has his say; his administration wants a &#8220;fully zero-carbon aviation sector by 2050,&#8221; according to a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/09/fact-sheet-biden-administration-advances-the-future-of-sustainable-fuels-in-american-aviation/">White House fact sheet</a> released Thursday. Aviation accounts for 11% of the country&#8217;s transportation-related emissions, the fact sheet says. Plus, while 3 billion gallons of fuel certainly sounds like a lot, a United spokesperson told TechCrunch that the airline consumes around 4 billion annually, and the White House says demand overall could be as high as 35 billion gallons per year by 2050.</p>
<p>To meet that demand, Biden said he is seeking that SAF incentives be included in the $3.5 trillion spending bill currently being debated by Congress, including a tax credit and $4.3 billion earmarked for funding SAF projects.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note two things: one, as it currently stands, SAF is more expensive than conventional jet fuel, itself a considerable cost for airlines. Two, the above goals on behalf of the airlines are non-binding, voluntary agreements. Taken together, that means (in my humble opinion) that a tax incentive or something like it will be necessary for SAF to achieve cost parity with conventional fuel &#8212; and for airlines to actually adopt it.</p>
<hr />
<p>The other policy items that caught my eye this week come from the great state of New York. The first is out of New York City, which set a target to install 40,000 public Level 2 chargers and 6,000 DC fast chargers by 2030. This buildout, outlined in the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/electrifying-new-york-report.pdf">Department of Transportation&#8217;s EV plan</a>, will be necessary for the city to reach its target of being fully carbon neutral by 2050.</p>
<p>Finally, the New York State House <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/571385-hochul-signs-law-requiring-zero-emission-passenger-vehicles-by-2035?rl=1">signed a bill</a> into law requiring all passenger vehicles sold in-state to be zero-emission by 2035, making it the second state (after California) to introduce a set deadline to phase out internal combustion engine cars. It&#8217;s hard to know whether this is the start of a sea change in state policy or whether NY and California are anomalies, but I can see this type of legislation becoming more popular in the coming years.</p>

<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Anthony Levandowski</strong>, the controversial and presidentially pardoned autonomous vehicle technology engineer, sat down with The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/in-first-post-pardon-interview-anthony-levandowski-explains-startups-pivot-to-mining">for an interview</a> that included details about his company&#8217;s pivot from big rigs to dump trucks.</p>
<p><strong>Aurora</strong> co-founder <strong>Sterling Anderson</strong> laid out the autonomous vehicle company&#8217;s <a href="https://aurora.tech/blog/the-aurora-driver-development-program-a-structured">development process</a> in a blog post this week. Aurora collaborated with half a dozen OEMs and has integrated its self-driving system into eight distinct vehicle platforms. Anderson wrote that the outcome &#8220;is a highly refined Driver-vehicle interface and a structured process for the design, development, and launch of vehicles designed for it that we call the Aurora Driver Development Program.&#8221; Side note: Aurora has made its Pittsburgh office its official headquarters.</p>
<p><strong>Intel</strong> subsidiary <strong>Mobileye</strong> and rental car giant <strong>Sixt SE</strong> announced plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/intels-mobileye-rental-giant-sixt-to-launch-a-robotaxi-service-in-germany-next-year/">launch a robotaxi service</a> in Munich next year. As I noted in my article, the robotaxi service will leverage all of Intel&#8217;s, and more specifically Mobileye&#8217;s, assets that have been in development or purchased in recent years, including the $900 million acquisition in 2020 of Moovit, an Israeli startup that analyzes urban traffic patterns and provides transportation recommendations with a focus on public transit.</p>
<p>Through the partnership, riders will be able to access the robotaxi service via the Moovit app. The service will also be offered through Sixt&#8217;s mobility ONE app, which gives customers the ability to hail a ride, rent, share or subscribe to vehicles. Caveat: this won&#8217;t be a large-scale service in the beginning; it will start small and operate similarly to other early rider programs first modeled by nuTonomy and Waymo.</p>
<p><strong>WeRide</strong>, a Chinese autonomous vehicle technology company, unveiled its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/weride-jiangling-motors-and-zto-express-unveil-robovan-an-autonomous-cargo-van/">first cargo van</a>. The company said it will work with Chinese automobile manufacturer Jiangling Motors and Chinese express delivery company ZTO Express to commercialize its first self-driving van at scale. The &#8220;robovans&#8221; will be based on JMC&#8217;s battery electric vehicle model with a fully redundant vehicle platform, combined with WeRide&#8217;s full-stack software and hardware autonomous driving (AD) solutions.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles (and batteries)</h3>
<p><strong>GM </strong>extended a shutdown at its Orion Assembly Plant by another two weeks due to a battery pack shortage related to the widespread Chevrolet Bolt EV and Bolt EUV safety recall. GM said the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/gm-extends-chevy-bolt-ev-production-shutdown-another-two-weeks/">extended downtime</a> at the Orion plant will last through September 20. Orion Assembly Plant in Michigan has been shut down since August 23.</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong> has hired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/ford-builds-leadership-team-of-commercial-vehicle-unit-ahead-of-e-transit-launch/">six senior-level executives</a> to its newly minted commercial vehicles and services business unit as the automaker prepares to bring to market the E-Transit cargo van and the F-150 Lightning Pro pickup truck &#8212; two electric vehicles it&#8217;s betting will become commercial customers&#8217; new workhorses.</p>
<p><strong>Sila Nanotechnologies&#8217;</strong> next-generation battery technology made its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/sila-nanotechnologiess-first-next-gen-battery-will-launch-in-whoop-wearables/">commercial product debut</a> in the new Whoop fitness tracker, a milestone that caps a decade of research and development by the Silicon Valley startup. This matters because Sila Nano has joint battery ventures with BMW and Daimler to produce batteries containing the company&#8217;s silicon-anode technology, with the goal of going to market in the automotive industry by 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Solid Power</strong>, a battery developer backed by Ford and BMW, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/solid-power-expands-production-capacity-to-deliver-test-batteries-to-bmw-ford-in-2022/">preparing to start pilot production</a> of its solid state batteries early next year. A new production facility will be dedicated to manufacturing a sulfide-based solid electrolyte material and pilot production of its commercial-grade, 100 ampere battery cells. Those pouch cells are expected to go to Ford and BMW for automotive testing in early 2022.</p>
<p>Meet <strong>Squad Mobility</strong> and learn about its vision of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/squad-mobility-eyes-shared-platforms-as-target-for-its-compact-solar-electric-quadricycle/">perfect urban vehicle</a>. Here&#8217;s a hint: it&#8217;s small, cheap, electric and includes solar.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> set the <a href="https://www.nuerburgring.de/news/tesla-faehrt-offiziellen-rekord-fuer-elektrofahrzeuge">official record</a> for electric vehicles at Nürburgring with a Tesla &#8220;Model S Plaid,&#8221; that driven by Andreas Simonsen circumnavigated the 20.8-kilometre. (12.9-mile) Nordschleife loop in 7:35.579, <a href="https://www.nuerburgring.de/news/tesla-faehrt-offiziellen-rekord-fuer-elektrofahrzeuge">according to a statement</a> from the motorsports complex.</p>
<p><strong>Toyota Motor</strong> said it will oppose a proposal by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives to give <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/toyota-says-it-will-fight-us-house-electric-vehicle-tax-plan-2021-09-11/">union-made electric vehicles</a> in the United States an additional $4,500 tax incentive, Reuters reported. The company said the proposal discriminates &#8220;against American autoworkers based on their choice not to unionize.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><strong>Volta Trucks</strong>, a full-electric commercial vehicle manufacturer, said its first vehicles will be manufactured in Steyr, Austria, by Steyr Automotive, formerly MAN Truck and Bus Austria.</p>
<h3>Delivery and sharing</h3>
<p><strong>DoorDash</strong>, <strong>Caviar</strong>, <strong>Grubhub</strong>, <strong>Seamless</strong>,<strong> Postmates</strong> and <strong>Uber Eats</strong> have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uber-eats-grubhub-doordash-sue-nyc-for-limiting-fees-the-apps-can-charge-restaurants/">sued the City of New York</a> over a law that would permanently limit the amount of commissions the apps can charge restaurants to use their services. The companies are seeking an injunction that would prevent the city from enforcing the legislation, unspecified monetary damages and a jury trial.</p>
<p><strong>Plentywaka</strong> co-founder and CEO Onyeka Akumah was interviewed by TechCrunch as part of its ongoing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/plentywaka-founder-onyeka-akumah-on-african-startups-and-global-expansion/">founders Q&amp;A series</a>.</p>
<h3>Misc. stuff</h3>
<p><strong>Hyundai Motor Group</strong> laid out its hydrogen strategy, announcing it will provide <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/hyundai-motor-group-unveils-its-hydrogen-strategy-plans-to-offer-fuel-cell-versions-of-commercial-cars-by-2028/">hydrogen fuel cell versions</a> for all its commercial vehicles by 2028. Hyundai&#8217;s goal is to achieve cost competitiveness comparable to that of EV batteries by 2030. The company also shared details about its high-performance, rear-wheel drive hydrogen sports car, the Vision FK, with a targeted range of 373 miles. Hyundai did not share when the vehicle would go into production.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong> unveiled the 2022 Chevrolet Silverado, a full-sized pickup truck that received a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/the-2022-chevrolet-silverado-gets-a-tech-upgrade-hands-free-trailering-and-a-new-zr2-off-road-flagship/"> major technology upgrade</a>, including its hands-free Super Cruise advanced driver assistance system and an infotainment system with embedded Google services, as well as an overhauled interior.</p>
<p><strong>David Zipper</strong> wrote a piece for Slate examining the growing problem of <a href="https://slate.com/business/2021/09/infotainment-tesla-mercedes-ford-volvo-distraction.html">infotainment systems</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">E-commerce these days is now a major part of every retailer&#8217;s strategy, so technology builders and platforms that are helping them compete better on digital screens are seeing a huge boost in business. In the latest turn, <a href="https://commercetools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Commercetools</a> &#8212; a provider of e-commerce APIs that larger retailers can use to build customized payment, check-out, social commerce, marketplace and other services &#8212; has closed $140 million in funding, a Series C that CEO Dirk Hoerig has confirmed to me values the company at $1.9 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The funding is being led by Accel, with previous investors Insight Partners and REWE Group also participating. Munich, Germany-based Commercetools spun out of REWE &#8212; a giant German retailer, and also a customer &#8212; and announced $145 million in investment led by Insight <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/21/commercetools-raises-145m-from-insight-for-shopify-style-e-commerce-apis-for-large-enterprises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in October 2019</a>.</span></p>
<p>This latest round represents a huge hike on its valuation since then, when Commercetools was valued at around $300 million.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for the big bump, of course, has been the wave of interest in digital transactions from shopping online. E-commerce was already growing at a steady pace before 2020, by some estimates representing more than half of all commerce transactions. The Covid-19 pandemic turbo-charged that proportion, with many retailers switching exclusively to internet sales, and consumers stuck at home happy to shop with a click.</p>
<p>While companies like Shopify have addressed the needs of smaller retailers, providing them with an alternative or complement to listing on third-party marketplaces like Amazon&#8217;s, Commercetools has built its business around catering to larger retailers and the many specific, large-scale needs and investment budgets that they may have for building their digital commerce solutions.</p>
<p>It provides some 300 APIs today around some nine &#8220;buckets&#8221; of services, and a wide network of integration partners, Hoerig said, and powers some $10 billion of sales annually for its customers, which include the likes of Audi, AT&amp;T, Danone, Tiffany &amp; Co., John Lewis and <a href="https://commercetools.com/customers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many others</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our main focus is the retailer with more than $100 million in gross merchandise value,&#8221; Hoerig said. &#8220;This is when it becomes interesting.&#8221; But he added that the force of market growth is such that Commercetools is also seeing a lot of business from smaller companies that are simply needing more functionality to address their fast growth. &#8220;So we also sometimes have customers that start at $5 million in GMV and quickly go to $50 million. With that scale, they also have specific requirements, so the lines get a bit blurry.&#8221; (And that also explains why investors are so interested: there is a lot of evidence of the market growing and growing; and by capturing smaller retailers on big trajectories, that represents a lot more scale for Commercetools.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hoerig is sometimes credited with being the person who first coined the term &#8220;headless commerce&#8221;, which basically means APIs that can be used by a company, or its team of strategists, developers and designers, to build their own customized check-out and other purchasing experiences, rather than fitting these into templates provided by the tech company powering the checkout.</p>
<p>But as the API economy has continued to grow, and the world of non-tech companies that use tech continues to mature, that has taking on a mass-market appeal, and so Commercetools is far from being the only one in this area. In addition to Shopify (which has its own version targeting larger businesses, Shopify Plus), others include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/spryker-raises-130m-at-a-500m-valuation-to-provide-b2bs-with-agile-e-commerce-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spryker</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/headless-commerce-startup-swell-raises-3-4m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swell</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/fabric-series-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabric</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/chord-series-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chord</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/shogun-raises-35m-to-help-brands-take-on-amazon-with-faster-and-better-sites-of-their-own/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shogun</a>.</p>
<p>Commercetools will be using the funding both to continue organically expanding its business, but also to make some acquisitions to bolt on new customers, and new technology, tapping into some of the scaling and consolidation that is taking place across e-commerce as a whole. What will be interesting to see is where consolidation will happen, and which startups will be raising money to scale on their own: right now there is a lot of enthusiasm around the space because it is so buoyant, and that will spell more money being funneled to more startups.</p>
<p>Case in point: when I first got wind of this funding round, Commercetools told me it was in the middle of a deal to acquire a company. In the end, that company decided to stay independent and take some more investment to try to grow on its own. Hoerig said it&#8217;s now pursuing another target.</p>
<p>Indeed, that is also the bigger force that has brought Commercetools to where it is today.</p>
<p>&#8220;The chance to invest in a fast-growing, innovative commerce platform was one we could not pass up,&#8221; said Ping Li, the partner at Accel who led on this deal, said in a statement. “Commercetools provides e-commerce enterprises the technology necessary to capture revenue in the rapidly growing global e-commerce market.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">As Chinese tech companies come under regulatory scrutiny at home, concerns and pressures are escalating among investors and domestic tech companies including China’s four big cloud companies, BATH (Baidu AI, Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud and Huawei Cloud), according to <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/china-cloud-infrastructure-Q2-2021?ctid=2225-538c1eda5c0b2c22075c0fb990131ff0">an analyst report</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Despite a series of antitrust and internet-related regulation crackdowns, the four leading cloud companies have been growing steadily. As the current scrutiny is not particularly focused on the cloud sector and the demand for digital transformation, artificial intelligence and smart industries remains firm, China’s cloud infrastructure market size mounted to $6.6 billion, which is an increase of 54% compared with the previous year, in the second quarter of 2021.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, share prices of three of them&#8211;Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent&#8211; have fallen between 18% and 30% over the last 6 month, which could make investors cautious on betting on the Chinese tech companies.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Chinese tech companies could always rely on their local market, especially when access to lucrative Western markets was blocked. But increasing domestic regulatory pressures over the past nine months have been a frustrating headwind for those companies that have seen their cloud businesses grow significantly over the past years,” said Canalys Vice President Alex Smith.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">The four big cloud titans dominate the Chinese cloud market, accounting for 80% of total cloud spending. Alibaba Cloud maintained its frontrunner status with a 33.8% market share, in the second quarter of this year. Huawei, which had 19.3% of China’s market size in 2Q21, is the one that has avoided regulatory measures so far.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Huawei is an infrastructure and device company that also happens to have developed a strong cloud business. When it comes to cloud infrastructure, we focus on the BATH companies, not just BAT. Huawei is in a strong position to drive growth, particularly in the public sector where it has a good standing and long-term relationship with the government,” Canalys Chief Analyst Matthew Ball said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While Chinese regulators intensify scrutiny of its technology companies, the crackdowns wreak havoc on its own markets and the shares of China-based companies.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beijing passed the Data Security Law in June that started to <a href="https://www.china-briefing.com/news/a-close-reading-of-chinas-data-security-law-in-effect-sept-1-2021/">go into effect early September for protecting critical data related to national security</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/27/china-proposes-strict-control-of-algorithms/">issued draft guidelines on regulating the algorithms companies</a>, targeting ByteDance, Alibaba Group, Tencent and DiDi and others, in late August.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Payments made a huge shift to digital platforms during the Covid-19 pandemic &#8212; purchasing moved online for many consumers and businesses; and a large proportion of those continuing to buy and sell in-person went cash-free. Today a startup that has been focusing on one specific aspect of payments &#8212; recurring billing &#8212; is announcing a round of funding to capitalize on that growth with expansion of its own. <a href="https://billogram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Billogram</a>, which has built a platform for third parties to build and handle any kind of recurring payments (not one-off purchases), has closed a round of $45 million.</p>
<p>The funding is coming from a single investor, Partech, and will be used to help the Stockholm-based startup expand from its current base in Sweden to six more markets, Jonas Suijkerbuijk, Billogram&#8217;s CEO and founder, said in an interview, to cover more of Germany (where it&#8217;s already active now), Norway, Finland, Ireland, France, Spain, and Italy.</p>
<p>The company got its start working with SMBs in 2011 but pivoted some years later to working with larger enterprises, which make up the majority of its business today. Suijkerbuijk said that in 2020, signed deals went up by 300%, and the first half of 2021 grew 50% more on top of that. Its users include utilities like Skanska Energi and broadband company Ownit, and others like remote healthcare company Kry, businesses that take invoice and take monthly payments from their customers. (There are others that the company is under NDA with that it cannot disclose.)</p>
<p>While there has been a lot of <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/08/implications_of_third-party_payment_processing_for_iap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attention</a> around how companies like Apple and Google are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-lowers-commissions-on-in-app-purchases-for-news-publishers-who-participate-in-apple-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handling subscriptions</a> and payments in apps, what Billogram focuses on is a different beast, and much more complex: it&#8217;s more integrated into the business providing services, and it may involve different services, and the fees can vary over every billing period. It&#8217;s for this reason that, in fact, even big companies in the realm of digital payments, like Stripe, which might even already have products that can help manage subscriptions on their platforms, partner with companies like Billogram to build the experiences to manage their more involved kinds of payment services.</p>
<p>I should point out here that Suijkerbuijk told me that Stripe recently became a partner of Billograms, which is very interesting&#8230; but he also added that a number of the big payments companies have talked to Billogram. He also confirmed that currently Stripe is not an investor in the company. &#8220;We have a very good relationship,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not surprising to see Stripe and others wanting to more in the area of more complex, recurring billing services. <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210910005516/en/Insights-on-the-SubscriptionRecurring-Billing-Management-Global-Market-to-2025---Featuring-ActivePlatform-Amazon-and-FastSpring-Among-Others---ResearchAndMarkets.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Researchers estimate</a> that the market size (revenues and services) for subscription and recurring billing will be close to $6 billion this year, with that number ballooning to well over $10 billion by 2025. And indeed, the effort to make a payment or any kind of transaction will continue to be a point of friction in the world of commerce, so any kinds of systems that bring technology to bear to make that easier and something that consumers or businesses will do without thinking about it, will be valuable, and will likely grow in dominance. (It&#8217;s why the more basic subscription services, such as Prime membership or a Netflix subscription, or a cloud storage account, are such winners.)</p>
<p>Within that very big pie, Suijkerbuijk noted that rather than the Apples and Googles of the world, the kinds of businesses that Billogram currently competes against are those that are addressing the same thornier end of the payments spectrum that Billogram is. These include a wide swathe of incumbent companies that do a lot of their business in areas like debt collection, and other specialists like Scaleworks-backed Chargify &#8212; which itself got a big investment injection earlier this year from Battery Ventures, which put <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/news/2021/04/23/battery-ventures-invests-in-chargify.html?page=all" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$150 million</a> into both it and another billing provider, SaaSOptics, in April.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The former group of competitors are not currently a threat to Billogram, he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Debt collecting agencies are big on invoicing, but no one &#8212; not their customers, nor their customers&#8217; customers &#8212; loves them, so they are great competitors to have,&#8221; Suijkerbuijk joked.</p>
<p>This also means that Billogram is not likely to move into debt collection itself as it continues to expand. Instead, he said, the focus will be on building out more tools to make the invoicing and payments experience better and less painful to customers. That will likely include more moves into customer service and generally improving the overall billing experience &#8212; something we have seen become a bigger area also during the pandemic, as companies realized that they needed to address non-payments in a different way from how their used to, given world events and the impact they were having on individuals.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with Jonas and the team at Billogram.” says Omri Benayoun, General Partner at Partech, in a statement. “Having spotted a gap in the market, they have quietly built the most advanced platform for large B2C enterprises looking to integrate billing, payment, and collection in one single solution. In our discussion with leading utilities, telecom, e-health, and all other clients across Europe, we realized how valuable Billogram was for them in order to engage with their end-users through a top-notch billing and payment experience. The outstanding commercial traction demonstrated by Billogram has further cemented our conviction, and we can’t wait to support the team in bringing their solution to many more customers in Europe and beyond!”</p>

<p class="p3">Health insurance is the kind of thing people usually only think about only when they need it. Otherwise, their policies are just paperwork in their files or cards in their wallet. Indonesian insurtech <a href="https://rey.id/">Rey Assurance</a> is taking a new approach. Once someone becomes a member, they also get access to a platform of health services, including AI-based self-assessment tools, 24/7 telemedicine consultations for no added fee and pharmacy deliveries. The startup is launching out of stealth today, having already raised $1 million in pre-seed funding from the Trans-Pacific Technology Fund (TPTF).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Rey was founded this year by Evan Tanotogono, former head of digital channel at Sequis, one of Indonesia largest insurers, and Bobby Siagian, who held lead engineering roles at companies including Tokopedia and Sea Group. They are joined by insurance industry veteran David Nugrho as their chief business officer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">They created Rey to address the low penetration of life and health insurance in Indonesia. “When you look at the root causes and pain points, you are looking at problems that are systemic here,” Tanotogono said. These include low awareness, expensive distribution channels like agents and telemarketing, high premiums and complicated policies.</p>
<p class="p3">“People feel like the product is really complex, the process is difficult and they don’t get the best value for the money. It’s been that way for many, many years,” he told TechCrunch. “We believe that we cannot just go into the market and digitize part of the value chain.”</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> Plans start from about $4 USD per month and</span> are available for individual or groups, like families, and small businesses. Rey’s wellness ecosystem was created to give customers more value for their money, and help differentiate it from other companies in Indonesia&#8217;s growing insurtech industry. Some other startups that have recently raised funding include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/indonesian-d2c-insurance-marketplace-lifepal-raises-9m-series-a/">Lifepal</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/indonesian-insurtech-startup-pasarpolis-gets-54-million-series-b-from-investors-including-leapfrog-and-sbi/">PasarPolis </a>and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/qoala-raises-13-5m-to-grow-its-insurance-platform-in-indonesia/">Qoala</a>.</p>
<p class="p3">“Right now, if you look at insurance in Indonesia, if the premium is high, maybe 80% or 90% of that is used for the distribution channel. Now if we optimize something for digital distribution, then we can reduce the price and use the rest for the wellness features,” Tanotogono added.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p class="p3">TPTF managing partner Glenn Kline told TechCrunch that Rey’s founding team was “really the driver” for its investment. “We felt these people really know where the pain points are and they understand clearly how not to try to change the legacy system, but create a whole new platform from the very beginning, where the core value proposition is an integrated solution that is simple and hassle-free.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Instead of doing the underwriting themselves, Rey works with insurance partners to design proprietary policies. The goal is to have an onboarding process that is completely online and only takes about five minutes, and a mostly cashless claim and reimbursement system through Rey’s payment cards. If its payment card can’t be used at healthcare provider, claims can be submitted by uploading receipt photos to the app.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Tanotogono said this is much faster than traditional insurance providers, which can take up to 14 working days to reimburse a claim, and made possible with Rey’s proprietary claim adjudication technology.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p3">Rey’s wellness ecosystem currently covers primary care services, including chats and video calls with medical providers. In the future, it plans to add specialists to the platforms.</p>
<p class="p3">Customers can also link their health wearables for incentives. For example, if they hit certain step or activity goals, they get rewards like discounts or shopping vouchers. Rey’s long-term plan is to link wearables more deeply to its insurance policies, using data to personalize policies and premiums.</p>

<p>Southeast Asia’s funding boom is set to continue, with <a href="https://www.jungle.vc/">Jungle Ventures</a> announcing today the $225 million first close of its fourth fund. Fund IV started raising in mid-May and is targeting a total of $350 million.</p>
<p>The majority of its limited partners are returning from previous funds, and include Temasek Holdings, IFC (which put $25 million in Fund IV), DEG and Asian and global family offices. The firm says this makes Fund IV the largest fund across all early-stage funds in Southeast Asia this year.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012, Jungle Ventures launched with a $10 million debut fund. Then in 2016, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/30/jungle-ventures-100-million-fund-southeast-asia/">announced</a> a $100 million second fund, followed in 2019 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/29/jungle-ventures-third-fund-175-million-first-close/">by its $240 million third fund</a>.</p>
<p>Fund IV fits in with Jungle Ventures’ pace of raising a new fund every 2.5 to 3 years, founding partner Amit Anand told TechCrunch. It also happens to come at a time when the region is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/investors-are-doubling-down-on-southeast-asias-digital-economy/">getting more attention—and capital</a>.</p>
<p>“If you look at Southeast Asia, where we are today, the ecosystem has been in the works for a long time. We started the journey back in 2012. We’re one of the oldest funds in the region and we haven’t seen as good a time as today to be in the tech ecosystem in Southeast Asia,” he said.</p>
<p>“Opportunity and talent were always obvious in the region, and I think capital has followed. But the recent exit announcements, whether acquisitions or the domestic and global IPOs, in many ways has completed the picture of Southeast Asia and made it a lot more attractive to everyone,” Anand added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Jungle Ventures takes a concentrated approach and tends to invest in about 12 to 13 companies per fund. It’s relatively stage-agnostic, writing seed to Series B checks and builds long-term partnerships with many of its investments. The firm has invested in every round of several companies, including<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/finaccel-raises-30m/"> buy now, pay later startup Kredivo</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WPDnNXGd67"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/finaccel-raises-30m/">Kredivo raises $30M to build a digital credit card for Southeast Asia</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Kredivo raises $30M to build a digital credit card for Southeast Asia&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/finaccel-raises-30m/embed/#?secret=WPDnNXGd67" data-secret="WPDnNXGd67" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This approach has worked out well, said Anand. Companies from its 2016 Fund II include unicorns FinAccel and Moglix, and it is paying about 7x on the fund today. “A similar pattern is emerging out of the 2019 vintage,” he added, which includes investments like beauty e-commerce platform Sociolla and KiotViet, the largest point-of-sale and store management system for small retailers in Vietnam.</p>
<p>Fund IV will write checks ranging from about $1 million, to $15 million for Series B funds, and participate in follow-on rounds, too.</p>
<p>“We typically invest in a company when it has a little bit of a product-market fit in its home market, and then we can help regionalize the business,” Anand said. “This could be at seed, it could be A, it could be at B, it doesn’t matter to us.”</p>
<p>Jungle Ventures’ limited partners also do a significant amount of co-investments; in the last three to four years, LPs have invested close to $400 million in its portfolio startups.</p>
<p>In terms of sectors, Anand is particularly excited about social commerce. “I think social commerce is going to eclipse e-commerce by a huge margin in a market like Southeast Asia. Southeast Asia is not just a story about the metro cities, it’s a story about multiple Tier 2, Tier 3 cities across different islands, different geographies. It’s also a geography where the social fabric is deeply engrained within communities.”</p>
<p>Jungle Ventures’ social commerce investments include Evermos, which sells halal and Sharia-compliant goods through agents to their communities.</p>
<p>The firm focuses primarily on Southeast Asia, but it also makes investments in India.</p>
<p>“The cross pollination of talent and ideas, learning and capital between Southeast Asia and India is very strong,” Anand said. “Southeast Asia, even though the ecosystem is growing a lot, the tech talent here in the region is still emerging, whereas India is a great source of tech talent, and we’ve enabled a lot of our portfolio companies to leverage that by opening up tech hubs in India.”</p>
<p>He added that “the focus for Indian investments is to help them expand to Southeast Asia as well and capture this opportunity, too.” One example from Jungle Ventures’ portfolio is interior design platform Livspace, which was founded in India, expanded in Singapore and will enter other Southeast Asia markets.</p>
