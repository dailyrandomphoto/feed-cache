										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More than two years ago, Ludwig Schoenack, Nikolaus Volk and Francesco Wiedemann looked at the bevy of scooter services, ride-hailing apps, public transit and car-sharing options available in most urban centers in the United States and saw a gap in the mobility market.</p>
<p>Consumers who didn&#8217;t want to own a car, but needed one for a few days or weeks had two options: head to a car rental center, likely located at an airport or outside the city center, or turn to a car-sharing platform. The three friends — all German immigrants whose paths had crossed in San Francisco — decided to pool their collective expertise from BMW, McKinsey and Uber and launch Kyte to create a new kind of car rental experience without taking on the costly business of owning and maintaining large fleets.</p>
<p>Kyte built a fleet-logistics platform that lets consumers rent vehicles through their app or website. The vehicles, which are located in hubs throughout a city center, are delivered by gig economy workers right to the renters&#8217; home. Kyte also handles the pickup and refuels the vehicle for no extra charge.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We still believe people own cars because they want it outside their door, so we thought why don&#8217;t we put it right there,&#8221; Schoenack said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Kyte partners with car rental firms and other companies that manage fleets, allowing the startup to focus on consumers and the tech.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The startup, which launched in late 2018 and operates in Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco, has caught the attention of capital of investors. The startup said Tuesday it has raised $9 million in funding from </span>DN Capital and Amplo VC. Numerous individual investors from the mobility industry also participated, including former Uber executives Ed Baker, Jörg Heilig, Josh Mohrer and William Barnes, as well as Lime co-founder Toby Sun and Kayak and Travelocity co-founder Terry Jones.</p>
<p>The funds are already being put to work to help drive Kyte&#8217;s expansion into markets, starting with Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2092334" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Kyte-PR@2x.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2092334" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2092334 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Kyte-PR@2x.png" alt="Kyte car rental app" width="1600" height="1200" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Kyte-PR@2x.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Kyte-PR@2x.png?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Kyte-PR@2x.png?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Kyte-PR@2x.png?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Kyte-PR@2x.png?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Kyte-PR@2x.png?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Kyte-PR@2x.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2092334" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kyte</p></div></p>
<p>Kyte&#8217;s founders wouldn&#8217;t disclose their revenue, except to say it&#8217;s generating a &#8220;solid six-figure&#8221; amount of revenue monthly. Schoenack added that Kyte&#8217;s monthly revenue has grown 400% since March as more consumers have turned to cars during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even before COVID was on the horizon, it was clear that we needed to change the way we interact with cars,&#8221; Schoenack said. Consumers have been more willing to try alternatives like Kyte to travel as COVID-19 has turned many off from air travel.</p>
<p>Despite this fast growth, Schoenack said more than half of Kyte&#8217;s bookings come from recurring users.</p>
<p>Kyte has also found its clients — which Schoenack would only describe as the biggest rental car companies in the country — are willing and enthusiastic participants since it helps get vehicles in the hands of customers. Rental car companies were hit hard by COVID-19 since the bulk of operations are at airports. These companies were left with millions of dollars of depreciating assets that weren&#8217;t generating any revenue.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dn-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="dn-capital">DN Capital&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> co-founder and managing director Steve Schlenker believes that Kyte will be a core building block to the future of mobility.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pandemic has accelerated the transformation of cities and consumer behavior with respect to transportation,&#8221; Schlenker said. &#8220;Kyte&#8217;s unique operations layer facilitates this transformation while providing a level of service and convenience that other solutions fail to meet.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today <a href="https://getdivvy.com/">Divvy</a>, a Utah-based startup that focuses on corporate spend management, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/divvy-raises-165-million-at-a-1-6-billion-valuation-301200377.html">announced</a> that it has closed a $165 million round at a $1.6 billion valuation. The company said that the new capital was raised from Hanaco, Schonfeld, PayPal Ventures, and Whale Rock, along with a cadre of prior investors.</p>
<p>The new investment is not <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/divvy-7ad9" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="divvy-7ad9">Divvy&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> first megaround of private capital. The well-known startup raised $200 million in April of 2019. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/30/utahs-divvy-raises-200m-to-eliminate-expense-reports/">reported at the time</a> that that round valued Divvy at around $700 million, making today&#8217;s deal a more than 2x increase in valuation for the company.</p>
<p>Divvy exists amongst the current generation of Utah-based tech upstarts that are keeping the state&#8217;s tech scene in the broader startup conversation. Podium <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/utahs-podium-raises-125m-series-c-led-by-yc-after-reaching-100m-arr/">fits in the same cohort</a>, for example, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/qualtrics/">Qualtrics</a> feels like it&#8217;s from the preceding peer group.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AUwwU3RAvg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/30/utahs-divvy-raises-200m-to-eliminate-expense-reports/">Utah&#8217;s Divvy raises $200M to eliminate expense reports</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Utah&#8217;s Divvy raises $200M to eliminate expense reports&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/30/utahs-divvy-raises-200m-to-eliminate-expense-reports/embed/#?secret=AUwwU3RAvg" data-secret="AUwwU3RAvg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Divvy&#8217;s market, the corporate spend management space &#8212; broadly corporate cards and software that helps firms manage and limit expenses &#8212; is incredibly active today as businesses look to modernize their financial infrastructure. The new capital for Divvy comes after multiple other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/spendesk-raises-another-18-million-for-its-corporate-card-and-expense-service/">competitors recently announced fresh funds itself</a>, for example. Let&#8217;s take a look at who Divvy is taking on with its new round.</p>
<h2>Competition</h2>
<p>A few weeks back <a href="https://t.co/robCWKydUu?amp=1">Ramp</a>, another corporate-cards-and-software startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/ramp-raises-30m-as-the-battle-to-own-corporate-spend-heats-up/">announced a $30 million raise</a> and that it had reached $100 million in spend through its service in its first 18 months of business. At the same time Divvy shared with TechCrunch that it had seen 120% customer growth and over 100% growth in platform spend in 2020, compared to 2019. At the time, Brex, which also competes in the corporate spend space, declined to share metrics.</p>
<p>That Divvy was able to raise so much capital given its recent growth rates is not surprising. But that so many companies in its sector are managing similarly-strong to-line expansion stands out. After covering the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ramp-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ramp-3">Ramp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> round in December and noting Divvy&#8217;s metrics at the same time, both <a href="https://www.airbase.com/">Airbase</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/spend-control-focused-airbase-adds-23-5m-to-its-series-a-as-it-posts-quick-growth/">more here</a>) and <a href="https://www.teampay.co/">Teampay</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teampay-adds-5m-to-its-series-a-at-higher-valuation-after-growing-arr-320-growth-since-the-round/">more here</a>) reached out with numbers of their own.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/team-labs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="team-labs">Teampay <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> reiterated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teampay-adds-5m-to-its-series-a-at-higher-valuation-after-growing-arr-320-growth-since-the-round/">its October-era metrics</a>, that it has seen its annual recurring revenue (ARR) grow by 320% and its total spend grow by 800% since its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/26/tribe-leads-12m-series-a-into-teampay-to-make-managing-employee-expenses-painless/">then year-ago Series A</a>. Airbase noted what it described as 250% growth in ARR &#8212; up by 2.5x, in other words &#8212; and 700% growth in payment volume (annualized).</p>
<p>Divvy, Teampay, and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/airbase" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="airbase">Airbase <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> are therefore growing like all heck, though in slightly different fashions. Divvy and Ramp offer their corporate spend products and software for free, taking a slice of payment volume through interchange revenues. Teampay and Airbase generate incomes from interchange as well, but also charge for their software. This gives them both spend<em> and</em> software revenues.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="NK1Wdkl1gB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teampay-adds-5m-to-its-series-a-at-higher-valuation-after-growing-arr-320-growth-since-the-round/">Teampay adds $5M to its Series A at higher valuation after growing ARR 320% growth since the round</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Teampay adds $5M to its Series A at higher valuation after growing ARR 320% growth since the round&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teampay-adds-5m-to-its-series-a-at-higher-valuation-after-growing-arr-320-growth-since-the-round/embed/#?secret=NK1Wdkl1gB" data-secret="NK1Wdkl1gB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Which brings us back to Divvy&#8217;s news from today. I normally avoid quoting from releases, but in today&#8217;s case a paragraph is worth sharing:</p>
<blockquote><p>The valuation of <span class="xn-money">$1.6 billion</span> and the addition of key investors validates Divvy&#8217;s ambition to modernize financial processes by combining credit, vendor, and spend management into a single platform. With this round of funding, Divvy plans to invest heavily in product development and engineering in order to accelerate their future roadmap.</p></blockquote>
<p>Divvy is going to invest heavily in product? That makes sense. But to give away its software forever just seems odd. Some of its competitors are charging for theirs! Why not Divvy as well?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see, but what is clear today is that the capital that has gone into startups in Divvy&#8217;s cohort was put into a niche that has shown huge demand. So, expect to hear more from this product area in 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.chronosphere.io/">Chronosphere</a>, the scalable cloud native monitoring tool launched in 2019 by two former Uber engineers, announced a $43.4 million Series B today. The company also announced that their service was generally available starting today.</p>
<p>Greylock, Lux Capital and venture capitalist Lee Fixel, all of whom participated in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/05/chronosphere-launches-with-11m-series-a-to-build-scalable-cloud-native-monitoring-tool/">the startup&#8217;s $11 million Series A</a> in 2019, led the round with participation from new investor General Atlantic. The company has raised $54.4 million.</p>
<p>The two founders, CEO Martin Mao and CTO Rob Skillington, created the open-source <a href="https://eng.uber.com/m3/">M3 monitoring project</a> while they were working at Uber, and left in 2019 to launch Chronosphere, a startup based on that project. As Mao told me <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/05/chronosphere-launches-with-11m-series-a-to-build-scalable-cloud-native-monitoring-tool/">at the time of the A round</a>, the company wanted to simplify the management of running the open source project:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>M3 itself is a fairly complex piece of technology to run. It is solving a fairly complex problem at large scale, and running it actually requires a decent amount of investment to run at large scale, so the first thing we’re doing is taking care of that management,</p></blockquote>
<p>He said that the company spent most of last year iterating the product and working with beta customers, adding that they certainly benefited from building the commercial service on top of the open-source project.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;re lucky that we have the foundation already from the open-source project, but we really wanted to focus a lot on building a product on top of that technology and really have this product be differentiated, so that was most of the focus of 2020 for us,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="gucbqL0DFf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/ibm-is-acquiring-apm-startup-instana-as-it-continues-to-expand-hybrid-cloud-vision/">IBM is acquiring APM startup Instana as it continues to expand hybrid cloud vision</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;IBM is acquiring APM startup Instana as it continues to expand hybrid cloud vision&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/ibm-is-acquiring-apm-startup-instana-as-it-continues-to-expand-hybrid-cloud-vision/embed/#?secret=gucbqL0DFf" data-secret="gucbqL0DFf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Mao points out that he and Skillington weren&#8217;t looking for this new round of funding as they still had money left from the A round, but the company&#8217;s previous investors approached them and they decided to strike to add additional money to the balance sheet, which would help grow the company, attract employees and help reassure customers they had plenty of capital to continue building the product and the company.</p>
<p>As the company has developed over the last year, it has been adding employees at a rapid clip, growing from 13 at the time of the A round in 2019 to 50 today with plans to double that by the end of next year. Mao says the founders have been thinking about how to build a diverse company from its early days.</p>
<p>&#8220;So [ … ] beginning last year we were making sure we were hiring the right leaders, and the right recruiting team who also care about diversity, then following that we made company-wide goals and targets for both gender and ethnic diversity, and then [we have been] holding ourselves accountable on these particular goals and tracking against them,&#8221; Mao said.</p>
<p>The company has been spread out from the beginning, even before COVID, with offices in Seattle, New York and Lithuania, and that has helped in terms of having a broader base to recruit from. Mao wants to remain mostly remote whenever it&#8217;s possible to return to the office, but maintain hubs on each coast where employees can meet and see each other in person.</p>
<p>With the product generally available today, the company will look to expand its customer base, and with the open-source project to drive interest, they have a proven way to attract new customers to the commercial product.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tile is preparing to introduce a new product this year that will serve as a rival to Apple&#8217;s long-awaited AirTags and other lost item trackers coming to the market, including those from Samsung, TechCrunch has learned. While previous Tile trackers have leveraged Bluetooth to help users locate lost items &#8212; like a misplaced set of keys, for example &#8212; Tile&#8217;s new product will take advantage of UWB (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-wideband">ultra wideband</a>) technology to find the missing items. It will also use augmented reality to help guide users to the lost item&#8217;s location via the Tile mobile app.</p>
<p>Ultra wideband technology is <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/ultra-wideband-information-iph771fd0aad/ios">available</a> on newer iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 models and <a href="https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/27710/20201014/led-samsung-apple-uwb-next-big-smartphone-tech.htm">select Android-powered devices</a>, including more recent devices <a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/10/12/samsung-uwb-tech-xiaomi-smart-home-demo/">from Samsung</a>.</p>
<p>Like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, UWB is a short-range, wireless communication protocol, but one that operates at very high frequencies. It can be used to capture spatial and directional data, which is where it comes in handy to lost item finders, like Tile&#8217;s trackers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple last year <a href="https://www.imore.com/ios-14-developers-can-now-take-advantage-u1-chip-thanks-new-nearby-interaction-framework">began to give third-party developers access</a> to its U1 chip, which uses UWB technology to make the iPhone spatially aware, via its &#8220;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/nearbyinteraction">NearbyInteraction</a>&#8221; framework. Some Android devices also ship with the technology. It&#8217;s unclear to what extent Tile is using the new frameworks with its forthcoming product, and the company is likely under NDA with regard to its work with Apple specifically, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/24/apple-find-my-competition/">per earlier reports</a>.</p>
<p>Based on Tile&#8217;s internal concept art for the device (shown below), Tile&#8217;s UWB model will look similar to its other small trackers, like the Tile Mate and Tile Pro. It will also have a square shape, center button, and flat back to support being mounted using an adhesive. And like other Tile dongles, it can be attached to a keychain.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2092114" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2092114" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2092114" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.03.02-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="458" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.03.02-PM.jpg 1184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.03.02-PM.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.03.02-PM.jpg?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.03.02-PM.jpg?resize=768,518 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.03.02-PM.jpg?resize=680,458 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.03.02-PM.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2092114" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tile concept art</em></p></div></p>
<p>Typically, Tile dongles would be attached to things like keys, remote controls, handbags, duffels, luggage, or other small carry items, or stuck to larger devices like personal electronics or bikes. However, lost items could only be located by way of Bluetooth, when nearby, or via Tile&#8217;s &#8220;community find&#8221; network when further away. The latter leveraged the Tile app installed on its users&#8217; phones to help locate any Tile tracker set to a lost mode, then ping the item&#8217;s owner when the item was found. This has allowed Tile users in the past to locate lost items like those left on an airplane by mistake, for example.</p>
<p>The new Tile tracker, on the other hand, will use UWB to make the finding process easier than before.</p>
<p>Because UWB offers spatial awareness capabilities, it will be able to locate missing items inside or outside, even when you can&#8217;t hear the tracker&#8217;s ring. This could help when the missing item is buried under something &#8212; like a sofa cushion &#8212; or inside something like a dresser drawer, for example. It can also help to find items more easily in a larger space, like a house with multiple floors.</p>
<p>The Tile app, meanwhile, will allow users to launch to an AR-enabled camera view that will help to guide them to the item&#8217;s location using overlays, like directional arrows and an AR view of the item&#8217;s location.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2092113" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2092113" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2092113" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.02.00-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="367" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.02.00-PM.jpg 1814w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.02.00-PM.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.02.00-PM.jpg?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.02.00-PM.jpg?resize=768,414 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.02.00-PM.jpg?resize=680,367 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.02.00-PM.jpg?resize=1536,828 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.02.00-PM.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2092113" class="wp-caption-text"><em><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tile internal concept art</em></p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Per sources familiar with Tile&#8217;s plans, we understand Tile expects to release the new tracker later this year with support for both iOS and Android devices. Pricing is unknown. Tile will still sell its popular Bluetooth-enabled devices, of course, as a good portion of the market does not yet own a UWB-enabled smartphone at this time &#8212; the technology is only found in newer devices.</p>
<p>Though Tile has historically led the market in comparison with other third-party lost item trackers, the company is due to face increased competition in 2021 as new trackers arrive from top smartphone brands, like Samsung and Apple.</p>
<p>At the <a href="https://insights.samsung.com/2020/08/05/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-virtual-event-watch-the-livestream-here-2/">2020 Samsung Galaxy Unpacked virtual event</a>, Samsung discussed its plans to integrate UWB into a new SmartThings Find application. This week, its <a href="https://gizmodo.com/latest-samsung-leak-shows-off-tile-like-bluetooth-track-1845977459">upcoming Samsung Galaxy SmartTag tracker was spotted</a> in images provided to the certification authority NCC. The device very much looks like a Tile tracker, with its square-ish shape and keychain hole, for instance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, according to a new research note from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/04/kuo-airtags-ar-device-2021/?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">Apple will reveal its own Tile competitor, AirTags</a> this year. Apple has already all but confirmed AirTag&#8217;s existence, as it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/apple-accidentally-confirms-the-existence-of-an-unreleased-product-airtags/">even accidentally published references</a> to its lost item tracker in an official support video at one point. <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/04/leaker-shares-final-apple-airtags-design-in-leaked-pairing-animation-video">Leaked images of the AirTags</a> also began to circulate this week, adding fuel to these reports of a &#8220;soon-ish&#8221; AirTags launch.</p>
<p>A UWB-powered tracker could help allow Tile to maintain its position in the market. Tile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/lost-item-finder-tile-expands-partnership-with-comcast-as-apples-competitor-looms/">as of last year</a>, had sold 26 million Tile devices, and was locating around 6 million items per day across 195 countries. Tile&#8217;s website now <a href="https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/about-tile">says</a> its devices reach over 230 countries and territories. With this scale, Tile today leads the market. But Apple&#8217;s AirTags could have a first-party advantage with deep integrations into its &#8220;Find My&#8221; app  &#8212; a concern that was <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/01/17/tile-apple-antitrust-opening-statement/">brought up by Tile in last year&#8217;s antitrust hearings</a> in reference to how Apple wields its platform and market power to overrun competitive businesses.</p>
<p>Tile is not speaking publicly about its plans for a UWB device at this time.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we can’t comment on our product roadmap, we&#8217;re constantly looking to improve our customer experience and solve the pain point of finding lost items,&#8221; a spokesperson for Tile told TechCrunch.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The aggregate fintech venture dataset shows an active sector with global demand from investors, but demand is not even.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the next few weeks, the venture capital industry will compile and release data concerning its Q4 2020 performance, capping a year that saw the world of private capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/30/the-second-wave-of-unicorn-layoffs-is-brutal/">freeze</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/second-quarter-vc-investing-totals-appear-lackluster/">thaw</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/late-stage-deals-made-q3-2020-a-standout-vc-quarter-for-us-based-startups/">burn</a>.</p>
<p>But we can get a peek at a critical part of the VC universe early, thanks to a preview of global <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aax-b20d" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="aax-b20d">fintech <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> investment results <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/fintech-trends-q4-2020/">from CB Insights</a>. The dataset deals with worldwide investments into fintech companies from the start of October through December 12.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Given that the last two weeks of the year are not famous for productivity, the dataset we have should prove representative for this critical slice of the venture capital market. (For our look at the third-quarter fintech VC market, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/fintech-vc-keeps-getting-later-larger-and-more-expensive/">head here</a>.)</p>
<p>To be honest, I didn&#8217;t plan on writing up this data when I first dug into it; I was prepping for later releases, hoping to ground myself ahead of the full numbers. However, the collected results aligned with several themes that cropped up during 2020, making it a representative capstone of sorts concerning the year&#8217;s venture capital market. So it was too interesting to not unpack.</p>
<p>What happened to fintech venture capital investment in Q4 and 2020? Some startup stages and regions did well, but amidst the good news, one of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/24/us-seed-stage-investing-flourished-during-pandemic/">hotter domestic segments of startup land</a> is not set to have a good global year. Let&#8217;s get into the numbers.</p>
<p>A final warning: Although these results are missing a few weeks&#8217; worth of inputs, we believe these numbers will prove more than directionally accurate when all results are tallied and released by the various organs of venture data tracking.</p>
<h2>North America and Europe shine, Asia falls</h2>
<p>Using numbers that include projections for the rest of 2020, it&#8217;s clear that the fintech venture capital world is not equally distributed. If you are reading this in the United States, for example, or the U.K., you might be surprised to learn that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cb-insights" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cb-insights">CB Insights <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> expects global fintech venture capital deal and dollar volume to fall in 2020. Surely not, with all the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/how-robinhood-and-chime-raised-2b-in-the-last-year/">neobank and trading-platform deals we saw</a>?</p>
<p>Yes, actually, because while fintech investment has risen in dollar terms in both North America and Europe, huge declines in Asia have overshadowed results in the other two regions. Here&#8217;s the clip of the preview chart:</p>

					<description><![CDATA["The next social network needs to be a place to hang also when you don’t come for a game session."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The gaming industry has had plenty of watershed moments in 2020 as consumer entertainment habits have shifted in response to the pandemic. One trend has been the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/top-gaming-investors-share-how-the-pandemic-is-reshaping-mmos-and-social-games/">crystallization of MMOs as social entertainment hubs</a> that serve more needs for users than ever before.</p>
<p>Following my survey of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/7-investors-discuss-augmented-reality-and-vr-startup-opportunities-in-2020/">gaming-focused investors on trends in the AR/VR world</a> several months ago, I pinged a handful of investors to tap their thoughts on the shifting trends and opportunities in social gaming.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hope Cochran, <a href="https://www.madrona.com/team-profiles/hope-cochran/">Madrona Venture Group</a></li>
<li>Daniel Li, <a href="https://www.madrona.com/team-profiles/daniel-li/">Madrona Venture Group</a></li>
<li>Niko Bonatsos, <a href="https://www.generalcatalyst.com/team/niko-bonatsos/">General Catalyst</a></li>
<li>Ethan Kurzweil, <a href="https://www.bvp.com/team/ethan-kurzweil">Bessemer Venture Partners</a></li>
<li>Sakib Dadi, <a href="https://www.bvp.com/team/sakib-dadi">Bessemer Venture Partners</a></li>
<li>Jacob Mullins, <a href="https://shastaventures.com/team/jacob-mullins/">Shasta Ventures</a></li>
<li>Alice Lloyd George, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alice-lloyd-george-b6686124/">Rogue</a></li>
<li>Gigi Levy-Weiss, <a href="https://www.nfx.com/team/gigi-levy-weiss/">NFX</a></li>
</ul>
<p>One thing that most investors expressed excitement around was the widening entertainment ambitions of social platforms, as concerts and movie screenings find homes on gaming platforms like Fortnite.</p>
<p>While evolving free-to-play mechanics continue to elevate the experience of single-player titles into something more living and breathing, platforms like Roblox have found areas for growth that seem more unique, developing into destinations for users to communicate and share.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s where culture is created,&#8221; Madrona&#8217;s Daniel Li told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Not all of the respondents shared the belief that a gaming platform like Fortnite would grow to become the next Facebook. General Catalyst&#8217;s Niko Bonatsos pointed to adjacent platforms like Discord or Twitch as the constants that would remain as consumers cycled through different platform ecosystems. Other pointed to the the still-disjointed experience switching between mobile and desktop experiences as a yet-to-be-solved stumbling block.</p>
<p>Building the metaverse and building a popular casual mobile game are two different things. Most investors I talked with emphasized how much the pace of scaling has accelerated across categories though with breakout hits rising faster than ever while disasters seem to grow evident just as quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that you look at Among Us, and Cyberpunk on the other side, anything can happen much faster and more extreme than it used to be just because of distribution,&#8221; Rogue VC&#8217;s Alice Lloyd George told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Read below for the full answers; some responses have been edited for length and clarity.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Hope Cochran and Daniel Li, Madrona Venture Group</h2>
<p><b>The idea that the next big social network will be an MMO seems to be a trendy take in the VC world, what are the roadblocks to this actually happening?</b></p>
<p><strong>Daniel Li:</strong> Hope and I were trading some notes and part of our thesis is that gaming is the future of social and for Gen Z, gaming is replacing not just old games, but it&#8217;s replacing TV and Netflix. So instead of going to watch music videos on YouTube, you&#8217;re going to a concert in Roblox and that&#8217;s a social experience with your friend … instead of going to the mall, now you&#8217;re in Roblox. It&#8217;s where kids are hanging out and it&#8217;s where culture is created.</p>
<p><strong>Hope Cochran:</strong> And in COVID, it&#8217;s the only place where they can hang out and I think the gaming industry has done a really fabulous job creating another social engagement that we need right now. I don&#8217;t want to focus too much on kids, but parents are becoming more accepting of their kids in the games because there is this social engagement and, for instance, I can see that my child is upstairs connecting with his four best friends. They log in together and they play. They normally might be out on a soccer field but they can&#8217;t right now so I think parents are becoming a little more comfortable saying, &#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s playing with his friends.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Gaming has seemingly become a more “mainstream” area for investment, as someone who has been in the space a bit, what&#8217;s different about investing in the gaming sector?</b></p>
<p><strong>HC:</strong> It&#8217;s very hard to find that balance between creative or understanding what might become a hit and a real business mind. So my experience has been that when you look into a gaming company as an investor, it&#8217;s actually more driven by math, stats and analytics, and then you have a core team who has the creative juices, so I try to look for that kind of dynamic.</p>
<p>So, who is developing what the users will love and who is analyzing it and how are they responding to what the users are loving. I do think there&#8217;s a point where a team develops a game and it&#8217;s mostly a creative process but then you have to kind of toggle to the analytics. It&#8217;s where the mathematicians meet the magicians and there needs to be a combination of that within every game.</p>
<p><b>What’s different about how popular games and MMOs are scaling these days? Have you seen any interesting growth hacks or strategies that seem promising?</b></p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> I think there are more and more of these cultural memes that just seem to come out of nowhere, like Among Us kind of just sat there for two years and streamers started picking it up and now it&#8217;s super popular. I&#8217;d say for nearly all of those, they&#8217;re going to be a social category of games, you don&#8217;t see a game like Cyberpunk come out of nowhere without any marketing dollars behind it.</p>
<p>So I do think one of those new channels is getting influencers to talk about your games, and typically I think for those it&#8217;s not actually the big influencers picking it up, it&#8217;s a whole bunch of small influencers all starting to play a game and have it start to build up steam that way. It&#8217;s more likely the Call of Duty&#8217;s that can hire the big streamers and pay them millions of bucks to play a new game, but I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a new to go-to-market for smaller studios around that.</p>
<p><b>How can MMOs, which feel like fundamentally active experiences, provide a better passive experience for users that may be more interested in the community than playing a first-person shooter or battle royale? How do games become more approachable to a wider audience?</b></p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> A lot of people are saying these single-player games aren&#8217;t really fun games anymore, they&#8217;re just like cinematic experiences. Like playing Cyberpunk for 60 hours versus binge-watching three TV series, it&#8217;s definitely a different experience. The thing that&#8217;s actually more interesting here is the virtual events that are happening inside these games. Thinking about what the next Twitch looks like, it&#8217;s probably some kind of experience where you&#8217;re inside the game doing something more passive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">Pokémon GO creator Niantic has acquired a small SF gaming startup building a league and tournament organization platform to help gamers create their own communities around popular titles.</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><a href="https://mayhem.gg/">Mayhem</a> was in Y Combinator&#8217;s winter 2018 batch and went onto raise $5.7 million in funding according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mayhem-gg/company_financials">Crunchbase</a>. Other backers include Accel, which led the startup’s Series A in 2018, Afore Capital and NextGen Venture Partners.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s focus has shifted quite a bit since its initial YC debut, when it announced a service called Visor that would analyze video of esports gameplay and coach users on how they could improve their performance. The company has seemed to shift its focus wholly to community tools to help gamers find matches and organize tournaments for games like Overwatch on its platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Terms of the acquisition weren’t disclosed by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nianticlabs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nianticlabs">Niantic <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>The “majority” of Mayhem’s team will be joining <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nianticlabs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nianticlabs">Niantic <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with the startup’s CEO Ivan Zhou landing in the company’s Social Platform Product team while the rest of the team joins Platform Engineering.</p>
<p>In a statement, Niantic asserts that the acquisition “reinforces our commitment to real-world social as the centerpiece of our mission.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/the-niantic-ec-1/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ec-1-niantic-read-more.jpg?w=300" alt="Read a deep dive of Niantic on Extra Crunch" width="300" height="160" /></a></p>
<p>Most of Niantic’s acquisitions of late have focused on augmented reality backend technologies so it’s interesting to see them buying tech that focuses on community organization.</p>
<p>Pokémon GO continues to be Niantic’s cash cow though the company hasn’t seen the same levels of viral success with subsequent releases where organic growth hasn’t been quite as easy to come by. Buying a startup building community tools suggests the company is ready to bring in some outside tech to push their own efforts forward as they strive to create a broader platform for their AR ambitions and more standalone hits of their own.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There’s a decent chance you missed the news back in May &#8212; there was, after all, a lot going on at the time. General Electric sold off its more than 100-year-old <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ge-power-ag" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ge-power-ag">GE <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Lighting division to smart home company Savant. Today, the division’s new owner is announcing a key rebranding effort, six months after the initial deal.</p>
<p>Clearly there’s still value in the GE name, even divorced of its original parent company. In its new home, the C by GE line is getting a rebrand, however. Seems totally reasonable &#8212; C by GE was never the most straightforward name. Going forward, the line will be rebranded as “Cync” &#8212; which, if not better is, at the very least different.</p>
<p>Along with the change in ownership, the name connotes a broadening of scope &#8212; that much was probably an inevitability under Savant. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ge-lighting" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ge-lighting">GE Lighting <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is becoming a larger smart home brand in its new home. CES, which kicks off next week, will find the company introducing a new thermostat and a range of outdoor products, including a new smart plug. The brand will also introduce a connected camera and fan speed switch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new products will test the value of the GE Lighting brand name, both outside of General Electric and beyond just lighting. The smart home category is already a crowded one (and has been for years), and Savant’s going up against offerings from big names like Amazon’s Ring.</p>
<p>The new Cync app will arrive in March, bringing with it “a more user-friendly and customizable experience that enhances comfort, control and confidence,” according to Savant. More news next week at CES.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In an unexpected turn, the New York Stock Exchange <a href="https://ir.theice.com/press/news-details/2021/NYSE-Updates-Guidance-on-Delisting-Determination-for-Securities-of-Three-Issuers-in-Relation-to-Executive-Order-13959--/default.aspx">said</a> Monday that it no longer intends to delist China&#8217;s three major telecoms operators, a decision that was originally announced on December 31.</p>
<p>The initial action targeted China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom as part of the Trump administration&#8217;s move to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-securities-investments-finance-communist-chinese-military-companies/">bar investment in companies</a> deemed to supply and support China’s military, intelligence and security services.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/ccmc/ns-ccmc_list.pdf">current blacklist</a> names 35 companies, including the parent organizations of the three listed telecoms firms as well as Huawei and China&#8217;s major chipmaker SMIC.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The reversal was made &#8220;in light of further consultation with relevant regulatory authorities,&#8221; said the exchange. The companies will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE while the exchange continues to evaluate how the executive order applies to them and their listing status, according to the announcement.</p>
<p>The delisting of the three telecoms giants, which have been trading on NYSE for about two decades, was seen by some experts as merely symbolic. The trading volumes of these firms in New York are only a small percentage of their total tradable shares, thus the impact of the potential delisting &#8220;would be rather limited on the companies’ growth and general market performance,&#8221; <a href="http://www.csrc.gov.cn/pub/csrc_en/newsfacts/release/202101/t20210103_390001.html">said</a> the China Securities Regulatory Commission in a statement issued on Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The recent move by some political forces in the U.S. to continuously and groundlessly suppress foreign companies listed on the U.S. markets, even at the cost of undermining its own position in the global capital markets, has demonstrated that U.S. rules and institutions can become arbitrary, reckless and unpredictable,&#8221; the Chinese exchange authority said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope that the U.S. side could show respect for the market and reverence for the rule of law, do more things that can benefit the order of global financial markets, the legitimate rights of investors, and the stability and development of the global economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>In recent times, a number of Chinese companies trading in the U.S. have opted for secondary listings in Hong Kong. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/27/alibaba-second-listing-hong-kong/">Alibaba</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-jd-com-listing-idUKKBN23I05W">JD.com</a> and NetEase have debuted in Hong Kong and more tech companies are reportedly weighing their homecoming. Chinese tech bosses are wary of the U.S. government&#8217;s potential clampdown, but they also hope to replicate Alibaba&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/27/alibaba-second-listing-hong-kong/">success in Hong Kong</a> and see funding opportunities in China&#8217;s new<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/china-new-tech-board/"> Nasdaq-style board</a>, which was introduced in 2019 in part to lure its tech darlings home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Using Xiami was once synonymous with having good music taste in China. The music app, which debuted around 2008 and was <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/rumor-alibaba-acquires-social-music-site-xiami">acquired by Alibaba in 2013</a>, is discontinuing its streaming service today, Xiami said in a <a href="https://h5.xiami.com/app/xiami-frontend/xm-announcement/index/index.html">notice</a> to users.</p>
<p>Xiami, which means &#8220;small shrimp&#8221; in Chinese, was once known for its smart discovery, elegant design, social features and support for indie musicians, which helped attract a loyal following among China&#8217;s artsy, hipster types. The beginning of its decline coincided with the battle for music rights in China. A digital music behemoth was formed in 2016 when <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tencent-to-buy-majority-stake-in-china-music-corp-creating-streaming-giant-1468470851">Tencent bought a majority stake in China Music Group</a>, which brought to Tencent a reservoir of exclusive music deals. By 2017, Tencent&#8217;s music apps <a href="https://radiichina.com/how-tencents-empire-is-making-music-pay/">controlled as much as 75%</a> of China&#8217;s music streaming market.</p>
<p>Xiami, on the other hand, lost large quantities of music rights and, consequently, users, who converted to more resource-rich platforms, albeit grudgingly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alibaba did have a shot at online music. In 2015, the e-commerce giant <a href="https://www.alizila.com/alibaba-names-renowned-musician-gao-xiaosong-run-music-unit-2/">appointed</a> two renowned industry veterans &#8212; a songwriter and a music company executive &#8212; to steer its newly minted music group. Neither was necessarily seen as having the experience for running an internet music business. Instead of growing Xiami, they poured resources into a platform called Alibaba Planet to build artist-fan relationships. The idea didn&#8217;t take off.</p>
<p>In the meantime, newcomers like NetEase Music are holding out in their battle against Tencent&#8217;s music empire, of which dominance has endured to this day.</p>
<p>While users will lose access to the app and all their data, Xiami is not totally dead. Its copyrights-focused segment Yin Luo (音螺 or Conch Music) will continue to operate, according to the notice. But the dream of Xiami&#8217;s utopian founders, &#8220;earn music &amp; money&#8221; (hence the app&#8217;s original name &#8220;EMUMO&#8221;), a vision they laid out inside a café on a snowy day in Hangzhou, is surely gone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a dismal year, the global smartphone market will slowly start recovering in 2021, <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20210105-10630.html">predicts TrendForce</a>. But Huawei won’t benefit and, in fact, will fall out of the research firm’s list of the world’s top six smartphone makers by production volume.</p>
<p>In 2020, global smartphone production dropped 11% year-over-year to 1.25 billion units. This year, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/trendforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="trendforce">TrendForce <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> expects it to increase by 9% to 1.36 million units, as people replace old devices and demand grows in emerging markets. But even that slight recovery is contingent on how the pandemic continues to impact the economy and the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/news/picture/analysis-global-chip-shortage-threatens-idUSKBN28R0ZL">global chip shortage</a> that is currently causing production delays across almost the entire electronics industry.</p>
<p>In 2020, the top six smartphone brands in order of production volume were Samsung, Apple, Huawei, Xiaomi, OPPO and Vivo. But this year TrendForce expects Huawei to slip out of that ranking, with the new top-six list comprising Samsung, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, Vivo and Transsion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Those six companies are expected to account for 80% of the global smartphone market in 2021, while Huawei will come in at seventh place.</p>
<p>The main reason for Huawei’s drop is the divestment of its budget smartphone brand, Honor. Huawei confirmed in November that it is selling Honor to a consortium of companies to save the division’s supply chain from the impact of United States government trade restrictions.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TBT8EEIfs4"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/huawei-sells-budget-phone-unit-honor-to-government-distribution-partners/">Huawei sells budget phone unit Honor to state-backed firms, distribution partners</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Huawei sells budget phone unit Honor to state-backed firms, distribution partners&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/huawei-sells-budget-phone-unit-honor-to-government-distribution-partners/embed/#?secret=TBT8EEIfs4" data-secret="TBT8EEIfs4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The spin-out was meant to shield Honor from the sanctions that have hurt Huawei’s business. But &#8220;it remains to be seen whether the ‘new’ Honor can capture consumers’ attention without the support from Huawei. Also, Huawei and the new Honor will be directly competing against each other in the future, especially if the former is somehow freed from the U.S. trade sanctions at a later time,&#8221; said TrendForce’s report.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20201124-10565.html">previous report</a> published shortly after Honor’s sale was announced, TrendForce predicted that the deal, along with the global chip shortage, meant Huawei would take just 4% of the market in 2021, compared to the 17% it held in 2019, and estimated 14% in 2020. Apple is expected to take away some market share from Huawei’s high-end smartphones, while Xiaomi, OPPO and Vivo will also benefit. TrendForce expects the newly spun-out Honor to take 2% market share in 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SVB Financial Group agreed today to buy <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/boston-private-financial-holdings" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="boston-private-financial-holdings">Boston Private Financial Holdings <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> in Boston for $900 million in cash and stock.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big deal for SVB, which has earned a reputation over its 37-year history as a bank that&#8217;s friendly to startups, as well as venture and private equity investors. Boston Private, founded in 1987, has roughly $<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201021005941/en/Boston-Private-Reports-Third-Quarter-2020-Results">16.3 billion</a> in assets under management, compared with SVB Asset Management&#8217;s $1.4 billion in related assets.</p>
<p>SVB, which formed its wealth advisory business in 2011, has been pushing more aggressively into wealth management for several years, hiring Yvette Butler, who&#8217;d previously led wealth strategies at Capital One, in the middle of 2018.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Butler has since been adding members to the bank&#8217;s wealth management team, telling Business Insider last year that &#8220;I see my job primarily as a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-bank-expanding-private-bank-and-wealth-advisory-businesses-2020-1">retention strategy</a> . . .Clients are already here. We&#8217;ve helped them grow their fund or business — and I see our role as private bank and wealth advisory as retaining.&#8221;</p>
<p>Underscoring SVB&#8217;s bid to strengthen its relationship with wealthy individuals who already have business dealings with the bank, Greg Becker, its president and CEO, said today in a release about the new tie-up: &#8220;Our clients rely on us to help increase the probability of their success — both in their business and personal lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Butler will lead the combined private banking and wealth management business with Anthony DeChellis, who has been the CEO of Boston Private for the last two years. DeChellis joined the outfit after a short stint as president of the crowdfunding platform OurCrowd and before that, as the CEO of Credit Suisse Private Banking (Americas) for more than seven years.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Boston Private shareholders will receive 0.0228 shares of SVB common stock and $2.10 of cash for each of their shares.</p>
<p>Bank stocks were generally battered in 2020, but as the Boston Globe <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/01/04/business/boston-private-be-acquired-by-svb-financial-900-million/">notes</a>, SVB&#8217;s stock is up more than 60% over the past three years because of its focus on the tech world, while Boston Private&#8217;s shares have fallen by 45%.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world&#8217;s attention is on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/jack-ma" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="jack-ma">Jack Ma&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> whereabouts after reports noted the billionaire founder of Alibaba and Ant Group had been absent from public view since late October.</p>
<p>On October 24, Ma delivered fiery remarks against China&#8217;s financial system to an audience of high-ranking officials. Days later the Chinese authorities abruptly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">halted Ant&#8217;s initial public offering</a>, an act believed to be linked to Ma&#8217;s controversial speech. The Chinese government subsequently told the fintech behemoth, which had thrived in a relatively lax regulatory environment, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/27/ant-group-financial-clampdown/">&#8220;rectify&#8221; its business</a> according to the law. The future of Ant hangs in the air.</p>
<p>Concurrently, Chinese regulators have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/alibaba-antitrust-probe/">launched an unprecedented probe</a> into Alibaba over suspected monopolistic behavior.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ma is known for his outspoken personality and love for the limelight, so it&#8217;s no surprise that his missing from recent events, including the final episode of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-04/jack-ma-skips-cherished-tv-show-after-beijing-tightens-screws">an African TV program he created</a>, is sparking widespread chatter. From economists to journalists, the Twitter world has tuned in:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;Regarding the Africa&#8217;s Business Heroes competition, Mr. Ma had to miss the finale due to a schedule conflict,&#8221; an Alibaba spokesperson said.</p>
<p>While China&#8217;s Twitter equivalent Weibo has not blocked searching for &#8220;Jack Ma missing,&#8221; the posts it surfaced barely have any likes or reposts. Elsewhere on the Chinese internet, users are speculating inside WeChat groups that Ma was either &#8220;made vanished&#8221; or has fled the country.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Ma has long stepped back from day-to-day operations at Alibaba. In September 2019, he officially handed his helm as the company&#8217;s chairman <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/09/jack-ma-officially-retires-as-alibabas-chairman/">to his successor Daniel Zhang</a>. That said, the billionaire still holds considerable sway over the e-commerce business as a lifetime partner at the so-called <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/article?news=p180910">Alibaba Partnership</a>, a group comprising senior management ranks who can nominate a majority of the directors to the board.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not unusual to see Chinese tycoons choosing to lie low in tough times. After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/16/richard-liu-accused-of-rape/">Richard Liu was accused of rape</a>, the flamboyant founder of JD.com, Alibaba&#8217;s archrival, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/2188891/jdcom-founder-richard-liu-no-show-chinas-biggest-political-event-despite">skipped</a> a key political event in China last year. Tencent founder Pony Ma, who already keeps a low profile, has been absent from the public eye for about a year, though the cause is his chronic &#8220;back problems,&#8221; a source told TechCrunch, and the tech boss has made <a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_8474608">virtual appearances</a> at events by sending voice messages in the past year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Steel production accounts for roughly 8% of the emissions that contribute to global climate change. It is one of the industries that sits at the foundation of the modern economy and is one of the most resistant to decarbonization.</p>
<p>As nations around the world race to reduce their environmental footprint and embrace more sustainable methods of production, finding a way to remove carbon from the metals business will be one of the most important contributions to that effort.</p>
<p>One startup that&#8217;s developing a new technology to address the issue is <a href="https://www.bostonmetal.com/">Boston Metal</a>. Previously backed by the Bill Gates-financed Breakthrough Energy Ventures fund, the new company has just raised roughly $50 million of an approximately $60 million financing round to expand its operations, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1763149/000176314921000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The global steel industry may find approximately 14% of its potential value at risk if the business can&#8217;t reduce its environmental impact, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/decarbonization-challenge-for-steel#">according to studies cited by the consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co.</a></p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/boston-metal" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="boston-metal">Boston Metal, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which previously raised $20 million back in 2019, uses a process called molten oxide electrolysis (&#8220;MOE&#8221;) to make steel alloys &#8212; and eventually emissions-free steel. The first close of the funding actually came in December 2018 &#8212; two years before the most recent financing round, according to Tadeu Carneiro, the company&#8217;s chief executive.</p>
<p>Over the years since the company raised its last round, Boston Metal has grown from eight employees to a staff that now numbers close to 50. The Woburn, Massachusetts-based company has also been able to continuously operate its three pilot lines producing metal alloys for over a month at a time.</p>
<p>And while the steel program remains the ultimate goal, the company is quickly approaching commercialization with its alloy program, because it isn&#8217;t as reliant on traditional infrastructure and sunk costs according to Carneiro.</p>
<p>Boston Metal&#8217;s technology radically reimagines an industry whose technology hasn&#8217;t changed all that much since the dawn of the Iron Age in 1200 BCE, Carneiro said.</p>
<p>Ultimately the goal is to serve as a technology developer licensing its technology and selling components to steel manufacturers or engineering companies that will ultimately make the steel.</p>
<p>For Boston Metal, the next steps on the product road map are clear. The company will look to have a semi-industrial cell line operating in Woburn by the end of 2022, and by 2024 or 2025 hopes to have its first demonstration plant up and running. &#8220;At that point we will be able to commercialize the technology,&#8221; Carneiro said.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s previous investors include <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/breakthrough-energy-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="breakthrough-energy-ventures">Breakthrough Energy Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Prelude Ventures and the MIT-backed &#8220;hard-tech&#8221; investment firm, <a href="https://www.engine.xyz/">The Engine</a>. All of them came back to invest in the latest infusion of cash into the company along with Devonshire Investors, the private investment firm affiliated with FMR, the parent company of financial services giant, Fidelity, which co-led the deal alongside Piva Capital and another, undisclosed investor.</p>
<p>As a result of its investment, Shyam Kamadolli will take a seat on the company&#8217;s board, according to the filing with the SEC.</p>
<p>MOE takes metals in their raw oxide form and transforms them into molten metal products. Invented at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and based on research from MIT Professor Donald Sadoway, Boston Metal makes molten oxides that are tailored for a specific feedstock and product. Electrons are used to melt the soup and selectively reduce the target oxide. The purified metal pools at the bottom of a cell and is tapped by drilling into the cell using a process adapted from a blast furnace. The tap hole is plugged and the process then continues.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of the technology, according to the company, is its scalability. As producers need to make more alloys, they can increase production capacity.</p>
<p>“Molten oxide electrolysis is a platform technology that can produce a wide array of metals and alloys, but our first industrial deployments will target the ferroalloys on the path to our ultimate goal of steel,” said Carneiro, the company&#8217;s chief executive, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190110005097/en/Boston-Metal-Raises-20M-to-Deliver-Industrial-Scale-Electrolysis-Solution-for-High-Volume-Ferroalloys-Production">in a statement announcing the company&#8217;s $20 million financing back in 2019</a>. “Steel is and will remain one of the staples of modern society, but the production of steel today produces over two gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub>. The same fundamental method for producing steel has been used for millennia, but Boston Metal is breaking that paradigm by replacing coal with electrons.”</p>
<p>No less a tech luminary than <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/bill-gates" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="bill-gates">Bill Gates <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> himself underlined the importance of the decarbonization of the metal business.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="https://www.bostonmetal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boston Metal</a> is working on a way to make steel using electricity instead of coal, and to make it just as strong and cheap,&#8221; Gates wrote in his blog,<a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/A-question-to-ask-about-every-climate-plan"> GatesNotes</a>. Although Gates did have a caveat. &#8220;Of course, electrification only helps reduce emissions if it uses clean power, which is another reason why it’s so important to get <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/A-critical-step-to-reduce-climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zero-carbon electricity,</a>&#8221; he wrote.</p>

This is your Daily Crunch for January 4, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Hundreds of Google and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/alphabet" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="alphabet">Alphabet <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> employees unionize</strong></p>
<p>More than 200 employees at Google and its parent company Alphabet have announced that they have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/google-alphabet-employees-union/">formed the Alphabet Workers Union</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Obviously, that&#8217;s only a tiny fraction of Alphabet&#8217;s workforce of more than 130,000 employees. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html">according to The New York Times</a>, the group is a &#8220;minority union&#8221; designed to give more structure to employee activism, rather than one that negotiates for a contract. And it will also be open to contractors.</p>
<p>“This is historic—the first union at a major tech company by and for all tech workers,” said Google software engineer Dylan Baker in a statement. “We will elect representatives, we will make decisions democratically, we will pay dues, and we will hire skilled organizers to ensure all workers at Google know they can work with us if they actually want to see their company reflect their values.”</p>
<p><strong>The tech giants</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/its-not-just-you-slack-is-struggling-this-morning/">It’s not just you, Slack is struggling this morning</a> — Precisely when the downtime began is not clear, though problems amongst the TechCrunch staff began a little after 10 a.m. Eastern time.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/venmo-adds-a-check-cashing-feature-waives-fees-for-stimulus-checks/">Venmo adds a check-cashing feature, waives fees for stimulus checks</a> — The feature can be used to cash printed, payroll and U.S. government checks, including the new stimulus checks.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/03/samsungs-galaxy-s21-debuts-january-14/">Samsung’s next Unpacked event is January 14</a> — This one&#8217;s called &#8220;Welcome to the Everyday Epic.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has acquired social broadcasting app Breaker, the companies announced today via a combination of blog posts and tweets. The deal will see Breaker&#8217;s team joining Twitter to help &#8220;improve the health of the public conversation&#8221; on the service, as well as work on Twitter&#8217;s new audio-based networking project, Twitter Spaces. The Breaker app, however, will shut down on January 15, 2021.</p>
<p>Breaker announced the acquisition <a href="https://blog.breaker.audio/the-breaker-team-is-joining-twitter-f8c1721d66c6">on its company blog</a>, explaining why it believes its team will be a good fit at Twitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here at Breaker, we’re truly passionate about audio communication and we’re inspired by the ways Twitter is facilitating public conversations for people around the world,&#8221; wrote Breaker CEO Erik Berlin. &#8220;We’re impressed by the entrepreneurial spirit at Twitter and enthusiastic about the new experiences that the team is creating.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Breaker was founded in 2016 and is <a href="https://www.breaker.audio/i/about">led by both</a> CEO Berlin, previously the founder and CTO at social advertising company 140 Proof (which sold to Acuity), and CTO Leah Culver, who previously founded Pownce and Grove and co-authored web technologies OAuth and oEmbed.</p>
<p>The app had launched at a time when podcasts were still very much thought of as audio feeds and podcast apps as productivity tools &#8212; not experiences around which a community could be built. Breaker helped to change that perception by offering an app where users could like and comment on episodes, discover new podcasts by following friends, share favorite shows to social media and much more.</p>
<p>According to Culver&#8217;s tweet, she&#8217;ll be joining Twitter with a focus on Twitter Spaces, Twitter&#8217;s audio-based social networking product and Clubhouse rival. Spaces lets Twitter users chat in real time using voice instead of text, as they do today. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-launches-its-voice-based-spaces-social-networking-feature-into-beta-testing/">new product entered beta testing in December.</a> Twitter is currently trying to work out not only the technical issues and bugs with the feature, but also the more complex issues that arise from hosting live audio, including moderation.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In a separate <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelmontano/status/1346213222416850944">tweet</a>, Twitter Engineering lead Michael Montano confirmed that Berlin, Culver and Breaker designer Emma Lundin will all be moving to Twitter as a result of the deal.</p>
<p>He also praised both Berlin and Culver&#8217;s entrepreneurial spirit as well as Culver&#8217;s push for open standards over the years.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Reached for comment, Twitter pointed to Montano&#8217;s tweet but offered no further details on the acquisition, price or broader plans.</p>
<p>Breaker says it will close in a matter of days its apps and services it built over the past years.</p>
<p>On January 15, 2021, Breaker will shut down for good. Up until that point, Breaker users will be able to export their OPML file to transfer their subscriptions to another podcasting app. Breaker recommends apps like Apple, Spotify, Stitcher, Overcast, Pocket Casts or Castro as an alternative. For those hosting a podcast on Breaker, these can be transferred elsewhere via the RSS feed.</p>
<p>The Breaker acquisition adds to a string of recent podcast M&amp;A activity. But unlike recent deals that involved podcast content, Breaker’s sale is made up of staff and technology, not podcasts themselves. This maps to Twitter’s general focus on collating content from others instead of making its own.</p>
<p>The Breaker deal, with its unannounced price, feels modest. Which means that while the company’s exit to Big Tweet is another point on the board for podcasting companies finding their way to some sort of payout, it fits the general narrative that podcasting services and podcasting content only has so much value.</p>
<p>The acquisition follows other podcast content deals in recent weeks and months, including <a href="https://www.tubefilter.com/2020/12/30/amazon-acquires-wondery-podcast/">Amazon&#8217;s $300 million acquisition of Wondery</a>, <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/sirius-xm-to-buy-stitcher-podcast-service-for-300-million-report/">Sirius buying Stitcher for $300 million</a>, not to mention all the content deals Spotify has picked up as of late.</p>
<p>That another podcast service sold for around $300 million has become a running joke. That number, while impressive-sounding to the individual, is not the sort of exit that venture capitalists target. The Breaker-Twitter tie-up, then, doesn’t push back on the idea that building a company focused on podcasting is to admit to a future that will have capped future upside.</p>
<p>Whether venture capitalists pull back from podcasting investments in 2021 is not yet clear, but Breaker’s sale does little to argue that private investors shouldn’t.</p>
<p>The real winner in the Breaker deal is Twitter, as it gains key talent as it enters what is shaping up to be a buzzy new market in 2021 for voice-based social networking &#8212; an idea whose time has come, perhaps, thanks to people being stuck at home amid a pandemic. Without conferences and parties to attend, many went in search of better ways to connect online.</p>
<p>But it remains to be seen if Twitter &#8212; a service that has publicly struggled with online toxicity and moderation failures &#8212; will be able to make audio networking a safe place for users to chat, or if it will amplify Twitter&#8217;s existing challenges in these areas. It also remains to be seen if voice-based networking will have a future in a reopened, post-COVID world where we can once again meet others in real-world, public places, instead of Twitter Spaces.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The lure of subscription pricing is the guarantee of recurring revenue for your business. Once a customer flips the switch to turn on your subscription, it&#8217;s easy money:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to recognize your revenue.</li>
<li>Easy to determine your margins and profits.</li>
<li>Easy to enhance your product and extend that revenue out for months, even years.</li>
</ul>
<p>While that&#8217;s true, converting a subscription customer isn&#8217;t as simple as flipping a switch. You can build a platform, launch with fanfare, offer all sorts of incentives and trials to attract potential customers — and watch as they disengage and lapse into limbo.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Contrary to popular belief, subscription pricing doesn&#8217;t work because of the lower price point that a monthly installment allows.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the actual guarantee that comes with subscription pricing, which will happen unless you cultivate a funnel that catches potential subscribers as soon as they learn about your product and follows them until their very last sign-in.</p>
<p>I built my first subscription-model product in 1999. I&#8217;m currently in early-access on my latest, and I&#8217;ve launched a bunch more along the way.</p>
<p>While the customer dynamic has changed over the last 20 years, the conversion process has not. In fact, it&#8217;s actually gotten easier to convert and retain customers through the subscription funnel.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve learned.</p>
<h2>Why subscription pricing works</h2>
<p>Subscription pricing is a hot trend in just about every business in every industry. Pay-as-you-go is the new normal from software to retail to service.</p>
<p>In my mind, the major shift occurred when mobile phones started pricing unlimited usage per period instead of fixed or cost per minute. Once usage limits were removed, use cases exploded and the promise of a truly mobile computer was finally realized.</p>
<p>Makers of all stripes learned that lesson: From razors to video streaming to accounting software, pricing models have emerged that focus on time periods instead of units.</p>
<p>But contrary to popular belief, subscription pricing doesn&#8217;t work because of the lower price point that a monthly installment allows. It&#8217;s effective because a subscription reorients each customer&#8217;s mind from product function to value proposition.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care what kind of German engineering went into my razor blades, <strong>as long as I have working blades when I need them.</strong></p>
<p>As an entrepreneur, you probably use at least one digital subscription service to build your own product and company, if not several. In fact, just to get to the MVP of my new project, I subscribed to AWS, MailChimp, Zapier and Bubble. I&#8217;m still on the free tier of a few more services for some lower-priority features. There&#8217;s a few more I quit or never tried.</p>
<p>Thus, you know that value prop plays a big part of whether the customer will pay and stay. So reinforcing your value proposition should play a big part in every level of your customer funnel.</p>
<h2>You must catch and track customers to be effective</h2>
<p>A subscription-pricing model without an ability to track the steps in the conversion funnel will result in all the headaches of subscription pricing without any of the benefits.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">From COVID-19’s curve to election polls, public temperature checks to stimulus checks, 2020 was dominated by numbers — the guiding compass of any self-respecting venture capital investor.</p>
<p>As a VC exclusively focused on investments in Israeli cybersecurity, the numbers that guide us have become some of the most interesting to watch over the course of the past year.</p>
<p>The start of a new year presents the perfect opportunity to reflect on the annual performance of Israel&#8217;s cybersecurity ecosystem and prepare for what the next twelve months of innovation will bring. With the global cybersecurity market outperforming this year’s panic-stricken expectations, we carefully combed through the figures to see how Israel’s market, its strongest performer, compared — and predict what it has in store.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The cybersecurity market continues to draw the confidence of investors, who appear to recognize its heightened importance during times of crisis.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The “cyber nation” not only remained strong throughout the pandemic, but even saw a rise in fundraising, especially around application and cloud security, following the emergence of remote workflow security gaps brought on by social distancing. Encouraged by this, investors have demonstrated committed enthusiasm to its growth and M&amp;A landscape.</p>
<p>Emboldened by the sector’s overall strength and new opportunities, today’s Israeli visionaries are developing stronger convictions to build larger companies; many of them, already successful entrepreneurs, are making their own bets in the industry as serial entrepreneurs and angel investors.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2092025" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2092025" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2092025" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/YLventuresinfographic.jpg" alt="YL VEntures state of the cyber nation infographic" width="1024" height="630" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/YLventuresinfographic.jpg 1430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/YLventuresinfographic.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/YLventuresinfographic.jpg?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/YLventuresinfographic.jpg?resize=768,473 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/YLventuresinfographic.jpg?resize=680,418 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/YLventuresinfographic.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2092025" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.ylventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YL Ventures <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The numbers also reveal how investors are increasingly concentrating their funds on larger seed rounds for serial entrepreneurs and the foremost industry trends. More than $2.75 billion was poured into the industry this year to back companies across all stages, a 97% increase from last year’s $1.39 billion. If its long-term slope is any indication, we can only expect it to continue to grow.</p>
<p>However, though they clearly indicate progress, the numbers still make the need for a demographic reset clear. Like the rest of the industry, Israel’s cybersecurity ecosystem must adapt to the pace of change set out by this year’s social movements, and the time has long passed for true diversity and gender representation in cybersecurity leadership.</p>
<h2><strong>Seed rounds reveal fascinating shifts</strong></h2>
<p>As the market’s biggest leaders garner experience and expertise, the bar for entry to Israel’s cybersecurity startup ecosystem has gradually risen over the years. However, this did not appear to impact this year’s entrepreneurial breakthroughs. 58% of Israel’s newly founded cybersecurity companies received seed rounds this year, totaling 64 seeded companies in 2020 compared with last year’s 61. The total number of newly founded companies increased by 5%, reversing last year’s downward trend.</p>
<p>The amount invested at seed hit an all-time high as average deal size in 2020 increased by 11%, amounting to an average of $5.2 million per deal. This continues an upward trend in average seed rounds, which have surged over the last four years due to sizable year-on-year increases. It also provides further support for a shift toward higher caliber seed rounds with a strategically focused and “all-in” approach. In other words, founders that meet the new bar for entry are raising bigger rounds for more ambitious visions.</p>

<h2><strong>Where is the money going?</strong></h2>
<p>2020 proved an exceptional year for application security and cloud security startups. Perhaps the runaway successes of Snyk and Checkmarx left strong impressions. This year saw an explosive 140% increase in application security company seed investments (such as Enso Security, build.security and CloudEssence), as well as a whopping 200% increase in cloud security seed investments (like Solvo and DoControl), from last year.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another week, another email newsletter. This time, the story is <a href="https://punchbowl.news">Punchbowl</a>, a politics-centric newsletter founded by a crop of recent Politico alums including Jake Sherman, Anna Palmer and John Bresnahan. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/03/business/media/punchbowl-playbook-capitol-hill-politics.html">Ben Smith has the story</a>, as does Maxwell Tani at the Daily Beast with <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/inside-the-politico-playbook-shake-up-jake-sherman-and-anna-palmers-exit">some more juicy details</a>.</p>
<p>Why do we need another newsletter analyzing Beltway politics in a world of Politico Playbook, Axios, The Daily 202 and a hundred others? In fact, why do we need the voluminous output of tech-oriented newsletters covering startups (by my count, there are at least several thousand newsletters covering our industry)? Why, in a media world that was supposed to be all about the long-tail, does it seem that every new media startup is targeting the same single niche over and over again?</p>
<p>That’s where the cauldrons of gold come in. Media is not unlike many startup markets — there may be infinite needs for diverse products, but there are only a handful of those needs that have serious dollars attached to them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In media, these are beats like DC politics, or investment banking / M&amp;A, or VC coverage in our quaint little world of startups, where the winners get to own massive audiences and, by extension, massive dollars from subscribers and advertisers. There are thousands of other niches, but they are impoverished with limited readership, users and recourse to revenue.</p>
<p>Put another way, these are tournament markets, where the winners can take all and where it is worth the gamble to have a small chance at a massive outcome rather than a good chance at a mediocre one. In medicine, “everyone” wants to cure cancer, not some neglected tropical disease (which might well have millions of people who could benefit from a cure). After all, the Nobel Prizes don’t go to merely good science, they go for the biggest advances of the century that have the right level of notability. In startups, founders want to target the largest business and consumer markets, not the small application that might be useful but won’t become a juggernaut.</p>
<p>Unicorns are not born in small markets.</p>
<p>There are of course hugely negative externalities to this model for many markets. All that competition to dominate the “first-read newsletter” on Capitol Hill or along Sand Hill Road means that we are overwhelmed with identical analyses on the same subjects rather than being able to select from a wide spectrum of different options. We probably should have more coverage of emerging market tech or state capitols than we do today.</p>
<p>In startups, we have way too many entrants in some extremely valuable layers of fintech, for example. There are at least … 50? 100? wealth-management startups and incumbent products that focus on automated investing in ETFs (so-called “roboadvisors”). Yet, there is so much money to be made in some of these layers, that every founder with sense is essentially saying “I’ll take my chances for the reward at the end of that particular road.”</p>
<p>You would sort of think the free market would work itself out in these niches. All that competition for attention in the DC media world or for wealth management users should ultimately lower costs and divide the pie thinly enough that it becomes less attractive for new entrants and makes other niches and markets look far more relatively competitive.</p>
<p>That would be true if the pie <i>did</i> actually subdivide further and further. Experience over the last decade though has proven to me that this is quite often not the case. DC politics <i>is</i> the cauldron of gold for politics coverage, and there are one to three newsletters that will always dominate that beat. M&amp;A coverage on Wall Street <i>is</i> the cauldron of gold of business journalism, and a handful of reporters are going to own that beat by being the switchboards for all the most important sources. And VC coverage <i>is</i> the cauldron of gold for startup media, which is why TechCrunch and a few of our friendly competitors work so hard to cover it every day.</p>
<p>New markets do get invented and old markets expand and contract. There are absolutely startups that sort of come from nowhere and dazzle us with their originality and ability to create whole new categories. Yet, for every unicorn that gets its start that way, there are 10 others that get built in existing major markets and compete for the big reward offered to the winner.</p>
<p>There isn’t anything wrong with investors who want to fund the fifteenth startup in a space. It makes sense — that’s where the rewards are, or at least, where we perceive the rewards to be. What needs to change is how to make some of those other niches offer the same incentives for innovation. How can more markets offer cauldrons of gold? Is that even possible? Or are we destined to read 100 newsletters on McConnell and Schumer’s machinations while getting ads for Marcus?</p>

One of the main reasons is that each partner in the venture was apparently just pursuing their own very different strategic approach to their respective healthcare challenges, meaning there really wasn&#8217;t much &#8220;joint&#8221; in the joint venture to begin with.</p>
<p>In a statement provided to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cnbc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cnbc">CNBC, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a Haven spokesperson highlighted some of the good results that came out of the partnership over the years, including improving access to primary care and making insurance benefits packages easier to grasp for employees. Meanwhile, Amazon has made lots of progress on its own with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/amazon-care-healthcare-service/">Amazon Care program</a>, which is its internal healthcare program for employees at its Washington facilities.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="csgto1ZeZW"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/amazon-care-healthcare-service/">Amazon launches Amazon Care, a virtual and in-person healthcare offering for employees</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon launches Amazon Care, a virtual and in-person healthcare offering for employees&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/amazon-care-healthcare-service/embed/#?secret=csgto1ZeZW" data-secret="csgto1ZeZW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Amazon Care includes provision of both virtual and in-person primary care doctor visits and prescription delivery. The company is also reported to be considering expansion of this service to other businesses, which signals its intent to turn it into a real business with aims very much in line with what the Haven JV had originally taken as its guiding light.</p>
<p>To be honest, the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/30/amazon-jpmorgan-and-berkshire-hathaway-to-build-their-own-healthcare-company/"> original announcement</a> about the JV&#8217;s founding was light on details and seemed like one of those things that comes together when very rich people talk about their shared problems over a casual afternoon hang at the club with caviar and mineral water distilled from pristine arctic ice or whatever they enjoy during their repasts, so it&#8217;s not all that surprising it didn&#8217;t materialize into anything more substantial.</p>
