					<description><![CDATA[Hello Sunshine, Reese Witherspoon&#8217;s media company that has produced content for streaming services like Hulu, Apple and HBO, among others, has been sold to a yet-unnamed new media firm run by former Disney execs, Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs, the company announced this morning. The Wall St. Journal first reported on the sale. Deal terms [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://hello-sunshine.com/">Hello Sunshine,</a> Reese Witherspoon&#8217;s media company that has produced content for streaming services like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/13/hulu-outbids-rivals-for-little-fires-everywhere-from-reese-witherspoon-and-kerry-washington/">Hulu</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/17/apple-greenlights-new-reese-witherspoon-backed-comedy-series-starring-kristen-wiig/">Apple</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Little_Lies_(TV_series)">HBO</a>, among others, has been sold to a yet-unnamed new media firm run by former Disney execs, Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs, the company <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210802005519/en/Hello-Sunshine-Announces-Majority-Investment-from-Newly-Formed-Next-Generation-Media-Company-Backed-by-Kevin-Mayer-Tom-Staggs-and-Blackstone">announced</a> this morning.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/reese-witherspoons-hello-sunshine-to-be-sold-to-media-company-backed-by-blackstone-11627914600">The Wall St. Journal</a> first reported on the sale.</p>
<p>Deal terms were not officially disclosed, but reportedly, the sale values Hello Sunshine&#8217;s business at around $900 million, The WSJ says. The news outlet had previously <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/reese-witherspoons-media-company-hello-sunshine-is-exploring-a-sale-11625605587">reported</a> Hello Sunshine was exploring a sale after receiving interest from a number of suitors, including Apple.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hello Sunshine was co-founded by Witherspoon and Strand Equity founder and managing partner Seth Rodsky in 2016, and is best known for producing series like HBO&#8217;s &#8220;Big Little Lies,&#8221; Hulu&#8217;s &#8220;Little Fires Everywhere,&#8221; and Apple&#8217;s &#8220;The Morning Show,&#8221; which feature Witherspoon in starring roles.</p>
<p>But the company has also invested in other film and media projects, ranging from <a href="https://deadline.com/2018/05/reese-witherspoon-hello-sunshine-meet-my-mom-facebook-watch-1202387374/">Facebook Watch series</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/10/reese-witherspoons-hello-sunshine-to-debut-an-exclusive-lineup-of-audible-originals/">collaborations</a> with Amazon&#8217;s Audible. It now has upcoming film and TV projects on the slate with Netflix, Amazon, ABC and Starz, and recently announced a Kids &amp; Animation division as well as the acquisition of Sara Rea&#8217;s SKR Production to expand into unscripted content.</p>
<p>In addition, the company operates an online and mobile book club app, <a href="https://reesesbookclub.com/">Reese&#8217;s Book Club</a>, now with 2.1 million followers. The club&#8217;s more popular picks are often turned into the shows and movies Hello Sunshine later produces.</p>
<p>Per Hello Sunshine&#8217;s announcement, the company will be the first acquisition by the new media venture run by Mayer and Staggs, which is backed by private equity firm Blackstone. The firm is spending more than $500 million in cash to purchase shares of Hello Sunshine from its investors, including AT&amp;T and Emerson Collective, The WSJ noted.</p>
<p>Following the deal&#8217;s closure, the senior management team will continue to run Hello Sunshine&#8217;s day-to-day operations. Witherspoon and Hello Sunshine Chief Executive Sarah Harden will join the board of new company and retain significant equity holders in the new business.</p>
<p>Hello Sunshine will become a cornerstone of the new media company&#8217;s strategy, which will involve being an &#8220;independent, creator-friendly home for cutting-edge, high-quality, category-defining brands and franchises,&#8221; it says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today marks a tremendous moment for Hello Sunshine. I started this company to change the way all women are seen in media. Over the past few years, we have watched our mission thrive through books, TV, film and social platforms. Today, we’re taking a huge step forward by partnering with Blackstone, which will enable us to tell even more entertaining, impactful and illuminating stories about women’s lives globally. I couldn’t be more excited about what this means for our future,&#8221; said Witherspoon in a statement about the deal.</p>
<p>The deal arrives at a time when there&#8217;s an uptick in consolidation happening the media business, as companies adjust to the shift away from traditional TV and standard movie releases to the always-on world of streaming and cord cutting. For example, Amazon in May <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/amazon-is-buying-mgm-studios-for-8-45b/">announced</a> it would buy MGM Studios for $8.45 billion &#8212; a deal being <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-amazon-mgm-investigation-195722033.html">investigated</a> by the FTC for potential antitrust issues. Meanwhile, WarnerMedia and Discovery around the same time <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-amazon-mgm-investigation-195722033.html">announced</a> their plans to merge operations, in hopes of taking a bigger bite out of the streaming market. Now, Comcast and ViacomCBS are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/20/comcast-and-viacomcbs-consider-partnership-to-bolster-streaming-tv.html">exploring</a> ways to work together, too.</p>
<p>But as traditional media companies begin to stream, like NBCU did with Peacock, for instance, they also<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/nielsen-says-the-office-was-the-most-popular-streaming-series-of-2020/"> pull back content</a> licensed to other streamers, like Netflix. That drives demand for new sources of independent programming, like what Hello Sunshine produces.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s value in this market comes from its pipeline of quality projects, many of which are pre-vetted by its book club members, who serve as a built-in audience and fan base for the later film or televised release. Plus, the projects it backs are also those that tell women&#8217;s stories &#8212; a historically neglected segment of the market, and one that Hello Sunshine&#8217;s success proves there&#8217;s pend-up demand for among viewers.</p>
<p>Blackstone&#8217;s investment in the new company is being made through its private equity business, which previously acquired a majority stake in dating app Bumble. Blackstone has made other entertainment industry investments, as well, including music rights organization <a href="https://www.blackstone.com/press-releases/article/leading-music-rights-organization-sesac-to-be-acquired-by-blackstone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.blackstone.com/press-releases/article/leading-music-rights-organization-sesac-to-be-acquired-by-blackstone/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1628003833085000&amp;usg=AFQjCNErIc4waoXaiccK2104r0WGVnyo4A">SESAC</a>; a <a href="https://www.blackstone.com/insights/article/three-reasons-why-blackstone-is-investing-in-content-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.blackstone.com/insights/article/three-reasons-why-blackstone-is-investing-in-content-production/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1628003833085000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG21UMrrYI7YW5kjfUzI8_DBAnwKQ">Hollywood</a> <a href="https://www.blackstone.com/press-releases/article/hudson-pacific-properties-and-blackstone-to-develop-los-angeles-area-studio-facility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.blackstone.com/press-releases/article/hudson-pacific-properties-and-blackstone-to-develop-los-angeles-area-studio-facility/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1628003833085000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHNuwgeGBuP00VQq9jnvT8_m6M3iA">studio space</a> and Burbank office real estate portfolio; global theme park operator <a href="https://www.blackstone.com/press-releases/article/kirkbi-blackstone-and-cppib-agree-terms-of-a-recommended-offer-for-merlin-entertainments-plc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.blackstone.com/press-releases/article/kirkbi-blackstone-and-cppib-agree-terms-of-a-recommended-offer-for-merlin-entertainments-plc/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1628003833085000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGLjy4_9sXtGnPd0suRvSwgcLWmUg">Merlin Entertainments</a>; online genealogy platform <a href="https://www.blackstone.com/press-releases/article/blackstone-completes-acquisition-of-ancestry-leading-online-family-history-business-for-4-7-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.blackstone.com/press-releases/article/blackstone-completes-acquisition-of-ancestry-leading-online-family-history-business-for-4-7-billion/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1628003833085000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFxNwntZ46LSzIX_IsfGIX5QnxjYw">Ancestry.com</a>; online mobile ad platforms <a href="https://www.blackstone.com/press-releases/article/blackstone-closes-acquisition-of-vungle-a-leading-mobile-performance-marketing-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.blackstone.com/press-releases/article/blackstone-closes-acquisition-of-vungle-a-leading-mobile-performance-marketing-platform/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1628003833085000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHOgNKbAQfcHWNQwL5VI6oeTGnuaA">Vungle</a> and <a href="https://www.blackstone.com/press-releases/article/blackstone-to-invest-in-liftoff-to-help-fuel-future-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.blackstone.com/press-releases/article/blackstone-to-invest-in-liftoff-to-help-fuel-future-growth/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1628003833085000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG3-f3muMQ0ZXW27b0-N6Rk--GZaw">Liftoff</a>; and <a href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.epidemicsound.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1628003833085000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGVh6hq2p1RX2fqX9AzAX0USibJbg">Epidemic Sound</a>, which delivers music to internet content creators.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[With PayPal, Klarna, Afterpay, Affirm and a host of smaller BNPL providers proving that customers like fee-based installment loans for online purchases, Square had to join the fight or miss a trick]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shares of Square are up this morning after the company announced its second-quarter earnings and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/square-to-buy-buy-now-pay-later-giant-afterpay-in-29b-deal/">that it will buy Afterpay</a>, an Australian buy now, pay later (BNPL) player in a $29 billion deal. As TechCrunch reported this morning, Afterpay shareholders will receive 0.375 shares of Square in exchange for their existing equity.</p>
<p>Shares of Afterpay are sharply higher after the deal was announced thanks to its implied premium, while shares of Square are up 7% in early-morning trading.</p>

<hr />
<p>Over the past year, we&#8217;ve written extensively about the BNPL market, usually from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/as-bnpl-startups-raise-a-look-at-klarna-affirm-and-afterpay-earnings/">perspective of earnings from companies in the space</a>. Afterpay has been a key data source, along with the yet-private Klarna and U.S. public BNPL outfit Affirm. Recall that each company has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/as-buy-now-pay-later-startups-keep-raising-capital-a-dive-into-klarna-afterpay-and-affirms-earnings/">posted strong growth in recent periods</a>, with the United States arising as a prime competitive market.</p>

Our read at the time was that any such movement by Cupertino would impact mass-market BNPL players more than niche-focused companies. Apple has a fintech base and broad IRL payment acceptance, making it a potentially strong competitor for BNPL services aimed at consumers; BNPL services targeted at particular industries or niches would likely see less competition from Apple.</p>
<p>From that landscape, let&#8217;s explore the Square-Afterpay deal. We want to know what Afterpay brings to Square in terms of revenue, growth and reach. We also want to do some math on the price Square is willing to pay for the company &#8212; and what that might tell us about the value of BNPL and fintech revenues more broadly. Then we&#8217;ll eyeball the numbers and try to decide if Square is overpaying for Afterpay.</p>
<h2>What Afterpay brings to Square</h2>
<p>As with most major deals these days, Square and Afterpay released an <a href="http://s27.q4cdn.com/311240100/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Square-Plans-to-Acquire-Afterpay-Transaction-Overview.pdf">investor presentation</a> detailing their argument in favor of their combination. Let&#8217;s dig through it.</p>
<p>Square is a two-part company. It has a large consumer business via Cash App, and it has a large business division that offers payments tech and other fintech services to corporate customers. Recall that Square is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/square-launches-business-bank-accounts/">also building out banking services</a> for its business customers and that Cash App also serves some banking and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/how-trading-apps-are-responding-to-the-gamestop-fustercluck/">investing functionality</a> for consumers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We know how much you love a good startup pitch-off. Who doesn’t? It combines the thrill of live, high-stakes entertainment with learning about the hottest new thing. Plus, you get to hear feedback from some of the smartest folks in the industry, thus learning how to absolutely crush it at your next pitch meeting with a VC.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">With all that in mind, we’re introducing a special summer edition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a> that’s all pitch-off, all the time.</p>

Those startups will pitch their products/businesses to a pair of expert VC judges, who will then give their live feedback.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/ff160dc5-e97a-4ecb-a4ff-296468849d31?dark=false" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. Last week, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> jumped on Twitter Spaces to discuss the tale of two edtech IPOs: Duolingo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/">the consumer language learning company</a>, and Powerschool, the enterprise K-12 software platform. It was a rare moment in the sun for the recently-revitalized sector, which saw two companies list on the NASDAQ on the same dang day.</p>
<p>Special shout out to our producer <a href="https://twitter.com/CGates123">Chris Gates </a>for handling this impromptu live chat, tech difficulties and all, and bringing it to your ears on this lovely Monday. Don&#8217;t forget that Equity is largely on break this week!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we got into, featuring some edtech entrepreneurs nice enough to drop on by:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/">China&#8217;s edtech crackdown</a> and how it is impacting startups both internationally and domestically. The regulations, one of which will force for-profit tutoring companies to turn into non-profits,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/edtechs-venture-backed-globalization-pauses-at-china/?tpcc=ECTW2020"> are also getting the cold shoulder from U.S. edtech VCs,</a> it seems.</li>
<li> As Lightspeed Ventures investor <a href="https://twitter.com/mercebent">Mercedes Bent </a>so aptly put it, the news is somewhat ironic: &#8220;[T]he US edtech IPO market is on fire (after being dormant for so long) and the China edtech market is crumbling (after being on fire for so long).&#8221;</li>
<li>Evidence of that can be found in the Duolingo IPO pricing arc. The company first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/duolingos-ipo-could-cast-golden-halo-on-edtech-startups/">posted a strong estimate of its worth</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/duolingo-boosts-ipo-price-target-in-boon-to-edtech-startups/">raised its range</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/duolingos-ipo-pricing-is-great-news-for-edtech-startups/">priced <em>above </em>that raised interval</a>, and still managed to trade higher. The company is still up more than $30 from its IPO price.</li>
<li>Powerschool was a bit different. It priced at $18 per share, the low-end of its $18 to $20 range. The company is up from its IPO price, albeit a much more modest two, or three percent in today&#8217;s early trading.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the second half of the show, we brought on the following host of edtech founders to share their hot takes about the current state of edtech:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/pacutler">Philip Cutler</a>, the founder &amp; CEO of <a href="https://paper.co/">PAPER</a> gave us an enterprise perspective. The startup recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/paper-series-c-ivp/">raised $100 million in a Series C round led by IVP.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/Taylor_Nieman">Taylor Nieman</a>, the founder &amp; CEO of <a href="https://t.co/5Eal21E4at?amp=1">Toucan</a> spoke language learning &#8212; and how she&#8217;s using Duolingo&#8217;s S-1 as a competitive advantage.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/AnadaLakra">Anada Lakra</a>, the founder &amp; CEO of <a href="https://t.co/nIj5Qn9B0O?amp=1">BoldVoice</a>, a startup that wants to help non-native English speakers hone their accents. TechCrunch covered the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/boldvoice-y-combinator-pre-seed/">here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yeva-hyusyan-5a16a220/?originalSubdomain=am">Yeva Hyusyan</a>, the founder of <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/home">Sololearn</a>, a Duolingo-like company that wants to teach coding instead of languages. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/sololearn-raises-24m-for-its-bite-sized-duolingo-like-mobile-first-coding-education-app/">recently raised $24 million</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we go, Equity is on a &#8220;break&#8221; this week, as we do some soul searching and refresh before our next run of shows. Obviously we still had to shaare this episode, and um, are recording another episode this week too, but you, my dear friend, will hear from us again next Monday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/zoom/">Zoom</a> has agreed to pay $85 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the video conferencing giant of violating users&#8217; privacy by sharing their data with third parties without permission and enabling &#8220;Zoombombing&#8221; incidents.</p>
<p>Zoombombing, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/zoom-waiting-rooms-default/">a term coined by TechCrunch</a> last year as its usage exploded because of the pandemic, describes unapproved attendees entering and disrupting Zoom calls by sharing offensive imagery, using backgrounds to spread hateful messages, or spouting slurs and profanities.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in March 2020 in the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California, also accused the firm of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/zoom-at-your-own-risk/">sharing personal user data</a> with third parties, including Facebook, Google and LinkedIn.</p>
<p>In addition to agreeing to an $85 million settlement, which could see customers receive a refund of either 15% of their subscription of $25 if the lawsuit achieves class-action status, Zoom has said it will take additional steps to prevent intruders from gatecrashing meetings. This will include alerting users when meeting hosts or other participants use third-party apps in meetings and offering specialized training to employees on privacy and data handling.</p>
<p>&#8220;The privacy and security of our users are top priorities for Zoom, and we take seriously the trust our users place in us,&#8221; Zoom said in a statement. “We are proud of the advancements we have made to our platform, and look forward to continuing to innovate with privacy and security at the forefront.”</p>
<p>The settlement requires approval from US District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, to be finalized.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s no secret that the technology for easy business-to-business payments has not yet caught up to its peer-to-peer counterparts, but <a href="https://kcpr.mxfig.com/5c538c40d7ccca0f92010099/l/lBE7t0JG2VGVrQi3S?messageId=!!!MESSAGE_ID!!!&amp;rn=!!!RECIPIENT_NAME_ENC!!!&amp;re=!!!EMAIL_ADDR_ENC!!!&amp;sc=!!!IS_SENDER_COPY!!!">Yaydoo</a> thinks it has the answer.</p>
<p>The Mexico City-based B2B software and payments company provides three products, <a href="https://kcpr.mxfig.com/5c538c40d7ccca0f92010099/l/FOHC2mS4qiu64agN6?messageId=!!!MESSAGE_ID!!!&amp;rn=!!!RECIPIENT_NAME_ENC!!!&amp;re=!!!EMAIL_ADDR_ENC!!!&amp;sc=!!!IS_SENDER_COPY!!!">VendorPlace</a><a href="https://kcpr.mxfig.com/5c538c40d7ccca0f92010099/l/mlJV8aSj6821DRyzE?messageId=!!!MESSAGE_ID!!!&amp;rn=!!!RECIPIENT_NAME_ENC!!!&amp;re=!!!EMAIL_ADDR_ENC!!!&amp;sc=!!!IS_SENDER_COPY!!!">,</a> P-Card and <a href="https://kcpr.mxfig.com/5c538c40d7ccca0f92010099/l/GNmnVO8Ng5zqvxsmM?messageId=!!!MESSAGE_ID!!!&amp;rn=!!!RECIPIENT_NAME_ENC!!!&amp;re=!!!EMAIL_ADDR_ENC!!!&amp;sc=!!!IS_SENDER_COPY!!!">PorCobrar</a>, for managing cash flow, optimizing access to smart liquidity, and connecting small, midsize and large businesses to an ecosystem of digital tools.</p>
<p>Sergio Almaguer, Guillermo Treviño and Roberto Flores founded Yaydoo — the name combines “yay” and “do” to show the happiness of doing something — in 2017. Today, the company announced the close of a $20.4 million Series A round co-led by Base10 Partners and monashees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Joining them in the round were SoftBank’s Latin America Fund and Leap Global Partners. In total, Yaydoo has raised $21.5 million, Almaguer told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Prior to starting the company, Almaguer was working at another company in Mexico doing point-of-sale. His large enterprise customers wanted automation for their payments, but he noticed that the same tools were too expensive for small businesses.</p>
<p>The co-founders started Yaydoo to provide procurement, accounts payable and accounts receivables, but in a simpler format so that the collection and payment of B2B transactions was affordable for small businesses.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2183840" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2183840" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2183840" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Group-2083.png" alt="" width="1024" height="893" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Group-2083.png 3655w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Group-2083.png?resize=150,131 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Group-2083.png?resize=300,262 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Group-2083.png?resize=768,670 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Group-2083.png?resize=680,593 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Group-2083.png?resize=1536,1340 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Group-2083.png?resize=2048,1786 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Group-2083.png?resize=50,44 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2183840" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yaydoo</p></div></p>
<p>The idea is taking off, and vendors are adding their own customers so that they are all part of the network to better link invoices to purchase orders and then connect to accounts payable, Almaguer said. Yaydoo estimates that the automation workflows reduced 80% of time wasted paying vendors, on average.</p>
<p>Yaydoo is joining a sector of fintech that is heating up — the <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/earnings/2019/mastercard-contactless-b2b-cross-border-growth/">global B2B payments market is valued at $120 trillion annually</a>. Last week, B2B payments platform Nium announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/nium-crosses-1b-valuation-with-200m-riverwood-capital-led-round/">$200 million in Series D</a> funding on a $1 billion valuation. Others attracting funding recently include Paystand, which raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/paystand-banks-50m-to-make-b2b-payments-cashless-and-with-no-fees/">$50 million in Series C</a> funding to make B2B payments cashless, while Dwolla <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/dwolla-raises-21m-to-bring-more-customizable-payment-and-money-transfer-options-to-fintechs-and-brands/">raised $21 million</a> for its API that allows companies to build and facilitate fast payments.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to attract new hires in Mexico and when the company expands into other Latin American countries. Yaydoo is also looking at future opportunities for its working capital business, like understanding how many invoices customers are setting, the access to actual payments, and how money flows out and in so that it can provide insights on working capital funding gaps. The company will also invest in product development.</p>
<p>The company has grown to over 800 customers, up from 200 in the first quarter of 2020. Its headcount also grew to 100 from 30 during the same time. In the last 12 months, over 70,000 companies have transacted on the Yaydoo network, and total payment volume grew to hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Yaydoo is a SaaS subscription model, but the new funding will also enable the company to create a pool of potential customers with a “freemium” offering with the goal of converting those customers into the subscription model as they grow, Almaguer said.</p>
<p>Rexhi Dollaku, partner at Base10 Partners, said the firm saw the way B2B payments were becoming modernized and “was impressed” by the Yaydoo team and how it built a complicated infrastructure, but made it easy to use.</p>
<p>He believes Latin America is 10 years behind in terms of B2B payments but will catch up sooner than later because of the digital transformation going on in the region.</p>
<p>“We are starting to see early signs of the network being built out of the payments product, and that is a good indication,” Dollaku said. “With the funding, Yaydoo will be also able to provide more financial services options for businesses to address a working fund gap.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Early-stage venture capital fund <a href="https://newtopia.vc/">Newtopia VC</a> launched Monday with $50 million to invest in tech startups based in Latin America.</p>
<p>The fund will invest between $250,000 and $1 million in startups at the seed stage to help them achieve the milestones needed on the path to raising a Series A.</p>
<p>Newtopia is led by five major players in the regional entrepreneurial ecosystem:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Patricio Jutard, co-founder of MURAL;</li>
<li aria-level="1">Mariano Mayer, former national secretary for entrepreneurs and SMEs in Argentina and founder of Marea Venture Partners;</li>
<li aria-level="1">Sacha Spitz, co-founder and partner of Yavu Ventures and former director at the Universidad de San Andrés incubation program;</li>
<li aria-level="1">Jorge Aguado, former national science, technology and innovation secretary in Argentina;</li>
<li aria-level="1">Juan Pablo Lafosse, founder and former CEO of Almundo.</li>
</ul>
<p>The group has already invested in startups in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina, including Aleph (B2B SaaS for e-commerce), Apperto (social commerce), Choiz (healthtech), Exactly (DeFi), Elevva (e-commerce brands), Inipay (fintech), Leef (sustainability), Wibson (e-privacy) and Yerbo (wellness).</p>
<p>Mayer told TechCrunch that he sees a great moment happening in Latin America around global venture capital firms &#8212; like Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/30/softbank-makes-a-huge-bet-on-latin-america/">SoftBank &#8212;</a>making bets in the region, especially targeting later-stage investments. There are home-grown venture capital firms doing well, too, citing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/the-latam-funding-boom-continues-as-kaszek-raises-1b-across-a-duo-of-funds/">Kaszek’s $1 billion funds</a>.</p>

<p>“However, we see a gap in investments in seed and road to Series A,” he added. “We aim to help entrepreneurs in those stages. Newtopia started with conversations during the pandemic, and now we see a big momentum for transformation of traditional sectors and the talent to make businesses out of these opportunities.”</p>
<p>Newtopia is offering both investment and a hands-on mentorship model to guide startups through the initial stages so they can grow regionally or globally. The fund has already amassed a community of more than 70 founders to invest, advise and be venture partners to the portfolio companies.</p>
<p>The Newtopia 10-Week Program works with companies to find product-market fit, achieve initial goals and set a foundation for further growth. The firm opened the call for applicants and will select 10 startups to receive a spot in the program and $100,000 each.</p>
<p>By taking a lead in early-stage investing, it will feed the rest of the venture capital firms that are doing later-stage investing, Mayer said.</p>
<p>He sees investments growing in Latin America every year, estimating there was a record $4 billion spread across the region, turning some companies into unicorns, including Jutard’s Mural, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/mural-raises-50m-series-c-after-tripling-its-arr-in-the-last-year/">raised $50 million</a> in July. That has more than validated that there will be more money in coming years, Mayer added.</p>
<p>Jutard said the fund’s founders were all investing or mentoring companies on their own, but the new funding will enable them to structure that assistance to help hundreds of startups rather than a handful.</p>
<p>“Early-stage companies go through an emotional rollercoaster where they feel alone, encounter times when it is hard to sell their product or recruit, so we are focused on building a community of support,” Jutard added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Columbus, Ohio-based Finite State, a startup that provides supply chain security for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/connected-devices/">connected devices</a> and critical infrastructure, has raised $30M in Series B funding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The funding lands amid increased focus on the less-secure elements in an organizations’ supply chain, such as Internet of Things devices and embedded systems. The problem, Finite State says, is largely fueled by device firmware, the foundational software that often includes components sourced from third-party vendors or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/12/how-open-source-software-took-over-the-world/">open-source</a> software. This means if a security flaw is baked into the finished product, it’s often without the device manufacturers&#8217; knowledge.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Cyber attackers see firmware as a weak link to gain unauthorized access to critical systems and infrastructure,” Matt Wyckhouse, CEO of Finite State, tells TechCrunch. “The number of known cyberattacks targeting firmware has quintupled in just the last four years.”</p>
<p>The Finite State platform brings visibility to the supply chains that create connected devices and embedded systems. After unpacking and analyzing every file and configuration in a firmware build, the platform generates a complete bill of materials for software components, identifies known and possible zero-day vulnerabilities, shows a contextual risk score, and provides actionable insights that product teams can use to secure their software.</p>
<p>“By looking at every piece of their supply chain and every detail of their firmware — something no other product on the market offers — we enable manufacturers to ship more secure products, so that users can trust their connected devices more,” Wyckhouse says.</p>
<p>The company’s latest funding round was led by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/energize-ventures/">Energize Ventures</a>, with participation from Schneider Electric Ventures and Merlin Ventures, and comes a year after Finite State raised a $12.5 million Series A round. It brings the total amount of funds raised by the firm to just shy of $50 million.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The startup says it plans to use the funds to scale to meet the demands of the market. It plans to increase its headcount too; Finite State currently has 50 employees, a figure that’s expected to grow to more than 80 by the end of 2021. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“We also want to use this fundraising round to help us get out the message: firmware isn’t safe unless it’s safe by design,&#8221; Wyckhouse added. &#8220;It’s not enough to analyze the code your engineers built when other parts of your supply chain could expose you to major security issues.”</p>
<p>Finite State was founded in 2017 by Matt Wyckhouse, founder and former CTO of Battelle’s Cyber Business Unit. The company showcased its capabilities in June 2019, when its widely-cited Huawei Supply Chain Assessment revealed numerous backdoors and major security vulnerabilities in the Chinese technology company’s networking devices that could be used in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/5g/">5G</a> networks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Yes founder and CEO Julie Bornstein helped some of the world&#8217;s biggest and best-loved brands develop industry leading e-commerce operations, and also served as COO at Stitch Fix, arguable one of the top success stories of digital-first fashion. The Yes is her first foray into entrepreneurship, however, and we got the chance to talk to Julie all about her experience as a founder.</p>
<p>On this week&#8217;s episode of Found, our weekly interview podcast, we hear from Julie all about how she identified the gap The Yes was created to address, and how she changed some of the longtime fundamentals about how fashion brands sell their wares and work with customer sales channels. Julie also tells us about why The Yes knew it needed a larger-than-average seed to accomplish its goals, and how she went out and got it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the rise of Open Banking, Psd2 Regulation, InsurTech, and the whole, general Fintech boom, tech investors have realized that there is an increasing place for dedicated funds which double down on this ongoing movement. When you look at the rise of banking-as-a-service offerings, payments platforms, insurtech, asset management, and infrastructure providers, you realize that there is a pretty huge revolution going on.</p>
<p>European fintech companies have raised $12.3bn in 2021 according to Dealroom, but the market is still wide-open for a great deal more funding for B2B fintech startups.</p>
<p>So it’s little surprise that B2B fintech-focused <a href="https://elementventures.vc/">Element Ventures</a>, has announced a $130 million fund to double-down on this new FinTech enterprise trend.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by financial services veterans Stephen Gibson and Michael McFadgen, and joined by Spencer Lake (HSBC&#8217;s former Vice Chairman of Global Banking and Markets) Element is backed by finance-oriented LPs and some 30 founders and executives from the sector.</p>
<p>Element says it will focus on what it calls a “high conviction investment strategy,” which will mean investing in only around a handful of companies a year (15 for the fund in total) but, it says, providing a &#8220;high level of support&#8221; to its portfolio.</p>
<p>So far it has backed B2B fintech firms across the UK and Europe including Hepster (total raised $10M), the embedded insurance platform out of Germany <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/german-insuretech-platform-hepster-raises-10m-series-a-led-by-element-ventures/">which I recently reported on</a>; Billhop (total raised $6.7M), the B2B payment network out of Sweden; Coincover (total raised $11.6M), a cryptocurrency recovery service out of the UK; and Minna (total raised $25M), the subscription management platform out of Sweden.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;German insurtech platform Hepster raises $10M Series A led by Element Ventures&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/german-insuretech-platform-hepster-raises-10m-series-a-led-by-element-ventures/embed/#?secret=OB4Mh4MpqB" data-secret="OB4Mh4MpqB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Speaking to me over a call McFadgen, Partner at Element Ventures, said: “Stephen and I have been investing in B2B FinTech together for quite a long time. In 2018 we had the opportunity to start element and Spencer came on boar in 2019. So Element as an independent venture firm is really a continuation of a strategy we&#8217;ve been involved in for a long time.”</p>
<p>Gibson added: “We are quite convinced by the European movement and the breakthrough these Fintech and insure tech firms in Europe are having. Insurance has been a desert for innovation and that is changing. And you can see that we’re sort of trying to build a network around companies that have those breakthrough moments and provide not just capital but all the other things we think are part of the story. Building the company from A to C and D is the area that we try and roll our sleeves up and help these firms.”</p>
<p>Element says it will also be investing in the US and Asia. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://boxgroup.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BoxGroup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has quietly, yet diligently, been funding companies at the early stage for over a decade. The 11-year-old firm in fact was the first investor in Plaid, a fintech company that nearly got sold to Visa last year for billions of dollars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has seen a number of impressive exits over the years, proving an eye that can detect winners before the winners themselves may even realize it. In fact, it’s that early faith in companies that partner David Tisch believes has been key to BoxGroup’s success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re starting a company and you’re going to raise money, that first yes is the hardest. And it’s the one that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> gives you the confidence, the excitement – to know that there&#8217;s somebody out there that&#8217;s going to believe in this and give you money for it,” Partner David Tisch told TechCrunch. “We really do try to pride ourselves on being that first yes on a regular basis. So the earlier we meet companies, the better.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, BoxGroup is announcing it has beefed up its war chest so that it can be that “first yes” to more companies with the closure of two new funds </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">totaling $255 million of capital. BoxGroup Five is the firm’s fifth early stage fund, and is aimed at investing in emerging tech companies at the pre-seed and seed stages. BoxGroup Strive is its second opportunity fund that will back companies in their subsequent follow-on rounds. Each fund amounts to $127.5 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, BoxGroup has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">made over 300 investments including having invested in the earliest rounds of Ro, Plaid, Airtable, Workrise, Scopely, Bowery Farms, Ramp, Titan, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warby Parker, Classpass, Guideline and Glossier. It has had a number of impressive exits in Flatiron Health, PillPack, Matterport, Oscar, Mirror, Bark, Bread and Trello. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BoxGroup Five – the firm&#8217;s early-stage fund – will</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> invest in about 40 to 50 new companies a year with investments ranging from $250,000 to $1 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to be the second or third biggest check in a round,” Tisch said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opportunity fund occasionally makes later-stage investments in new companies, but mostly just continues to support companies it invested in at an earlier stage. For example, BoxGroup first invested in <a href="https://www.id.me/">id.me</a> in 2010.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The company is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">sort of an 11-year overnight success that we&#8217;ve been backing for over a decade now,” Tisch said. “It’s an example of us just continuing to support companies through their life cycle.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BoxGroup also pre-seeded digital healthcare startup Ro, but also funded every round it’s raised since, including its most recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/ro-raises-500m-to-grow-its-remote-and-in-home-primary-care-platform/">$500 million funding at a $5 billion valuation</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tisch describes the BoxGroup six-person team as “generalists” in terms of the spaces it invests in, with a portfolio consisting of startups in the consumer, enterprise, fintech, healthcare, marketplace, synthetic biology and climate sectors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/10/boxgroup-raises-its-first-externally-backed-fund-to-invest-in-seed-stage-startups/">BoxGroup’s last fund closures</a> – which totaled $165 million – marked the first time the firm had accepted outside capital in nine years. Prior to that point, it had been funded with only personal capital. Its LPs are a mixed group of endowments, foundations and family offices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For BoxGroup, building authentic relationships with founders is at the root of what the firm does, says </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partner Nimi Katragadda. That includes taking bets on founders, sometimes more than once, even if one of their companies didn’t work out. It means backing just ideas in some cases, and people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This cannot be transactional, it has to be personal,” she said. “We want to go on a journey with someone for a decade as they build their business&#8230;. We&#8217;re comfortable with what early means, including a lot of assumptions, more vision t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">han traction, and raw product.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Partner Adam Rothenberg agrees, saying: &#8220;Our goal is to be the friend in the room. We believe in honesty, tough love, and transparency in building relationships with founders. We focus on the &#8220;how&#8221; more than the &#8220;what&#8221; — how a founder thinks, how they will build product, and how they think about attracting talent.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With offices in San Francisco and New York, the firm will likely be growing in the near future as BoxGroup is looking to add on some “first-line investors,” Tisch said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greg Rosen was named a partner at the firm. Rosen originally joined BoxGroup in 2015, where he spent three years before leaving to join Benchmark. He re-joined BoxGroup in early 2020 and joins the firm&#8217;s three other partners: Tisch, Rothenberg and Katragadda. </span></p>
<p>While the world of venture is crazy hot right now, Tisch said the firm keeps itself grounded with a wisdom that can only be gained with experience and in time.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is seemingly infinite capital waiting to be deployed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Without calling the cycle, we know that over time markets go up and down&#8230;No matter where we are in a given cycle, smart and determined minds will come together to build important technology companies. Our job is to make sure we are meeting those founders and choosing wisely about which ones to partner with for 10+ year journeys.&#8221;</p>

<p>Organizing information about prospective deals is a challenging task for B2B sales teams, since salespeople usually rely on multiple tools (email, Zoom, WhatsApp, etc) to talk with buyer committees. It becomes even more unwieldy when sales teams work remotely. <a href="https://nektar.ai/">Nektar.ai</a> is a B2B sales productivity startup that wants to help sales team by reducing the amount of time they spend on manual data entry and providing analytics that can increase their revenue. The Singapore-based company announced today it has raised $6 million in seed funding, led by B Capital Group.</p>
<p>3One4 Capital and returning investor Nexus Venture Partners also participated, along with angel investors like Amit Midha, president of Asia Pacific and Japan at Dell; Ritesh Agarwal the founder and CEO of OYO Hotels;, Kevin Merritt, former president of Tyler Technologies’ data and insights division; Evan Davidson, SentinelOne’s vice president of Asia Pacific and Japan; Deep Nishar, senior managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers; and Tom Donlea, Ekata’s vice president and general manager of APAC.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Combined with its previous round, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/08/singapore-based-sales-productivity-platform-nektar-raises-2-15-million-seed-round/">$2.15 million led by Nexus Venture Partners</a> and announced in November 2020, the new funding brings Nektar.ai’s total seed capital to $8.1 million. The company says this is one of the largest seed rounds ever for a SaaS company based in Asia. Nektar.ai’s workforce is remote-first and the company says half of its team are women.</p>

<p>Nektar.ai has been in stealth mode since it was founded in 2020 by Abhijeet Vijayvergiya and Aravind Ravi Sulekha, working with hundreds of clients in private beta mode. Its waitlist is currently open for sign-ups, with plans to launch publicly in the first half of 2022. Part of Nektar.ai’s seed funding will be used to build a go-to-market team focused on the United States.</p>
<p>Nektar.ai was designed for SaaS revenue teams who have to manage information across many channels, including email, calendars, web conferences, Slack, CRM tools, LinkedIn and WhatsApp. This makes it hard for them to collaborate, follow playbooks (or sets of best practices) and get a full understanding of their deals pipeline and revenue. Nektar.ai integrates with different apps, surfaces key data and delivers it to the most convenient collaboration tool for a team, like Slack.</p>
<p>Vijayvergiya told TechCrunch that over the last six months, Nektar.ai accelerated product development because “we saw a strong demand for a guided selling solution in the market,” onboarding more than 200 prospects from its waitlist.</p>
<p>Nektar.ai launched a web console for managers, a Chrome extension and integrations with Salesforce, Google Workspace and Slack. It also added a new feature called Capture Bot, an AI-based system that automatically extracts important information from salespeople’ online interactions with buyer committees, surfacing data that would otherwise be tucked away in different inboxes and calendars. This increases the accuracy of their CRM tools and allows sales managers to see how engaged their teams are with potential customers and how prospective deals are progressing.</p>
<p>For individual representatives, Nektar.ai’s tools let them spend less time on manual data entry. They also get analytics like multithreading scores that help them identify how deals were won or lost. For example, Vijayvergiya said one client found they won deals if they had at least four contacts with a buyer committee after the demo stage. As a result, its sales representatives began engaging with more than four members of the buyer committee on all potential deals.</p>
<p>Another way Nektar.ai helps SaaS sales teams save money and time is building databases of first-party contacts from their inboxes. Vijayvergiya said one client was able to save $50,000 by organizing their existing contacts instead of purchasing third-party contact data.</p>
<p>In a statement, B Capital Group general partner Gabe Greenbaum said, “Nektar.ai’s solutions provide great value to distributed revenue teams, which is even more important as enterprises conduct further business across global markets. B Capital is always eager to work with experienced and knowledgeable founders, and we’re confident that Abhijeet, Aravind and the Nektar.ai team will continue their strong momentum on the path to becoming the industry-leading tool for enterprise sales productivity.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pet pharmacy <a href="https://www.mixlabrx.com/">Mixlab</a> has developed a digital platform enabling veterinarians to prescribe medications and have them delivered — sometimes on the same day — to pet parents.</p>
<p>The New York-based company raised a $20 million Series A in a round of funding led by Sonoma Brands and including Global Founders Capital, Monogram Capital, Lakehouse Ventures and Brand Foundry. The new investment gives Mixlab total funding of $30 million, said Fred Dijols, co-founder and CEO of Mixlab.</p>
<p>Dijols and Stella Kim, chief experience officer, co-founded Mixlab in 2017 to provide a better pharmacy experience, with the veterinarian at the center.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dijols’ background is in medical devices as well as healthcare investment banking, where he became interested in the pharmacy industry, following TruePill and PillPack, which he told TechCrunch were “creating a modern pharmacy model.”</p>
<p>As more pharmacy experiences revolved around at-home delivery, he found the veterinary side of pharmacy was not keeping up. He met Kim, a user experience expert, whose family owns a pharmacy, and wanted to bring technology into the industry.</p>
<p>“The pharmacy industry is changing a lot, and technology allows us to personalize the care and experience for the veterinarian, pet parent and the pet,” Kim said. “Customer service is important in healthcare as is dignity and empathy. We kept that in mind when starting Mixlab. Many companies use technology to remove the human element, but we use it to elevate it.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="despaGYHp9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/16/where-top-vcs-are-investing-in-digital-health/">Where top VCs are investing in digital health</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Where top VCs are investing in digital health&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/16/where-top-vcs-are-investing-in-digital-health/embed/#?secret=despaGYHp9" data-secret="despaGYHp9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Mixlab’s technology includes a digital service for veterinarians to streamline their daily medication workflow and gives them back time to spend with patient care. The platform manages the home delivery of medications across branded, generic and over-the-counter medications, as well as reduces a clinic’s on-site pharmacy inventories. Veterinarians can write prescriptions in seconds and track medication progress and therapy compliance.</p>
<p>The company also operates its own compound pharmacy where it specializes in making medications on-demand that are flavored and dosed.</p>
<p>On the pet parent side, they no longer have to wait up to a week for medications nor have to drive over to the clinic to pick them up. Medications come in a personalized care package that includes a note from the pharmacist, clear and easy-to-read instructions and a new toy.</p>
<p>Over the past year, adoptions of pets spiked as more people were at home, also leading to an increase in vet visits. This also caused the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/ae/news-releases/pet-care-market-influenced-by-humanization-sentiment-future-market-insights-881210559.html">global pet care industry</a> to boom, and it is now projected to reach $343 billion by 2030, when it had been <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/pet-care-market-104749">valued at $208 billion in 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Pet parents are also spending more on their pets, and a Morgan Stanley report showed that they see pets as part of their family, and as a result, 37% of people said they would take on debt to pay for a pet’s medical expenses, while 29% would put a pet’s needs before their own.</p>
<p>To meet the increased demand in veterinary care, the company will use the new funding to improve its technology and expand into more locations where it can provide same-day delivery. Currently it is shipping to 47 states and Dijols expects to be completely national by the end of the year. He also expects to hire more people on both the sales team and in executive leadership positions.</p>
<p>The company is already operating in New York and Los Angeles and growing 3x year over year, though Dijols admits operating during the pandemic was a bit challenging due to “a massive surge of orders” that came in as veterinarians had to shut down their offices.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Keith Levy, operating partner at Sonoma Brands and former president of pet food manufacturer Royal Canin USA, will join Mixlab’s board of directors. Sonoma Brands is focused on growth sectors of the consumer economy, and pets was one of the areas that investors were interested in.</p>
<p>Over time, Sonoma found that within the veterinary community, there was space for a lot of players. However, veterinarians want to home in on one company they trust, and Mixlab fit that description for many because they were getting medication out faster, Levy said.</p>
<p>“What Mixlab is doing isn’t completely unique, but they are doing it better,” he added. “When we looked at their customer service metrics, we saw they had a good reputation and were relentlessly focused on providing a better experience.”</p>

<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, our scoop machine Mark Harris was at it again. This time, he found some interesting and entertaining documents related to Elon Musk&#8217;s underground Loop system in Las Vegas received via a Freedom of Information Act. Among the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/read-the-script-every-driver-for-elon-musks-las-vegas-loop-must-learn/">treasure is a &#8220;ride script&#8221;</a> that instructs drivers for the Loop system to bypass passengers&#8217; questions about how long they have been driving for the company, declare ignorance about crashes, and shut down conversations about Musk himself.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The takeaway: the script shows just how serious The Boring Company, which built and operates the system, is about controlling the public image of the new system, its technology and especially Musk.</p>
<p>Importantly, the documents confirm that Autopilot, the advanced driver assistance system in the Tesla vehicles used in the Loop system, must be disabled.</p>

<h2>Micromobbin&#8217;</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1999054 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png" alt="" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/the-station-scooter1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>This is a <em>step</em> outside the norm of what I usually think of when I think of micromobility (you&#8217;ll see what I did there in a second), but this week I wrote about a new<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/ashirase-a-honda-incubation-reveals-advanced-walking-assistance-system-for-visually-impaired/"> in-shoe navigation system</a> that helps the visually impaired walk around town.</p>
<p><strong>Ashirase</strong>, as both the system and the name of the company is called, involves attaching a three-dimensional vibration device, including a motion sensor, inside a pair of shoes. This bit of hardware is connected to a smartphone app that someone with low vision can use to enter their destination. Vibrations in the front part of the shoe give the cue to walk straight, and vibrations on the left and right cue the user to make a left or right turn. The aim is to free up the hands while walking to use a cane and allow the walker to put more of their full attention on audio signals in the environment, thus making their commutes a bit more intuitive and their lives more independent.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a really interesting bit of tech because it uses a similar stack to what we&#8217;re seeing in autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems. Which makes sense because that&#8217;s the founder&#8217;s background. Wataru Chino worked in <strong>Honda&#8217;s</strong> EV motor control and automated driving systems departments since 2009. His startup is a product of Honda&#8217;s incubator, Ignition, that features original technology, ideas, and designs of Honda associates with the goal of solving social issues and going beyond the existing Honda business.</p>
<h3>Accessibility: We love to see it</h3>
<p><strong>Cabify</strong> recently announced a new feature that makes its rideshare service more accessible to the elderly, people with partial visual impairment and people with cognitive disabilities. The feature provides voice notifications to alert the user when a driver is on their way or has just arrived, when the ride starts, when a stop has been reached, when a message has come into the app&#8217;s chat, etc.</p>
<p>The notification makes use of a text-to-speech functionality that Android and iOS phones have.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple and Google operating systems allow us to pronounce sentences with the system&#8217;s voice but we have developed the text and established the situations where we inform and draw the user&#8217;s attention,&#8221; a Cabify spokesperson told me.</p>
<h3>Lime&#8217;s push for world domination</h3>
<p>And we&#8217;re back with the latest on <strong>Lime&#8217;s</strong> plans to take over the world, one electric scooter at a time. The micromobility goliath has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/moovit-integrates-lime-electric-scooters-bikes-mopeds-into-transit-planning-app/">announced an integration</a> with the <strong>Moovit</strong> transit planning app. From Monday onwards, Moovit users in 117 cities across 20 countries will see Lime&#8217;s electric scooters, bikes and mopeds show up as an option for travel, either as the whole journey or as part of a multi-modal journey. This news follows a trend we&#8217;re seeing as cities start to see micromobility companies as less of a public nuisance and more of a public solution, particularly for first- and last-mile travel. Integrating with Moovit, an app that&#8217;s solely focused on public transportation, is a move that helps in the long run creating a broader transportation ecosystem.</p>
<h3>New whips</h3>
<p><strong>Espin</strong> released its limited edition fixie style e-bike <a href="https://www.espinbikes.com/products/aero">called the Aero</a>. It&#8217;s just the thing for Seattle hipsters, particularly ones with a stick-and-poke bike tattoo. The bike frame is just as sleek as you&#8217;d expect from a single gear bike, all clean lines and comes in either a forest green or a smoke gray. The Aero can reach top speeds of 20 mph and can hit 30 miles on a single charge. Best of all, it doesn&#8217;t break the bank at $1,399.</p>
<p><strong>Splach</strong>, which normally makes e-scooters and e-bikes, has come out with something it&#8217;s calling the <a href="https://splach.bike/pages/transformer">Transformer</a>. I truly don&#8217;t know how to categorize it but it looks like a lot of fun to ride. The company is calling the light-duty e-vehicle a &#8220;mini-moto Robust scooter specialized for rugged terrains.&#8221; It looks like a dirt bike has been sized way down and given a long neck so you can stand on it and still steer it. It also looks like it would indeed do well on rugged terrains, based on videos of people shredding down dirt paths. Splach used Indiegogo to fund the thing, and said it reached its goal within an hour.</p>
<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>Get ready to hear a lot more about supply chain constraints around batteries with virtually every automaker shouting out pledges to shift their entire portfolio away from internal combustion engines and towards electric powertrains.</p>
<p>Cell producers need access to the raw materials like nickel that are needed to make batteries. Mining those materials is the most common means, but that isn&#8217;t sustainable (and I&#8217;m not just talking about the environmental toll). <strong>JB Straubel</strong>, who is best known as the former Tesla co-founder and longtime CTO, is tackling the supply chain issue through his startup <strong>Redwood Materials</strong>. The battery recycling company is aiming to create a circular supply chain. This closed-loop system, Straubel says, will be essential if the world&#8217;s battery cell producers hope to have the supply needed for consumer electronics and the coming wave of electric vehicles.</p>
<p>High-profile investors like Amazon, funds managed by T. Rowe and Bill Gates&#8217; Breakthrough Ventures fund recognize the opportunity and have injected<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/redwood-materials-raises-700m-to-expand-its-battery-recycling-operation/"> $700M in fresh capital</a> into Redwood Materials. This is comically large compared to the startup&#8217;s last raise of $40 million. And sources tell me that this pushes Redwood Material&#8217;s valuation to $3.7 billion.</p>
<p>I interviewed Straubel about the raise and what struck me was how aggressively he wants to scale; he is treating this issue as if there is no time to lose — and he&#8217;s not wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Clarios</strong>, the maker of low-voltage vehicle batteries, postponed its IPO, citing market volatility, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-29/brookfield-backed-clarios-is-said-to-postpone-1-8-billion-ipo?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a>. the Milwaukee area-based company backed by Brookfield Asset Management had filed to raise $1.7 billion by offering 88.1 million shares at a price range of $17 to $21.</p>
<p>Fisker, the electric vehicle startup turned publicly traded company via a SPAC, has turned investor to support EV charging company Allego. Fisker said it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/fisker-invests-in-ev-charging-network-allegos-spac-merger/">investing $10 million</a> in private-investment-in-public equity (PIPE) funding for the merger of Allego and special purpose acquisition company Spartan Acquisition Corp III. The merger puts Allego at a pro forma equity value of $3.14 billion.</p>
<p><strong>Flock, </strong>which went from providing drone insurance to commercial vehicle insurance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/connected-car-insurance-startup-flock-raises-17m-series-a-led-by-chamath-palihapitiya/">raised $17 million</a> in a Series A funding led by Social Capital, the investment vehicle run by Chamath Palihapitiya, best known as a SPAC investor and chairman of Virgin Galactic. Flock&#8217;s existing investors Anthemis and Dig Ventures also participated. This round brings Flock&#8217;s total funding to $22 million. Justin Saslaw (Social Capital&#8217;s fintech partner) joins Flock&#8217;s board of directors, as does Ross Mason (founder of Dig Ventures and MuleSoft).</p>
<p><strong>HappyFresh</strong>, the on-demand grocery app based in Indonesia, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/indonesia-based-grocery-app-happyfresh-reaps-65m-led-by-naver-financial-and-gafina/">raised $65 million</a> in a Series D round led by Naver Financial Corporation and Gafina B.V., with participation from STIC, LB and Mirae Asset Indonesia and Singapore. It also included returning investors Mirae-Asset Naver Asia Growth Fund and Z Venture Capital. The company&#8217;s previous round of funding was a $20 million Series C announced in April 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Lordstown Motors</strong> got a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/troubled-ev-company-lordstown-motors-gets-400m-lifeline-in-stock-sale-agreement/">lifeline</a> from a hedge fund managed by investment firm Yorkville Advisors about five weeks after the automaker issued a warning that it might not have enough funds to bring its electric pickup truck to market. The hedge fund agreed to buy $400 million worth of shares over a three-year period, according to a regulatory filing.</p>
<p><strong>Merqueo</strong>, the on-demand delivery service that operates in Latin America, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/colombias-merqueo-bags-50m-to-expand-its-online-grocery-delivery-service-across-latin-america/">raised $50 million</a> in a Series C round of funding co-led by IDC Ventures, Digital Bridge and IDB Invest. MGM Innova Group, Celtic House Venture Partners, Palm Drive Capital and previous shareholders also participated. The financing brings the Bogota, Colombia-based startup&#8217;s total raised to $85 million since its 2017 inception.</p>
<p><strong>Niron Magnetics</strong>, a company developing permanent magnets free of rare earths, <a href="https://nironmagnetics.com/news/niron-magnetics-raises-21-3m-to-commercialize-rare-earth-free-magnets-for-a-more-sustainable-electric-economy/">raised $21.3 million in new financing</a> from the Volvo Cars Tech Fund and Volta Energy Technologies, which joined existing investors Anzu Partners and the University of Minnesota. Niron will use the funding to build its pilot production facility in Minnesota.</p>
<p><strong>Onto</strong>, the EV car subscription company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/onto-raises-175-million-in-series-b-to-expand-ev-subscription-service-in-the-uk/">raised $175 million</a> in a combined equity and debt Series B round. The equity piece was led by Swedish VC Alfvén &amp; Didrikson. British investment company Pollen Street Capital provided the senior-secured asset-backed debt facility. The company, which has raised a total of $245 million, says it plans to double its fleet size every three to six months and that any new vehicles will be used as collateral. Onto did not disclose how much of the round came from equity versus debt.</p>
<p><strong>Zūm</strong>, a student transportation startup, was awarded a five-year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/zum-wins-150m-from-san-francisco-schools-to-modernize-and-electrify-student-transport/">$150 million contract</a> to modernize San Francisco Unified School District transport service throughout the district. Zūm, which already operates its rideshare-meets-bus service in Oakland, much of Southern California, Seattle, Chicago and Dallas, will be responsible for handling day-to-day operations, transporting 3,500 students across 150 school campuses starting this fall semester.</p>

<p>I hear things. But I&#8217;m not selfish. Let me share!</p>
<p>You might have missed my article late Friday about <strong>Argo AI</strong> landing a permit in California that will allow the company to give people free rides in its self-driving vehicles on the state&#8217;s public roads.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: The <strong>California Public Utilities Commission</strong> issued Argo the so-called Drivered AV pilot permit, which is part of the state&#8217;s Autonomous Vehicle Passenger Service pilot. This puts Argo in a small and growing group of companies seeking to expand beyond traditional AV testing &#8212; a signal that the industry, or at least some companies, are preparing for commercial operations.</p>
<p>Regulatory hurdles remain and don&#8217;t expect Argo to be offering and charging for &#8220;driverless&#8221; rides anytime soon. But progress is being made and I would expect the company to secure the next permit — in a long line of them — later this year.</p>
<p>Argo has never officially indicated what city it is targeting for a robotaxi service in California. The company has been testing its autonomous vehicle technology in Ford vehicles around Palo Alto since 2019. Today, the company&#8217;s test fleet in California is about one dozen self-driving test vehicles. It also has autonomous test vehicles in Miami, Austin, Washington D.C., Pittsburgh and Detroit. (In July, Argo and Ford announced plans to launch at least 1,000 self-driving vehicles on Lyft’s ride-hailing network in a number of cities over the next five years, starting with Miami and Austin.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hearing from some sources familiar with Argo&#8217;s strategy for California that we should look south of the Bay Area. <em>Way south</em>.</p>
<p>The city that jumps to mind is San Diego. Some AV companies are already playing around the Irvine area and Los Angeles seems too unwieldy. Plus, Ford already has a footprint in San Diego. The automaker partnered way back in 2017 with AT&amp;T, Nokia and Qualcomm Technologies to test Cellular vehicle-to-everything (CV2X) at the San Diego Regional Proving Ground with the support of the San Diego Association of Governments, Caltrans, the city of Chula Vista, and intelligent transportation solutions provider McCain. The upshot of these trials? To improve traffic efficiency, vehicle safety and &#8220;support a path towards autonomous vehicles.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Policy corner</h2>

<p>Hi everyone. Let&#8217;s dive into two key pieces of proposed legislation this week: the infrastructure bill and the tailpipe emissions standards.</p>
<p>After months of negotiations, U.S. senators have finally settled on a $550 billion infrastructure package that includes investments in roads, bridges, broadband and more. The bill would provide $7.5 billion to electrify buses and ferries, including school buses, and $7.5 billion to build out a national network of public EV charging stations. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/28/fact-sheet-historic-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/">Subsequent statements</a> on the bill from the White House say directly that the EV investments are intended to keep the U.S. competitive on the world stage: &#8220;U.S. market share of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) sales is only one-third the size of the Chinese EV market. The President believes that must change.&#8221;</p>
<p>The budget is just a fraction of the $2.25 trillion bill <strong>President Joe Biden</strong> originally introduced in March. That version of the bill earmarked billions more for transportation electrification, especially in rebates and incentives to get consumers buying more EVs. The bill is still with the Senate for final approval. Then it will head to the House before finally ending up on Biden&#8217;s desk.</p>
<p>The <strong>Environmental Protection Agency</strong> and the <strong>Department of Transportation</strong> have proposed rules that would beef up tailpipe emissions standards, which had been rolled back under President Donald Trump. The rules would be identical to the agreement the state of California reached with Ford, VW, Honda, BMW and Volvo in 2019, the AP reported. If approved, the rules would apply starting with model year 2023 vehicles.</p>
<p>The aim is to cut carbon emissions from transportation and encourage more people to buy hybrid and electric. But many environmental groups like the Sierra Club &#8212; plus some EV automakers &#8212; don&#8217;t think they go far enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;This draft proposal would drive us in the right direction after several years in reverse&#8211;but slowly getting back on track is not enough,&#8221; Chris Nevers, senior director of environmental policy at Rivian, told TechCrunch. EPA and NHTSA must maximize the stringency of the program beyond the voluntary deal and account for current and future developments in vehicle electrification.</p>
<p>One more thing that caught my eye this week&#8230;The Washington Post reported that Biden and a group of automakers are negotiating for the latter group to make a &#8220;formal pledge&#8221; to have at least 40% of all vehicles sold in 2030 to be electric. The article doesn&#8217;t specify which OEMs are part of the talks. However, it&#8217;s hard to imagine automakers signing onto anything &#8212; even a &#8220;voluntary pledge&#8221; &#8212; without some hefty federal spending to go along with it. We&#8217;ll have to see if the provisions in the infrastructure bill are enough.</p>

<p>As per ushe, there was a ton of transportation news this week. Let&#8217;s dig in.</p>
<h3>ADAS</h3>
<p>Yep, ADAS gets its own section now in an effort to make it abundantly clear that advanced driver assistance systems are not self-driving cars. Never. Never ever.</p>
<p><strong>New York Times&#8217;</strong> Greg Bensinger weighs in on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/opinion/self-driving-cars-tesla-elon-musk.html">beta testing and Tesla</a> in this opinion column.</p>
<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Aurora</strong> co-founder and chief product officer Sterling Anderson <a href="https://aurora.tech/blog/our-blueprint-for-launching-our-ride-hailing-business">put out a blog</a> and a <a href="https://twitter.com/sterling_a/status/1421134137100947460">bunch of tweets</a> to layout a blueprint for an autonomous ride-hailing business that will launch in late 2024 with partners Toyota and Uber. Aurora has spent the past year or so pushing its messaging on self-driving trucks, which the company says is its best and most viable first commercial product. Aurora never entirely ditched the robotaxi idea, but it was pretty quiet on the topic. Until now.</p>
<p>The blog comes about a week after competitor Argo AI and Ford announced a partnership with Lyft. While the timing might not be related, it does show that competition is heating up in both areas — robotaxis and self-driving trucks — with every AV company keen to show progress and deep partnerships.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>TuSimple</strong>, the self-driving truck company that went public earlier this year, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/tusimples-self-driving-truck-network-takes-shape-with-ryder-partnership/">partnered with <strong>Ryder</strong></a> as part of its plan to build out a freight network that will support its autonomous trucking operations. Ryder’s fleet maintenance facilities will act as terminals for TuSimple’s so-called AFN, or autonomous freight network.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Ford</strong> released Wednesday its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/ford-expects-semiconductor-rebound-new-vehicle-demand-to-increase-2021-profits/">second quarter earnings</a> for 2021, which besides containing a surprise profit despite the ongoing chip shortage, revealed that its F-150 Lightning electric pickup has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-pickup-reservations-surpass-120000/">generated 120,000 preorders</a> since its unveiling in May. Ford reported revenue of $26.8 billion, slightly below expectations, and net income of $561 million in the second quarter.</p>
<p><strong>Lucid Group</strong> (formerly Lucid Motors) will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/lucid-motors-kicks-off-market-debut-with-ev-factory-expansion-plans/">expanding its factory</a> in Casa Grande, Arizona, by 2.7 million square feet, CEO Pete Rawlinson said just hours after the company officially went public with a $4.5 billion injection of capital. The company also said it has 11,000 paid reservations for its flagship luxury electric sedan, the Lucid Air.</p>
<p><strong>Polestar</strong> said it plans to launch in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/polestar-to-double-its-retail-stores-as-it-seeks-to-ramp-up-ev-sales/">nine more markets</a> this year, doubling its global presence as it seeks to sell more of its electric sedans. The company, which is the electric performance vehicle brand under Volvo Car Group, also wants to double the number of retail stores to 100 locations and add more service centers by the end of the year. The Swedish automaker has more than 650 so-called &#8220;service points&#8221; in Polestar markets and wants to exceed 780 by the end of 2021.</p>
<p><strong>REE Automotive</strong> has picked Austin for its U.S. headquarters. The company said the headquarters will help it address the growing U.S. market demand for mission-specific EVs from delivery and logistics companies, Mobility-as-a-Service and new technology players.</p>
<p><strong>Tesla</strong> reported its second-quarter earnings and it was packed with news, including that the company generated<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/teslas-quarterly-profit-surpasses-1-billion/"> $1.14 billion in net income</a>, marking the first time the company’s quarterly profit (on a GAAP basis) has passed the three-comma threshold. And they hit that profitability metric without completely relying on the sale of zero-emissions credits to other automakers.</p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk weighed in on the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/what-teslas-bet-on-iron-based-batteries-means-for-manufacturers/">battery strategy</a> and disclosed that the company is pushing the launch of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/tesla-delays-semi-truck-to-2022-cybertruck-back-burnered-for-model-y/">electric Semi truck program</a> to 2022 due to supply chain challenges and the limited availability of battery cells. And everything is pointing to the Cybertruck also being delayed until next year.</p>
<p>And finally, Tesla&#8217;s latest quarterly earnings report showed growth in its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/teslas-solar-and-energy-storage-business-rakes-in-810m-finally-exceeds-cost-of-revenue/">energy storage and solar business</a>. The company reported $801 million in revenue from its energy generation and storage business &#8212; which includes three main products: solar, its Powerwall storage device for homes and businesses, and its utility storage unit Megapack. More importantly, the cost of revenue for its solar and energy storage business was $781 million, meaning that for the first time the total cost of producing and distributing these energy storage products was lower than the revenue it generated. That&#8217;s good news.</p>
<h3>eVTOLs and other flying things</h3>
<p><strong>Joby Aviation</strong> completed the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/joby-aviation-aiming-to-go-to-market-in-2024-completes-154-mile-test-flight/">longest test flight</a> of an eVTOL to date: Its unnamed full-sized prototype aircraft concluded a trip of over 150 miles on a single charge. The test was completed at Joby&#8217;s Electric Flight Base in Big Sur, California, earlier this month. It&#8217;s the latest in a succession of secretive tests the company&#8217;s been conducting, all part of its goal to achieve certification with the Federal Aviation Administration and start commercial operations.</p>
<p><strong>Lilium</strong>, the electric air taxi startup, has tapped German manufacturer Customcells to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/the-lilium-electric-jet-will-use-batteries-manufactured-by-germanys-customcells/">supply batteries</a> for its flagship seven-seater Lilium Jet.</p>
<h3>People stuff</h3>
<p><strong>AEye</strong>, a lidar company, has been adding to its executive team in the past few months. The most recent is the hiring of automotive veteran and former Valeo executive Bernd Reichert as senior vice president of ADAS. the company has also hired Velodyne&#8217;s former COO Rick Tewell, Bob Brown from Cepton and Hod Finkelstein as chief research and design officer from Sense Photonics.</p>
<p><strong>Cruise</strong> is also on a bit of an executive and engineering hiring spree. The company sent me a list of recent folks who have joined including former Southwest Airlines employee Anthony Gregory as VP of market development, Phil Maher, the former Virgin Atlantic COO, as VP of central operations and Bhavini Soneji as VP of product engineering. Soneji was most recently VP of engineering at Headspace, and was at Microsoft and Snapchat before that.</p>
<p>Cruise also hired Vinoj Kumar, who oversaw Google&#8217;s cloud infrastructure and software systems, as VP of Infrastructure and Yuning Chai, former lead perception researcher at Waymo, as head of AI Research. In all, Cruise now employs more than 1,900 people.</p>
<p><strong>Don Burnette</strong>, the co-founder and CEO of self-driving trucks company <strong>Kodiak Robotics</strong>, sat down with TechCrunch as part of our ongoing Q&amp;A series with the founders of transportation startups. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/kodiak-robotics-founder-says-tight-focus-on-autonomous-trucks-is-working/">interview covers a lot of ground</a>, including Burnette&#8217;s views on the company&#8217;s strategy, current funding conditions in the industry and what he learned at Otto. the self-driving trucks startup he co-founded and that was acquired by Uber.</p>

<p>Milton “engaged in a fraudulent scheme to deceive retail investors” for his own personal benefit, according to the federal indictment unsealed by U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan. Milton was charged with two counts of securities fraud and wire fraud by a federal grand jury.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Abu Dhabi-based micromobility company Fenix has acquired Palm, a shared e-scooter company in Turkey, for $5 million – the exact amount the company raised last November and this past February during its seed round.</p>
<p>Despite having not even raised a Series A round yet, Fenix scrounged together the cash and equity needed to fund this buy and stretch into Turkey, calling on additional capital from existing investors Maniv Mobility and Emkan Capital. Fenix would not disclose the terms of the acquisition or how much it recently raised.</p>
<p>This acquisition marks Fenix&#8217;s expansion into its fifth Middle Eastern country and 13th city since its launch last November, making it the largest shared micromobility operator in the region, ahead of regional competitors KIWIride, Careem and Arnab Mobility.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Palm has a meaningful presence in Istanbul, and the city will be a major focus for our company in the near term,&#8221; Jaideep Dhanoa, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Beyond Istanbul, we see tremendous opportunity across Turkey. The country is home to 83 million people and there are 24 cities with a million or more people. Mersin, for example, is another coastal city Palm operates in today where we will continue to invest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Berhan Goskin and <span style="font-weight: 400;">Alican İstanbullu, Palm&#8217;s founders, will continue to lead the company and Fenix&#8217;s expansion plans across Turkey. Existing Palm shareholders will also migrate over and support Fenix&#8217;s efforts to lead the market in Turkey, according to a statement from the company.</span></p>
<p>The Palm acquisition not only hands off Palm&#8217;s fleet of around 1,500 Ninebot e-scooters to Fenix, bringing the startup&#8217;s total vehicle size up to 10,000, but it also gives Fenix a built-in permit with Istanbul, a city of 15.5 million people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Recently the Turkey Ministry of Transport legalized shared e-scooters nationally in a very progressive and pro-competition manner,&#8221; said Dhanoa. &#8220;This regulatory clarity increased the attractiveness of the market for investment and was a significant motivator for the transaction. There are several local market requirements to qualify for a five-year license which is partially why we went in inorganically. With Palm we now have a five-year license for e-scooter sharing in Turkey and expect to receive permits in some of the highest potential  districts in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Istanbul&#8217;s first round of applications for capped e-scooter permits were due earlier this month, so the acquisition means Fenix didn&#8217;t need to apply for a new license. It will, however, have to comply with all local Turkey market requirements.</p>
<p>Fenix says it will begin deploying several thousands of its vehicles, laden with built-in hand sanitizers, in August, adding to Palm&#8217;s existing fleet, which will be rebranded to reflect new ownership. Fenix did not disclose who its manufacturing partner is for its vehicles, but told TechCrunch that it&#8217;s &#8220;not one of the usual suspects&#8221; and that the partnership is exclusive and involves a co-development of custom vehicles for their markets.</p>
<p>As part of its entry into Istanbul, Fenix also has plans to establish an R&amp;D center on the ground for software and hardware in order to &#8220;develop breakthrough technologies for the Turkish market and to export to the Greater Middle East region,&#8221; according to a statement.</p>
<div>&#8220;Turkey has some of the top tech talent in the broader region, and now that we&#8217;ll also be operating there, we&#8217;re excited about leveraging that talent pool to help us craft solutions for the Turkey market, as well as apply them to the rest of our network,&#8221; IQ Sayed, co-founder and CTO, told TechCrunch. &#8220;This holds for all our offerings and all parts of our tech stack, but I&#8217;m especially looking forward to augmenting our payments tech, machine learning and IoT capabilities there.  We will also be looking into local manufacturing opportunities.&#8221;</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nozomi Networks, an industry cybersecurity startup that aims to shield critical infrastructure from cyberattacks, has raised $100 million in pre-IPO funding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The Series D funding round was led by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/triangle-peak-partners">Triangle Peak Partners</a>, and also includes investment from a number of equipment, security, service provider and go-to-market companies including Honeywell Ventures, Keysight Technologies and Porsche Digital.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This funding comes at a critical time for the company. Cyberattacks on industrial control systems (ICS) — the devices necessary for the continued running of power plants, water supplies, and other critical infrastructure — increased both in frequency and severity during the pandemic. Look no further than May and June, which saw ransomware attacks target the IT networks of Colonial Pipeline and meat manufacturing giant JBS, forcing the companies to shut down their industrial operations.</p>
<p>Nozomi Networks, which competes with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/dragos-series-c-industrial-systems-security/">Dragos</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/industrial-cybersecurity-startup-claroty-raises-140m-in-pre-ipo-funding-round/">Claroty</a>, claims its industrial cybersecurity solution, which works to secure ICS devices by detecting threats before they hit, aims to prevent such attacks from happening. It provides real-time visibility to help organizations manage cyber risk and improve resilience for industrial operations.</p>
<p>The technology currently supports more than a quarter of a million devices in sectors such as critical infrastructure, energy, manufacturing, mining, transportation, and utilities, with Nozomi Networks doubling its customer base in 2020 and seeing a 5,000% increase in the number of devices its solutions monitor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The company will use its latest investment, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/27/cybersecurity-firm-nozomi-networks-raises-30m-in-latest-round-of-funding/">which comes less than two years after it secured $30 million in Series C funding</a>, to scale product development efforts as well as its go-to-market approach globally.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Specifically, Nozomi Networks said it plans to grow its sales, marketing, and partner enablement efforts, and upgrade its products to address new challenges in both the OT and IoT visibility and security markets.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Kuda Bank, the London-based, Nigerian-operating startup that is taking on incumbents in the country with a mobile-first, personalised and often cheaper set of banking services built on newer, API-based infrastructure, has been on a growth tear in the last several months, and to fuel its expansion, it has now raised another round of funding. TechCrunch [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.kudabank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kuda Bank</a>, the London-based, Nigerian-operating startup that is taking on incumbents in the country with a mobile-first, personalised and often cheaper set of banking services built on newer, API-based infrastructure, has been on a growth tear in the last several months, and to fuel its expansion, it has now raised another round of funding.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has learned, and confirmed with Kuda, that the startup has closed, via its London entity, a Series B of $55 million &#8212; money that it plans to use to double down not just on new services for Nigeria, but to prepare its launch into more countries on the continent, and in the words of co-founder and CEO Babs Ogundeyi, to build a new take on banking services for &#8220;ever African on the planet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding was made at a valuation of $500 million, and it comes on the back of some impressive early growth for the startup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We’ve been doing a lot of resource deployment has been in our operational entity, in Nigeria. But now we are doubling down on expansion and the idea is to build a strong team for the expansion plans for Kuda,&#8221; Ogundeyi told TechCrunch in an interview. &#8220;We still see Nigeria as an important market and don’t want to be distracted so don’t want to disrupt those operations too much. It’s a strong market and competitive. It’s one that we feel we need to have a strong hold on. So this funding is to invest in expansion and have more experience in the company with relation to expansion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kuda now has 1.4 million registered users, which is more than double the number it had in March when it had 650,000 registered users &#8212; a figure it revealed when announcing its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/kuda-raises-25m-more-led-by-valar-to-become-the-neobank-for-every-african-on-the-planet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series A of $25 million</a> led by Valar Ventures.</p>
<p>We understand that this latest Series B was a relatively quick inside round &#8212; that is, it&#8217;s coming from existing investors. Co-led by Valar Ventures and Target Global, it also includes SBI and a number of previous angels also participating. Kuda was not proactively raising money at the time the Series B was initiated and closed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We felt that Babs and Musty&#8221; &#8212; Musty Mustapha, the co-founder and CTO &#8212; &#8220;are ambitious on another level. For them, it was always about building a pan-African bank, not just a Nigerian leader,&#8221; said Ricardo Schäfer, the partner at Target who led the round for the firm. &#8220;The prospect of banking over 1 billion people from day one really stood out for me at the beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>You might notice that it&#8217;s only been four months since Kuda last announced a round of funding. Equity rounds raised in quick succession, sometimes just months apart, seems to be the order of the day at the moment, fueled in part by a lot of money being pumped into venture at the moment, but also by the state of the market. When the company in question is showing all the right growth metrics and is working in a particularly buzzy area, many will strike when the iron is hot. (GoPuff, which last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/gopuff-confirms-new-1b-cash-injection-at-a-15b-valuation-to-expand-its-instant-grocery-delivery-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed a $1 billion raise</a> just months after a previous round, is another example of that happening from a different corner of the world.)</p>
<p>Neobanks &#8212; fintechs building a new generation disruptive of banking services based around more modern interfaces and infrastructure based around the concept of API-driven embedded finance &#8212; have been one of these areas, growing at a rate of nearly 50% annually in terms of revenues and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/neobanking-market-size-worth-722-60-billion-by-2028-cagr-47-7-grand-view-research-inc--808489566.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">projected</a> to be collectively a $723 billion market by 2028.</p>
<p>Within that, we&#8217;re seeing a number of strong players emerging across the globe built on this model &#8212; Nubank out of Brazil, Revolut and N26 in Europe, WeBank in China, Varo and Chime in the U.S. among them. In this regard, Africa may be the last great untapped region when it comes to banking, one reason why Kuda is being eyed up and is seeing strong adoption.</p>
<p>The writing has been on the wall for years. A report from <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/financial%20services/our%20insights/african%20retail%20bankings%20next%20growth%20frontier/roaring-to-life-growth-and-innovation-in-african-retail-banking-web-final.ashx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">McKinsey</a> on banking in Africa in 2018 identified a surge of interest in financial services that were delivered digitally, and that growth would be driven by a rapidly evolving middle class of consumers, while at the same time an ongoing death of accessible financial services for the majority of the population with some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/payments-lending-and-neobanks-rule-fintechs-in-emerging-markets-report-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">300 million people still unbanked on the continent</a>. It&#8217;s these three basic factors on which Kuda has built its own service.</p>
<p>Kuda is not the only one building and raising and growing. Others raising money for new fintech plays include payments company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/africa-has-another-unicorn-as-chipper-cash-raises-100m-series-c-led-by-svb-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chipper Cash</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/30/airtel-africa-gets-an-extra-200m-for-its-mobile-money-business-from-qia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airtel Africa</a>, online lender <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiger-global-leads-42m-series-b-in-nigerian-credit-led-neobank-fairmoney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FairMoney</a> and more.</p>
<p>However, Kuda is unique among the neobanks in that it is building its services with its own banking license in hand.</p>
<p>This means that it can be more flexible and fast-moving when it comes to creating new products or tweaking existing ones, and it gives the company another level of credibility in a region where those who were already banking with incumbents might be more wary of new players.</p>
<p>Indeed, Kuda&#8217;s initial business model was built around providing banking services to people who still also held accounts with incumbent banks: people would have their salaries paid into their old accounts, and then transferred out to be spent and used in other ways via their Kuda accounts. Ogundeyi said that this is gradually shifting and more people are now bringing both paying-in and paying-out to their Kuda accounts.</p>
<p>Ogundeyi would not say which countries would be Kuda&#8217;s next targets. But he did note that its most recently-launched product, Kuda&#8217;s first move into credit by way of an overdraft allowance, is a sign of the things to come.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a unique product, an overdraft that we pre-qualify the most active users for,&#8221; he said. In Q2 it qualified over 200,000 users and pushed out $20 million worth of credit. With a 30-day repayment, he said, so far default has been &#8220;minimal&#8221; because of the company&#8217;s approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;We use all the data we have for a customer and allocate the overdraft proportion based on the customer&#8217;s activities, aiming for it not to be a burden to repay,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Andrew McCormack, a general partner at Valar Ventures who co-founded the firm with Peter Thiel and James Fitzgerald, said that the still-nascent potential of the market, and how Kuda is approaching that, were behind its decision invest in the startup another time.</p>
<p>“Kuda is our first investment in Africa and our initial confidence in the team has been upheld by its rapid growth in the past four months,&#8221; he said. &#8220;With a youthful population eager to adopt digital financial services in the region, we believe that Kuda’s transformative effect on banking will scale across Africa and we’re proud to continue supporting them.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/softbank-backed-indian-insurance-platform-policybazaar-raises-75-million/">online insurance aggregator</a> PolicyBazaar has filed for an initial public offering in which it is seeking to raise $809 million, becoming the fourth startup in the past two months from the South Asian market to explore public markets.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.icicisecurities.com/Upload/ArticleAttachments/PB%20Fintech%20Limited%20-%20DRHP.pdf">papers</a> submitted to the market regulator in India, PolicyBazaar said it is looking to raise $504 million by issuing new shares while the rest will be driven by sale of shares by existing investors.</p>
<p>The 12-year-old startup &#8212; backed by SoftBank, Falcon Edge Capital, Tiger Global, and InfoEdge &#8212; said it may consider raising about $100 million in a pre-IPO round. Softbank plans to sell shares worth over $250 million, while PolicyBazaar founders are looking to sell shares worth $52.7 million, they said in the papers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>PolicyBazaar serves as an aggregator that allows users to compare and buy policies &#8212; across categories including life, health, travel, auto and property &#8212; from dozens of insurers on its website without having to go through conventional agents. It operates in India as well as the Middle East.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2126229" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126229" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2126229 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/policybazaar-website.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="398" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/policybazaar-website.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/policybazaar-website.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/policybazaar-website.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/policybazaar-website.jpg?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/policybazaar-website.jpg?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/policybazaar-website.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2126229" class="wp-caption-text">PolicyBazaar website</p></div></p>
<p>In India only a fraction of the nation’s 1.3 billion people currently have access to insurance and some analysts say that digital firms could prove crucial in bringing these services to the masses. According to rating agency ICRA, insurance products had reached less than 3% of the population as of 2017.</p>
<p>An average Indian makes about $2,100 in a year, according to World Bank. ICRA estimated that of those Indians who had purchased an insurance product, they were spending less than $50 on it in 2017.</p>
<p>&#8220;India’s life insurance market is expected to grow at 18.8% p.a. to reach ₹ 31.9 trillion (US$ 425 billion) in FY2030, driven by favorable macro indicators, rising awareness towards financial products and services, digitization and simplification of products and processes, online channels for distributions, innovations and customizations in products and favorable government policies and regulatory push,&#8221; the startup said in the papers.</p>
<p>In a report early this year, analysts at Bernstein estimated that PolicyBazaar commands 90% of share in the online insurance distribution market. The platform, which competes with Acko as well as Amazon in India, also sells loans, credit cards and mutual funds. The startup says it sells over a million policies a month.</p>
<p>“India has an under-penetrated insurance market. Within the under-penetrated landscape, digital distribution through web-aggregators like Policybazaar forms &lt;1% of the industry. This offers a large headroom for growth,” Bernstein analysts wrote to clients.</p>
<p>Zomato, which had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/food-delivery-firm-zomato-surges-in-key-india-debut/">stellar public debut last month</a>, as well as fintech firms Paytm and MobiKwik have filed for their initial public offerings in recent weeks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian online learning platform Unacademy has raised $440 million in a new financing round as investors double down on the South Asian market and elsewhere following a widening series of regulatory crackdowns in China that wiped hundreds of billions of dollars last month.</p>
<p>Temasek led the Bangalore-based startup’s new financing round &#8212; Series H &#8212; while Mirae Asset and existing investors including SoftBank Vision Fund 2, General Atlantic, Tiger Global as well as Deepinder Goyal of Zomato and Oyo&#8217;s Ritesh Agarwal participated in it, said the startup.</p>
<p>The new round values the six-year-old startup at $3.44 billion, up from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/tiger-global-invests-in-india-unacademy-at-2-billion-valuation/">$2 billion in November last year</a>. The investment brings Unacademy’s to-date raise to about $860 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The online learning platform, which began its journey on YouTube and still uses Google&#8217;s video platform to on-board educators, helps students prepare for competitive exams to get into college, as well as those who are pursuing graduate-level courses.</p>
<p>On its app, students watch live classes from educators and later engage in sessions to review topics in more detail. The startup has over 50,000 educators on its platform, many of whom are very popular on YouTube. These educators help Unacademy sell more subscriptions and in return get a commission, according to industry executives familiar with the business arrangement.</p>
<p>Unacademy has amassed over 6 million monthly active users (over 600,000 of whom pay for the service) in over 10,000 cities in India.</p>
<p>Gaurav Munjal, Unacademy co-founder and chief executive, said the startup will deploy the fresh capital to broaden its bets on new categories such as upskilling, jobs and hiring.</p>
<p>Relevel is &#8220;giving people a path to get their dream job irrespective of their educational background, while Graphy is &#8220;empowering creators to build their online businesses to sell digital goods including NFTs,&#8221; he said in a tweet.</p>
<p>In a recent conversation with TechCrunch, Munjal said he wants Unacademy to become a consumer internet tech giant &#8212; perhaps the &#8220;Tencent of India.&#8221;</p>

<p>The startup competes with scores of firms including Byju&#8217;s, which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/ubs-investment-makes-byjus-the-most-valuable-startup-in-india/">India&#8217;s most valuable startup</a> (at $16.5 billion valuation), TAL-backed Vedantu, Tiger Global-backed Classplus, and Lightspeed Venture-backed Teachmint. (TAL&#8217;s American depositary receipts have dropped to some 70% in recent days from $90 early this year as investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/chinas-regulatory-crackdown-is-good-news-for-startups-aligned-with-ccp-goals/">retreat following China&#8217;s crackdowns</a>.)</p>
<p>All these startups have reported growth in the past year as India &#8212; like most other countries &#8212; enforced lockdowns and closed schools to contain the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2184424" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184424" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2184424 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unacademy-app.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="281" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unacademy-app.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unacademy-app.jpg?resize=150,41 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unacademy-app.jpg?resize=300,82 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unacademy-app.jpg?resize=768,211 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unacademy-app.jpg?resize=680,187 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/unacademy-app.jpg?resize=50,14 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2184424" class="wp-caption-text">Monthly active users of education learning firms&#8217; Android apps in India, according to mobile insight platform App Annie (sourced by TechCrunch from industry execs.)</p></div></p>
<p>At stake is India&#8217;s online education market, which is estimated to generate $5 billion in revenue by 2025 (up from about $1 billion last year), according to analysts at Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>As of last year, there were about 6 million students in India who were paying for an online learning app, a figure Bernstein analysts expect to reach about 70 million by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>Unacademy said last week it was creating a $40 million fund for educators on its platform. &#8220;On Day One (which is today) we already have more than 300 Educators eligible for the Grant which they will get immediately. Over the next few years we will give Grants of over $40M to our Educators,&#8221; said Munjal in a tweet.</p>
<p>The new investment comes at a time when Indian startups are raising record capital and a handful of mature firms are beginning to explore the public markets. Business-to-business commerce and financing startup Ofbusiness said over the weekend it had raised $160 million in a new financing round (led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2) at a valuation of $1.5 billion, becoming the 18th Indian startup to attain the unicorn status, up from 11 last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a blockbuster deal that rocks the fintech world, Square announced today that it is acquiring Australian buy now, pay later giant Afterpay in a $29 billion all-stock deal.</p>
<p>The purchase price is based on the closing price of Square common stock on July 30, which was <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SQ/history?fr=sycsrp_catchall">$247.26</a>. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022, contingent upon certain closing conditions. It values Afterpay at more than 30% premium to its latest closing price of A$96.66.</p>
<p>Square co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey said in a statement that the two fintech behemoths “have a shared purpose.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We built our business to make the financial system more fair, accessible, and inclusive, and Afterpay has built a trusted brand aligned with those principles,” he said in the statement. “Together, we can better connect our Cash App and Seller ecosystems to deliver even more compelling products and services for merchants and consumers, putting the power back in their hands.”</p>
<p>The combination of the two companies would create a payments giant unlike any other. Over the past 18 months, the buy now, pay later space has essentially exploded, appealing especially to younger generations drawn to the idea of not using credit cards or paying interest and instead opting for the installment loans, which have become ubiquitous online and in retail stores.</p>
<p>As of June 30, Afterpay served more than 16 million consumers and nearly 100,000 merchants globally, including major retailers across industries such as fashion, homewares, beauty and sporting goods, among others.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="dDVPBRlkvL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/as-bnpl-startups-raise-a-look-at-klarna-affirm-and-afterpay-earnings/">As BNPL startups raise, a look at Klarna, Affirm and Afterpay earnings</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As BNPL startups raise, a look at Klarna, Affirm and Afterpay earnings&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/as-bnpl-startups-raise-a-look-at-klarna-affirm-and-afterpay-earnings/embed/#?secret=dDVPBRlkvL" data-secret="dDVPBRlkvL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The addition of Afterpay, the companies’ statement said, will “accelerate Square’s strategic priorities” for its Seller and Cash App ecosystems. Square plans to integrate Afterpay into its existing Seller and Cash App business units, so that even “the smallest of merchants” can offer buy now, pay later at checkout. The integration will also give Afterpay consumers the ability to manage their installment payments directly in Cash App. Cash App customers will be able to find merchants and buy now, pay later (BNPL) offers directly within the app.</p>
<p>Afterpay&#8217;s co-founders and co-CEOs Anthony Eisen and Nick Molnar will join Square upon closure of the deal and help lead Afterpay’s respective merchant and consumer businesses. Square said it will appoint one Afterpay director to its board.</p>
<p>Shareholders of Afterpay will get 0.375 shares of Square Class A stock for every share they own. This implies a price of about A$126.21 per share based on Square&#8217;s Friday close, according to the companies.</p>
<p>Will there be more consolidation in the space? That remains to be seen, and Twitter is all certainly abuzz about what deals could be next. Here in the U.S., rival Affirm (founded by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/affirm-doubles-after-starting-to-trade-despite-strong-ipo-pricing/">went public earlier this year</a>. On July 30, shares closed at $56.32, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AFRM/?fr=sycsrp_catchall">significantly lower</a> than its opening price and 52-week-high of $146.90. Meanwhile, European competitor Klarna — which is growing rapidly in the U.S. — in June <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/fintech-giant-klarna-raises-639m-at-a-45-6b-valuation/">raised another $639 million</a> at a staggering post-money valuation of $45.6 billion.</p>
<p>No doubt the BNPL fight for the U.S. consumer is only heating up with this deal.</p>
