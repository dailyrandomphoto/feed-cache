										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese automaker Geely Automobile Holdings is launching a new brand of premium electric vehicles as it aims to capture a share of the luxury EV market that has been dominated by Tesla and other homegrown companies.</p>
<p>The new brand of vehicles, called Zeekr, will be manufactured by parent company Zhejiang Geely Holding Group. The first Zeekr vehicles are expected to be delivered in the third quarter of 2021.</p>
<p>The launch of Zeekr, which was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-geely-electric-exclusive/exclusive-targeting-tesla-chinas-geely-to-launch-new-premium-ev-brand-sources-idUSKBN2BB054">first reported by Reuters</a> and confirmed today by Geely, has been couched as a bid to take on Tesla in China. Tesla has had success in the country, reporting in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm">a recent regulatory filing</a> that sales in China more than doubled last year, from $2.9 billion in 2019 to $6.6 billion in 2020. But Tesla is hardly the only competition in China, the world’s largest market for electric vehicles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zeekr will have to jostle with domestic start-ups Li Auto and NIO that also offer luxury car models. While Geely remained the highest-selling Chinese auto brand by units sold in 2020 – its fourth consecutive year in the top spot – net profits dropped 32% last year, according to financial results posted Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Zeekr marque will be manufactured by Geely Holding using its Sustainable Experience Architecture, an open-source EV technology that the company said offers driving ranges of up to 435 miles (700 km) as well as smart connectivity options. Geely has plans to deploy the architecture across its nine automotive brands (the company is a minority shareholder of Daimler AG and owner of Volvo Cars) – and sell to other manufacturers.</p>
<p>Eric Li, founder of Geely Holding, said in a statement that the company intends to make the architecture accessible to other car makers.</p>
<p>The SEA platform is just one piece of Geely’s plans to position itself as a leading source of electric vehicle manufacturing and technology. Last month, Geely and Volvo Cars announced they had axed plans to merge but will instead set up a standalone company that will develop next-gen hardware and software for electric vehicles across its brands and with other manufacturers. The two companies will also jointly source batteries and electric motors under the new collaboration.</p>
<p>Geely Holding is also setting the stage to take on a larger role in manufacturing for other car companies, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/foxconn-geely-team-up-to-build-electric-autonomous-and-shared-vehicles-for-automakers-startups/">plans for a joint venture</a> with Chinese company Foxconn Technology Group – Apple’s main supplier – aimed at contract manufacturing for automakers. Geely said it would partner with Chinese tech giant Baidu in a separate venture to build EVs, also with its SEA platform. Baidu has been developing intelligent driving technologies, including autonomous driving, which it said it would contribute to the new company.</p>
<p>Zeekr will be jointly owned by the subsidiary and its parent with a 51% and 49% share structure, with a joint investment of 2 billion yuan ($307 million).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Soft robotics have long been one of the more exciting categories among emerging technologies. Of course, as with most new tech, the field has some drawbacks over more traditional models. While they improve flexibility and complains over their more rigid counterparts, robots made of soft materials have often had an issue delivering electrical connectivity. In many cases, water and air-filled bladders are used to helped facilitate movement.</p>
<p><a href="https://engineering.cmu.edu/news-events/news/2021/03/11-touch-of-silver.html">New research</a> out of Carnegie Mellon University points to a method that could help increase conductivity in soft materials like hydrogels, without compromising the compliance at the core of the material’s appeal.</p>
<p>Recently <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/9/eabd3440">highlighted in a science journal</a>, the method essentially adds micrometer-sized silver flakes into the mix through a method similar to screen printing. When the material is partially dehydrated, the flakes begin forming connections that can be used to deliver a charge. The team describes the flakes as akin to, “a second layer of nervous tissue over your skin.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2129036" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/0311-em-touch-of-silver-01.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></p>
<p>“With its high electrical conductivity and high compliance or ‘squishiness,’ this new composite can have many applications in bioelectronics and beyond,” mechanical engineer professor Carmel Majidi said in a release tied to the news. “Examples include a sticker for the brain that has sensors for signal processing, a wearable energy generation device to power electronics, and stretchable displays.”</p>
<p>There are a ton of potential uses for soft robotics, but medical remains one of the most compelling. Treatment of motor disabilities and muscular disorders are among those highlighted by the team, including assistance for stroke patients and people suffering from Parkinson’s-related tremor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Well before the rumors, we knew this day was coming. After several generations of smartwatches and a handful of headphones, the smartwatch was the next logical step for OnePlus.</p>
<p>At today’s big launch event, the company made its first major wearable official, sporting the decidedly pared-down name, OnePlus Watch. As the title implies, the smartwatch is not a particularly flashy one. It has a minimalist design and, at $159, a price to match.</p>
<p>What’s perhaps most interesting here is the operating system. The Watch will be running the equally straightforwardly named OnePlus Watch OS. Google’s Wear OS was obviously the low-hanging fruit here. And then, after that, Tizen, which Samsung has used for several generations of Galaxy Watches.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead, the company opted to build its own operating system on top of RTOS (real-time operating system). CEO Pete Lau addressed the subject not long ago in a OnePlus forum, writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>We chose to go with a smart wear operating system developed based on RTOS because we believe it provides you a smooth and reliable experience while offering a great battery life, covering some of the biggest concerns we&#8217;ve been hearing from people looking to buy a smartwatch.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2128693" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128693" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2128693 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1046" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png 11747w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=147,150 147w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=294,300 294w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=768,785 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=666,680 666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=1504,1536 1504w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=2005,2048 2005w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/OnePlus-Watch-still-1.png?resize=64,64 64w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2128693" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> OnePlus</p></div></p>
<p>The battery aspect certainly rings true. That continues to be one of the largest hang-ups for smartwatches, particularly as companies continue to add features. According to the press materials, the 402 mAh battery gives the Watch anywhere between one to two weeks of life on a charge, which is a pretty impressive claim (we have yet to get our hands on a review unit to test this out). That would put it on par with many fitness bands.</p>
<p>There are a slew of sensors on board, measuring different health metrics, including heart rate and blood oxygen, accessible through OnePlus’s Health app. There’s 4GB of storage, half of which can be used for things like music. The Watch is rated IP68 waterproof.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard configuration, the company is also introducing a Cobalt model, which swaps the stainless steel body for a strong cobalt alloy, coupled with scratch-resistant sapphire glass.</p>
<p>The wearable will go on sale in North America on April 14.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cameras have long been the battleground on which the smartphone wars have been fought. Short of any left-field innovation like folding screens or strange form factors, that looks likely to continue to be the case for the foreseeable future. Year after year and generation after generation, companies tout imaging breakthroughs to set themselves apart.</p>
<p>It makes sense. Smartphones have improved to a point where flagship devices are, as a rule, pretty good. And while cameras have been a part of those improvements, there’s still a lot of room for improvement, both in terms of hardware and the software/AI that augments it. Recently, OnePlus announced that it would be recruiting a big name to help it in that fight.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AXf85mNO8o"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/07/oneplus-recruits-hasselblad-for-three-year-smartphone-imaging-deal/">OnePlus recruits Hasselblad for 3-year smartphone imaging deal</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;OnePlus recruits Hasselblad for 3-year smartphone imaging deal&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/07/oneplus-recruits-hasselblad-for-three-year-smartphone-imaging-deal/embed/#?secret=AXf85mNO8o" data-secret="AXf85mNO8o" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Earlier this month, the Chinese smartphone maker unveiled a three-year deal with Hasselblad, one of the most iconic names in the photography space. Announced at an event today, the company’s new OnePlus 9 series will be the first handset to sport the early fruits of the $150 million deal.</p>
<p>The deal makes sense from a strategic standpoint. After all, OnePlus’s transformation from a high-end budget device to flagship competitor has put companies like Apple and Samsung in its sights. Both of those companies have established and long-standing imaging departments for their hardware, so in addition to a clear branding partnership, this does seem to be an earnest attempt to level the playing field.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2128614" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128614" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2128614" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9055-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9055-2.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9055-2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9055-2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9055-2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9055-2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9055-2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/CMC_9055-2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2128614" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>It’s worth noting, up top, that the days of being the budget alternative are, to a degree, gone. The OnePlus 9 starts at $729 and the Pro starts at $969. As smartphone pricing goes, that’s toward the lower-end of premium devices, but after the introduction of the Nord, it seems safe to say that budget will no longer be a primary differentiator for OnePlus’s primary line.</p>
<p>Naturally, the OnePlus 9 Pro gets the most benefit from these early stages of the Hasselblad deal. The primary camera sports a 48-megapixel Sony sensor, coupled with improved focus speeds and increased color accuracy. The ultrawide camera has a 50-megapixel sensor (also Sony), with a lens designed to reduce distortion. Interestingly, the company says it’s also effective for shooting close macro shots with distances as close as 4cm.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Will Apple&#8217;s spectacular iPhone 12 sales figures boost the smartphone industry in 2021?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/will-apples-spectacular-iphone-12-sales-figures-boost-the-smartphone-industry-in-2021/embed/#?secret=xp9UMqdEbx" data-secret="xp9UMqdEbx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The third primary camera is an eight-megapixel telephoto capable of up to 30x digital zoom (though you’re going to lose a fair bit of information). There’s a fourth monochrome camera, as well, which primarily serves to help improve black and white shots. The standard OnePlus 9 has a similar setup, though you’ll drop that telephoto lens.</p>
<p>Here’s OnePlus on what Hasselblad is bringing to the table this time out:</p>
<blockquote><p>The new Hasselblad Pro Mode offers incredibly accurate and natural color for a solid foundation for post-editing. It has been revamped with a new user interface based on Hasselblad’s image processing software to give professional-level users a unique Hasselblad look and feel. It also allows for an unprecedented amount of control for expert photographers to fine-tune their photos, with the ability to adjust ISO, focus, exposure time, white balance and more. Users can also shoot in 12- bit RAW format for 64-times the color compared with 10-bit RAW traditionally found in other smartphones.</p></blockquote>

<p>Keep in mind, the partnership is still in its early stages, and much of the money is going toward R&amp;D, so we’ll probably be seeing more integration down the road.</p>
<p>The display is the same as the one found in the OnePlus 8T. That’s a 6.55-inch AMOLED with a 120Hz refresh rate. Brightness maxes out at 1,100 nits, and the screen sports HDR10+ certification. There’s a Snapdragon 888 inside, coupled with 8 or 12GB of RAM and 128 or 256GB of storage. Both models feature a solid 4,500 mAh battery that goes from empty to 100% charge in 29 minutes.</p>
<p>Pre-orders start March 26. The handsets will ship April 2.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to fast-moving technology, mobility zooms ahead of the pack — both literally and figuratively. Early-stage startup founders and investors need to keep their fingers on the sector’s very rapid pulse and the best place to do that is, you guessed it, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=startuppackages&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=post03_startuppackage&amp;display=true">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> on June 9.</p>

</ul>
<p>Keeping with the networking theme, this is how Karin Maake, senior director of communications at FlashParking, described her experience.</p>
<blockquote><p>“TC Sessions: Mobility isn&#8217;t just an educational opportunity, it&#8217;s a real networking opportunity. Everyone was passionate and open to creating pilot programs or other partnerships. That was the most exciting part. And now — thanks to a conference connection — we’re talking with Goodyear&#8217;s Innovation Lab.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Don’t miss your chance to sashay your superior stuff in front of the mobility industry’s leading mover, shakers and makers. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=startuppackages&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=post03_startuppackage&amp;display=true">Buy a Startup Exhibitor Package now</a>, save 35 percent and get ready for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=startuppackages&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=post03_startuppackage&amp;display=true">TC Sessions Mobility 2021</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[There's a lot of news this morning, so let's discuss all the big dollars before YC demo day kicks off.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s demo day for the current Y Combinator class, so we&#8217;ll have a largely early-stage focus at TechCrunch today. But there&#8217;s also a host of late- and super-late-stage news this morning that matters.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get to all of it before we start to talk accelerators, overheated pre-seed valuations and the like.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>There are three things to discuss. First, the possible $10 billion exit of Discord to Microsoft. Discord is a <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/discord/company_financials">well-financed unicorn</a> that has raised oodles of capital and reportedly sports rapidly expanding revenues. Our goal will be to vet whether the price tag in question makes any sense, or if it is too low.</p>
<p>Second: Real estate-tech company Compass has set an IPO price range we need to explore. Is its resulting valuation strong? Does it line up with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/compass-files-for-ipo/">recent financial performance</a>?</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>And, third, Intermedia Cloud Communications has priced its IPO. We&#8217;re behind on this entire debut, so we&#8217;ll take a second to riff on what the company does and what it is worth.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a lot. But if we don&#8217;t get through it all now, we&#8217;ll fall behind and feel silly later. Let&#8217;s get to work!</p>
<h2>Discord and Microsoft</h2>
<p>Microsoft might be getting good at community, which is an odd thing to say about the enterprise software and cloud computing giant. The company&#8217;s Xbox gaming ecosystem has survived the test of time, Github is doing fine under Microsoft&#8217;s auspices, and Minecraft seems unharmed by Redmond&#8217;s stewardship.</p>
<p>That means gamers, developers and kids are all content to hang with Satya Nadella and company. Adding Discord to the mix might give Microsoft even more tooling to augment its existing communities, or perhaps tie them more closely together. But that&#8217;s all product news, which isn&#8217;t our remit. Let&#8217;s talk numbers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/23/technology/microsoft-discord-deal.html">The New York Times</a> reported that Discord has &#8220;held deal talks with Microsoft for a transaction that could top $10 billion.&#8221; That figure has been widely reported, so we&#8217;ll use it for our work.</p>
<p>With a possible valuation in hand, we need revenue numbers to figure out if the possible sale price makes any sense. Happily, we have somewhat fresh numbers: The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-social-network-without-ads-discord-defies-convention-11615199401">Wall Street Journal reported</a> earlier this month that &#8220;generated $130 million in revenue [in 2020], up from nearly $45 million in 2019.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://onetrust.com/">OneTrust</a>, a late stage privacy platform startup, announced it was adding ethics and compliance to the mix this morning by acquiring Convercent, a company that was built to help build more ethical organizations. The companies did not share the purchase price.</p>
<p>OneTrust <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/onetrust-nabs-300m-series-c-on-5-1b-valuation-to-expand-privacy-platform/">just raised $300 million</a> on a fat $5.1 billion valuation at the end of last year, and it&#8217;s putting that money to work with this acquisition. Alan Dabbiere, co-chairman at OneTrust sees this acquisition as a way to add a missing component to his company&#8217;s growing platform of services.</p>
<p>&#8220;OneTrust instantly brings a proven ethics and compliance technology, team, and customer base into the OneTrust, further aligning the Chief Ethics &amp; Compliance Officer strategy alongside privacy, data governance, third-party risk, GRC (governance, risk and compliance), and ESG (environmental, social and governance) to build trust as a competitive advantage,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Convercent brings 750 customers and 150 employees to the OneTrust team along with its ethics system, which includes a way for employees to report ethical violations to the company and a tool for managing disclosures.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Convercent wants to make it easier for companies to measure ethical behavior&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/14/converscent-wants-to-make-it-easier-for-companies-to-measure-ethical-behavior/embed/#?secret=r9iByA1WEr" data-secret="r9iByA1WEr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Convercent can also use data to help surface bad behavior before it&#8217;s been reported. As CEO Patrick Quinlan explained <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/14/converscent-wants-to-make-it-easier-for-companies-to-measure-ethical-behavior/">in a 2018 TechCrunch article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Sometimes you have this interactive code of conduct, where there’s a new vice president in a region and suddenly page views on the sexual harassment section of the Code of Conduct have increased 200% in the 90 days after he started. That’s easy, right? There’s a reason that’s happening, and our system will actually tell you what’s happening.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Quinlan wrote <a href="https://www.convercent.com/blog/next-stop-trust-onetrust">in a company blog post</a> announcing the deal that joining forces with OneTrust will give it the resources to expand its vision.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a part of OneTrust, we’ll be combining forces with the leader across privacy, security, data governance, third-party risk, GRC, ESG—and now—ethics and compliance. Our customers will now be able to build centralized programs across these workstreams to make trust a competitive differentiator,&#8221; Quinlan wrote.</p>
<p>Convercent was founded in 2012 and has raised over $100 million, according to Pitchbook data. OneTrust was founded in 2016. It has over 8000 customers and 150 employees and has raised $710 million, according to the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple this morning <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/03/apple-expands-free-professional-learning-to-help-teachers-champion-creativity/">announced</a> a handful of education-related updates to its suite of classroom apps as well as a new recognition for teachers, called the Apple Teacher Portfolio. Teachers who complete a total of nine lessons where they learn foundational skills on iPad and Mac to become an officially recognized Apple Teacher will be able to submit their portfolio of lesson examples to earn the Apple Teacher Portfolio recognition. They can then also share their portfolio with their colleagues or use it to showcase their work.</p>
<p>Teachers can work towards acquiring the badge through the Apple Teacher Learning Center, which is Apple&#8217;s self-paced learning platform for educators. This offering is designed to help teachers learn how to incorporate Apple technologies in the classroom, including by using iPad and Mac apps for creating art, videos, animations, recordings, page layouts, podcasts, data trackers, music, and more. Across the lessons, Apple provides templates as examples which teachers can customize or combine to make their own projects that use either an iPad or Mac and Apple software like Keynote, GarageBand, iMovie, and others.</p>

<p>In addition, Apple today rolled out updates across its Schoolwork and Classroom apps, as well as its &#8220;Everyone Can Create&#8221; curriculum, which has historically focused on taking advantage of Apple&#8217;s creative tools like iMovie, Clips and GarageBand.</p>
<p>In Schoolwork, teachers will gain the option to share Schoolwork projects with colleagues by exporting their assignments, which can then be imported back into Schoolwork or other platforms. Other improvements have been made to the sidebar navigation to make it quicker to access classes, assignments and student accounts.</p>
<p>Classroom, meanwhile, has been updated for remote learning &#8212; a feature that would have been more useful to have rolled out in 2020, amid the height of U.S. lockdowns during the pandemic. With the update, teachers will be able to invite remote students to Classroom sessions where they&#8217;ll be able to guide them to apps, view their screen (with the student&#8217;s permission) and track their engagement. The software has also been rebuilt using Mac Catalyst, making it work across iPad and Mac, including Macs powered by Apple&#8217;s M1 chips.</p>
<p>The Everyone Can Create&#8221; curriculum has had a number of smaller updates. Its Drawing guide has been updated to include motion graphics and animation in Keynote, while Photos now covers the creation of animated GIFs using Keynote, and the Camera and Photos apps. The Video guide will now explore creating short films using a green screen and other special effects, and Music adds new podcasting features using GarageBand, Apple says. Today, more than 5,000 K-12 institutions worldwide are using the curriculum.</p>

<p>Apple last year had <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/21/apple-schoolwork-classroom-distance-learning/">updated</a> its Schoolwork and Classroom apps, with some updates to Schoolwork to support distance learning &#8212; like managing assignments over the cloud and support for calling students via FaceTime, for example. But even as the pandemic forced schools towards remote learning, Google jumped ahead of edtech rivals by aggressively giving away its software and courting teachers. Its low-cost Chromebooks were being given out across school districts, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chromebook-shipments-double-due-to-pandemic-193424657.html">doubling demand</a> in 2020. Google Classroom, meanwhile, doubled to more than 100 million active users by April 2020, Bloomberg Quint <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/google-widens-lead-in-education-market-as-students-rush-online">reported</a>. As of Feb. 2021, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/google-to-roll-out-slate-of-over-50-updates-for-classroom-meet-and-other-online-education-tools/">Google said</a> the service was being used by over 150 million students, teachers and admins, up from just 40 million last year.</p>
<p>Apple didn&#8217;t say today how many users it has for its own educational software programs, by comparison. However, by encouraging teachers to create a portfolio which they can then share, Apple is helping to push towards greater adoption of its tools by more directly involving educators in the process.</p>
<p>Apple Teacher Portfolio launched today and is available in the Apple Teacher Learning Center. The &#8220;Everyone Can Create guides&#8221; are a free download on Apple Books. And new versions of both Schoolwork and Classroom are available in beta now through AppleSeed for IT.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Augmented Reality pioneer <a href="https://www.blippar.com">Blippar</a> &#8211; which has had a tortuous history after early investors pulled out and the company had to scramble for new backers &#8211; has now closed a $5 million funding round, after 18 months of re-positioning as a B2B company in the AR space.</p>
<p>The pre-Series A round was co-led by Chroma Ventures and West Coast Capital. Canadian entrepreneur Anthony Lacavera also participated via his Globalive Capital investment firm. Chroma is the investment arm of Paddy Burns’ and Chris van der Kuyl’s gaming company 4J Studios, while West Coast is the private equity arm of Scottish entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter and family.</p>
<p>The new investors join existing shareholder Candy Ventures; the multi-stage investment firm founded by British property entrepreneur Nick Candy, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/blippar-finds-life-after-death-as-former-investor-buys-assets-to-relaunch-ar-startup/">who came to Blippar’s rescue</a>. This new entity acquired the company’s assets in a patent sale and managed to keep on sounder Ambarish Mitra, although he is now acting as the company’s “Chief Creative Officer”. At hits height, Blippar burned through $130 million in funding, claiming a $1.5 billion valuation, and tried to crack the consumer AR market. But Blippbuilder, its SaaS AR creation platform, is the asset that is now seeing it make a B2B comeback.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At its height Blippar employed 340 people, Now it’s 30 people. But it has all the IP and assets from its previous incarnation, and is now ‘making hay while the sun shines’.</p>
<p>AR technology is now being used in several areas such as live events (when they return!) retail, FMCG, automotive, healthcare and education.</p>
<p>Rumoured AR glasses from Apple and the inclusion of AR results in mobile search results may well help its adoption, as well as the continuing need for social distancing.</p>
<p>While the tech giants are developing AR tools, these are platform-dependent, whereas Blippar hopes to be the agnostic alternative.</p>
<p>Its two routes to market are, firstly, via its Blippbuilder SAAS platform, which enables agencies, brands and AR content creators to create communications and campaigns. It also does bespoke work with an in-house team “Studio B”.</p>
<p>Faisal Galaria, CEO of Blippar, commented: “We are very excited to have attracted investors of this caliber to Blippar… 2020 was a transformative year for Blippar with a 200% increase in revenue quarter on quarter, continued strengthening of the senior leadership team, and delivery of cutting-edge AR campaigns for major global brands including OnePlus, Kellogg’s and Dr Pepper. We have leveraged our 10 years of investment, provenance, and technology leadership in the AR space to come back leaner, more focussed and better than ever before.”</p>
<p>Burns and Van der Kuyl are best known for porting Minecraft to the Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo games consoles. The latter said in a statement: “The immersive nature of AR makes it one of the most important use cases for the gaming industry. Blippar’s AR technology is by far the most advanced and innovative that I’ve seen in years and there is huge potential for AR to power the ultimate gaming experience of the future. We look forward to being part of the Blippar journey.”</p>
<p>Hunter commented: “Blippar has demonstrated strong progress with the turnaround plan put in place by Faisal and the team, and the business is now well placed to maximize the opportunities presented by the growing AR ecosystem hence we are delighted to invest.”</p>
<p>In addition, Justin Cooke, Venture Partner at tech investor Northzone, has also been appointed to the Blippar Board this month. The UK Government also has a minority equity stake in Blippar via its Future Fund match funding scheme&lt; which was design to assist struggling tech companies through the pandemic.</p>
<p>Blippar re-enters a market which includes Niantic, Unreal, Unity, 8th Wall, Zappar and Magic Leap. But as AR matures, it may be back in the right place.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how brands are using the platform:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the third greatest television show of all time (sorry <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-lists/100-greatest-tv-shows-of-all-time-105998/veep-101740/"><em>Rolling Stone</em></a>), one of Texas&#8217; most famous fictional football players <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/2761467/friday-night-lights-flip-this-qb-flip-that-house/">once said</a>, &#8220;When all the scared rats are leaving a sinking market, that&#8217;s when a real entrepreneur steps in &#8212; a true visionary.&#8221;</p>
<p>If that&#8217;s the case, then the startup renewable energy retail reseller <a href="https://www.arcadia.com/">Arcadia</a> may be a true visionary. Even as <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/AG-Ken-Paxton-sues-Griddy-alleging-deceptive-15988077.php#:~:text=sighting%20in%20Gulf-,ERCOT%20shuts%20down%20Griddy%2C%20as%20Paxton%20sues,retailer%20over%20'deceptive%20business%20practices'&amp;text=March%201%2C%202021%20Updated%3A%20March,2%2C%202021%202%3A33%20p.m.&amp;text=The%20Electric%20Reliability%20Council%20of,effectively%20shutting%20down%20the%20company.">energy startups servicing customers throughout the great state of Texas are forced to throw in the towel</a>, the Washington-based, consumer-focused renewable energy power provider (based on renewable energy certificates purchased on the open market), is making an acquisition to enter the Texas market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company is buying <a href="http://realsimpleenergy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://realsimpleenergy.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616587927486000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFGnDWF-CX7Q_PKdWyrNUreHg1FoQ">Real Simple Energy</a>, which not only marks the company&#8217;s availability in all 50 states, but gives Real Simple Energy customers access to both wind and solar power generating projects. The company said it  will leverage Real Simple Energy&#8217;s platform and expertise to secure the best rates for members, monitor for better savings, and provide a smarter yet simpler energy experience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Recent events in the Texas market prove that customers shouldn’t be exposed to wholesale or variable rates, and want an energy advocate to protect them,” said Kiran Bhatraju, CEO and Founder of Arcadia. “Both Arcadia and Real Simple Energy recognize the challenges Texas homeowners and renters have historically faced in the energy buying process, and we remain committed to removing these confusing barriers.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Texans have consistently paid more for power than consumers that buy their energy from regulated market participants thanks to the state&#8217;s disastrously deregulated power markets. The combined companies are pitching fixed rate contracts to Texas consumers that won&#8217;t be vulnerable to bill spikes, but will offer average savings above the flat rates regulated utilities offer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The deregulated energy industry, especially in Texas, has underserved customers and as a result, most customers overpay for electricity and receive poor customer service. Using technology, we are helping customers realize the promise of deregulation and always get the best fixed rates available,&#8221; said Trent Crow, CEO of Real Simple Energy, in a statement. “As industry veterans, joining forces with Arcadia will allow us to get better deals for customers and enhance our customer experience.  We manage 100% of the energy experience and become a customer’s independent agent and advocate so they never have to worry about their electricity bill again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deal is Arcadia&#8217;s first acquisition and follows the company&#8217;s launch of a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/arcadia-expands-residential-community-solar-to-maine-301240000.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/arcadia-expands-residential-community-solar-to-maine-301240000.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1616587927486000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEyodXKZ0kzODVLerFPoyuGUzCBaQ">community solar program</a> all the way across the country in the great state of Maine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://huckleberry.com/">Huckleberry</a>, an insurtech company that offers a variety of insurance to small businesses, has announced a partnership with Berkshire Hathaway GUARD. This represents the biggest partnership with a carrier for the startup to date.</p>
<p>The startup, cofounded by Bryan O&#8217;Connell, has made some major moves in the past year. The company launched in 2017 offering workers compensation and general liability insurance to small and medium-sized businesses through an online portal, cutting out a lot of the hassle for these businesses as they seek out the right policy.</p>
<p>In the last year, the SF-based company has nearly doubled its geographic footprint and added five new policies to the product suite, including cyber, automotive insurance, umbrella insurance and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Moreover, it&#8217;s moving to New York and opening up an office in Columbus, Ohio, called HQ2. O&#8217;Connell says that the move to New York is all about positioning the startup in the midst of NYC&#8217;s burgeoning pool of fintech talent.</p>
<p>With the new partnership and the company&#8217;s growth over the past year, it&#8217;s bringing on new team members, with plans to get to 100 people by the beginning of 2022. In particular, it&#8217;s brought on Bill Kaper as Chief Technology Officer. Kaper hails from Root Insurance, where he served as VP of Engineering and oversaw a team of 200+ engineers. Huckleberry also snagged Braden Davis, formerly of Jetty, as Chief Insurance Officer.</p>
<p>The company raised $18 million in Series A capital back in December of 2019, with investors that include Tribe Capital, with participation from Amaranthine, Crosslink Capital and Uncork Capital.</p>

<p>The momentum from the new hires and partnership with Berkshire Hathaway will allow Huckleberry to move into higher risk insurance categories.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.userinterviews.com/">User Interviews</a>, the Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator-backed company that has built a CRM for product developers to get user feedback, has closed on a $10 million Series A round. The financing was led by Teamworthy Ventures, with participation from Las Olas, Accomplice, FJ Labs, ERA, Trestle Partners and ValueStream.</p>
<p>The company, cofounded by <a href="https://twitter.com/baself90">Basel Fakhoury</a>, was created out of failure, in some ways. Originally, the User Interviews team started with a project called Mobile Suites, an amenities logistics platform for hotels. It was a dud, and the team — Basel Fakhoury, Dennis Meng and Bob Saris — decided to do more user research before determining their next product.</p>
<p>In trying to collect that research, they stumbled upon a huge problem. It often takes companies weeks, if not months, to conduct a study around user research. The company decided to build out a platform that would procure subjects for research quickly and effectively, using an algorithm to pair qualified, engaged testers with the client.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The product became Recruit, and ran on an a la carte model. To complement Recruit, the team also launched Research Hub, which is a CRM tool for all the testing methodologies used with actual users. To be clear, User Interviews doesn&#8217;t run the surveys or A/B tests themselves, but rather helps companies manage the frequency and data of those tests, not unlike what Salesforce does for sales people.</p>
<p>Recently, User Interviews added a subscription layer to its product, allowing companies to purchase access to the software on an annual basis, rather than on a usage basis. Fakhoury says that this dual-model allows companies to try out the platform before they fully commit.</p>

<p>According to the startup, the company has experienced 140 percent annual growth, which has accelerated during the pandemic. Clients include Amazon, Microsoft, Colgate and Spotify.</p>
<p>User Interviews plans on using the new funding to hire more in the product department, as well as build out integrations with user testing software and their clients own data management systems.</p>
<p>Right now, the team is about 50 people, and is fully remote, with nearly half the workforce being female.</p>
<p>Fakhoury said the biggest challenge for the company is being able to do two things at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are simultaneously disrupting this legacy industry with Recruit, and we are creating a category with Research Hub,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those are somewhat different strategies and missions and making sure that we can do both of those in tandem is one big thing for us.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last fall, delivery startup <a href="https://gopuff.com">goPuff</a> made a big splash by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gopuff-funding/">raising $380 million in funding</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/gopuff-acquires-bevmo/">acquiring West Coast beverage retailer BevMo</a> shortly afterwards. Just a few months later, the Philadelphia-based company is announcing that it has raised another $1.15 billion in funding at an $8.9 billion valuation (compared to $3.9 billion in October).</p>
<p>Available in more than 650 U.S. cities, goPuff delivers a wide variety of products in under 30 minutes while charging a flat $1.95 delivery fee. Rafael Ilishayev and Yakir Gola, who serve as co-CEOs, founded the company in 2013 while they were students at Drexel University. When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gopuff-funding/">I first spoke to Gola last fall</a>, he told me that the pair thought, &#8220;There has to be a better way to get convenience products delivered.”</p>
<p>The company now says its vertically integrated approach is a key advantage. GoPuff buys products directly from manufacturers, then distributes those products through its 250-plus &#8220;micro-fulfillment centers&#8221; and a network of independent drivers. Ilishayev said this results in rapid deliveries, strong unit economics, and a model that passes delivery fees directly to drivers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important that we&#8217;re making our margin on product, not people,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The company continues to expand its product lineup new Better For You (healthy snacks), Beauty and Baby categories, as well as<a href="https://gopuff.com/mystery_box"> Curated Mystery Boxes</a>. When I asked how new products fit into the larger goPuff brand and strategy, Ilishayev replied, &#8220;People, throughout our whole existence, have tried to put us into an industry: &#8216;Are you convenience? Are you pharmacy?&#8217; The reality is that we&#8217;re neither. We&#8217;re in this category of instant needs, and our production innovation solely stems from consumer demand &#8230; There&#8217;s no category we offer on goPuff that consumers weren&#8217;t crying out for.&#8221;</p>
<p>GoPuff says that the new funding will allow it to continue expanding throughout the United States, as well as internationally, and to introduce new products. The round comes from D1 Capital Partners, Fidelity Management and Research Company, Baillie Gifford, Eldridge, Reinvent Capital, Luxor Capital and SoftBank Vision Fund 1.</p>
<p>In a statement, D1 founder and Chief Investment Officer Daniel Sundheim said:</p>
<blockquote><p>goPuff is truly in a league of its own. We believe that the company&#8217;s vision and differentiated model drive industry-leading economics and sustainable growth. Since we initially invested in goPuff last fall, we have been consistently impressed by the team’s ability to successfully execute against its growth plans. The company&#8217;s potential is tremendous, and we look forward to the unique opportunities that lie ahead.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a few twists and turns and then ultimately cancelling its F8 developer conference last year over Covid-19 concerns, Facebook today announced a return of the event in a virtual-only format it is calling F8 Refresh. The company today said that it will be holding it as a <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2021/03/23/join-us-f8-refresh-june-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-day event on June 2</a>. You can sign up for F8 Refresh <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/f8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a mark of the times to be right-sizing everything to the place we are in right now. So although F8 has grown in size and scope over the years &#8212; it typically attracts around 5,000 people and many more to its in-person event &#8212; it looks like the social network is taking 2021 to be a little more modest in its approach.</p>
<p>Mark is maybe the operative word here: there will be no Mark Zuckerberg keynote this year, Facebook has confirmed to me. Instead of words from its founder and CEO, Facebook will have Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, VP of Platform Partnerships, delivering the opening presentation at the event, which will as usual provide some updates on new launches for the platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s another sign of the times that making plans so far in advance, and in person, just won&#8217;t cut it right now: there have been too many unexpected developments around the spread, then wane, then resurgence of the pandemic, and even one year later, in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-56486732" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple parts</a> of the world authorities are still trying to get activity <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/21/us/miami-beach-curfew-spring-break.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">under control</a> to keep the virus in <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-boris-johnson-warns-europes-third-wave-will-hit-uk-but-is-reassured-eu-doesnt-want-jabs-blockade-12253582" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check</a>.</p>
<p>In the past, Facebook has given much more lead time to people for F8, to let developers, partners and other attendees to clear their calendars and organize travel from further afield. Its 2020 two-day event, which had originally been scheduled for May 2020, was announced in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/facebook-announces-dates-for-its-2020-f8-developers-conference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">November 2019</a> for example. Of course, in the months following, as Covid-19 took its grip, F8 2020 became one of a wave of events to be cancelled, with Facebook first looking to replace it with a series of local events, but then cancelling everything altogether.</p>
<p>&#8220;F8 has always brought together an incredible community of people who are building, innovating, and looking for what’s next. And over the last year, our community of developers enabled growth for businesses of all sizes to adapt to a changed world and accelerate their digital transformation,&#8221; noted Papamiltiadis in a blog post. &#8220;In recognition of this, we want to bring F8 back to its roots: a place to celebrate, inspire and help developers grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The big question will be what topics Facebook will see fit to tackle in June. Some of the bigger themes hanging over it right now are how it plans to continue growing in developing markets, whether/what it will launch in response to newly rising apps like Clubhouse, how it might diversify its business model beyond advertising, whether we will ever see a launch of Novi and Diem, and how Facebook continues to tackle misuse on its platform.</p>
<p>For a company so huge and influential, there is indeed a lot to potentially cover. But at least for now the focus seems to be more modest as well. Rather than big launches and major announcements, it looks like Facebook will keep the F8 focus more on its ecosystem and the developers in it. Among the areas that Papamiltiadis highlighted will be addressed, he mentioned product tools for building in Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and Oculus; technical deep-dive sessions; demos, and panels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.tracehq.com/">Trace</a>, an early startup that wants to bring a taste of SaaS to the finance side of the house, announced an $8 million seed round today led by Greylock and Uncork Capital with participation from Nyca Partners, Redpoint Ventures and various individual angels.</p>
<p>Mike Gonzalez, co-founder and CEO at the company describes Trace as the first service designed specifically for finance teams to interact with the rest of the business and involves budgeting, accounting, procurement and other tasks. &#8220;What Trace is really building is an all-in-one platform where financial decisions are made, and people can work with finance to get work done,&#8221; he explained</p>
<p>Trace handles all the core interactions between finance and everyone they need to work with in the business, focusing on budget owners. &#8220;In our platform, budget owners are given visibility into their financial targets, so they know what they&#8217;re working towards,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The idea is to build a more coordinated workflow between all the stakeholders in the process including finance, the department head, legal, security operations and so forth. Instead of cobbling together a bunch of different tools, Trace is attempting to bring this process into a single service.</p>
<p>Gonzalez has a deep background in this area having spent several years building custom financial systems as a consultant, and later working at Zenefits to build an internal system to track this kind of financial information. He took that knowledge, and along with his co-founders built Trace.</p>
<p>The company launched in 2018, spent the next year building the product and debuted the service in 2019. Although the pandemic has been challenging on a personal and company-building level, it did expose how important having a grip on the financial side of the business was when every penny counts.</p>

<p>For now the startup is taking aim at companies with between 200 and 1500 employees with hopes of ramping up to larger companies over time. Trace currently works with Sage Intacct, Netsuite and QuickBooks ERP financial systems.</p>
<p>It has a dozen employees, mostly in R&amp;D with plans to add to that number as the business grows. As a Hispanic, who co-founded the company with his brother, he says that D&amp;I is a cornerstone of his company building plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re both Hispanics, and we grew up in rough neighborhoods without privilege. And so promoting an environment of equal opportunity and inclusion is something that I care deeply about,&#8221; he said. He says that they have already begun to invest to drive diversity and it&#8217;s a huge priority for the company moving forward.</p>
<p>The company has been distributed from the beginning, so the pandemic didn&#8217;t really change that, but as it grows, Gonzalez envisions having an office where people can come together for more collaborative work as needed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like other venture investors over the past year, Cain McClary, co-founder of the investment firm <a href="https://www.kdtvc.com/">KdT Ventures</a>, recently made the jump to Austin. But unlike the rest of them, he was coming from Black Mountain, NC.</p>
<p>McClary had spent the better part of the last three years with his co-founder Mack Healy building out a portfolio that would be the envy of almost any investor looking at financing startups whose businesses depend on innovations at the borders of current technological achievement.</p>
<p>Since 2017, when the firm closed on the first $3.5 million of what ended up being a $15 million fund (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001716717/000171671717000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">they had targeted $30 million</a>), McClary and Healy managed to find their way onto the cap table of businesses like the green chemicals manufacturer, Solugen; health diagnostics technology developer, <span style="font-weight: 400;">PathAI; the Nigerian genetic dataset developer, 54Gene; the novel biomaterials developer, Checkerspot; and the genetics-focused therapy company, Dyno Therapeutics. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That portfolio &#8212; and the subsequent top decile performance that Cambridge Associates has said comes with it &#8212; has allowed McClary and Healy to close on an oversubscribed $50 million new fund to invest in promising startup companies.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2128858" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2128858" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2128858" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KdT-co-founder.png" alt="" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KdT-co-founder.png 1784w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KdT-co-founder.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KdT-co-founder.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KdT-co-founder.png?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KdT-co-founder.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KdT-co-founder.png?resize=1536,1023 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KdT-co-founder.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2128858" class="wp-caption-text">KdT co-founders Cain McClary and Mack Healy. Image Credit: <a href="https://www.kdtvc.com/">KdT Ventures</a></p></div></p>
<p>Hailing from a small Tennessee town outside of Leipers Fork (itself a small Tennessee town) McClary studied medicine at Tulane and business at Stanford where he linked up with Healy through a mutual friend.</p>
<p>Healy, who had done stints throughout big Bay Area startups like Airbnb, Databricks, and Facebook brought the software expertise (and some capital to stake the firm) while McClary provided the life sciences know-how.</p>
<p>Together the two men set out to hang their investment shingle at the intersection of software and life sciences that was proving to be fertile ground for new business creation. Each company in the firm&#8217;s portfolio depends on both the advances in understanding how to code computers and living cells.</p>
<p>McClary had left California for personal reasons when he launched the fund in 2017 and in 2020 relocated to Austin for professional ones. Healy had already set up shop in the city and it was easier, McClary said to fly out to San Francisco to look for companies from the Austin airport than it was from Ashville.</p>
<p>Also, both men were placing big bets on the Dell Medical School at the University of Texas to become the breeding ground for the type of entrepreneurs that the firm is looking to back.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mack was there… the Dell Medical School and we think it’s going to be produce the types of entrpereneurs that we want to support. Houston has a med system. I firmly believe that texas has a place at the table in the future </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The way that we define it is that we like to invest in the physical layer of the world,&#8221; said McClary. &#8220;That includes not only medicine, but chemicals and agriculture. All of that is driven by some of the things that we have this sourcecode for the physical world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Mapping the unmapped corners of the frontier tech startup world means that the firm not only has a presence in Austin, but has hired principals to scour Houston and Research Triangle Park in North Carolina for hot deals.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean the firm is forsaking California though. One of the most recent deals in the KdT portfolio is Andes Ag, an Emeryville, Calif.-based startup that&#8217;s applying yield-boosting microbes directly to seeds in an effort to improve crop performance for farmers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The KdT team speaks the language of science, making them an outlier in this area of venture investing,&#8221; said JD Montgomery of Canterbury Consulting, a limited partner in KdT’s first and second fund. “They are passionate about building the science companies of the future that will tackle some of the significant challenges our world faces in the next decade and beyond.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/14/1018296/bill-gates-climate-change-beef-trees-microsoft/">a recent interview</a> discussing Bill Gates&#8217; recent book &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Avoid-Climate-Disaster-Breakthroughs/dp/0385546130/ref=asc_df_0385546130/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=459649254175&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=11168314863701036991&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9010962&amp;hvtargid=pla-918137739254&amp;psc=1">How to Avoid a Climate Disaster</a>&#8220;, the Microsoft and <a href="https://www.breakthroughenergy.org/">Breakthrough Energy</a> founder (and the world&#8217;s<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/"> third wealthiest man</a>) advocated for citizens of the richest countries in the world to switch to diets consisting entirely of what he called synthetic meat in an effort to curb greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Gates&#8217; call is being met by startups and public companies hailing from everywhere from Amsterdam to Tel Aviv, London to Los Angeles, and Berkeley to&#8230; um&#8230; Chicago.</p>
<p>Indeed, two of the best funded companies in the lab-grown meat market hail from The Netherlands, where <a href="https://mosameat.com/">Mosa Meat</a> is being challenged by a newer upstart, <a href="https://www.meatable.com/">Meatable</a>, which just announced $47 million in new financing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company aims to have its first product approved by European regulators by 2023 and notching commercial sales by 2025.</p>
<p>Meatable has a long road ahead of it, because, as Gates acknowledged in his interview with MIT Technology Review <em>(ed. note: I&#8217;m</em> available for a call, too, Bill), &#8220;the people like Memphis Meats who do it at a cellular level—I don’t know that that will ever be economical.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond the economics, there&#8217;s also the open question of whether consumers will be willing to make the switch to lab grown meat. Some companies, like the San Francisco-based Just Foods and Tel Aviv&#8217;s Supermeat are already selling chicken patties and nuggets made from cultured cells at select restaurants.</p>
<p>These products don&#8217;t get at the full potential for cellular technology according to Daan Luining, Meatable&#8217;s chief technology officer. &#8220;We have seen the nugget and the chicken burger, but we&#8217;re working on whole muscle tissue,&#8221; Luining said.</p>
<p>The sheer number of entrants in the category &#8212; and the capital they&#8217;ve raised &#8212; points to the opportunity for several winners if companies can walk the tightrope balancing cost at scale and quality replacements for free range food.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The mission of the company is to be a global leader in providing proteins for the planet. Pork and beef and regularly eaten cuts have on environmental and land management,&#8221; Luining said. &#8220;The technology that we are using allows us to go into different species. First we’re focused on the animals that have the biggest impact on climate change and planetary health.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>For Meatable right now, price remains an issue. The company is currently producing meat at roughly $10,000 per pound, but, unlike its competitors, the company said it is producing whole meat. That&#8217;s including the fat and connective tissue that makes meat&#8230; well&#8230; meat.</p>
<p>Now with 35 employees and new financing, the company is trying to shift from research and development into a food production company. Strategic investors like DSM, one of the largest food biotech companies in Europe should help. So should angel investors like Dr. Jeffrey Leiden, the executive chairman of Vertex Pharmaceuticals; and Dr. Rick Klausner, the former executive director of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and a founder of Juno Therapeutics, GRAIL, and Mindstrong Health, after leaving Illumina where he served as chief medical officer.</p>
<p>Institutional investors in the company&#8217;s latest round include Google Ventures founder Bill Maris&#8217;<span style="font-weight: 400;"> new fund, </span><a href="https://section32.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Section 32</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and existing investors like: </span><a href="https://blueyard.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlueYard Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://agronomics.im/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agronomics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://humboldtfund.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humboldt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.weforum.org/people/taavet-hinrikus"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taavet Hinrikus.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s first commercial offering will likely be a lab-grown pork product, but with expanded facilities in Delft, the location of one of the top universities in The Netherlands, a beef product may not be far behind.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Meatable has] a great team and game-changing technology that can address the challenges around the global food insecurity issues our planet is facing,” said Klausner. “They have all the right ingredients to become the leading choice for sustainably and efficiently produced meat.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.actioniq.com">ActionIQ</a>, which helps companies use their customer data to deliver personalized experiences, is announcing that it has extended its Series C funding, bringing the round to a total size of $100 million.</p>
<p>That number includes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/actioniq-series-c/">the $32 million that ActionIQ announced</a> in January of last year. Founder and CEO Tasso Argyros said the company is framing this as an extension rather than a separate round because it comes from existing investors — including March Capital — and because ActionIQ still has most of that $32 million in the bank.</p>
<p>Argyros told me that there were two connected reasons to raise additional money now. For one thing, ActionIQ has seen 100% year-over-year revenue growth, allowing it to increase its valuation by more than 250%. (The company isn&#8217;t not disclosing the actual valuation.) That growth has also meant that ActionIQ is getting &#8220;a lot more ambitious&#8221; in its plans for product development and customer growth.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We raised more money because we can, and because we need to,&#8221; Argyros said.</p>
<p>The company continues to develop the core platform, for example by introducing more support for real-time data and analysis. But Argyros suggested that the biggest change has been in the broader market for customer data platforms, with companies like Morgan Stanley, The Hartford, Albertsons, JCPenney and GoPro signing on with ActionIQ in the past year.</p>

<p>Some of these enterprises, he said, &#8220;normally would not work with a cutting-edge technology company like us, but because of the pandemic, they&#8217;re willing to take some risk and really invest in their customer base and their customer experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Argyros also argued that as regulators and large platforms restrict the ways that businesses can buy and sell third-party data, platforms like ActionIQ, focusing on the first-party data that companies collect for their own use, will become increasingly important. And he said that ActionIQ&#8217;s growth comes as the big marketing clouds have &#8220;failed&#8221; — either announcing products that have yet to launch or launching products that don&#8217;t match ActionIQ&#8217;s capabilities.</p>
<p>Companies that were already using ActionIQ include The New York Times. In fact, the funding announcement includes a statement from The Times&#8217; senior vices president of data and insights Shane Murray declaring that the newspaper is using ActionIQ to deliver &#8220;hundreds of billions of personalized customer experiences&#8221; across &#8220;mail, in-app, site, and paid media.&#8221;</p>
<p>ActionIQ has now raised around $145 million total, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/actioniq">according to Crunchbase</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://hopin.com/">Hopin</a>, a unicorn best known for its online events-hosting service, <a href="https://hopin.com/blog/hopin-acquires-streamable-and-jamm">announced</a> this morning that it has acquired two more companies. The smaller concerns, <a href="https://jamm.app/en/download/">Jamm</a> and <a href="https://streamable.com/">Streamable</a>, were acquired in deals that Hopin declined to detail.</p>
<p>However, in an email to TechCrunch, Hopin CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/johnnyboufarhat">Johnny Boufarhat</a> said that both companies were &#8220;early-stage&#8221; concerns. We can infer deal scale from the comment.</p>
<p>Hopin has operated with an acquisitive bent in recent months, announcing an acquisition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/hopin-buys-livestreaming-startup-streamyard-for-250m-as-it-looks-to-expand-its-product-lineup/">StreamYard for $250 million</a> in January in addition to today&#8217;s deals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jamm sells what it calls &#8220;1-click video collaboration for teams,&#8221; while Streamable helps other companies upload and stream their videos. After acquiring StreamYard, which provided video livestreaming services, it&#8217;s not hard to discern that video is the locus of Hopin&#8217;s checkbook focus.</p>
<p>Boufarhat agrees, explaining to TechCrunch that its latest purchases will help his company &#8220;build even more technology for customers to make professional-grade video capabilities easily accessible at scale.&#8221; The CEO added that his company is &#8220;unofficially&#8221; calling its efforts &#8220;an ecosystem of connection powered by all aspects of video.&#8221;</p>
<p>The total addressable market (TAM) for that vision is likely larger than the online-events work that Hopin is best known for, or even the hybrid online/offline events market that the company was originally born to support.</p>
<p>When Hopin announced its StreamYard buy, it had purchased a company with material revenues. Boufarhat&#8217;s team decided to keep the startup alive as a standalone product. As Jamm and Streamable are earlier-stage affairs, will they receive the same treatment?</p>
<p>Yes and no. Yes for Streamable, no for Jamm. Per Hopin&#8217;s founder, Jamm will be &#8220;fully integrated into Hopin’s products,&#8221; while Streamable will both live on as an individual product while also finding points of integration into its events platform.</p>
<p>TechCrunch was curious if, as in the StreamYard deal, the amount of revenue that Hopin had purchased was material. It is not, per Boufarhat. So, the last revenue number we have for Hopin, some $70 million ARR disclosed during <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/hopin-confirms-400m-raise-at-5-65b-valuation/">its $400 million funding round earlier this month</a>, is likely still pertinent. Hopin was valued at $5.65 billion at the time.</p>
<p>The company did disclose that the number of &#8220;organizers&#8221; using its platform to host events has risen from 85,000 earlier this month to 90,000 as of today. That&#8217;s just under 6% growth in less than a month. Hopin&#8217;s rapid growth trajectory appears intact for now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Update:</strong> Telegram has now announced it&#8217;s pulled in over $1BN in debt financing by selling bonds.</p>
<p>Founder Pavel Durov put out an update via his official Telegram channel after a press announcement earlier today had revealed the company had taken in $150M from Mubadala and Abu Dhabi Catalyst Partners by selling 5-year pre-IPO convertible bonds.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear where the additional millions in debt funding are coming from &#8212; Durov merely writes that Telegram has sold bonds to &#8220;some of the largest and most knowledgable investors from all over the world&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This will enable Telegram to continue growing globally while sticking to its values and remaining independent,&#8221; he goes on, adding that the $1BN debt cushion will also be used to implement a monetization strategy he set out in December &#8212; when Durov wrote that &#8220;a project of our size needs at least a few hundred million dollars per year to keep going&#8221;.</p>
<p>He also committed not to sell Telegram, reiterating then that he wants it to remain independent. Monetization would be non-intrusive, he further pledged then, saying any future move to monetize large one-to-many channels through ads would see benefits flow back to the community &#8212; such as in the form of &#8220;free traffic in proportion to their size&#8221; &#8212; while future content sales (like premium stickers) would also entail contributing artists getting &#8220;a part of the profit&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want millions of Telegram-based creators and small businesses to thrive, enriching the experience of all our users,&#8221; was Durov&#8217;s strategic vision in December. Now he&#8217;s got the debt war chest to execute on the plan.</p>
<p><em>Our original report follows below&#8230; </em></p>
<p>Messaging platform Telegram, which recently passed 500 million monthly active users but still isn&#8217;t monetizing all the digital chatter it hosts &#8212; has taken in a little more funding to keep its engines ticking over.</p>
<p>Mubadala Investment Company, the Abu Dhabi-based sovereign investor, is throwing in $75M in exchange for 5-year pre-IPO convertible bonds of Telegram &#8212; with Abu Dhabi Catalyst Partners investing a further $75M, the pair said today in a <a href="https://www.wam.ae/en/details/1395302920777">press release</a>.</p>
<p>The investment is touted as a strategic partnership, with Mubadala anticipating benefits for Abu Dhabi&#8217;s startup ecosystem by having a local Telegram presence drawing in skills and talent to the capital.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mubadala-inv-telegram/abu-dhabi-funds-invest-150-million-in-telegram-messaging-app-idUSKBN2BF0UR">Reuters</a> Telegram will be opening an office in Abu Dhabi following the investment &#8212; building out its regional presence from a Dubai, UAE base.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Pavel Durov, Telegram founder and CEO, said: &#8220;We are honoured by the $150M investment into Telegram from Mubadala and Abu Dubai Catalyst Partners. We look forward to developing this strategic partnership to continue our growth in the MENA region and globally.&#8221;</p>
<p>To date, Telegram has been bankrolled over a seven+ year lifespan by Durov, who made ~$300M from selling his stake in the vk social network he also founded &#8212; aka Russia&#8217;s &#8216;Facebook&#8217; &#8212; back in 2015.</p>
<p>But sustaining a messaging platform with half a billion users can&#8217;t be done through billionaire bootstrapping alone.</p>
<p>Some additional investment did come in via Telegram&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/08/telegram-open-network/">recent attempt to launch a blockchain platform</a>. However the effort was derailed by US regulators last year &#8212; forcing it to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/telegram-to-pay-sec-fine-of-18-5-million-and-return-1-2-billion-to-investors-as-it-dissolves-ton/">refund</a> most (but not all) of the money it had booked for the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/telegram-abandons-its-ton-blockchain-platform/">failed TON platform</a> &#8212; so speculation over how Telegram will monetize its platform goes on.</p>
<p>In recent weeks Durov has responded to this chatter via his public Telegram channel to confirm he&#8217;s considering introducing ads for &#8220;large one-to-many channels&#8221; &#8212; but pledging he won&#8217;t do so in chats.</p>
<p>He has also rejected the notion of using user data to target ads &#8212; a move that would undermine the loud privacy promises Telegram repeatedly makes to users to put clear blue water between its platform and the (Facebook-owned) data-mining competition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Users will be able to opt out of ads, but I do think that privacy-conscious ads are a good way for channel owners to monetize their efforts &#8212; as an alternative to donations or subscriptions, which we are also working to offer them,&#8221; Durov wrote last month.</p>
<p>Telegram&#8217;s usage has, meanwhile, continued to swell this year &#8212; boosted by users switching from Facebook-owned WhatsApp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/e2e-encrypted-email-providers-also-see-sign-ups-surge-as-chat-app-users-flock-to-signal-and-telegram-in-search-of-privacy/">over privacy concerns</a>. So there&#8217;s limited room for copycat monetization, unless Durov is willing to trash his personal &#8216;pro-privacy, pro-user&#8217; brand. To say that&#8217;s highly unlikely is an understatement.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he has further limited his options by rejecting a series of investment offers in recent months.</p>
<p>A report in Russian press <a href="https://thebell.io/telegram-otklonil-predlozhenie-ob-investitsiyah-s-otsenkoj-v-30-mlrd">earlier this year</a> said he&#8217;d rejected an investment offer for a 5%-10% stake in the company that had valued it at $30BN. We&#8217;ve also been told he rejected a higher offer that had valued Telegram at $35BN &#8212; and another of $4BN at a $40BN pre-money valuation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Durov is afraid of investors of any kind,&#8221; one source told us on why he refused to give up any equity.</p>
<p>Debt financing seems to be Telegram&#8217;s preferred route at this stage. Back in January <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/telegram-founder-in-talks-to-raise-debt-amid-apps-explosive-growth">The Information</a> reported that it was discussing raising up to $1BN in debt financing from with banks and investors &#8212; which would convert to shares in an eventual public offering.</p>
<p>That debt route &#8212; via pre-IPO convertible bonds &#8212; is now taking shape with today&#8217;s investment news out of Abu Dhabi. Although $150M is a lot less than the rumoured $1BN so this may be just an initial tranche. (And may in fact be needed to pay back TON investors&#8217; <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/telegram-offers-ico-investors-refund-or-option-to-hang-on-till-april-2021">whose refunds are falling due</a>.)</p>
<p>But with a couple of debt backers sticking their necks out to take a punt on Durov&#8217;s anti-establishment alternative &#8212; and on the chance of an Telegram IPO by 2026 &#8212; the company is in a better position to get buy in from other debt funders, including in the region as it deepens its geographical commitment to the Middle East.</p>
<p>One key attraction for Telegram backers is likely to be its agile product dev. There Durov has repeatedly shown he can deliver &#8212; growing usage of his platform with the help of a steady pipeline of user-focused features.</p>
<p>Efforts on the product side at this stage look geared towards pivoting into a Patreon-style platform for content creators to build communities of followers willing to pay for their content (which would thereby enable Telegram to monetize by taking a cut as commission).</p>
<p>&#8220;Our end goal is to establish a new class of content creators &#8212; one that is financially sustainable and free to choose the strategy that is best for their subscribers,&#8221; wrote Durov last month. &#8220;Traditional social networks have exploited users and publishers for far too long with excessive data collection and manipulative algorithms. It&#8217;s time to change this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just over a month later his channel lit up again with more product news &#8212; this time capitalizing on the buzz around social audio with the announcement of the launch of a Clubhouse-clone on Telegram channels dubbed &#8220;voice chats 2.0&#8221;.</p>
<p>He also announced feature that lets admins of channels and public groups host voice chats for millions of live listeners &#8212; taking the cap off the earlier feature. &#8220;No matter how popular your talk gets, new people will be able to tune in. It&#8217;s like public radio reinvented fo the 21st century,&#8221; Telegram&#8217;s blog post enthused.</p>
<p>Durov had more developments to tease: One-to-many video broadcasts that will see the platform let users host their own &#8216;TV stations&#8217; which he said will be coming this &#8220;spring&#8221;. So Telegram continues to evolve as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/clubhouse-app-chat-rooms/">social app landscape shifts</a>.</p>
<p>Commenting on the debt financing in a statement, James Munce, CFO and COO of Abu Dhabi Catalyst Partners (ADCP), lauded Telegram&#8217;s management team’s &#8220;unshakeable dedication to building a platform centred around privacy and user experience&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe this creates a strong value proposition and will be a focal point for social media platforms and a new era of messaging,&#8221; he added.</p>
