										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As building in public continues to gain popularity with early-stage startup founders, Murmur, coming out of stealth today, wants to leverage that natural transparency to a louder frequency.</p>
<p>Founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/aarondignan">Aaron Dignan</a>, Murmur helps startups create work agreements based on the policies of other startups. &#8220;Work agreements&#8221; is an intentionally broad phrase, but encapsulates everything that a team decides about how work works, from paternal leave strategies to strategic priorities to how hiring works.</p>
<p>“It’s everything you’ve ever argued about [within your startup],” Dignan said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It requires a healthy level of transparency within the ecosystem, meaning that a startup would have to be open with sharing its policies to the public in the first place. But, if Murmur works, it could help early-stage founders save time on the pain-staking process of figuring out how to build policies from scratch around hiring, OKR goals and vacation policies.</p>
<p>Instead, a new founder could just rely on other, seasoned founders, who have shared their policies for anyone to enjoy, and customize their own plan based around those practices.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The 10 benefits and policies any modern workplace should have&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/06/the-10-benefits-and-policies-any-modern-workplace-should-have/embed/#?secret=P44zqTRQni" data-secret="P44zqTRQni" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Today, Murmur <a href="https://www.notion.so/Murmur-raises-1-8M-to-scale-the-magic-of-working-agreements-c82e95c4c5584b84937f8a87d148db42">announced</a> that it has raised $1.8 million to scale its working agreements platform in a round led by Lerer Hippeau, with participation from SemperVirens, Human Ventures and Remote First Capital. Other investors include Steve Schlafman, Mariano Suarez-Battan (the CEO of Mural), Brian Sugar (the CEO of PopSugar) and Adam Pisoni (the co-founder of Yammer).</p>
<p>The company, still in private beta, will be launching to the public in early summer 2021.</p>
<p>Murmur is a web-based platform that allows startups to author, customize and plan policies that will shape a team’s culture. The platform helps teams go from proposal to decision with features like voting, edits and feedback throughout the process of creating an agreement. Instead of pushing a copy and paste of another startup’s policy, Murmur prompts founders to use the outsourced policies as seeds, and add customization as they go.</p>
<p>“Anybody can Google and find some company’s years-old processes; the trick is in making an inclusive ‘agreement’ with real time all participating in the magic of keeping it and iterating it, and improving it,” Dignan said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119098" style="width: 965px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119098" loading="lazy" class="breakout  wp-image-2119098" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg" alt="" width="955" height="661" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg 3250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg?resize=768,532 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg?resize=680,471 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg?resize=1536,1063 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg?resize=2048,1418 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 955px) 100vw, 955px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2119098" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Murmur</p></div></p>
<p>Right now, it is free for anyone to see listed company public agreements. But it costs money to use the Murmur platform to create and customize your own agreements off of this information. With this format, you can see that Dignan thinks that the conversion power of the company lies more in its platform than the content.</p>
<p>Dignan tells me that the team is still testing pricing strategies, but the current plan is a free trial followed by a monthly per-seat fee of $12 to $15 per month, per user. One day, companies could charge a premium for a “kit” of tools on their platform.</p>
<p>Murmur’s initial target for customers are startups that are growing fast and already work in public, such as Buffer, Basecamp, Lattice and Blinkist, but in the future, big enterprises could also see it useful.</p>
<p>Murmur is launching amid a general trend of companies that are pitching themselves as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/best-practices-as-a-service-is-a-key-investment-theme-to-watch-in-2021/">best-practices-as-a-service.</a> Companies in this space aren’t simply enabling other startups to use a fancy SaaS tool, they are not-so-gently pushing them to use those tools in the best possible way for the best possible outcome. Murmur, if it hits scale, could help the next generation of startups figure out the best way to start companies.</p>
<p>Dignan says that the startup “aims to do for working practices what GitHub did for code.”</p>
<p>Remote work is obviously a key catalyst for the company, since the transition has reminded teams that transparency, standards and communication is vital to a functioning organization.</p>
<p>While the startup currently only has Murmur working agreements on the platform, it plans to onboard the agreements of dozens of companies in the coming months. Even though the platform is what makes Murmur special, it’s clear that curating agreements from top companies plays a vital role in Murmur’s success.</p>
<p>It is not paying companies to publicly list their agreements, and the branding benefit of transparency is well worth the confidentiality cost of sharing due to recruitment benefits.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Best practices as a service is a key investment theme to watch in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/best-practices-as-a-service-is-a-key-investment-theme-to-watch-in-2021/embed/#?secret=JIH1rqBhkm" data-secret="JIH1rqBhkm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Dignan says connections from his <a href="https://www.bravenewwork.com/">book about the future of work</a> will help land those agreements. Writing a book about a changing world of work before a global pandemic turned everything upside down is ironic, but Dignan, it appears, doesn’t view Murmur as a pandemic pivot.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ve been thinking about this tool for seven years,” he said. But he didn’t think an opinionated tool would have a large enough total addressable market, and that anything that would scale would just reinforce the status quo. He didn’t build Murmur for a while because he thought that the ecosystem didn’t need “yet another customer engagement tool.”</p>
<p>So, he waited. And the pandemic, another peak of the Black Lives Matter movement and the election happened within one year.</p>
<p>“It was all signaling that the complexity is too much,” he said. “We need new ways of working, making decisions and organizing as people. And that felt like this huge moment where we plant the seed and in a few years&#8217; time, the market will be huge.”</p>

		Ethan Eismann is the Vice President of Design at Slack, leading design and engineering teams to deliver exceptional product experiences.

	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">At Slack, every one of our processes and features has been designed with the primary goal of making Slack a workplace tool that feels human. We see ourselves as our users’ hosts, and we want them to feel comfortable and happy every time they’re in Slack. Our product isn’t just built for work — it’s built for people doing work, and everything we create is meant to forward our mission of making work life simpler, more pleasant and more productive.</p>
<p>Our job is to understand what people want, and then translate that value through thoughtfully designed, well-functioning products and features.</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of an unprecedented shift to remote work, we’ve seen an influx of people turning to Slack to make the <a href="https://slack.com/solutions/remote-work#slack-channels">transition to a digital-first workplace</a>. Building thoughtful, intuitive products that add value, delight and human-centric experiences into peoples’ working lives has never been more important.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Product principles are essential guidelines that help teams evaluate work across functions.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>To ensure we’re meeting our customers where they’re at, we created a set of guiding &#8220;product principles&#8221; that inform everything we build, and which serve as the foundation for our entire product decision-making process.</p>
<p>There’s business value in improving an organization&#8217;s processes, and we’ve been able to provide better experiences for our customers by enacting ever-evolving product principles and using them to evaluate our products and features. Any company can benefit from having product principles — it’s all about how you develop and deploy them across your organization.</p>
<h2>First, what are product principles?</h2>
<p>Product principles are essential guidelines that help teams evaluate work across functions, as well as up and down the decision-making chain, by ensuring all work ladders up to the organization’s ultimate goals. Better alignment, in turn, leads to better and faster product decisions.</p>
<p>Product principles should always evolve to keep up with the changing ways you work and what your customers need. At Slack, we currently have five principles that guide us:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t make me think.</li>
<li>Be a great host.</li>
<li>Prototype the path.</li>
<li>Don’t reinvent the wheel.</li>
<li>Make bigger, bolder bets.</li>
</ol>
<p>By implementing these principles into all we build across teams — design, legal, marketing and more — they provide a shared framework for decision-making that keeps us aligned and therefore able to make better decisions, faster.</p>
<p>The idea of having principles themselves isn’t a new concept, but the creation process behind building and promoting these principles is often overlooked or underdeveloped.</p>
<h2>Start with your product philosophy</h2>
<p>Before building the principles themselves, it’s important to first establish your product philosophy, which will inform how your organization will ultimately view and abide by its principles.</p>
<p>At Slack, we embrace an approach we call &#8220;getting to the next hill.&#8221; While there is a long-term product strategy, we don’t spend a lot of time debating exactly where we’ll be in one or two years from now. Instead, we focus on more immediate, incremental moves to improve our customers’ working lives.</p>
<p>We’ve found that because Slack is used in so many different ways by so many different companies, it&#8217;s better to learn from how our customers use our features than from endlessly debating aspirational future ideas.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a move designed to directly challenge Amazon, Walmart today announced it&#8217;s dropping the $35 minimum order requirement for its two-hour &#8220;Express&#8221; delivery service, a competitor to Amazon&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="https://primenow.amazon.com/">Prime Now</a>.&#8221;  With Walmart Express Delivery, customers can order from Walmart&#8217;s food, consumables or general merchandise assortment, then pay a flat $10 fee to have the items arrive in two hours or less.</p>
<p>The service is useful for more urgent delivery needs &#8212; like diapers or a missing ingredient for a recipe, SVP of Customer Product, Tom Ward, noted in an <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/03/01/walmart-drops-35-minimum-for-express-delivery">announcement</a>. They&#8217;re not meant to sub in for larger shopping trips, however &#8212; Express orders are capped at 65 items.</p>
<p>Today, Express Delivery is available in nearly 3,000 Walmart stores reaching 70% of the U.S. population, Walmart says. It builds on top of stores&#8217; existing inventory of pickup and delivery time slots as a third option, instead of giving slots away to those with the ability to pay higher fees.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Like Walmart&#8217;s grocery and pickup orders, Express orders are shopped and packaged for delivery by Walmart&#8217;s team of 170,000 personal shoppers and items are priced the same as they are in-store. This offers Walmart a potential competitive advantage against grocery delivery services like Instacart or Shipt, for example, where products can be priced higher and hurried or inexperienced shoppers aren&#8217;t always able to find items or search the back, having to mark them as &#8220;out of stock.&#8221;</p>
<p>In theory, Walmart employees will have a better understanding of their own store&#8217;s inventory and layout, making these kind of issues less common. It will also have direct access to the order data, which will help it better understand what sells, what replacements customers will accept for out-of-stocks, when to staff for busy times and more.</p>
<p>In addition to grocery delivery, Express Delivery competes with Amazon&#8217;s Prime Now, a service that similarly offers a combination of grocery and other daily essentials and merchandise. Currently, Prime Now&#8217;s 2-hour service has a minimum order requirement of $35 without any additional fees in many cases &#8212; though the Prime Now app explains that some of its local store partners will charge fees even when that minimum is met, and others may have higher order minimums, which makes the service confusing to consumers.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Starting today, no more $35 min. order requirement for Express delivery. Another way we’re making it easier than ever to get what you need when you need it. <a href="https://t.co/lCgQItLeRn">https://t.co/lCgQItLeRn</a> <a href="https://t.co/HONlL0SzxG">pic.twitter.com/HONlL0SzxG</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Walmart Inc. (@WalmartInc) <a href="https://twitter.com/WalmartInc/status/1366405938366791683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Walmart&#8217;s news comes at a time when Amazon appears to be trying to push consumers away from the Prime Now standalone app, too.</p>
<p>When you open the Prime Now app, a large pop-up message informs you that you can now shop Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh from inside the Amazon app. A button labeled <em>&#8220;Make the switch&#8221;</em> will then redirect you. Meanwhile, on Amazon&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=15247183011&amp;ref=acq_slash_prime&amp;ms3_c=278baea1880c041f3de99b1cf7ea0ca7">website touting Prime&#8217;s delivery perks</a>, the &#8220;Prime Now&#8221; brand name isn&#8217;t mentioned at all. Instead, Amazon touts free same-day (5-hour) delivery of best sellers and everyday essentials on orders with a $35 minimum purchase, or free 2-hour grocery delivery from Whole Foods and Fresh.</p>
<p>When asked why Amazon is pushing Prime Now shoppers to its main app, Amazon downplayed this as simply an ongoing effort to &#8220;educate&#8221; consumers about the option.</p>
<p>Walmart, on the other hand, last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/walmart-grocery-is-merging-with-walmarts-main-app-and-website/">merged</a> its separate delivery apps into one.</p>
<p>After items are picked, Walmart works with a network of partners, including DoorDash, Postmates, Roadie and Pickup Point, as well as its in-house delivery services, to get orders to customers&#8217; doorsteps. This last-mile portion has become a key area of investment for Walmart and competitors in recent months &#8212; Walmart, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/walmart-is-buying-joyrun-assets-to-add-peer-to-peer-product-delivery/">acquired</a> assets from peer-to-peer delivery startup JoyRun in November. And before that, a former Walmart delivery partner,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/target-is-looking-to-buy-delivs-same-day-delivery-tech/"> Deliv, sold to Target.</a></p>
<p>This is not the first time Walmart has dropped order minimums in an attempt to better compete with Amazon and others.</p>
<p>In December, Walmart announced its Prime alternative known as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/walmart-takes-on-prime-by-dropping-35-minimum-on-walmart-com-purchases/">Walmart+ would remove the $35 minimum on non-same day Walmart.com orders</a>. But it had stopped short of extending that perk to same-day grocery until now.</p>
<p>To some extent, Walmart&#8217;s ability to drop minimums has to do with the logistics of its delivery operations. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/walmart-to-ramp-up-automated-fulfillment-at-its-stores-as-online-grocery-grows.html">Walmart has been turning more of its stores into fulfillment centers</a> by converting some into small, automated warehouses in partnership with technology providers and robotics companies, including Alert Innovation, Dematic and Fabric.</p>
<p>And because its stores are physically located closer to customers than Amazon warehouses, it has the ability to deliver a broad merchandise selection, faster, while also turning large parking lots into picking stations &#8212; another thing that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanverdon/2021/02/28/why-amazon-should-be-worried-about-walmarts-micro-fulfillment-centers/?sh=6795ad587033">could worry Amazon</a>, which is now <a href="https://www.nj.com/monmouth/2021/02/amazon-to-open-fulfillment-center-at-site-of-former-sears-store-mayor-says.html">buying up closed mall stores</a> for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-and-giant-mall-operator-look-at-turning-sears-j-c-penney-stores-into-fulfillment-centers-11596992863">its own fulfillment operations. </a></p>
<p>Walmart today still carries a $35 minimum on other pickup and delivery orders and same-day orders from Walmart+ subscribers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On a recent episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>, Bain Capital Ventures&#8217; Matt Harris said that if you had asked him a year ago what would happen to venture capital during a pandemic lockdown, he would have replied &#8220;it would have fallen off a cliff.&#8221; Before the world changed so fundamentally, VCs and founders alike believed they needed to meet in person to build trust before signing paperwork that would financially and emotionally bond them together for years and years.</p>
<p>Today, the landscape is very different. More institutional capital is flowing into startups at much faster rates and a good deal of credit must go to the virtual pitch meeting. Founders can now take 30+ meetings in a single day, but are they making the most of those meetings?</p>
<p>At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=melissabradleypost">TechCrunch Early Stage in April</a>, Melissa Bradley will talk us through how to nail your virtual pitch meeting and take questions from the audience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bradley is the co-founder of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ureeka/">Ureeka</a>, a venture-backed mentorship platform for SMBs that pairs founders with experts and mentors. Bradley is also founder and managing partner of 1863 Ventures, a business development program that accelerates underrepresented entrepreneurs (a group Bradley calls the New Majority) into their hyper-growth phase.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s also a professor at Georgetown University&#8217;s business school, teaching impact investing, social entrepreneurship, P2P economies and innovation.</p>
<p>In short, Bradley deeply understands what it&#8217;s like to sit on both sides of the table, as a VC and a founder, and even more deeply understands what it takes to have a successful virtual meeting from her experience building Ureeka (which is entirely virtual).</p>
<p>Bradley joins an all-star cast of speakers at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=melissabradleypost">TC Early Stage</a>, an event that is packed with breakout sessions focused on all the core competencies that a startup needs to be successful. Here&#8217;s a preview of some of the sessions going down at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=melissabradleypost">TC Early Stage</a>:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buzzy mega-rounds and high-profile IPOs often dominate headlines. But many of those companies were once early-stage and scrapping to raise a seed round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, </span><a href="http://www.chicagoventures.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a VC firm that often leads seed-stage rounds, announced the close of its third fund &#8212; a $63 million vehicle that it’s already put to work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Ventures (which is based in Chicago, where else?) has a very specific set of criteria when it looks to back companies. For one, as mentioned, it not only wants to back seed-stage startups, it usually leads those rounds. The firm is targeting 25 investments out of its new fund with an average check size of $1.5 million to $2 million.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As evidence, it has so far backed 11 companies out of this third fund, leading 10 of those rounds. The startups include </span>CognitOps<span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span>CoPilot<span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span>Forager<span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span>Interior Define<span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span>NOCD<span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span>OneRail<span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span>PreFix and<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span>Ureeka<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm also is focused on investing in companies located out of the traditional hotspots of Silicon Valley and New York. Six of its most recent investments were in Chicago-based startups, two in Austin (where it recently opened an office), one in Orlando, Florida, and one in Los Angeles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Ventures prides itself in identifying, and backing, “overlooked” companies. It was founded in 2012 under the premise that enduring companies could be built “anywhere” and not restricted to “a few select area codes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Only a handful of funds consistently lead seed rounds. Tag-along, momentum-based investing is the norm,” the firm said in a statement. “The industry’s attention still converges on industries and geographies with rich histories of innovation. We fill these gaps. We lead seed rounds before it’s obvious, and serve as active, operationally-involved partners during a company’s earliest days. We invest off the coasts.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the firm’s portfolio companies have raised more than $1.5 billion in follow-on capital. Seventeen of those companies are now valued over $100 million, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/cameo/">Cameo</a>, business software marketplace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/11/g2-crowd-a-business-software-marketplace-raises-another-55m-at-just-under-a-500m-valuation/">G2</a> and logistics software company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/20/early-stage-saas-vc-slip-snaps-recovery-as-public-software-stocks-soar/">project44</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Ventures closed its second fund in 2016 &#8212; which</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> included a $60 million main </span><a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001644873-16-000002/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a $6 million sidecar fund. The firm opted not to go the sidecar route this time around. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conjunction with the new fund, Chicago Ventures also announced that it has promoted </span><a href="http://chicagoventures.com/team/peter-christman/">Peter Christman</a> and <a href="http://chicagoventures.com/team/lindsay-knight/">Lindsay Knight</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to partner. Christman leads investments in companies rebuilding old-line enterprise workflows and consumer products expanding access to care and financial well-being. Knight leads the firm’s post-investment operations, including talent, business development and functional best practice sharing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chicago Ventures has also named Jackie DiMonte to the team as a new partner. DiMonte comes from Hyde Park Venture Partners, where she led early-stage, enterprise investments. An engineer by training, DiMonte is based in Austin, where Chicago Ventures has made 10 investments since 2015.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the dollars invested into seed-stage startups in the United States had an up-and-down year that TechCrunch explored </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/24/us-seed-stage-investing-flourished-during-pandemic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in this piece</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Also, the pattern of </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/more-supergiant-seed-rounds-are-sprouting-up/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rising seed-check sizes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> seen in prior years continued, despite the tumultuous business climate.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tech companies are no stranger to controversy and workplace issues. Over the years, it&#8217;s become clear that no company is immune from diversity issues. But it&#8217;s the job of those in the diversity, equity and inclusion departments to create and foster environments that are welcoming to all.</p>
<p>Last year, in the wake of the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others, many companies spoke out in support of Black lives and the Black Lives Matter movement. At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=justice2021&amp;utm_content=arlanhamilton&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=uberfbnetflixpost&amp;display=TRUE">TechCrunch Sessions: Justice</a>, we&#8217;ll examine what some companies said at the time and how those statements align with where they are today.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll also dive in to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/examining-the-pipeline-problem/">myth of the pipeline problem,</a> as well as the idea of imposter syndrome and <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/02/stop-telling-women-they-have-imposter-syndrome">how companies can help</a> to shift the onus from the person experiencing feelings of doubt to the systems and cultures that perpetuate biases, sexism and racism. We&#8217;ll also, of course, talk about each company&#8217;s DEI efforts over the years, where progress has been made and where there&#8217;s still room for improvement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To have this conversation, we&#8217;ve called on three DEI leaders from Uber, Facebook and Netflix to share their experiences, struggles and wins leading the charge for genuine inclusivity in tech.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a bit about the three of them:</p>
<p><strong>Bo Young Lee, Uber Chief Diversity Officer</strong></p>
<p><div id="attachment_1712901" style="width: 643px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1712901" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1712901" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/42731328210_3aea5d73cd_k.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="633" height="422" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/42731328210_3aea5d73cd_k.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/42731328210_3aea5d73cd_k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/42731328210_3aea5d73cd_k.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/42731328210_3aea5d73cd_k.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/42731328210_3aea5d73cd_k.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/42731328210_3aea5d73cd_k.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/42731328210_3aea5d73cd_k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1712901" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Photo by Kimberly White/Getty Images for TechCrunch / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>Lee became <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/23/uber-has-hired-a-chief-diversity-officer/">Uber&#8217;s first-ever chief diversity officer in early 2018</a>. Lee joined about one year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/11/ubers-board-votes-unanimously-to-adopt-all-recommendations-of-holder-report/?_ga=2.229786132.962186928.1614100640-1057749772.1591641289">former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and his law firm recommended</a> Uber have a chief diversity officer. Holder and his firm were tapped in the aftermath of former Uber engineer Susan Fowler&#8217;s allegations of sexual harassment at the company.</p>
<p>At TC Sessions: Justice, I&#8217;ll chat with Lee about where Uber is today, as well as how it is doing in its mission to double Black representation in leadership by 2025.</p>

<p>Altine joined Facebook last April after previously serving as the managing director of global diversity and inclusion for investor service Moody&#8217;s.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/10/tech-at-work-dei-at-facebook-prop-22-and-gig-worker-earnings/">Last year</a>, Facebook committed to having 50% of its workforce be members of underrepresented groups, which includes BIPOC, women, disabled people and veterans. Over the next five years, Facebook also said it’s committed to increasing its Black employee base by 30%; currently 3.8% of its U.S.-based employees are Black.</p>
<p><strong>Wade Davis, VP of Inclusion Strategy for Product</strong></p>

<p>Davis, who joined Netflix in this role in September 2019, works directly with product leaders at the company to implement inclusive policies and practices into the workplaces. He also works alongside other VPs at Netflix to improve upon diversity and inclusion within the workforce. Prior to joining Netflix, Davis consulted for Google, P&amp;G and others.</p>
<p>Netflix released its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/netflix-releases-latest-diversity-numbers/">first-ever diversity report just this year</a>. Netflix had previously disclosed its data but had yet to make a full report out of it. Netflix did not lay out any concrete goals, but said it’s generally wanting to increase representation by hiring more inclusively and building out its recruiting networks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://workspace.google.com/">Google Workspace</a>, the company&#8217;s productivity platform you&#8217;ll forever refer to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/g-suite-is-now-google-workspace/">as G Suite</a> (or even &#8220;Google Docs&#8221;), is launching a large update today that touches everything from your calendar to Google Meet and how you can use Workspace with Google Assistant.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119041" style="width: 321px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Assistant-in-Workspace.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119041" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2119041" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Assistant-in-Workspace.gif" alt="" width="311" height="640" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2119041" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Indeed, the highlight here is probably that you can now use Assistant in combination with Google Workspace, allowing you to check your work calendar or send a message to your colleagues. Until now, this feature was available in beta and even after it goes live, your company&#8217;s admins will have to turn on the &#8220;Search and Assistant&#8221; service. And this is a bit of a slow rollout, too, with this capability now being generally available on mobile but still in beta for smart speakers and displays like Google&#8217;s own Nest Hub. Still, it&#8217;s been a long time coming, given that Google promised these features a very long time ago now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The other new feature that will directly influence your day-to-day work is support for recurring out-of-office entries and segmentable working hours, as well as a new event type, Focus Time, to help you minimize distractions. Focus Time is a bit cleverer than the three-hour blocks of time you may block off on your calendar anyway in that it limits notifications during those event windows. Google is also launching a new analytics feature that tells you how much time you spend (waste) in meetings. This isn&#8217;t quite as fully featured (and potentially creepy) as Microsoft&#8217;s Productivity Score, since it only displays how much time you spend in meetings, but it&#8217;s a nice overview of how you spend your days (though you know that already). None of this data is shared with your managers.</p>
<p>For when you go back to an office, Google is also adding location indicators to Workspace so you can share when you will be working from there and when you&#8217;ll be working from home.</p>
<p>And talking about meetings, since most of these remain online for the time being, Google is adding a few new features that now allow those of you who use their Google Nest Hub Max to host meetings at home and to set up a laptop as their own second-screen experience. What&#8217;s far more important, though, is that when you join a meeting on mobile, Google will now implement a picture-in-picture mode so you can be in that Meet meeting on your phone and still browse the web, Gmail and get important work done during that brainstorming session.</p>
<p>Mobile support for <a href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/10058482?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en">background replace</a> is also coming, as well as the addition of Q&amp;As and polls on mobile. Currently, you can only blur your background on mobile.</p>

<p>For frontline workers, Google is adding something it calls Google Workspace Frontline, with new features for this group of users, and it is also making it easier for users to build custom AppSheet apps from Google Sheets and Drive, &#8220;so that frontline workers can digitize and streamline their work, whether it&#8217;s collecting data in the field, reporting safety risks, or managing customer requests.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://zetaglobal.com">Zeta Global</a>, the marketing technology company founded by David A. Steinberg and former Apple CEO John Sculley, is announcing an additional $222.5 million in new debt financing.</p>
<p>The company has gone down the debt route before — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/27/marketing-tech-company-zeta-global-raises-140m-at-a-1-3-billion-valuation/">a Series F raised in 2017</a> combined $115 million funding with $25 million in debt. BofA Securities served as lead arranger and bookrunner for the new financing, with participation from Barclays, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding.</p>
<p>“For this round, we were able to both refinance our debt and add in a large amount of capacity for current operations and future initiatives,” Steinberg (Zeta’s CEO) told me via email. “We were able to work with our syndicate to capture a low interest rate and take advantage of the strong credit markets.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company emphasizes its data-driven approach to marketing, combining companies’ first-party data with artificial intelligence and what it says are more than 2.4 billion customer identifiers. Steinberg said this approach has only become more crucial, with 2020 delivering “a five-year acceleration” as brands face the challenge of “digitally transforming their business structure to be data-centric.”</p>
<p>“Zeta’s capabilities are helping marketers engage customers across the entire digital ecosystem more intelligently and efficiently, with individualized messages, offers, and content by way of our identity-based data and predictive AI,” Steinberg continued. “Our challenge is to continue to keep up with our customers’ needs and maintain our competitive advantage around data and AI.”</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s funding announcement notes that previous loans have been used to finance acquisitions and integrations, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/05/zeta-global-acquires-commenting-service-disqus/">commenting platform Disqus</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/18/zeta-global-acquires-boomtrain-to-bring-more-machine-learning-to-its-marketing-automation-platform/">machine learning-powered marketing platform Boomtrain</a>. Asked whether this new debt will also be used for acquisitions, Steinberg said the company continues to “organically innovate,” with a focus on its customer data platform and connected TV capabilities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Wondering how to nail that virtual pitch meeting and raise VC funding? Or how to build a high-octane sales team?

					<description><![CDATA[Let's see what we can learn about Coinbase's recent trading volume before looking into Robinhood's. Is Robinhood crypto a possible threat to Coinbase's consumer trading volumes?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The impending <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/coinbase-files-to-go-public-in-a-key-listing-for-the-cryptocurrency-category/">Coinbase direct listing</a> is a fintech debut to watch. The cryptocurrency-focused consumer trading concern is set to become a public company on the back of a strong 2020, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/">a particularly strong final quarter</a>.</p>
<p>And it appears that the company is also having a strong kickoff in 2021. What Coinbase is worth is therefore hard to guess, though some are trying, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/if-coinbase-is-worth-100-billion-whats-a-fair-valuation-for-stripe/">as we&#8217;ve noticed</a>.</p>

<hr />
<p>But Coinbase is hardly the only company enjoying a crypto bounce: Robinhood, another American consumer fintech we&#8217;ve spent too much time discussing in recent weeks, is also riding a wave in its users&#8217; cryptocurrency activity.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995211 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-grn.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Between both companies, we&#8217;re seeing signs of the sort of growing consumer interest and trading volume that has historically come with sustained periods of bitcoin price expansion. But Coinbase charges fees for trading, while Robinhood doesn&#8217;t. And transaction-fee-based income is the vast majority of Coinbase&#8217;s revenues &#8212; 96% in calendar 2020, for example.</p>
<p>The situation sets up an interesting contrast.</p>
<p>This morning, let&#8217;s see what we can learn about Coinbase&#8217;s recent trading volume before looking into Robinhood&#8217;s. And finally, we&#8217;ll remind ourselves of how Coinbase talked about Robinhood in its S-1 filing. Is Robinhood crypto a possible threat to Coinbase&#8217;s consumer trading volumes? Let&#8217;s tinker.</p>
<h2>An argument called forever</h2>
<p>Kicking off with Coinbase, <a href="https://twitter.com/fintechfrank/">The Block&#8217;s Frank Chaparro</a> got us thinking this morning <a href="https://twitter.com/fintechfrank/status/1366395196095795206">by tweeting</a> the following chart:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2118962" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-9.53.13-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-9.53.13-AM.png 729w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-9.53.13-AM.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-9.53.13-AM.png?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-9.53.13-AM.png?resize=680,400 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-9.53.13-AM.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>You can see why the chart caught our eye. Now, we can&#8217;t reproduce the same chart on <a href="https://www.cryptocompare.com/">CryptoCompare</a>, as the tool required sits behind a locked door. But we can, however, leverage other services to confirm the gist of the image.</p>
<p>Other data agrees: Historical trading information <a href="https://nomics.com/exchanges/gdax-coinbase-pro#chart">via Nomics</a> shows a steep rise in 2021 bitcoin trading on Coinbase Pro, a piece of the larger Coinbase empire. And Bitcoinity <a href="https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/volume/2y?c=c&amp;exchange=coinbase&amp;r=week&amp;t=a">shows similar gains for Coinbase</a> trading volumes over the same time period.</p>
<p>Chaparro is correct that the data paints a compelling Q1 2021 revenue story for Coinbase. But it&#8217;s not the only company that is seeing crypto demand spike.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram today <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/doubling-up-on-instagram-live-with-live-rooms/">announced</a> it&#8217;s adding a much-requested feature to its app with the launch of &#8220;Live Rooms,&#8221; which allow up to four people to broadcast live together at the same time. Previously, the app only allowed users to live stream with one other person, similar <a href="https://www.facebook.com/formedia/solutions/facebook-live">to Facebook Live</a>. The company says it hopes Live Rooms will open up more creative opportunities in terms of live broadcast formats to allow for things like live talk shows, expanded Q&amp;A&#8217;s or interviews, jam sessions for musicians, live shopping experiences and more.</p>
<p>In addition to the ability to livestream with more people, Instagram also touts how the new feature can help creators to make more money. Last year, in the early days of the COVID-19 crisis, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/instagram-to-test-new-revenue-streams-including-badges-and-igtv-ads/">Instagram introduced badges</a> as a way for fans to support their favorite creators during a live video. Once purchased, the badges appear next to a fan&#8217;s name throughout the live video, helping them to stand out in the comments and unlock other special features, like placement on the creator&#8217;s list of badge holders and access to a special heart.</p>
<p>Badges became more broadly available <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/instagram-rolls-out-fan-badges-for-live-videos-expands-igtv-ads-test/">last fall</a>, at three price points: $0.99, $1.99 or $4.99.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Live Rooms, fans can buy badges to support the hosts (one badge per person) as well as use other interactive features like Shopping and Live Fundraisers. The company says it&#8217;s also now developing other tools, like moderator controls and audio features that will roll out in the months to come.</p>
<p>To start a Live Room, you&#8217;ll swipe left and select the Live camera option, then title the Room and tap the Room icon to add guests. Here, you&#8217;ll see a list of people who&#8217;ve already requested to go live with you and you&#8217;ll be able to search for other guests to add.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2118989" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2118989" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2118989" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-3.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-3.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-3.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-3.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-3.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-3.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-3.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/pasted-image-0-3.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2118989" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>When you start the Live Room, you&#8217;ll remain at the top of the screen while guests are added. The guests can be added all at once or individually, depending on your preference. This allows for opportunities to add &#8220;surprise guests&#8221; to livestreams to keep fans engaged.</p>
<p>The ability to add more guests to a livestream can also help a creator grow their follower base, as all the guests&#8217; followers are notified about the Live Room, in addition to your own.</p>
<p>For safety reasons, any person that&#8217;s been blocked by any of the Live Room participants will not have access to join the livestream. Plus, any guests who have previously had their live access revoked due to violations of Instagram&#8217;s Community Guidelines won&#8217;t be able to join any Live Rooms.</p>
<p>During live broadcasts, the hosts can also report and block comments and use comment filters to maintain a safer experience for all viewers.</p>
<p>Live broadcasts became an increasingly important way for creators, business owners and brands to stay connected with followers during the pandemic, which shut down in-person live events, including concerts, shows, classes, conferences, meetups and more. Instagram reported a 70% increase in Live views from February to March, for instance, as creators and businesses shifted their work online.</p>

<p>As the pandemic wore on throughout 2020 and into 2021, the lack of in-person connection has allowed for other opportunities and even new social networks to grow. Live audio platform Clubhouse, for example, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/report-social-audio-app-clubhouse-has-topped-8-million-global-downloads/">seen rapid adoption</a>, particularly by the tech and creative crowds, who today use the app to tune into live shows, chat sessions and even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/31/elon-musk-goes-live-on-clubhouse-but-with-the-room-full-fans-stream-audio-on-youtube/">big-name interviews</a>. Twitter is now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-launches-its-voice-based-spaces-social-networking-feature-into-beta-testing/">building</a> a rival, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/facebook-building-product-clubhouse.html">reportedly</a>, so is Facebook.</p>
<p>But while Clubhouse offers a very different experience, it still operates in the same broader space of allowing fans to connect with high-profile individuals of some sort &#8212; entrepreneurs and founders, celebrities, market experts, thought leaders, influencers and so on. And because users&#8217; time is limited, seeing this type of activity shift to non-Facebook owned platforms is likely of concern to Instagram and its parent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the live video broadcasting space, Instagram today faces a number of competitors, from those focused on a particular niche &#8212; like game streaming site Twitch, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/talkshoplive-seed-funding/">live</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/popshop-live-gets-3-million-to-bring-live-streaming-to-shopping/">shopping</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/dote-shopping-party/">apps</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/newness-raises-3-5-million-for-its-twitch-for-beauty-streamers/">more</a>&#8212; as well as general purpose live platforms offered by YouTube and TikTok. (The latter was <a href="https://twitter.com/panzer/status/1360760548212699138">spotted offering</a> a four-up livestream format just last month, in fact.)</p>
<p>Instagram says Live Rooms are rolling out now to both iOS and Android to all global markets. The company expects the rollout to reach 100% of its user base within the week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Commission has said it will present a legislative plan later this month for what it&#8217;s calling a &#8220;digital green pass&#8221; &#8212; aka a digital certificate &#8212; which it says will be aimed at facilitating cross-border travel in the age of coronavirus.</p>
<p>President Ursula von der Leyen said today that the planned digital tool will aim to provide proof that a person has been vaccination &#8212; but not just that; the &#8216;digital green pass&#8217; will also display the results of tests, i.e. for those who have been unable to get a vaccine yet, along with information on &#8220;COVID-19 recovery&#8221;.</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;ll present this month a legislative proposal for a Digital Green Pass. The aim is to provide:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>•Proof that a person has been vaccinated <br />•Results of tests for those who couldn’t get a vaccine yet<br />•Info on COVID19 recovery</p>
<p>It will respect data protection, security &amp; privacy</p>
<p>&mdash; Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) <a href="https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1366346729289904128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;It will respect data protection, security and privacy,&#8221; von der Leyen added in a couple of tweets.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Digital Green Pass should facilitate Europeans&#8217; lives,&#8221; she also said. &#8220;The aim is to gradually enable them to move safely in the European Union or abroad &#8212; for work or tourism.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Commission will release details of the legislative plan on March 17, per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-von-der-leyen/eu-to-propose-vaccine-certificates-in-time-for-summer-holidays-idUSKCN2AT2DN">Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s executive is keen for a pan-EU system to be set up to avoid fragmentation of the bloc&#8217;s single market &#8212; such as if individual Member States strike their own bilateral deals. Or to avoid a third party commercial system gaining ground (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/tech-and-health-companies-including-microsoft-and-salesforce-team-up-on-digital-covid-19-vaccination-records/">earlier this year</a> a number of tech companies announced they were working to establish a &#8216;universal&#8217; standard for vaccine status).</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tech and health companies including Microsoft and Salesforce team up on digital COVID-19 vaccination records&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/tech-and-health-companies-including-microsoft-and-salesforce-team-up-on-digital-covid-19-vaccination-records/embed/#?secret=8ivYdkecz1" data-secret="8ivYdkecz1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Commission is being careful to avoid calling the digital pass a &#8216;vaccine passport&#8217; &#8212; as the notion of limiting people&#8217;s freedoms based on (still very) limited access to vaccines raises the ugly spectre of discrimination.</p>
<p>At the same time the EU executive is clearly feeling pressure to help Member States &#8212; such as Greece and Spain &#8212; whose economies rely heavily on cross-border tourism. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/europe-is-working-on-a-common-framework-for-vaccine-passports/">back in January</a> it said a common approach for mutual recognition of vaccine documentation is of the &#8220;utmost importance&#8221;.</p>
<p>A pan-EU digital certification for displaying vaccine and COVID-19 test result status is the solution it&#8217;s settled on. Although it does not appear that use of the digital pass will be mandatory.</p>
<p>The Commission declined to go into further detail when contacted for comment and during a <a href="https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-202456">press briefing today</a> when it was asked for more details about the digital pass plan.</p>
<p>Another question is how quickly the planned digital certificate system could be got up and running. With the prospect of summer vacations now just a few months out the Commission will be under pressure to work quickly. At the same time &#8212; per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu-von-der-leyen/eu-to-propose-vaccine-certificates-in-time-for-summer-holidays-idUSKCN2AT2DN">Reuters</a> &#8212; the Commission wants to cooperate with international organization to ensure the system works outside the EU, too.</p>
<p>Last month Apple said it was tightening up the iOS review process around vaccines passes &#8212; saying developers would now be required to work with entities recognized by public health authorities or companies associated with them prior to submitting such an app. The <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56099162">BBC</a> reported that Apple had made the change &#8220;to ensure these apps responsibly handle sensitive data and provide reliable functionality&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/eu-privacy-experts-push-a-decentralized-approach-to-covid-19-contacts-tracing/">Last year</a> a number of European privacy experts mobilized to devise a decentralized privacy-safe standard for another coronavirus-related digital tool: Bluetooth-powered contact-tracing apps to estimate COVID-19 exposure risk. Although some Member States (like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/france-rebrands-contact-tracing-app-in-an-effort-to-boost-downloads/">France</a>) opted for a centralized system &#8212; despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/apple-launches-system-level-covid-19-exposure-notification-express-with-ios-13-7-google-to-follow-later-this-month/">Apple and Google</a> choosing to support only decentralized apps for contact-tracing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.tonal.com">Tonal</a>, maker of the smart home fitness trainer, announced it is more than tripling the number of physical locations it sells devices in through a new partnership with Nordstrom.</p>
<p>Starting this month, Tonal will have 50-square-foot stations in the women’s activewear departments of at least 40 Nordstrom locations across the U.S., bringing the total number of Tonal physical locations to 60 by the end of 2021. Shoppers will be able to walk in or book appointments to try Tonal devices and purchase them through employees on-hand.</p>
<p>“As we looked to expand our retail footprint and strategy, we looked to the retail landscape, and we really feel like Nordstrom says ‘best-in-class’ — the department store is well-suited to succeed in a COVID and post-COVID world,” explained Christopher Stadler, Tonal’s CMO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tonal, which manufactures a wall-mounted device with a digital weight system that emulates various traditional gym stations, already operates 16 locations across the country with devices shoppers can try and work out to, with plans to open four additional showrooms later this year. But the partnership with Nordstrom, which expects <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nordstrom-eyes-billions-in-new-sales-in-a-post-covid-19-recovery-203849515.html">overall sales growth of 25%</a> in 2021, marks a first-of-its-kind for at-home fitness makers. Peloton, for instance, operates a larger network of dedicated showrooms in the U.S., Canada, Germany and the UK, but it has yet to partner with an outside retailer to display and demo its bikes and treadmills.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119034" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119034" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2119034" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tonal-x-Nordstrom_Nordstrom-Walnut-Creek.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tonal-x-Nordstrom_Nordstrom-Walnut-Creek.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tonal-x-Nordstrom_Nordstrom-Walnut-Creek.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tonal-x-Nordstrom_Nordstrom-Walnut-Creek.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tonal-x-Nordstrom_Nordstrom-Walnut-Creek.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tonal-x-Nordstrom_Nordstrom-Walnut-Creek.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tonal-x-Nordstrom_Nordstrom-Walnut-Creek.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tonal-x-Nordstrom_Nordstrom-Walnut-Creek.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tonal-x-Nordstrom_Nordstrom-Walnut-Creek.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2119034" class="wp-caption-text">An example of Tonal&#8217;s placement at a Nordstrom in Walnut Creek. Photo via Tonal.</p></div></p>
<p>Tonal’s physical expansion arrives amid a boom in demand for at-home equipment during the pandemic. According to Stadler, sales of Tonal equipment surged 800% from December 2019 to December 2020, causing 10-12 week wait times for deliveries. Those delays are somewhat comparable to Peloton, which has also faced significant delivery wait times in recent months and currently reports 6-10 week delays — an issue Peloton CEO John Foley acknowledged and apologized for in a note to users.</p>
<p>Tonal, for its part, is working to address shipment delays. According to Stadler, the startup has significantly ramped up production of devices, increased employee headcount, and in some cases, now air-ships equipment from Taiwan to the U.S. to meet demand.</p>
<p>“We have seen extraordinary demand for Tonal, and we’re working aggressively around the clock to produce, deliver and install Tonals faster and faster,” says Stadler. “We’ve absolutely ramped up production, and all facets of the organization are rallying to deliver our customer orders as quickly as we can.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few things are more personal than a keyboard and yet they are often overlooked by Work From Home guides. Why use the standard issue keyboard when there are so many options available? This is a sampling of some of the keyboards used by TechCrunch’s editorial staff.

<p>Excuse the dust, grim, and general dirtiness of the following. Keyboards are gross and hard to clean and we did the best we could getting our keyboards photo-ready. I used two cans of air on my keyboard and it still looks like a toy in a preschool sandbox.</p>

<p>Working across borders is hard — working across languages is even harder. So getting a foreign language keyboard (mine is Korean) has been a godsend, if only because after two decades of using a computer, I still peck at a keyboard like I don’t know the location of the keys.</p>
<p>Now, should you get a foreign language keyboard? Good god no. Certainly don’t buy it overseas like I originally did when I was a foreign correspondent in Seoul, since apparently warranties don’t transfer globally. Also, the E key finally busted on my last “space white” keyboard (unfortunately, E is about as common in English as ㄷ/ㄸ is in Korean so that key gets a lot of abuse), and let’s just say the world is not designed to special order individual keys in a foreign language in the United States.</p>
<p>So I bought a new space grey keyboard. And then Apple said they couldn’t find a replacement Korean keyboard E key in white, so they gave me a free keyboard because Apple is nice. So now I have two space grey Korean keyboards, one on my desk and one sitting in storage for when I invariably destroy the one I’m typing this on. Don’t buy a foreign language keyboard. Actually, don’t buy a keyboard at all. Certainly don’t be a writer. Just yell in a Clubhouse room and let’s move to the next, post-text century.</p>

<p>I just acquired this <a href="https://en.varmilo.com/keyboardproscenium/">Varmilo</a> V87M tenkeyless with PBT keycaps and Cherry Red switches. It&#8217;s got a great solid feel and is very comfortable to type on, and has a deeper sound than some more clacky keyboards I&#8217;ve used. But I don&#8217;t like the placement of the media keys.</p>
<p>Before this I had an all-black Ducky One with side-printed key labels, which I much prefer. But I ordered it with Cherry Black switches, which it turns out are uncomfortable for me to use &#8211; they take a bit more force and have a sort of &#8220;bump&#8221; in the middle, and my body didn&#8217;t like it. I did, however, like the DIY feel of adjusting the dipswitches and programming the media keys in as well, though I totally get it&#8217;s not for everyone.</p>
<p>I wish that I could combine the feel and build of the Varmilo with the keycaps and customizability of the Ducky and the media controls of the Das Keyboard 4, with its lovely volume wheel. But I&#8217;m tempted by non-Cherry switches now that their patents have expired and the market is wide open. Someone send me one of those little switch samplers!</p>

<p>Here’s my boring Apple keyboard. It’s a French keyboard so it’s going to look all weird if you’ve used QWERTY keyboards your entire life. It works, it’s reliable and I can type for hours and hours… The most important part is that I don’t think about it so I can just focus on what I’m writing.</p>

<p>The fact that Apple charges $149 for its wireless space grey Magic Keyboard when the silver variant goes for $129 might seem like an oddity for a company worth $2.2 trillion, but maybe the fact that they have suckered a rube like myself into paying an extra $20 for a dark grey colorway is the reason they have achieved such ridiculous success.</p>
<p>In recent years, Apple has opted to stay conservative with the entry prices for some of their hardware but they have also begun jacking up the prices of accessories for those devices. My desire to have an external keyboard that matched all of my other tech stuff says more about me than it does Apple, but come on Tim, do you really need that extra $20 from me?</p>

<p>I bought this keyboard when I built my new PC last month. I generally use an Apple keyboard for work and mostly game with a PS4 controller so I hadn’t used it much. But a few weeks ago I spilled coffee on my main keyboard for the first time in my life. I tried to used a Logitech K380 I have as a substitute but even though it’s pretty new a few of its keys squeak which makes me feel crazy.</p>
<p>Now I’ve subbed in my admittedly beautiful rainbow machine the Cooler Master SK622 as my day to day keyboard. It’s my first mechanical keyboard! I went with blue switches because I don’t like the feel of the red ones, but it is a bit hard to get used to the noise. Ideally I’d probably prefer brown switches! It feels pretty good though, even for someone (me) who types pretty fast but in a very wacky way because I never learned to do it the right way. Maybe it’s time for Mario Teaches Typing after all.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s not much to say about the tool of my trade &#8211; except that it could do with a good clean. The white is definitely not as crisp as Apple would like at this point. The lettering on the &#8216;S&#8217; key has also worn a bit for some reason. Other than that I&#8217;ve no complaints. I had to stop relying on the MBP laptop keyboard because it&#8217;s so faulty (sticky &#8216;B&#8217; and &#8216;N&#8217; keys which either don&#8217;t type or double type in faulty keyboard roulette). I like the Magic keyboard&#8217;s compact size. The battery also lasts a decent amount of time before you have to go hunting for overpriced Apple dongles in order to juice it back up.</p>
<p>I have one complaint: The Bluetooth connection seems to go a bit funky after a while because hitting CAPS Lock can fire up the MBP&#8217;s spinning wheel &#8216;o death for no good reason. Switching the keyboard&#8217;s Bluetooth off and back on and again seems to restore order.</p>

<p>This is the <a href="https://www.hhkeyboard.com">Happy Hacking Keyboard Professional 2</a> with a partial set of custom keycaps. Yes, long name for a small keyboard. It’s not perfect and yet I love it. Don’t worry. It still has a number pad and media controls. These are accessed through a function key (the heart).</p>
<p>The Happy Hacking Keyboard has a longer history than most, originally designed for Unix programmers. For me, the small size is perfect for just typing, and the keys feel lovely thanks to its novel switches. This keyboard uses Topre capacitive key switches, which combine the feel of a mechanical switch with the responsiveness of a membrane-based keyboard. The result are resounding clicks and clacks, and keys that are resistant at the top and easy at the bottom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>There are several newer versions of this keyboard with wireless connectivity and quieter key switches.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Atlanta startups can now add another name to their rolodexes of venture firms operating out of the Big Peach with the close of Silicon Road Ventures new $31 million fund.</p>
<p>Silicon Road invests across the U.S. from its base in Atlanta, the firm said with a focus on e-commerce, retail, and consumer packaged goods.</p>
<p>The firm said it&#8217;s focused on in-store retail and technology for shoppers, the multi-channel commerce world, supply chain and logistics technologies and financial technologies and payments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded two years ago, the fund invested in ten startups over the course of 2020 and is targeting another twenty for its first fund.</p>
<p>The firm hopes that entrepreneurs find its &#8220;corporate connect&#8221; program to be a key differentiator, which relies on founder and managing partner Sid Mookerji&#8217;s experience in e-commerce, retail and consumer packaged goods to link corporations to relevant startups and research, according to a statement.</p>
<p>Silicon Road is already working with the upstart retail chain Citizen Supply, which provides a highly curated marketplace to showcase new consumer brands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>, the members only event series that features tech leaders waxing poetic on how to perfect the pitch deck (and more!) has gotten off to a strong start in 2021. Thus far, we&#8217;ve seen the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/28/justworks-series-b-pitch-deck-may-be-the-most-wonderfully-simple-deck-ive-ever-seen/">most beautifully simple deck in existence with the help of Justworks&#8217; Isaac Oates and Bain&#8217;s Matt Harris</a>, learned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/pitch-decks-pricing-and-how-to-nail-the-narrative-with-lightspeeds-gaurav-gupta-and-grafanas-raj-dutt/">how to nail the narrative with Lightspeed&#8217;s Gaurav Gupta and Grafana&#8217;s Raj Dutt</a>, heard about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/ironclads-jason-boehmig-the-objective-of-pricing-is-to-become-less-wrong-over-time/">perils of pricing with Accel&#8217;s Steve Loughlin and Ironclad&#8217;s Jason Boehmig</a>, and learned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/felicis-aydin-senkut-and-guidelines-kevin-busque-on-the-value-of-simple-pitch-decks/">the value of simple pitch decks with Felicis&#8217; Aydin Senkut and Guideline&#8217;s Kevin Busque</a>.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s only the beginning. We&#8217;ve got a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/check-out-the-incredible-speakers-joining-us-on-extra-crunch-live-in-march/">packed slate coming your way in March</a>, featuring Cleo Capital&#8217;s Sarah Kunst, PlanetFWD&#8217;s Julia Collins, Flourish Ventures&#8217; Emmalyn Shaw, Steady&#8217;s Adam Roseman, Mayfield&#8217;s Navin Chaddha, and Poshmark&#8217;s Manish Chandra.</p>
<p>One of the beautiful things about Extra Crunch Live is the Pitch Deck Teardown. Our esteemed speakers take a look at pitch decks <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">submitted by the audience</a> and give their live feedback. It&#8217;s an invaluable way to understand how VCs and founders alike think about what makes a great deck.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p id="speakable-summary">The importance of the pitch deck can’t be underestimated. It is often the first point of contact between a company and venture investors, but how investors consume a pitch deck (and what they <em>really</em> think) is also a bit of a black box.</p>
<p>Are they speed-flipping through the slides or taking their time? Do they prefer more information on the team or context on the industry? More numbers or more words? How many slides is the right number of slides?</p>
<p>There are too many questions to count, and often very few answers. But we’re popping the lid off of that black box with the Pitch Deck Teardown.</p>
<p>If this seems like a good fit for you, you can <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">submit your pitch deck to be featured on Extra Crunch Live right here</a>. (We prioritize decks submitted by Extra Crunch members, but anyone can send us a deck and we&#8217;ll take a look at as many as possible!)</p>
<p>See you on the next episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S.-based oil major Chevron is doubling down on its investment in geothermal power by investing in a Swedish developer of low-temperature geothermal and heat power projects called Baseload Capital.</p>
<p>Oil companies are under pressure to find new lines of business as the world prepares for a massive shift to renewable energy resources to power all aspects of industry in the face of mounting climate-related disasters caused by greenhouse gas emissions warming the temperature on the planet.</p>
<p>Joining Chevron in the investment was the ubiquitous billionaire-backed clean energy investment firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures and a Swedish investment group called Gullspang Invest AB.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The investment into Baseload follows closely on the heels of another commitment that Chevron made to the geothermal technology developer <a href="https://eavor.com/">Eavor</a> and a recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/geothermal-home-heating-gets-a-30-million-boost-from-bill-gates-breakthrough-energy-ventures/">Breakthrough Energy Ventures investment in the Google-affiliated company, Dandelion Energy</a> (a spinout from Google&#8217;s parent company&#8217;s moonshot technology development business unit, called X).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="lc9BQdjaEj"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/geothermal-home-heating-gets-a-30-million-boost-from-bill-gates-breakthrough-energy-ventures/">Geothermal home heating gets a $30 million boost from Bill Gates&#8217; Breakthrough Energy Ventures</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Geothermal home heating gets a $30 million boost from Bill Gates&#8217; Breakthrough Energy Ventures&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/geothermal-home-heating-gets-a-30-million-boost-from-bill-gates-breakthrough-energy-ventures/embed/#?secret=lc9BQdjaEj" data-secret="lc9BQdjaEj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Dandelion and Eavor are just two examples of a groundswell of startups working to leverage the knowledge from the oil and gas industry to tap geothermal resources for applications ranging from baseload energy to home heating and cooling.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re joined by businesses like <a href="https://www.fervoenergy.com/">Fervo Energy</a>, <a href="https://www.greenfireenergy.com/">GreenFire Energy</a> and <a href="https://www.sagegeo.com/">Sage Geosystems</a>, who&#8217;re all leveraging heat to generate power.</p>
<p>As Chevron noted in its press release, heat power is an affordable form of renewable energy that can be harnessed from either geothermal resources or waste heat.</p>
<p>The investments in Baseload and Eavor are financed by CTV’s Core Venture fund, which identifies companies with technology that can add efficiencies to Chevron’s core business in operational enhancement, digitalization and lower-carbon operations, the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Together the two businesses are planning pilot projects to test technology and could look to current Baseload operations in Japan, Taiwan, Iceland or the United States to develop projects.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Financial terms of the deal were undisclosed. </span></p>
<p>“In August, we announced that we were looking for a new strategic investor to help us accelerate deployment in our key markets,” said Baseload’s Chief Executive Officer Alexander Helling. “We couldn’t have asked for a better one. Chevron complements our group of owners and adds expertise in drilling, engineering, exploration and more. These assets are expected to accelerate our ability to deploy heat power and strengthen our way of working.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.syniverse.com/">Syniverse Technologies</a>, a company that helps mobile providers move communications across public and private networks, announced an extensive partnership with <a href="http://Twilio.com">Twilio</a> this morning. Under the agreement, Twilio is investing up to $750 million to become a minority owner in the company.</p>
<p>The idea behind the partnership is to combine Twilio&#8217;s API communications expertise with Syniverse&#8217;s mobile carrier contacts to create this end-to-end communications system. Twilio&#8217;s strength has always been its ability to deliver communications like texts without having a carrier relationship. This deal gives them access to that side of the equation.</p>
<p>James Attwood, executive chairman at Syniverse, certainly saw the value of the two companies working together. &#8220;The partnership will provide Syniverse access to Twilio’s extensive enterprise and API services expertise, creating opportunities to continue to build on Syniverse’s highly innovative product portfolio that helps mobile network operators and enterprises make communications better for their customers,&#8221; Attwood said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twilio&#8217;s $3.2B Segment acquisition is about helping developers build data-fueled apps&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilios-3-2b-segment-acquisition-about-helping-developers-build-data-fueled-apps/embed/#?secret=YoTOXQsOy3" data-secret="YoTOXQsOy3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Today&#8217;s deal comes on the heels of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/12/twilio-confirms-it-is-buying-segment-for-3-2b-in-an-all-stock-deal/">the company&#8217;s $3.2 billion acquisition of Segment</a> at the end of last year as it continues to look for ways to expand its markets. Will Townsend, an analyst at Moor Insight &amp; Strategy who covers the network and carrier markets, sees this deal giving Twilio access to a broader set of technologies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twilio [gets] access to Syniverse&#8217;s significant capabilities in massive industrial IoT and private 4G LTE and 5G cellular networking. Both are poised to ramp significantly given newfound enterprise access to licensed spectrum via recent C-Band and CBRS auctions,&#8221; Townsend told me. He believes this will help Twilio reach parts of the enterprise not connected by Wi-FI or where the customers are dealing with &#8220;a mishmash of solutions that don&#8217;t scale or propagate well.&#8221;</p>
<p>As it turns out, it&#8217;s not a coincidence the two companies are coming together like this. In fact, Twilio has been a Syniverse customer for some time, according to Chee Chew, chief product officer at Twilio.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a case of an old-school company like Syniverse, which was founded in 1987, combining forces with a more modern approach to communications like Twilio, which provides developers with APIs to deliver communications services inside applications with just a couple of lines of code.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/twilio-nears-deal-to-invest-up-to-750m-in-syniverse-sources-say-11614554312">which broke the news</a> of this deal, is also reporting the company could go public via SPAC at a value of between $2 and $3 billion some time later this year. That would suggest that it has not gained much value since the 2010 deal.</p>
<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, says the SPAC provides an interesting additional component to the deal. &#8220;The high-flying stock market creates all kind of new chickens, one of them being a SPAC, and that’s the financial opportunity that Twilio is likely pursuing with the investment into Syniverse. The more immediate benefit is for Twilio to use the messaging vendor for its services. Call it a partnership with investment upside,&#8221; Mueller said.</p>
<p>According to Syniverse, &#8220;the company is one of the largest private IP Packet Exchange (IPX) providers in the world and offers a range of networking solutions, excelling in scenarios where seamless connections must cross over networks &#8212; either across multiple private networks or between public and private networks.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is currently <a href="https://www.carlyle.com/media-room/news-release-archive/carlyle-group-buy-syniverse-technologies-31-share-26-billion">owned by the Carlyle Group</a> private equity firm, which bought it in 2010 for $2.6 billion. Twilio launched in 2008 and raised over $236 million before<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/22/twilio-prices-its-ipo-at-15-per-share-above-its-previous-target/"> going public in 2016 at $15 per share</a>. The stock was up 3.82% in early trading, suggesting that Wall Street approves of the deal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An iPhone hacking team has released a new jailbreak tool for almost every iPhone, including the most recent models, by using the same vulnerability that Apple last month said was under active attack by hackers.</p>
<p>The Unc0ver team <a href="https://twitter.com/Pwn20wnd/status/1365833293069975557">released its latest jailbreak</a> this weekend, and says it works on iOS 11 (iPhone 5s and later) to iOS 14.3, which Apple released in December.</p>
<p>Jailbreaking is a cat-and-mouse game between security researchers who want greater control and customizations over their phones, and Apple, which says it locks down iPhones for security. Hackers build jailbreak tools by finding and exploiting vulnerabilities that can lift some of the restrictions that Apple puts in place, like installing apps outside of its app store, which most Android users are already used to.</p>
<p>In a tweet, the jailbreak group said it used its &#8220;own exploit&#8221; for CVE-2021-1782, a kernel vulnerability that Apple said was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/apple-says-ios-14-4-fixes-three-security-bugs-under-active-attack/">one of three flaws</a> that &#8220;may have been actively exploited&#8221; by hackers. By targeting the kernel, the hackers are able to get deep hooks into the underlying operating system.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We wrote our own exploit based on CVE-2021-1782 for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/unc0ver?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#unc0ver</a> to achieve optimal exploit speed and stability.</p>
<p>&mdash; @Pwn20wnd (@Pwn20wnd) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pwn20wnd/status/1364878565523787777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 25, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212146">fixed the vulnerability</a> in iOS 14.4, released last month, which also prevents the jailbreak from working on later versions. It was a rare admission that the iPhone was under active attack by hackers, but the company declined to say who the hackers were and who they were targeting. Apple also granted anonymity to the researcher who submitted the bug.</p>
<p>The group&#8217;s last jailbreak, which supported iPhones running iOS 11 to iOS 13.5, was fixed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/23/hackers-iphone-new-jailbreak/">in a matter of days</a> last year. Apple works quickly to understand and fix the vulnerabilities found by jailbreak groups, since these same vulnerabilities can be exploited maliciously.</p>
<p>Security experts generally advise iPhone users against jailbreaking because it makes the device more vulnerable to attacks. And while keeping your phone up to date may introduce security fixes that remove the jailbreak, it&#8217;s one of the best ways of keeping your device secure.</p>
