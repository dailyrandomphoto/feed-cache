										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brazil is a country riven with economic contradictions. It has one of the largest and most profitable banking industries in Latin America, and is among the world’s most developed financial markets. Financial transactions that would take days to process in the United States through ACH happen instantaneously in Brazil. This sophistication, however, masks a backward state of affairs plagued by appalling customer service, exorbitant fees and lack of banking access for many.</p>
<p>The country’s financial system is volatile and often leaves its citizens with few or no alternatives. <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=58873">According to an HBS case study</a>, “in December 2018 the interest rate in Brazil for corporate loans was 52.3%, for consumer loans it was 120.0% and for credit card indebtedness it was 272.42%.” Those rates are many multiples higher compared to figures in neighboring countries.</p>
<p>Brazil’s banking system is a massive market, and one ill-served by incumbents. If someone could thread the needle of product development, strategy and political horse trading required to build a bank in a country where it is nearly impossible for foreigners to own or invest in a bank, it would be one of the great startup and economic success stories of this century.</p>
<p><b>Nubank</b> is on its way to realizing that objective. Its story is one of unmitigated success, even by the standards of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ec1">our EC-1 series</a> on high-flying companies and their hard-learned lessons. Just last week, this Brazilian credit card and banking fintech <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/fintech-all-star-nubank-raises-a-750m-mega-round/">raised a $750 million round led by Berkshire Hathaway</a> at a $30 billion valuation, becoming one of the most valuable startups in the world. It has 40 million users across Brazil, as well as Mexico and Colombia.</p>
<p>Yet, it’s a startup with a CEO and co-founder who isn’t Brazilian, didn’t speak the local language of Portuguese, hadn’t started a company before, and didn’t really know a lot about banking to begin with. This is a story of how raw execution, a “faster, faster” mentality and a fanaticism for making customer experience as enjoyable as a trip to Disney World can completely change the history of an industry — and country — forever.</p>
<p>Our lead writer for this EC-1 is <b>Marcella McCarthy</b>. McCarthy, who spent significant time in Brazil growing up and is trilingual in English, Spanish and Portuguese, has been covering the LatAm and Miami ecosystems for TechCrunch with an eye to the disruption underway in these interconnected regions. The lead editor for this package was <b>Danny Crichton</b>, the assistant editor was <b>Ram Iyer</b>, the copy editor was <b>Richard Dal Porto</b>, and illustrations were drawn by <b>Nigel Sussman</b>.</p>
<p><i>Nubank had no say in the content of this analysis and did not get advance access to it. McCarthy has no financial ties to Nubank or other conflicts of interest to disclose.</i></p>
<p>The Nubank EC-1 comprises four main articles numbering 9,200 words and a reading time of 37 minutes. Here’s what’s in the bank:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For most startups, the hardest early challenge is identifying a market and a product to serve it. That wasn’t the case for Nubank CEO David Velez, who understood the massive potential for success if he could break into Latin America’s most valuable economy with even a moderately modern banking offering.</p>
<p>Instead, the challenge was how to rebuild the concept of a bank in a country where banking is widely hated, all while the incumbents heavily entrenched with the state worked to block every move.</p>
<p>Nubank knew its market and geography, and through tenacious fundraising, inventive marketing and product development, and a series of contrarian hires, Velez and his team stripped bare the morass of Brazilian banking to build one of the world’s great fintech companies.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The challenge was how to rebuild the concept of a bank in a country where banking is widely hated, all while the incumbents heavily entrenched with the state worked to block every move.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In the first part of this EC-1, I’ll look at how Velez brought his skills and experience to bear on this market, how Nubank was founded in 2013, and how the team brought a Californian rather than Brazilian vibe to their first office on — no joke — California Street, in a neighborhood called Brooklin in the city of São Paulo.</p>
<h2>The makings of an entrepreneur</h2>
<p>The idea of being his own boss was ingrained in Velez from his earliest days in Colombia, where he grew up in an entrepreneurial family, with a father who owned a button factory. “I heard from my dad over and over again that you need to start your own company,” Velez said.</p>
<p>But years would pass and Velez still had no idea what he wanted to do. To “kill time,” and also to surround himself with entrepreneurial energy, Velez attended Stanford University — partially financed by the sale of some livestock — and then worked as an analyst at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley before switching to venture capital at General Atlantic and Sequoia.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[David Velez needed to fill two key co-founding roles to begin building Nubank — he needed a CTO to lead the engineering side of the business, as Velez didn’t have an engineering background.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/nubank-ec1-origin/">we mentioned in part 1 of this EC-1</a>, David Velez had two key co-founding roles he needed to fill to get started building Nubank. For one, he needed a CTO to lead the engineering side of the business, as Velez didn’t have an engineering background.</p>
<p>Edward Wible, an American computer science graduate who spent most of his career in private equity, would take that responsibility. He didn’t bring years of coding experience, but he had qualities that Velez considered more important: A strong belief in the potential of the product and an equally intense commitment to working on it.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Given the occasionally hostile reaction of most incumbent banks to their customers in Brazil, Nubank’s starkly contrasting openness and transparency has garnered a huge following.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>That left an even more important role to fill — one that was much harder to define. This other co-founder would need to blend knowledge of the Brazilian market and local savvy with expertise in banking, all while embodying a Silicon Valley ethos of focusing on customers. This person would also have to work in São Paulo for minimal wages out of a small office with just one bathroom, all in the belief that their equity (both stock and sweat) would one day be worth it.</p>
<p>Velez would eventually stumble upon Cristina Junqueira, who was qualified to do all this, and much, much more.</p>
<p>“Once someone said I was the glue of the operation, and that someone else was the brains. And I said, ‘No, I’m the glue <i>and</i> the brains, and I bet my brain is even better than his,”’ Junqueira said.</p>
<p>Junqueira didn’t just lead Nubank’s drive into the Brazilian market, she also upended age-old notions of what it means to be a 21st-century bank. Her inspiration was nothing short of Disney, and her mission was to create a bank as popular as the magical kingdom itself.</p>
<p>A bank. As popular as Disney. Sounds like a fairy tale, frankly.</p>
<h2>Raised to be a doer</h2>
<p>Unlike her co-founders Velez and Wible, Junqueira grew up in Nubank’s home market of Brazil. The eldest of four sisters, she remembers her parents — both dentists — always assiduously working to maintain their practice.</p>
<p>Their work ethic trickled down, but so did responsibility. As the oldest at home, she was forced to grow up quickly and take on responsibilities from an early age. “I remember being 11 years old and doing grocery shopping for the month,” she said. “I did everything very young.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It’s easy to assume the name Nubank refers to “new bank,” but that’s not what the founders were going for. The word “nu” in Portuguese means “naked,” and Velez wanted the name to reflect his vision.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As we saw in parts 1 and 2 of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/nubank-ec1/">this EC-1</a>, by mid-2013, Nubank CEO David Velez had most of what he needed to get started. He’d brought on two co-founders, assembled ambitious engineering and operations teams, raised $2 million in seed funding from Sequoia and Kaszek, rented a tiny office in São Paulo, and was armed with a mission to deliver the kind of banking services that customers in a market as large and lucrative as Brazil’s should expect.</p>
<p>Despite being named Nubank, however, the startup couldn’t actually <i>be</i> a bank: Brazil’s laws made it illegal at the time for a foreigner-run company to operate a bank. That restriction required the team to develop an inventive product strategy to find a foothold in the market while they waited for a license directly from the country’s president.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Nubank was so adamant about differentiating itself from other banks that it chose Barney purple for its brand color and first credit card.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Nubank therefore pursued a credit card as its first offering, but it had to race against a clock counting quickly down to zero. At the time, Brazil didn’t have ownership restrictions on this product segment like it did with banking, but new rules were coming into force in just a few months in May 2014 that would block a company like Nubank from launching.</p>
<p>The company needed to execute rapidly over the next eight months if it wanted to be grandfathered into the existing regulations. The speed of operations was frantic to say the least, and the company would go on to work even faster, ultimately propelling itself into the stratosphere of fintech startups.</p>
<h2>Full faith in credit</h2>
<p>It’s easy to assume that the name Nubank refers to “new bank,” but that’s not really what the founders were going for. The word “nu” in Portuguese means “naked,” and Velez and his team wanted the name to reflect their vision: To build a 21st-Century bank without any of the shackles imposed by the traditional banks in Brazil.</p>
<p>The team wanted to offer services to as many people as possible, as there is a huge wealth gap in Brazil, where the minimum wage is around $200 a month.</p>
<p>Launching with just a credit card was both a strategic and practical business decision. Credit cards were widely used in the country, and everyone understood how they worked. Additionally, you could only use credit cards to shop online in Brazil, because debit cards weren’t accepted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nubank’s first office, on California Street in the Brooklin neighborhood of São Paulo, makes for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/nubank-ec1-origin/">a great beginning to the company’s story</a>. It wasn’t a Silicon Valley garage, but this tiny, one-bathroom rented house, where 30 people <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/nubank-ec1-scaling/">worked insane hours to push out the company’s debut credit card</a>, lends just as well to an image of entrepreneurial spirit and drive.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			As Nubank continues to make international waves, more and more VC investors are taking a look at the Brazilian ecosystem and could potentially fund other upstarts in the years to come.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But as Nubank’s story continued, the team eventually had to move out of that early office, and the next several offices, too. Eventually Nubank had to relocate to an eight-story building in São Paulo, which houses a large part of the company’s now 3,000-person team.</p>
<p>The startup reached decacorn status in far less than a decade, and it is growing faster than ever. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/fintech-darling-nubank-raises-blockbuster-400m-series-g-at-25b-valuation/">When I interviewed CEO David Velez back in January</a> to discuss Nubank’s $400 million Series G, he said, “We’ve gone from 12 million customers in 2019 to 34 million solely based on word of mouth.” By September last year, the company was onboarding 41,000 new customers per day.</p>
<p>In the five months since our interview, Nubank has managed to rope in a whopping 6 million customers to reach 40 million. It’s now valued at $30 billion.</p>

<p>Getting there hasn’t been easy. The company’s three co-founders, Velez, Edward Wible and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/nubank-ec1-cofounder/">Cristina Junqueira</a>, had to make key strategic decisions about how to scale themselves to retain the company’s lead in the neobanking market. That lead is getting tougher to sustain every day. Nubank’s proliferating offerings and broader geographical remit has painted a massive target on its back, and a wide number of competitors have cropped up to run on the paths it pioneered.</p>
<p>Like most Disney films, a fairy-tale ending seems in order, but it’ll take a few more rotations of the film wheel to get to the ending.</p>
<h2>Early mistakes and ingredients for success</h2>
<p>For the co-founding trio, it became increasingly clear that Nubank’s growing scale demanded critical strategic decisions on how to bring order to the company.</p>
<p>By 2018, the company had thousands of employees, millions of customers, and they still didn’t have a head of HR. Growth until then had been somewhat unstructured. According to Junqueira, waiting so long to hire a head of HR was one of their early mistakes, because it stunted their ability to grow. “[Good] people continue to be our biggest bottleneck,” she says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When they were released in 2019, Powerbeats Pro were standouts. Two-plus years later, they remain one of the more well-rounded wireless earbuds on the market. There are things I would change, of course. Even in 2019, that charging case was ridiculously large. In 2021, the original case is all the more absurd. And, of course, noise-canceling has become nearly standardized among mid-tier buds.</p>
<p>After weeks of rumors and leaks (including a very public cameo on the ears of one of <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/beats_studio_buds_spotted_in_the_ears_of_lebron_james-news-49327.php">the world’s most famous athletes</a>), Beats’ latest take on the space is finally official. Meet the Beats Studio Pro. They are not, as the company will be quick to tell you, a Powerbeats Pro replacement. Those are sticking around (which isn’t to say they won’t be getting their own upgrade).</p>
<p>Beats may be Apple-owned, but in most respects, the brand operates as it has. It was a wildly successful brand well before Apple got its hands on it, after all. So the company’s opted not to fix what’s clearly not broken. And while technology is clearly shared between the two camps (the H1 chip on the Powerbeats, example), it maintains a line between its self-branded audio offerings (AirPods, et al.) and the Beats line. There’s a reason Beats never really shows up at Apple events, in spite of having a big announcement the following week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Compared to AirPods, the Beats lines can get a bit convoluted. Effectively the new Studio Beats are a fully wireless earbud line from the company, borrowing a name from its premium over-ear line. But the new buds are actually significantly more compact than Powerbeats Pro, both in terms of the case and the buds themselves. Also notable &#8212; and frankly a bit surprising &#8212; is the pricing.</p>
<p>At $150, the Studio Buds are a fair bit cheaper than the two-year-old Powerbeats Pro, which currently go for between $160 and $200 online. Keep in mind, that’s down from a launch price of $250. That’s also $50 less than the AirPods and $20 less than the Galaxy Buds. It’s a nice price for what you’re getting here &#8212; though maybe my standards have shifted a bit, just coming off <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/sony-sets-a-new-standard-with-the-wf-1000xm4-earbuds/">of a review of the $280 Sony WF-1000XM4</a>.</p>
<p>Those Sonys are in a class of their own, of course. It’s much fairer for all parties concerned to pit them against other midrange headphones. And by that metric, they perform pretty well. The biggest addition here is active noise canceling &#8212; keep in mind, it was far from standard when the Powerbeats Pro were announced. These days, however, it feels like a glaring omission at this price range (Google, I’m looking at you).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165106" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165106" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2165106" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9540.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9540.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9540.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9540.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9540.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9540.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9540.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9540.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9540.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165106" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Another interesting top-level feature is fast pairing for both iOS and Android, making the Studio Beats one of the first products to walk that line. Funny that it comes from an Apple product, but again, the company seems be afforded at least a little bit of freedom on that front. It’s a small thing &#8212; after all, many people will only use the iOS/Android one-touch pairing once, but there’s a lot to be said for making the product as accessible to as many potential customers as possible.</p>

<p>I like the new streamlined design of the buds. As mentioned above, the new case is a fraction of the size of the Powerbeats. Still, the Studio Buds have the same stated battery life, with eight hours on the headphones and 24 total, when you factor in the case. That’s a healthy bit of life, which is quickly becoming the standard these days. There’s a USB-C port on the bottom (a move away from the Apple-only Lightning), which will give you an hour of playback time on a five-minute charge.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165127" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165127" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2165127" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9498.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9498.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9498.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9498.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9498.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9498.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9498.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9498.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9498.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165127" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The case is wider and a bit thicker than the AirPods Pro, but is still easily pocketed. It has a bit of a cheap plasticky feel to it, but the matte finish is a nice touch. The branding is the standard Beats level of loud, with a big, bold white “b” set against the black. The buds, too, sport the logo, which can pass for a “9” or a “6” depending on positioning. The lid has a snap to it, and the magnets on the buds snap nicely in place &#8212; though, as with the Powerbeats, it can take a little finagling to get them into the proper position.</p>
<p>The buds are fairly compact, as well. The earhooks are gone. That’s something of a mixed bag, honestly. I didn’t think I would love the Powerbeats Pros earhooks, but as someone who experiences some ear pain with a lot of different bud designs, I’ve found them to be among the most comfortable options, transferring the load bearing to the top of the ear.</p>
<p>The Studio Buds are fairly comfortable, and I was able to work out in them (IPX4 rating FTW), though I did have some trouble keeping them in place on occasion. That’s certainly never been a problem with the Powerbeats. If you really don’t want them to move, I recommend applying a bit of pressure to really corkscrew them in place.</p>
<p>One of the design choices I really appreciate that Beats brought back is the physical button. Powerbeats had them and they&#8217;re back here on the end of the Studio Buds. It’s got a nice little click to it that I prefer to purely touch-based buttons. A single click will Play/Pause and a long click will turn ANC on and off.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165107" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165107" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2165107" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9539.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9539.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9539.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9539.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9539.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9539.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9539.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9539.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/CMC_9539.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165107" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The ANC is a nice addition, of course. It does a decent job with ambient noise, but can’t really touch what you’ll find on higher-end systems. The sound quality, too, has come a ways in the last couple of years. Beats has refined things with a pair of 8.2mm drivers that offer solid sound at their price point. These aren’t sitting-around-and-enjoy-the-finer-points-of-classical-sonata-or-experimental-jazz-record buds; they are, however, solid, listen-to-music-or-a-podcast-while-going-about-your-life headphones.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to like about the buds, and with little question, they’re a much better deal in 2021 than the Powerbeats Pro, even if they don’t feel as groundbreaking as their predecessors did at launch.</p>
<p>The new Beats Studio Buds are up for preorder today and start shipping June 24.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Depending on whom you ask, the digital advertising industry is either counting down the minutes to doomsday or entering an exciting new era for engaging with consumers. Apple’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know/">iOS 14.5 update</a> — which effectively ends automatic opt-ins to online tracking and data collection — is finally at hand, and Google aims to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/google-wants-to-phase-out-support-for-third-party-cookies-in-chrome-within-two-years/">phase out third-party cookies</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">next year</a>.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The future could see a wave of innovations that help consumers opt out of data collection. So it’s up to the advertising industry to find ways to get these educated, empowered consumers to opt back in.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Whether these changes set digital advertisers back 15 years or pave the way to more fruitful interactions with customers remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: This is big. Allowing users to decide what browsing data can be collected, by whom and under what circumstances is a move that will change the direction of the advertising industry.</p>
<p>But the new direction does not have to lead digital marketers to oblivion, failure or poverty. In fact, it’s quite the opposite.</p>
<p>With a few changes to short-term strategy — and a longer-term plan that takes into account the fact that people are awakening to the value of their online data — advertisers can form a new type of relationship with consumers. It can be built upon trust and open exchange of value.</p>
<p>It’s up to advertisers to grasp, accept and reap the benefits of the upcoming changes. Because with iOS 14.5, cookie deprecation, and regulations like GDPR and CCPA, one era is ending and a new one is beginning. There’s a new seat at the table in the great bargaining session between advertisers and technology giants. It’s occupied — for the first time — by the user.</p>
<h2>The short-term strategy</h2>
<p>Advertisers can weather big changes in the short term by implementing several steps.</p>
<p>For starters, developers should update their application SDKs to support Apple’s new<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skadnetwork"> SKAdNetwork solution</a> and then verify attribution across each channel. For example, after SDK updates, verify that the number of installs reported from your Facebook Ads matches up to the number of installs you’re seeing reported in the App Store developer console or your preferred analytics provider.</p>

<hr />
<p>This can become more complicated the more channels you’re on, but it is important to verify all of your advertising channels’ reporting. Also important is setting your<a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/blog/skadnetwork-conversion-value-ios14/"> conversion value</a>, because this is the key to getting granular information on your ad campaigns and ensuring the right entity controls the flow of information.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This is Equity Monday, our morning coffee chat with you that is all about the weekend, what to expect this week, and some funding rounds you may have missed. I&#8217;m subbing in for Alex Wilhelm today, who is deservedly <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1404136515274485761">out on vacation. </a>You can find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">@nmasc_</a>, and Equity on Twitter (turn on those notifications!) <a href="https://twitter.com/EquityPod">@equitypod. </a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Biden and world leaders are congregating at <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/06/14/world/nato-summit">the NATO summit</a>, which kicks off this week. Also, the <a href="https://dublintechsummit.tech/">Dublin Tech Summi</a>t is happening on Thursday with yours truly, other TC folks, and many entrepreneurs making a virtual appearance.</p>
<p>Now, onto the news!</p>

<li> The weekend: The seat next to Jeff Bezos as he launches into space <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-auctions-off-seat-on-first-human-spaceflight-for-28m/">just got filled for $28 million. </a>Also, Elon Musk tweeted about how Tesla might start accepting Bitcoin as a payment once at least half of it can be mined using clean energy. The comment sent Bitcoin up more than a few percentage points, hovering at $39,173 at the time of the recording.</li>
<li>This morning: <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a63d25dd-ac6a-4bc5-9d38-5b42967e93cd">The FT reports that Flagship Pioneering</a>, which is responsible for incubating and launching Moderna, has raised a new venture capital fund at $3.4 billion. Flagship isn&#8217;t your traditional VC. It forms teams around problem areas and brainstorms solutions, incubates the most promising ones, and then eventually spins out and finances those companies.</li>
<li> Funding rounds: Byju&#8217;s got a check from UBS and Zoom founder Eric Yuan, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/ubs-investment-makes-byjus-the-most-valuable-startup-in-india/">making it the most valuable startup in India.</a> The company is now valued at $16.5 billion post-money.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Beleaguered electric vehicle startup Lordstown Motors’ stock shares have taken another hit after the company said Monday that CEO Steve Burns and CFO Julio Rodriguez have resigned, just a few weeks after Burns was reassuring investors of the company&#8217;s bright future.</p>
<p>Lordstown Motors’ Lead Independent Director Angela Strand was appointed executive chairwoman to oversee the transition until a permanent CEO is found. Becky Roof will service as Interim CFO. Roof has acted as interim CFO at a number of other companies, including Saks Fifth Avenue and Eastman Kodak.</p>
<p>The company, which was founded as an offshoot of former CEO Burns’ other company, Workhorse Group, announced less than stellar <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">first quarter results</a> in May, including news that production volumes would likely be half – from around 2,200 vehicles to just 1,000 – should the company not identify more funding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The EV startup is one of a growing suite of companies in the transportation space that have gone public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/03/lordstown-motors-becomes-latest-ev-automaker-to-use-a-spac-to-go-public/">The deal</a>, announced last August, gave Lordstown around $675 million in gross proceeds and a market value of $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>Yet, less than a year after the deal was announced, Lordstown told the <a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/static-files/f0d0d2f4-d298-4576-9344-61f82e345e19">SEC in a filing</a> that it does not have enough capital to manufacture and deliver the electric pickup, dubbed – note the irony – &#8216;Endurance.&#8217; “The Company believes that its current level of cash and cash equivalents are not sufficient to fund commercial scale production and the launch of sale of such vehicles,” the filing said. “These conditions raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.”</p>
<p>While Burns and Rodriguez are the most prominent corporate figures in the shakeup, Lordstown also announced other changes to its executive team Monday. Jane Ritson-Parsons, who was acting as Lordstown Motors interim chief brand officer, was promoted to Chief Operating Officer; and former head of investor relations Carter Driscoll was promoted to Vice President, Corporate Development, Capital Markets and Investor Relations.</p>
<p>Lordstown on Monday also released the results of a report conducted by a special internal committee <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/lordstown-motors-accused-of-faking-ev-truck-orders-by-short-seller-firm-hindenburg-research/">accusations</a> that the company was faking preorders of its debut electric pickup, in a report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research. Lordstowns’ independent inquiry is separate to an ongoing investigation from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over the allegations.</p>
<p>While the report is “is, in significant respects, false and misleading,” the committee said that the investigation did identify some inaccuracies regarding some statements about the pre-orders. In particular, some entities that made a large number of pre-orders made commitments that were not firm enough to be included in the pre-order disclosures. Overall, the special committees’ findings overwhelmingly reject Hindenburgs’ accusations against the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A number of startups (eg, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/18/veriff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/berbix-raises-9m-for-its-identity-verification-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/15/passbase-is-building-a-full-stack-identity-engine-with-privacy-baked-in/">here</a> and <a href="https://identityreview.com/vouched-raises-3-million-aims-to-be-the-stripe-for-id-verification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>) have fashioned themselves as the &#8220;Stripe for identity verification&#8221;, providing an easy way for developers to integrate ID authentication into a platform. Today, Stripe is stepping in to fill that need itself: the company is launching a new product called Stripe Identity &#8212; a self-serve tool that companies can use to verify user identities, with Stripe managing the customer data in an encrypted format, using computer vision and machine learning to &#8220;read&#8221; and match up government IDs with live selfies.</p>
<p>Stripe says the service works in as little as 15 seconds.</p>
<p>The service is launching in beta starting today in 30 countries, the company said, but in the meantime, it&#8217;s already quietly been in use by select partners. They include <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://discord.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623753371046000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEecyu-1jiB48IV2emXu2-MBjUDmQ">Discord</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> (as part of its <a href="https://blog.discord.com/the-future-of-bots-on-discord-4e6e050ab52e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ID verification feature</a>); </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.peerspace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.peerspace.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623753371046000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGcaiCTvF1gfwSeJDASMCUTat2NnQ">Peerspace</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> (which runs ID verification when onboarding users and merchants); </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://goshippo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://goshippo.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623753371046000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHojVeHlgGI9jYomr3bHykCB9QNtA">Shippo</a> (when when it identifies high-risk users, asks them to verify themselves); and other unnamed customers who are using it to prevent account takeovers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Developers can <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/login?redirect=%2Fidentity%2Fapplication" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go here</a> to request access, and it sounds like Stripe will be talking more about the service in general during <a href="https://sessions.stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe Sessions</a>, its developer conference, later this week.</span></p>
<p>“Businesses have been asking us for an easy and fast way to verify identities online. Stripe Identity offers them just that,” said Rob Daly, Head of Engineering for Stripe Identity. “Now, any internet business—from a five-person startup to a multinational enterprise—can begin securely verifying the identities of their users in a matter of minutes, not weeks or months.”</p>
<p>If you look at the list of early users, something significant stands out: Identity is another example of how Stripe is extending its reach as a powerhouse provider of services to businesses that extend well beyond payments.</p>
<p>Of course, payments remains at the heart of Stripe, and identity verification definitely has a connection to that &#8212; it can help with preventing e-commerce fraud, for starters &#8212; but as you can see, ID authentication also covers a number of other use cases, such as in helping prevent account takeovers, or to verify someone&#8217;s age, or to comply with other &#8220;know your customer&#8221; regulations, or to stamp out bots and trolls: no payments necessary. For this reason, Stripe&#8217;s confirmed that you don&#8217;t have to be an existing Stripe customer in order to use Stripe Identity.</p>
<p>Identity verification has become an important and widely-used component of the process of enabling online interactions, whether monetary or otherwise. And it has something in common with payments that makes it a ripe candidate for building as an API-enabled service: both are complex to build, requiring the integration of a number of disparate technologies and third-party data providers. Since building something like that is not likely the core competency of the companies that require ID verification, that leaves the door open for third-party companies to build that tech and provide it as a service.</p>
<p>Stripe is far from being the only one working in this field: others include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/jumio-raises-150m-as-its-all-in-one-id-authentication-platform-crosses-300m-verified-identities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jumio</a> (which raised a big round earlier this year); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/onfidos-husayn-kassai-steps-back-brings-in-new-ceo-ahead-of-a-planned-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Onfido</a> (reportedly planning an IPO); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/18/veriff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Veriff</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/berbix-raises-9m-for-its-identity-verification-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berbix</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/15/passbase-is-building-a-full-stack-identity-engine-with-privacy-baked-in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Passbase</a> and more.</p>
<p>In the case of Stripe, the company is offering customers two ways to use Stripe Identity. Like Stripe&#8217;s payments product, it can be integrated into a checkout or other workflow by way of some lines of code. But it can also be offered as a service outside of that, by way of a verification link issued just around suspicious transactions or other users that are identified as high-risk.</p>
<p>While Stripe has made a number of acquisitions to expand its technology and services &#8212; last week&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/payments-giant-stripe-launches-stripe-tax-to-integrate-sales-tax-calculations-for-30-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch of Stripe Tax</a>, for example, complemented its acquisition of Tax Jar earlier this year &#8212; Stripe Identity was built in-house, the company says, and has been in use for the better part of 10 years by the company to verify merchants as part of its own onboarding and anti-fraud checks.</p>
<p>“We know from experience how much work it takes to build a rigorous and secure system for global identity verification,” said Delia Pawelke, Head of Global Risk Strategy and Onboarding Policy at Stripe, in a statement. “With Stripe Identity, we’re making our advanced compliance infrastructure available to all of our users. For an online business, verifying someone’s identity is now as easy as accepting a payment.” In turning its internal tool into an external product, Stripe tweaked the verification service somewhat, providing more guidance for photo-taking for example.</p>
<p>Stripe said that fees will be charged &#8220;per transaction,&#8221; but didn&#8217;t disclose to TechCrunch what those fees will be. We&#8217;ll update this post as we learn more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In January, former Uber executive<a href="https://twitter.com/limeyerd?lang=en"> Liz Meyerdirk</a> announced that she has taken over as chief executive of <a href="https://thepillclub.com/">The Pill Club.</a> The company, which offers an online birth control prescription and delivery service to hundreds of thousands of women, had hit record revenues, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/as-it-hits-100-million-run-rate-the-pill-club-adds-former-uber-exec-liz-meyerdirk-as-ceo/">crossing $100 million in annual run rate</a> for the first time in its 4-year history.</p>
<p>She found the bridge between ride-sharing to healthcare to be smoother than some might expect, saying that she focused on how to apply technology “to logistics for an everyday use case, [to know] how that simplifies your everyday life.”</p>
<p>Now, six months into her new job, Meyerdirk announced that her company has raised more capital to capitalize off of the momentum in women’s health right now. The Pill Club announced today that it has raised a $41.9 million Series B extension round led by Base 10. Existing investors including ACME, Base10, GV, Shasta Ventures and VMG participated in the round, as well as new investors including Uber’s Dara Khosrowshahi and Honey’s George Ruan and iGlobe.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The extension round comes over 2 years after the company announced its initial Series B investment, a $51 million financing led by VMG Partners. After reportedly being valued at $250 million, the company declined to provide its latest valuation, other than saying that the extension was an up-round.</p>
<p>When a customer joins The Pill Club, they are given a medical questionnaire and a digital form to input personal information. The company gives them a sense of how much the service will cost, and if the price works, it connects them to a nurse either live or via text.</p>
<p>“In a happy case, you can see a nurse immediately, “ she said. “Obviously if it&#8217;s midnight, we haven&#8217;t figured that out yet.” The nurse walks though different options, since, Meyerdirk added, “contraception is not one size fits all.”</p>
<p>Once a customer makes a decision, The Pill Club can then prescribe birth control through their own pharmacy, which will be delivered to their door within two or three days.</p>
<p>The Pill Club launched in 2016 with an at-home delivery service of birth control. Between 2016 and January 2021, it launched in 43 states plus the District of Columbia. It has added 5 new states in the past six months, and plans to get to 50 states by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>The company makes money from a medical visits, insurance reimbursement for prescription drugs, and cash patients who aren&#8217;t covered by insurance.</p>
<p>The chief executive views a big part of its value proposition as embedding with existing insurance plans of its customers, including Medi-CAL and Family PACT. In the last three months, 16% of The Pill Clubs’ new patients were on Medicaid.</p>
<p>“You’ve got companies like Oscar [Health] that are reimagining health insurance, and you’ve got Ro, Hims and Hers, who are [taking] cash as a primary&#8230;way to serve..patients,” she said. “That’s fantastic for those who can afford it, but for us, because so much of our value system is around access to equity, we believe everyone should have the right to get access to birth control.”</p>
<p>The company believes that it has to work within the system of insurance to have true innovation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Telemedicine that ignores the reality of insurance is always going to have a limited piece of the pie,&#8221; a spokesperson from the company said said. &#8220;Cash-only systems simply aren’t a product built for a scale. A truly innovative healthcare platform exists within the realities of the system.&#8221;</p>

<h2>By women, for women</h2>
<p>Long-term, the Pill Club wants to replace the old model of going to a primary care provider for annual visits with ongoing care for women.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m generally healthy [but] I actually do have questions on mammograms&#8230;colonoscopies, or anything,” Meyerdirk said. “And being able to have a person other than my mom” to talk to that doesn’t require a trip to the doctor or urgent care, is the gap that The Pill Club wants to fill.</p>
<p>“We think it&#8217;s too good to be true, when we actually get what we deserve,” Meyerdirk said when describing women’s health. Part of her goal going forward is to think bigger, beyond contraception, and figure out how The Pill Club could bring a digital refresh to other areas of women’s health.</p>
<p>In March, the company launched a dermatology pilot, and also expanded its 2020 period care pilot. A portion of the new capital is earmarked toward launching new services for its members.</p>

<p>The Pill Club also shared the diversity metrics of its 350-person staff as part of its announcement.</p>
<p>The Pill Club has 72% of employees identifying as women, and 28% of employees identifying as male. The executive leadership similarly sees predominantly women, with the ratio being 62.5% women and 37.5% male. As for racial diversity, the overall company identifies as 33% white, 19% Asian, 16% Hispanic or Latino and 14% Black or African American, with 13% of employees declined to identify.</p>
<p>“We’re by women for women,” Meyerdirk said. “It’s very, very different when you’re by men, for women.” Her appointment came as The Pill Club’s founder and former chief executive officer Nick Chang, stepped down from day to day operations. He didn’t take a board seat, but does still have shares in the company.</p>

<p>The wave of prescription, for-delivery medication is only getting bigger, with The Pill Club joined by startups such as Nurx and Simply Health, and bigger corporations such as<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/rx-walmart-plus-161333005.html"> Walmart </a>and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/amazon-pharmacy-free-prescription-delivery-for-prime-members.html">Amazon.</a></p>
<p>“The idea of creating more choice and flexibility across healthcare is long overdue,” she said. “Everyone deserves to have great options when they consider who can best address their daily needs.”</p>
<p><em>Editor&#8217;s note: A prior version of this story noted that The Pill Club does birth control for pick up. This is incorrect. It delivers birth control through its own pharmacies. A correction has been made to reflect this change.  </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.dataiku.com">Dataiku</a> is going downstream with a new product today called Dataiku Online. As the name suggests, Dataiku Online is a fully managed version of Dataiku. It lets you take advantage of the data science platform without going through a complicated setup process that involves a system administrator and your own infrastructure.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Dataiku, the platform lets you turn raw data into advanced analytics, run some data visualization tasks, create data-backed dashboards and train machine learning models. In particular, Dataiku can be used by data scientists, but also business analysts and less technical people.</p>
<p>The company has been mostly focused on big enterprise clients. Right now, Dataiku has more than 400 customers, such as Unilever, Schlumberger, GE, BNP Paribas, Cisco, Merck and NXP Semiconductors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are two ways to use Dataiku. You can install the software solution on your own, own-premise servers. You can also run it on a cloud instance. With Dataiku Online, the startup offers a third option and takes care of setup and infrastructure for you.</p>
<p>“Customers using Dataiku Online get all the same features that our on-premises and cloud instances provide, so everything from data preparation and visualization to advanced data analytics and machine learning capabilities,” co-founder and CEO Florian Douetteau said. “We’re really focused on getting startups and SMBs on the platform — there’s a perception that small or early-stage companies don’t have the resources or technical expertise to get value from AI projects, but that’s simply not true. Even small teams that lack data scientists or specialty ML engineers can use our platform to do a lot of the technical heavy lifting, so they can focus on actually operationalizing AI in their business.”</p>
<p>Customers using Dataiku Online can take advantage of Dataiku’s pre-built connectors. For instance, you can connect your Dataiku instance with a cloud data warehouse, such as Snowflake Data Cloud, Amazon Redshift and Google BigQuery. You can also connect to a SQL database (MySQL, PostgreSQL…), or you can just run it on CSV files stored on Amazon S3.</p>
<p>And if you’re just getting started and you have to work on data ingestion, Dataiku works well with popular data ingestion services. “A typical stack for our Dataiku Online Customers involves leveraging data ingestion tools like FiveTran, Stitch or Alooma, that sync to a cloud data warehouse like Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift or Snowflake. Dataiku fits nicely within their modern data stacks,” Douetteau said.</p>
<p>Dataiku Online is a nice offering to get started with Dataiku. High-growth startups might start with Dataiku Online as they tend to be short on staff and want to be up and running as quickly as possible. But as you become bigger, you could imagine switching to a cloud or on-premise installation of Dataiku. Employees can keep using the same platform as the company scales.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s easier than ever to build a product and sell it around the United States, or the world. But if you want to do so without incurring the wrath of any particular state, or nation-state, you&#8217;d best have your tax matters in order. This is why <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/payments-giant-stripe-launches-stripe-tax-to-integrate-sales-tax-calculations-for-30-countries/">Stripe&#8217;s news last week</a> that it has built tax-focused tooling to help its customers manage their state bills mattered.</p>
<p>But for SaaS companies, things can be more complicated from a tax perspective. That&#8217;s what <a href="https://anrok.com/">Anrok</a>, a startup working to build sales tax software for SaaS firms, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michellevalentinehk/">Michelle Valentine</a>, said that modern software companies need specialized help. And her startup is announcing a $4.3 million fundraise today to back its efforts. The capital event was led by Seqouia and Index, the latter firm a place where Valentine used to work.</p>
<p>Anrok delivers its service via an API, and charges based on the total dollar value of sales that it helps a customer manage. Its percentage-fee falls with volume, and you can&#8217;t pay more than 0.19% of managed revenue, so it&#8217;s pretty cheap regardless, given how strong software gross margins tend to be.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165238" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165238" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2165238 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/founding-team-anrok.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/founding-team-anrok.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/founding-team-anrok.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/founding-team-anrok.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/founding-team-anrok.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/founding-team-anrok.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/founding-team-anrok.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165238" class="wp-caption-text">The Anrok founding team: Michelle Valentine, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kannan-goundan-25789a/">Kannan Goundan</a>. Via the company.</p></div></p>
<p>Valentine said that there are three things that make SaaS tax issues more complex than other products. The first deals with addresses. Software companies have to pay sales tax where customers are located, and often only have partial information. Anrok will help with that problem. The CEO also said that variable SaaS billing makes charging the right amount of tax an interesting issue, and that states have tax laws specifically aimed at the software market that must be navigated.</p>
<p>So, a more mass-market solution might not be the best fit for SaaS companies looking to avoid both trouble with states and the work of handling tax matters themselves.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not hard to see why Anrok was able to raise capital. The company is early-stage with its first customers onboarded, so it&#8217;s not posting the sort of revenue growth that investors covet at the later stages. What then were its more fetching attributes? From our perspective, on-demand pricing and a simply gigantic market.</p>
<p>Sure, Anrok is serving SaaS businesses, but it&#8217;s doing so using what could be described as a post-SaaS business model; on-demand, or usage-based pricing is an increasingly popular way to charge for software products today, putting Anrok closer to the cutting edge in business-model terms. And the company&#8217;s market is essentially every software business out there. That&#8217;s a lot of TAM to carve into, something that investors love to see.</p>

<p>On an upcoming episode of Extra Crunch Live, we&#8217;ll sit down with MaC Venture Capital founding managing partner Marlon Nichols and Wonderschool co-founder and CEO Chris Bennett. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-mac-venture-capital-and-wonderschool?ref=cc6fdfd74b4f">REGISTER HERE FOR FREE!</a></p>
<p>Not only will we discuss how they came together for Wonderschool&#8217;s seed round in 2017, but how that translated into what has become a total of $24 million in funding from VCs like a16z and First Round Capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;ll also host the Extra Crunch Live Pitch-off, where folks in the audience can pitch their startup to Nichols and Bennett to get their live feedback.</p>
<p>Nichols is a former Kauffman Fellow and Investment Director at Intel Capital. His portfolio includes Gimlet Media, MongoDB, Thrive Market, PlayVS, Fair, LISNR, Mayvenn, Blavity and Wonderschool. Nichols knows more than most of us will ever learn about seed-stage fundraising, and even gave a chat at TechCrunch Early Stage in April that outlines four strategies for securing seed funding.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll get even deeper on that subject with Nichols, and hear the perspective from the other side of the table with Bennett.</p>
<p>Wonderschool is a network of early childhood programs that combine the quality of top-notch early education with an in-home setting.</p>
<p>Bennett can talk extensively on edtech as a sector, and we&#8217;ll pick both his and Nichols&#8217; mind on that fast-growing space.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget that this episode will feature an Extra Crunch Live Pitch-off, so founders in the audience should be ready to &#8220;raise their hand&#8221; and get in the mix.</p>
<p>The episode goes down on Wednesday, June 16 at 3 p.m. ET/noon PT.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Because of the pandemic, we’re all a lot more familiar with remote working than we used to be, whether we like it or not. But the remote tools of the pre-pandemic era &#8211; Slack, Trello, Zoom, Asana, etc, etc, etc &#8211; are, if we admit it to ourselves, barely scratching the surface of what we really need to be productive. Luckily a new era of remote-working tools is fast emerging. <a href="https://twitter.com/mikebutcher/status/1397522865050824707">As I recently tweeted</a>, we need to think far more in asynchronous terms if remote working is to be productive (and healthy!), long term.</p>
<p>Older tools can offer asynchronous collaboration, but a new wave of tools is coming. Loom, for instance, is one-way video for ’show and tell’. It’s raised $203.6M &#8211; however, it has a drawback: it doesn’t have many collaboration features.</p>
<p>Now a new European startup hopes to address this.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.claap.io/">Claap</a>, an asynchronous meeting platform with video and collaboration, thinks it might have part of the solution and a private beta launch is planned for this month.</p>
<p>It’s now raised $3 million in pre-seed funding from LocalGlobe, Headline, E.Ventures, Kima Ventures and angels including Front co-founder Mathilde Collin, Oyster co-founder Tony Jamous, Nest and GoCardless founder Matt Robinson and Automattic’s head of product Aadil Mamujee. It also includes a group of 30 angels such as Ian Hogarth (Songkick), Olivier Godement (Stripe), Roxanne Varza (Station F), Chris Herd (FirstBase), and Xavier Niel (Kima), Shane Mac (investor in Remote).</p>
<p>We all now know that what were previously small catch-ups are now 30-minute Zoom calls, which are pointless. &#8216;Asynchronous meetings’ could be the way forward.</p>
<p>Claap says its product allows employees to record a short video update on a topic, allow others to comment on the relevant part, and set a due date for team members to respond. Colleagues then view the video and respond in their own time. Claap bulls itself as the remote working equivalent of the &#8216;quick hallway catch-up’. It integrates with other workplace tools such as Trello or Jira so that when a decision is made on a project, it’s recorded for everyone on the team to see and refer back to. A subscription model is planned which will have a sliding scale depending on team size.</p>
<p>Because it doesn’t require real-time interaction, you don’t need t find a time that suits everyone for a meeting, so in fact the ‘meeting’ sort of disappears. . Instead, the platform creates a space for feedback and iterations.</p>
<p>Founders Robin Bonduelle and Pierre Touzeau looked at solutions already adopted by companies such as Automattic, and GitLab. Touzeau was previously at 360Learning which employed a strict limiting policy for meetings. Bonduelle has 10 years of product management experience, working at various startups and scaleups including Ogury where he was VP of Product, and Rocket Internet. He developed asynchronous communication habits while managing 50 people across 4 different countries and time zones. Touzeau has worked for businesses including L’Oreal and 360Learning, where he was most recently VP of Marketing.</p>
<p>However, asynchronous communication is not always perfect. As we know, Emails and Slack messages can go unread. Video MIGHT be the solution.</p>
<p>Robin Bonduelle, co-founder and CEO at Claap, said: “After a year of working remotely, people are realizing the benefits of not working in an office but at the same time grappling with one of its worst consequences: back-to-back video meetings. A query that in the office would take five minutes to solve now takes at least 30, leaving everyone more exhausted in the process. Claap is designed to solve this issue, allowing colleagues the tools to keep them engaged and connected but without taking up all their time. It’s a new meeting format that allows people to make quick decisions.”</p>
<p>Touzeau said: “Meetings are a necessary part of working, but it doesn’t need to be your entire day. Asynchronous meetings are the key to freeing up our calendars but making sure work still gets done and deadlines are met. We’re excited by the potential Claap has to empower people to work from anywhere.”</p>
<p>George Henry, General Partner at LocalGlobe, said: “We were impressed with Robin and Pierre’s vision and the potential for Claap to allow employees to connect on a project when they need to and facilitate the ability to work from anywhere.”</p>
<p>Jonathan Userovici, Partner at Headline, said: “Zoom may have been the go-to enterprise app over the past 12 months but for the thousands of businesses that are now going to be remote-first, video conferencing alone won’t be enough to keep teams connected and get work done. Claap is the challenger tool to end video-calling fatigue.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European privacy group <a href="https://noyb.eu/en">noyb</a>, which recently kicked off a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/europes-cookie-consent-reckoning-is-coming/">major campaign</a> targeting rampant abuse of the region&#8217;s cookie consent rules, has followed up by publishing a technical proposal for an automated browser-level signal it believes could go even further to tackle the friction generated by endless &#8216;your data choices&#8217; pop-ups.</p>
<p>Its proposal is for an automated signal layer that would enable users to configure advanced consent choices &#8212; such as only being asked to allow cookies if they frequently visit a website; or being able to whitelist lists of sites for consent (if, for example, they want to support quality journalism by allowing their data to be used for ads in those specific cases).</p>
<p>The approach would offer a route to circumvent the user experience nightmare flowing from all the dark pattern design that&#8217;s made cookie consent collection so cynical, confusing and tedious &#8212; by simply automating the yeses and noes, thereby keeping interruptions to a user-defined minimum.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the European Union cookie consent banners mushroomed in the wake of a 2018 update to the bloc&#8217;s privacy rules (GDPR) &#8212; especially on websites that rely on targeted advertising to generate revenue. And in recent years it has not been unusual to find cookie pop-ups that contain a labyrinthine hell of opacity &#8212; culminating (if you don&#8217;t just click &#8216;agree&#8217;) &#8212; to vast menus of &#8216;trusted partners&#8217; all after your data. Some of which are pre-set to share information and require the user to individually toggle each and every one off.</p>
<p>Such stuff is a mockery of compliance, rather than the truly simple choice envisage by the law. So noyb&#8217;s earlier campaign is focused on filing scores of complaints against sites it believes aren&#8217;t complying with requirements to provide users with a clear and free choice to say no to their data being used for ads (and it&#8217;s applying a little automation tech there too to help scale up the number of complaint it can file).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Europe&#8217;s cookie consent reckoning is coming&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/30/europes-cookie-consent-reckoning-is-coming/embed/#?secret=Tjr2biXXZu" data-secret="Tjr2biXXZu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Its <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">follow-up here &#8212; showing how an advanced control layer that signals user choices in the background could work &#8212; shares the same basic approach as the &#8216;Do Not Track&#8217; proposals originally proposed for baking into web browsers all the way back in 2009 but which failed to get industry buy-in. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">There has also been a </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/tech-publisher-coalition-backs-new-push-for-browser-level-privacy-controls/">more recent US-based push</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to revive the idea of browser-level privacy control &#8212; buoyed by California&#8217;s California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/01/the-california-consumer-privacy-act-officially-takes-effect-today/">took effect at the start of last year</a>, and includes a requirement that businesses respect user opt-out preferences via a signal from their browser.</span></p>
<p>However noyb&#8217;s version of browser-level privacy control seeks to go further by enabling more granular controls &#8212; which it says it necessary to better mesh with the EU&#8217;s nuanced legal framework around data protection.</p>
<p>It points out that Article 21(5) of the GDPR already allows for automatic signals from the browser to inform websites in the background whether a user is consenting to data processing or not.</p>
<p>The ePrivacy Regulation proposal, a much delayed reform of the bloc&#8217;s rules around electronic privacy has also included such a provision.</p>
<p>However noyb says development to establish such a signal hasn&#8217;t happened yet &#8212; suggesting that cynically manipulative consent management platforms may well have been hampering privacy-focused innovation.</p>
<p>But it also sees a chance for the necessary momentum to build behind the idea.</p>
<p>For example, it points to how Apple has recently been dialling up the notification and control it offers users of its mobile platform, iOS, to allow people to both know which third party apps want to track them and allow or deny access to their data &#8212; including giving users a super simple &#8216;deny all third party tracking&#8217; option backed into iOS&#8217; settings.</p>
<p>So, well, why should Internet users who happen to be browsing on a desktop device not have a set of similarly advanced privacy controls too?</p>
<p>EU lawmakers are also still debating the ePrivacy Regulation reform &#8212; which deals centrally with cookies &#8212; so the campaign group wants to demonstrate how automated control tech could be a key piece of the answer to so-called &#8216;cookie consent fatigue&#8217;; by giving users a modern toolset to shrink consent friction without compromising their ability to control what happens with their data.</p>
<p>In order to work as intended automated signals would need to be legally binding (to prevent adtech companies just ignoring them) &#8212; and having a clear legal basis set out in the ePrivacy Regulation is one way that could happen within fairly short order.</p>
<p>The chance at least is there.</p>
<p>There have been concerns that the ePrivacy reform &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/07/eprivacy-an-overview-of-europes-other-big-privacy-rule-change/">which was stalled for years</a> &#8212; could end up weakening the EU&#8217;s data protection framework in the face of massive adtech industry lobbying. And the negotiation process to reach a final text remains ongoing. So it&#8217;s still not clear where it&#8217;s going to end up.</p>
<p>But, earlier this year, the European Council agreed its negotiating mandate with the other EU institutions. And, on cookies, the Council said they want companies to find ways to reduce &#8216;cookie consent fatigue&#8217; among users &#8212; such as by whitelisting types of cookies/providers in their browser settings. So there is at least a potential path to legislate for an effective browser-level control layer in Europe.</p>
<p>For now, noyb has published a <a href="https://www.dataprotectioncontrol.org/prototype/">prototype</a> and a <a href="https://www.dataprotectioncontrol.org/spec/">technology specification</a> for what it&#8217;s calling the ADPC (aka Advanced Data Protection Control). The work on the framework has been carried out by noyb working with the <a class="m_-7022938034534963183link1" href="https://www.sustainablecomputing.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.sustainablecomputing.eu/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623744088053000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHY0nQPcZciPAGpedDOGbfxVowHYg">Sustainable Computing Lab</a> at the Vienna University of Economics and Business.</p>
<p>The proposal envisages web pages sending privacy requests in a machine-readable way and the ADPC allowing the response to be transmitted using header signals or via Java Script. noyb likens the intelligent management of queries and automatic responses such a system could support to an email spam filter.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, chairman Max Schrems said: &#8220;For Europe, we need more than just an &#8216;opt-out&#8217; so that it fits into our legal framework. That&#8217;s why we call the prototype &#8216;Advanced&#8217; Data Protection Control, because it&#8217;s much more flexible and specific than previous approaches.</p>
<p>&#8220;ADPC allows intelligent management of privacy requests. A user could say, for example, &#8216;please ask me only after I&#8217;ve been to the site several times&#8217; or &#8216;ask me again after 3 months.&#8217; It is also possible to answer similar requests centrally. ADPC thus allows the flood of data requests to be managed in a meaningful way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With ADPC, we also want to show the European legislator that such a signal is feasible and brings advantages for all sides,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We hope that the negotiators of the member states and the European Parliament will ensure a solid legal basis here, which could be applicable law in a short time. What California has done already, the EU should be able to do as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Commission has been contacted for comment on noyb&#8217;s ADPC.</p>
<p>While there are wider industry shifts afoot to depreciate tracking cookies altogether &#8212; with Google proposing to replace current adtech infrastructure supported by Chrome with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">an alternative stack</a> of (it claims) more privacy respecting alternatives (aka its Privacy Sandbox) &#8212; there&#8217;s still plenty of uncertainty over what will ultimately happen to third party cookies.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s move to end support for tracking cookies is being closely scrutinized by regional antitrust regulators. And just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">last week</a> the UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which is investigating a number of complaints about the plan, said it&#8217;s minded to accept concessions from Google that would mean the regulator could order it not to switch off tracking cookies.</p>
<p>Moreover, even if tracking cookies do finally crumble there is still the question of what exactly they get replaced with &#8212; and how alternative adtech infrastructure could impact user privacy?</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s so-called &#8216;Privacy Sandbox&#8217; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/google-isnt-testing-flocs-in-europe-yet/">proposal to target ads at cohorts of users</a> (based on bucketed &#8216;interests&#8217; its technology will assign them via on-device analysis of their browsing habits) has raised fresh concerns about the risks of exploitative and predatory advertising. So it may be no less important for users to have meaningful browser-level controls over their privacy choices in the future &#8212; even if the tracking cookie itself goes away.</p>
<p>A browser-level signal could offer a way for a web user to say &#8216;no&#8217; to being stuck in an &#8216;interest bucket&#8217; for ad targeting purposes, for example &#8212; signalling that they prefer to see only contextual ads instead, say.</p>
<p>tl;dr: The issue of consent does not only affect cookies &#8212; and it&#8217;s telling that Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/google-isnt-testing-flocs-in-europe-yet/">has avoided</a> running the first trials of its replacement tech for tracking cookies (FLoCs, or federated learning of cohorts) in Europe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Niantic has encouraged the world to roam the streets as Pokémon trainers and wizards&#8230; next up? Time to transform and roll out.</p>
<p>80&#8217;s mega toy Transformers is the latest IP to partner with Niantic to build a map-heavy, geolocation-centric game.</p>
<p>Details are still a bit light, but here&#8217;s just about everything we know:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;ll be called <em>Transformers: Heavy Metal. </em>They&#8217;ve put up a pre-registration <a href="https://www.transformersheavymetal.com">page here</a>.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s being built in collaboration with Hasbro, TOMY, and Seattle game team Very Very Spaceship.</li>
<li>Players will be a part of the &#8220;Guardian Network,&#8221; according to the announcement, &#8220;a group of humans who have banded together with the Autobots in a war against the Decepticons.&#8221;</li>
<li>It&#8217;s built on Niantic&#8217;s Lightship platform, the same underlying engine that powers Pokémon GO, Harry Potter Wizards Unite, and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/is-this-niantics-next-game/">still in-development Catan: World Explorers</a>.</li>
<li>When&#8217;s it arriving? Nothing too specific yet, but it&#8217;ll launch in &#8220;select markets&#8221; soon, and then globally &#8220;later this year&#8221;. This staged rollout tends to be Niantic&#8217;s approach; Pokémon GO landed first in Japan, while Catan was quietly rolled out in New Zealand last year.</li>
</ul>
<p>They&#8217;ve only released a bit of concept art so far, and it suggests gameplay not unlike GO and Wizards Unite. That battle screen on the right definitely looks a whole lot like a Pokémon GO battle:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165547" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165547" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2165547" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Transformers-art-NIANTIC.png" alt="" width="1000" height="785" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Transformers-art-NIANTIC.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Transformers-art-NIANTIC.png?resize=150,118 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Transformers-art-NIANTIC.png?resize=300,236 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Transformers-art-NIANTIC.png?resize=768,603 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Transformers-art-NIANTIC.png?resize=680,534 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Transformers-art-NIANTIC.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165547" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Niantic</p></div></p>
<p>Will this one take over the world the way Pokémon GO did in the summer of 2016? Maybe not — that one hit a lot of the right notes at the right time, the perfect blend of novelty and nostalgia. But Wizards Unite has found enough of an audience that it&#8217;s still in active development two years after launch, so it seems Niantic sees room for more map-centric games. A rep for Niantic mentioned this being one of <em>ten </em>real-world titles that the company currently has in development, suggesting that they see <em>lots</em> of room there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today announced that it is making Workspace, the service formerly known as G Suite (and with a number of new capabilities), available to everyone, including consumers on free Google accounts. The core philosophy behind Workspace is to enable deeper collaboration between users. You can think of it as the same Google productivity apps you&#8217;re already familiar with (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Meet, Chat, etc.), but with a new wrapper around it and deeper integrations between the different apps.</p>
<p>For individual users who want more from their Workspace, there will also be a new paid offering, though Google isn&#8217;t saying how much you&#8217;ll have to pay yet. With that, users will get access to &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">premium capabilities, including smart booking services, professional video meetings and personalized email marketing, with much more on the way.&#8221; We&#8217;ll likely hear more about this later this year. This new paid offering will be available &#8220;soon&#8221; in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Australia, Brazil and Japan.</span></p>
<p>Consumers will have to switch from the classic Hangouts experience (RIP) <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/9341104">to the new Google Chat</a> to enable it &#8212; and with this update, all users will now have access to the new Google Chat, too. Until now, only paying G Suite/Workspace users had access to this new Workspace user experience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Collaboration doesn’t stop at the workplace &#8212; our products have been optimized for broad participation, sharing and helpfulness since the beginning,&#8221; said Javier Soltero, VP and GM, Google Workspace. &#8220;Our focus is on delivering consumers, workers, teachers and students alike an equitable approach to collaboration, while still providing flexibility that allows these different subsets of users to take their own approach to communication and collaboration.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once enabled, users will encounter quite a few user interface changes. The left rail, for example, will look a little bit like the bottom bar of Gmail on iOS and Android now, with the ability to switch between Mail, Chat, Meet and Spaces (which &#8212; yeah &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure anybody really understands this one, but more about this later). The right rail will continue to bring up various plugins and shortcuts to features like Google Calendar, Tasks and Keep.</p>
<p>A lot of people &#8212; especially those who simply want Gmail to be Gmail and don&#8217;t care about all of this collaboration stuff in their private lives &#8212; will hate this. But at least for the time being, you can still keep the old experience by not switching from Hangouts to the new Google Chat. But for Google, this clearly shows the path Workspace is on.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2164624" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Spaces_Vignette_1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164624" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2164624" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Spaces_Vignette_1.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="640" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2164624" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;Back in October of last year, we announced some very significant updates to our communication and collaboration product line and our business, starting with the new brand and identity that we chose around Google Workspace that&#8217;s meant to represent what we believe is the future direction and real opportunity around our product &#8212; less around being a suite of individual products and more around being an integrated set of experiences that represent the future of work,&#8221; Soltero explained in a press briefing ahead of today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>And then there is &#8220;Spaces.&#8221; Until now, Google Workspace features a tool called &#8220;Rooms.&#8221; Rooms are now Spaces. I&#8217;m not quite sure why, but Google says it is &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">evolving the Rooms experience in Google Chat into a dedicated place for organizing people, topics, and projects in Google Workspace.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best I can tell, these are Slack-like channels where teams can not just have conversations around a given topic but also organize relevant files and upcoming tasks, all with an integrated Google Meet experience and direct access to working on their files. That&#8217;s all good and well, but I&#8217;m not sure why Google felt the need to change the name. Maybe it just doesn&#8217;t want you to confuse Slack rooms with Google rooms. And it&#8217;s called Google Workspace, after all, not Workroom. </span></p>
<p>New features for Rooms/Spaces include <span style="font-weight: 400;">in-line topic threading, presence indicators, custom statuses, expressive reactions and a collapsible view, Google says.</span></p>
<p>Both free and paid users will get access to these new Spaces once they launch later this year.</p>
<p>But wait, there&#8217;s more. A lot more. Google is also introducing a number of new Workspace features today. Google Meet, for example, is getting a companion mode that is meant to foster &#8220;collaboration equity in a hybrid world.&#8221; The idea here is to give meeting participants who are in a physical meeting room and are interacting with remote participants a companion experience to use features like <span style="font-weight: 400;">screen sharing, polls, in-meeting chat, hand raise and Q&amp;A live captions on their personal devices. Every participant using the companion mode will also get their own video tile. This feature will be available in September.</span></p>

<p>Also new is an RSVP option that will allow you to select whether you will participate remotely, in a meeting room (or not at all), as well as new moderation controls to allow hosts to prevent the use of in-meeting chat and to mute and unmute individual participants.</p>
<p>On the security side, Google today also announced that it will allow users to bring their own encryption keys. Currently, Google encrypts your data, but it does manage the key for you. To strengthen your security, you may want to bring your own keys to the service, so Google has now partnered with providers like <a href="https://flowcrypt.com/blog/article/2021-06-14-google-workspace-encryption/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flowcrypt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.futurex.com/news/futurex-partners-with-google-workspace"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Futurex</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Thales and </span><a href="https://www.virtru.com/google-drive-encryption/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtru</span></a> to enable this.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">With Client-side encryption, customer data is indecipherable to Google, while users can continue to take advantage of Google’s native web-based collaboration, access content on mobile devices, and share encrypted files externally,&#8221; writes Google directors of product management Karthik Lakshminarayanan and Erika Trautman in today&#8217;s announcement.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2164692" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/TwgMh_-POKMly8B2mr476SiaCMDXHsEaCkxibxc7bYtBE5BmSnL-6-I6ECcFBUVPHAi9e_gdb-iBbkFvEcqCzRwUDhbDJo-vT0W0hVzdT5oyi8qg2FW8ZeTs5h3srS6vKEVTCUgbGg.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164692" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2164692" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/TwgMh_-POKMly8B2mr476SiaCMDXHsEaCkxibxc7bYtBE5BmSnL-6-I6ECcFBUVPHAi9e_gdb-iBbkFvEcqCzRwUDhbDJo-vT0W0hVzdT5oyi8qg2FW8ZeTs5h3srS6vKEVTCUgbGg.gif" alt="" width="800" height="480" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2164692" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Google is also introducing trust rules for Drive to give admins control over how files can be shared within an organization and externally. And to protect from real phishing threats (not those fake ones your internal security organization sends out every few weeks or so), Google is also now allowing admins to enable the same phishing protections it already offers today to content within an organization to help guard your data against insider threats.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As ubiquitous as Google Docs has become in the last year alone, a major criticism often overlooked by the countless workplaces who use it is that it isn&#8217;t end-to-end encrypted, allowing Google — or any requesting government agency — access to a company&#8217;s files. But Google is finally addressing that key complaint with a round of updates that will let customers shield their data by storing their own encryption keys.</p>
<p>Google Workspace, the company&#8217;s enterprise offering that includes Google Docs, Slides and Sheets, is adding client-side encryption so that a company&#8217;s data will be indecipherable to Google.</p>
<p>Companies using Google Workspace can store their encryption keys with one of four partners for now: Flowcrypt, Futurex, Thales, or Virtru, which are compatible with Google&#8217;s specifications. The move is largely aimed at regulated industries — like finance, healthcare, and defense — where intellectual property and sensitive data are subject to intense privacy and compliance rules.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2165470" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2165470" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2165470 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/google-docs.gif" alt="" width="800" height="480" /><p id="caption-attachment-2165470" class="wp-caption-text">(Image: Google / supplied)</p></div></p>
<p>The real magic lands later in the year when Google will publish details of an API that will let enterprise customers build their own in-house key service, allowing workplaces to retain direct control of their encryption keys. That means if the government wants that company&#8217;s data, they have to knock on their front door — and not sneak around the back by serving the key holder with a legal demand.</p>
<p>Google <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/google-workspace-encryption-wp.pdf">published technical details</a> of how the client-side encryption feature works, and will roll out as a beta in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Tech companies giving their corporate customers control of their own encryption keys has been a growing trend in recent years. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/18/slack-hands-over-encryption-keys-to-regulated-customers/">Slack</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/01/new-egnyte-product-puts-customers-in-control-of-encryption-keys/">cloud vendor Egnyte</a> bucked the trend by allowing their enterprise users to store their own encryption keys, effectively cutting themselves out of the surveillance loop. But Google has dragged its feet on encryption for so long that startups are working to build <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/blog/the-enterprise-cloud/easy-to-use-encryption-add-on-secures-your-google-docs/">alternatives that bake in encryption</a> from the ground up.</p>
<p>Google said it&#8217;s also pushing out new trust rules for how files are shared in Google Drive to give administrators more granularity on how different levels of sensitive files can be shared, and new data classification labels to mark documents with a level of sensitivity such as &#8220;secret&#8221; or &#8220;internal&#8221;.</p>
<p>The company said it&#8217;s improving its malware protection efforts by now blocking phishing and malware shared from within organizations. The aim is to help cut down on employees mistakenly sharing malicious documents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://motorway.co.uk/">Motorway</a>, is a UK startup that allows professional car dealers to bid in an auction for privately-owned cars for sale. The startup has had rapid success by removing a lot of friction in the process. It’s now raised £48m / $67.7m in a Series B round led by Index Ventures, along with new investors BMW i Ventures and Unbound. Existing investors Latitude and Marchmont Ventures also participated. The funding will be used to extend its platform and grow the current 160-strong team.</p>
<p>The startup claims it allows consumers to sell their car for up to £1,000 more than they would do via other means, by uploading its details via a smartphone app that also uses computer vision to assess the state of the car. Over 3,000 professional car dealers then bid for the vehicle in a daily online auction. The highest offer wins the car, which is then collected for free by the winning dealer inside 24 hours. </p>
<p>Motorway says it has sold 65,000 cars since its launch in 2017 and seen sales hit £50m in May 2021 alone, £2.5m of transactions a day, and more than 4,000 completed car sales a month. With only 5% of all vehicles in the UK sold online right now, there is plenty of headroom for this market to grow.<br />
 <br />
Tom Leathes, CEO of Motorway, said: “For half a century, inefficient offline processes have led to bad deals and a bad experience for both car sellers and car dealers. Motorway has fundamentally changed a broken experience where everyone ends up dissatisfied – and we’ve transformed it with a superior online experience where everybody wins. Cutting out the middlemen leaves both the consumer and car dealer with a better deal, all from home and without the stress. Our incredible growth so far is testament to our focus on delivering more value through technology – and this investment will provide us with the fuel to take Motorway to the next level.&#8221;<br />
 <br />
Danny Rimer, Partner at Index Ventures, said: “We’re always looking to invest in companies that are truly disrupting an industry and meeting a real customer need. We have found that in Motorway. The team has built an incredibly powerful platform, underpinned by great technology and a deep understanding of the challenges both consumers and car dealers face. Motorway has quickly become the first port of call for tens of thousands of people selling their car.” <br />
 <br />
Motorway previously raised £14m in venture funding since it was founded by Tom Leathes, Harry Jones and Alex Buttle in 2017.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking to me over interview Leathes added: “COVID has been a real accelerator of something that was already happening. The car industry is moving online and that&#8217;s partly about people buying their next car online, but it&#8217;s also about dealers changing their behavior, how they do business, where they buy their cars. It forced that change which they resisted for a long time, and now they&#8217;re embracing it, so it&#8217;s a fundamental shift in the industry. And this is why we see such a massive opportunity to provide the rails to help both sides of the marketplace to move online.”</p>
<p>Rimer added: “It&#8217;s rare that you have founders who have worked together across multiple successful and less successful startups who have that scar tissue and success, and are now going for a much bigger opportunity. The business model is really an important one for us because instead of owning inventory and then having to get rid of your inventory, sort of like the difference between Net-a-Porter and Farfetch. Motorway&#8217;s marketplace is just like Farfetch &#8211; they don&#8217;t have any inventory, which means that just by merely making that platform happen for buyers and sellers, they win. So there&#8217;s a lot less risk associated with what the money is going to be used for when building the business.”</p>
