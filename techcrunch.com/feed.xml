</div><p id="speakable-summary">Driver monitoring systems (DMS) are fast becoming the leading automotive safety system in the world. In the United States, rapid growth of Level 2 driving assistance systems such as General Motors’ Super Cruise and Ford’s BlueCruise are quickly expediting and greatly expanding DMS usage.</p>
<p>Driver monitoring systems use strategically placed cameras to ensure that the driver is paying attention to the road, awake and alert. The system is integrated into the vehicle and can be programmed according to a series of escalating actions, starting with a driver alert or warning and progressing to slowing or stopping the car if the driver is no longer able to operate the vehicle.</p>
<p>Across the globe, DMS will become a standard safety feature as soon as 2023. Provisions in the U.S. bipartisan infrastructure bill will require the Department of Transportation to begin making rules to stop distracted and drunk driving as well as update the U.S. New Car Assessment Program (NCAP). European standards, at first, will apply to distracted and drowsy driving. Eventually, Europe will require the systems to detect impairment to include alcohol and drugs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232254" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>These technologies can’t come soon enough. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813060">caused</a> over 3,000 deaths in 2019, an increase of 10% from 2018. Drunken driving has increased, too. In 2019, 10,142 people died in drunken driving crashes. Early estimates from 2020 <a href="https://www.madd.org/press-release/alcohol-related-deaths-up-9-despite-fewer-cars-on-the-road-during-pandemic">point</a> to a 9% increase in DUI deaths. While many expected traffic deaths to decline during the pandemic, the opposite occurred.</p>
<p>The good news is that DMS is road-ready technology, already in use today. Every major OEM in the U.S. has plans to implement DMS soon. General Motors just announced its next-generation system, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/gm-to-introduce-new-hands-free-driver-assistance-system-in-2023-starting-with-cadillac/">UltraCruise</a>, which uses DMS to ensure motorists can drive when needed. According to GM, this Level 2 system will allow for hands-free driving in 95% of all driving situations. The current system, Super Cruise, is already being expanded across more vehicle models.</p>
<p>Worldwide, carmakers are also expected to rapidly increase the use of DMS in response to growing demand for driver assist systems and government regulations. A recent <a href="https://www.itskrs.its.dot.gov/its/benecost.nsf/ID/761a0e0595322c97852581fd004d9ba0">study</a> reported that advanced emergency braking systems alone could reduce crashes in light vehicles by 33%. These figures are impossible to ignore. To place that in context, traffic deaths <a href="https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/yearly-snapshot">fell</a> 29% in the 39 years between 1980 and 2019.</p>
<p>If we were to apply a conservative effectiveness rate of 30% and assume high levels of DMS penetration in the vehicle fleet to address distraction, drowsiness and intoxication in 2019, it is reasonable to estimate that up to 4,200 fatalities and 315,000 injuries could have been prevented<strong>.</strong> Even if we reduce the effectiveness rate to 10% and allow for a ramp-up to high levels of DMS penetration over several years, there remains a dramatic improvement to the prevention of road trauma.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) are often mentioned as key technological vehicle safety improvements. ADAS includes things like automatic emergency braking, lane departure warnings, blind-spot detection and other types of crash-prevention technologies. However, these technologies work best when combined with DMS.</p>
<p>For example, a car using DMS in combination with an AEB system would know if a driver is distracted. In this case, the car can increase the distance before the AEB system starts to stop the car. Similarly, lane-keeping assistance can become more sensitive and take over more vehicle control when the vehicle detects a distracted or drowsy driver.</p>
<p>In 2015, U.S. automakers agreed to include ADAS as standard equipment by 2022. <a href="https://www.euroncap.com/en">Euro NCAP</a> will require DMS as part of ADAS beginning in 2023. Combining DMS with ADAS creates a truly robust vehicle safety system.</p>
<p>DMS utilizes a closed-loop system, meaning all data stays onboard the vehicle. The camera that monitors the driver uses advanced algorithms and technology to “look” at data points on the eyes and the face. No video is recorded, and the system is not in place to “tattle” on the driver; rather, it provides real-time assistance and should not pose any privacy concerns for consumers.</p>
<p>It’s not just government rules and regulations driving DMS. Consumer Reports, a popular trade publication that many consumers consult before purchasing a new vehicle, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/whats-next-in-car-safety/">notes</a> the importance of DMS in vehicle safety.</p>
<p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) understands the potential of DMS and has included recommendations to accelerate advanced safety technologies in its latest <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/Advocacy/mwl/Pages/default.aspx">Most Wanted List</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past year, DMS has emerged as the clear leader in new lifesaving technologies. The technology exists and is being built into cars today. The emergence of driver assist technologies and government regulations will further expedite the rollout of DMS. The implementation of the U.S. infrastructure package is critical as it could help ensure 4,200 lives are saved from distracted driving every year.</p>

<p>This teardown covers all the key sections of a landing page so that you can apply the conversion and copywriting strategies to your startup&#8217;s homepage.</p>
<h2>Capture the reader&#8217;s attention right away</h2>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			When writing copy for the features section, you typically want to emphasize the problem your audience is facing. 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The first thing a new visitor to your site sees is the section called above the fold (ATF). This section is critical because your visitor will decide whether to continue and scroll or bounce based on how useful your ATF is.</p>
<p>Customer.io&#8217;s ATF section has five pieces that we&#8217;ll dive into individually: header, subheader, call to action, social proof and a visual.</p>

<h2>A strong header that answers &#8220;why&#8221;</h2>
<p>The header of your ATF section should explain exactly what your startup does and why it&#8217;s important in a concise way.</p>
<p>A general framework for writing a good header: If a visitor reads only your header, they should still know who you are and why they should use your product.</p>

<p>Customer.io explains what their product is in two words: messaging workflows. The benefit of using Customer.io is that it enables users to build their dream workflows, which implies complete customizability.</p>

<h2>A subhead that goes deeper</h2>
<p>The subhead explains how you&#8217;ll accomplish the promise of the header. Customer.io tells users that their automated messaging platform is how they let them build their own workflows.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2233649" style="width: 920px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233649" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233649" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-1.png" alt="The sub-head backs up the header" width="910" height="502" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-1.png 910w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-1.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-1.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-1.png?resize=768,424 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-1.png?resize=680,375 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233649" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<p>Subheads can also work by bluntly calling out who the product is for. Customer.io specifies who their product is for clearly. Users will now think, &#8220;Do I consider myself a tech savvy marketer?&#8221; If yes, they will continue reading. If no, they will bounce, which is completely fine.</p>

<p>Customer.io finishes their subhead with the main benefit it offers: Users make more money from their customers because they are able to understand them better through data-driven messaging.</p>

<h2>How to write a high-converting call to action</h2>
<p>Calls to action (CTAs) are used to encourage visitors to engage with your site to further the relationship. It&#8217;s very difficult to convert a visitor into a customer without some type of action mechanism.</p>
<p>Often, you only want one CTA in your ATF section so that users only have one path to take. But if, for example, you have a demo request CTA and you notice not many people are signing up for it, adding a secondary CTA, such as a free trial, may be worth testing. Customer.io does exactly this because they likely know they&#8217;d miss a ton of potential customers without a free trial.</p>
<p>Although they give users multiple options, it&#8217;s clear they want users to request a demo because that&#8217;s the emphasized CTA. They probably know that users who get a full demonstration are more likely to be converted and retained.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233652" style="width: 920px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233652" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233652" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6-1.png" alt="Add a second CTA if you find you aren't getting enough hits on your first one" width="910" height="502" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6-1.png 910w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6-1.png?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6-1.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6-1.png?resize=768,424 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6-1.png?resize=680,375 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233652" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>Adding visuals to explain another way</h2>
<p>Including a visual in your ATF section is only a good idea if it helps visitors understand the unique value of your product. Most cartoon explainers or stock images you see on company landing pages are arbitrary and meaningless.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say you should stop using drawn visuals. Instead, use visuals to show your product&#8217;s value. Customer.io&#8217;s visual works because they visualize how the workflow uses time to delay a push notification.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233653" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233653" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233653" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7-1.png" alt="Add visuals to show how your product works" width="1024" height="733" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7-1.png 1042w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7-1.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7-1.png?resize=300,215 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7-1.png?resize=768,550 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7-1.png?resize=680,487 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7-1.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233653" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>Add social proof to build credibility</h2>
<p>Social proof is crucial for establishing credibility. It&#8217;s also used to make visitors feel like everyone already knows about the product and they&#8217;re the ones missing out. Customer.io establishes credibility and bypasses any suspicion by saying 3,400 companies already work with them. They further prove their point by showing the logos of their most recognizable customers.</p>

<h2>Describe the features that make your product unique</h2>
<p>The features section will make up the bulk of your landing page. Features help users understand why your product is valuable to them. At the same time, it should address any concerns and handle objections proactively.</p>
<p>When writing copy for the features section, you typically want to emphasize the problem your audience is facing. This can be done by repeating the language you hear your customers using to describe their pain points.</p>
<p>Customer.io&#8217;s audience of tech-savvy marketers has a burning problem that doesn&#8217;t need to be further hyped by the copy. Instead, they focus on showing users how much better their life will be with their product.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233655" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233655" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233655" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/9-1.png" alt="Describe the features that set you apart" width="1024" height="571" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/9-1.png 1467w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/9-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/9-1.png?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/9-1.png?resize=768,428 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/9-1.png?resize=680,379 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/9-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233655" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<p>If you have a lot going on in one section, try using a contrasting visuals to guide the eye. Customer.io uses a yellow light bulb so that users naturally read from title to paragraph to image to social proof.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233656" style="width: 744px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233656" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233656" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/10-1.png" alt="Use contrasting visuals to guide the eye" width="734" height="547" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/10-1.png 734w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/10-1.png?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/10-1.png?resize=300,224 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/10-1.png?resize=680,507 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/10-1.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 734px) 100vw, 734px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233656" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<p>Adding social proof to feature sections can make the claims feel more credible. Look at how Customer.io uses legitimate marketers to motivate users to look through the tabbed widgets. People, especially in the same profession, tend to look at and accept the decisions of others as correct.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233657" style="width: 744px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233657" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233657" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11-1.png" alt="Feature professionals from the industry to build credibility" width="734" height="547" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11-1.png 734w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11-1.png?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11-1.png?resize=300,224 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11-1.png?resize=680,507 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11-1.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 734px) 100vw, 734px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233657" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<p>If users aren&#8217;t interacting with your widgets, experiment with multiple navigation options like tabs and arrows.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233658" style="width: 975px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233658" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233658" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12.png" alt="Use multiple navigation options to maximize how much visitors interact with widgets" width="965" height="818" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12.png 965w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12.png?resize=150,127 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12.png?resize=300,254 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12.png?resize=768,651 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12.png?resize=680,576 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/12.png?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 965px) 100vw, 965px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233658" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>Secondary features to give prospects peace of mind</h2>
<p>As visitors are scrolling through your landing page, it&#8217;s possible they can get fatigued by the time they&#8217;re halfway through reading. To make things easier, highlight the important parts of each feature. Customer.io highlights all the moving parts of an advanced messaging workflow to give users a dopamine hit: &#8220;Can they can really do all of this?&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233659" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233659" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233659" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/13-1.png" alt="Highlight the important parts of every feature to keep readers engaged" width="1024" height="353" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/13-1.png 1338w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/13-1.png?resize=150,52 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/13-1.png?resize=300,103 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/13-1.png?resize=768,265 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/13-1.png?resize=680,234 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/13-1.png?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233659" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>Highlight a feature by describing how it applies to the reader</h2>
<p>Your feature copy should be continuously laced with benefits. Another way to accomplish the same outcome is by addressing objections your customer might have right away. This will have the same effect by giving your reader a sense of your trustworthiness and appealing to their logic.</p>
<p>For Customer.io, the level of customizability is great until the user&#8217;s logic brain kicks in and they think: &#8220;Wait, I&#8217;ve tried setting something like this up in the past, and it never worked.&#8221; Customer.io hedges this by showing the technical specifics.</p>
<p>They also emphasize &#8220;Just a few clicks,&#8221; suggesting it&#8217;s easy to use and takes little time to set up.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233660" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233660" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233660" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/14-1.png" alt="Emphasize features and address objections proactively" width="1024" height="427" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/14-1.png 1345w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/14-1.png?resize=150,63 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/14-1.png?resize=300,125 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/14-1.png?resize=768,320 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/14-1.png?resize=680,284 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/14-1.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233660" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<p>The visual for the segmentation feature implies users will see more engaged customers when using their product.</p>

<h2>How to handle objections in your homepage copy</h2>
<p>Marketers know how nerve-wracking it can be to send an email campaign to thousands of people. Customer.io brings attention to this pain point and immediately handles it by highlighting their tech support teams and services.</p>
<p>A user might also think, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want my emails to bounce or end up in spam. I&#8217;m not sure I want to risk using a service like this.&#8221; That is why Customer.io ensures user emails get analyzed for maximum deliverability.</p>
<p>Some users understandably feel anxious about giving their data to a random &#8220;.io tech company.&#8221; To prove trust, Customer.io guarantees data protection.</p>

<h2>How to establish credibility in your industry</h2>
<p>Using statistics can quickly establish credibility. If you come out and say you&#8217;ve sent 535 million webhooks last year, that implies you&#8217;re working with a lot of companies and those companies are using your product.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also easier to explain the volume of data you&#8217;re able to handle visually than it is through a paragraph of text.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233663" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233663" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233663" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17-1.png" alt="Use statistics to establish and build credibility" width="1024" height="186" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17-1.png 1092w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17-1.png?resize=150,27 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17-1.png?resize=300,54 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17-1.png?resize=768,139 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17-1.png?resize=680,123 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/17-1.png?resize=50,9 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233663" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>Finish your page off with a final CTA and more social proof</h2>
<p>The last few sections of the landing page are about privacy, security and trust for a reason. Customer.io knows that no amount of painkilling features will win a user over without establishing trust. This is why they make sure to end the copy with a statement about how many companies trust them and include another company wall to the right of the CTA. It reminds visitors how credible they are.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233646" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233646" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2233646" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/18-1.png" alt="Use your last piece of copy to highlight your trustworthiness and end with a final CTA" width="1024" height="286" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/18-1.png 1381w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/18-1.png?resize=150,42 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/18-1.png?resize=300,84 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/18-1.png?resize=768,215 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/18-1.png?resize=680,190 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/18-1.png?resize=50,14 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233646" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Demand Curve</p></div></p>
<h2>How to apply this teardown to your homepage</h2>
<p>To summarize, here are the key points you should take away from this teardown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell users exactly who the product is for. This will make your target persona read more closely and send away those who wouldn&#8217;t purchase anyway.</li>
<li>If your main CTA is a demo request and you&#8217;re not getting many conversions, experiment with offering a free trial as an additional CTA.</li>
<li>The style of an image doesn&#8217;t matter. What matters is if it helps users understand the value of your product.</li>
<li>If your product is a painkiller, you don&#8217;t need to twist the knife further. Just match the emotions of your audience and show them your solution to their problems.</li>
<li>If your product targets a specific profession, use testimonials from people in the same profession and make sure to include the company name and job title.</li>
<li>If you find users don&#8217;t navigate through your tabbed widgets, experiment with multiple forms of navigation.</li>
<li>If your product&#8217;s biggest objection is security and trust, it&#8217;s okay to go overboard on objection handling.&#x200d;</li>
</ul>

<p>The beta is now open to everyone, and Season 1 of <em>Halo Infinite </em>multiplayer is underway three weeks early.

					<description><![CDATA[We won't know how special Podium truly is till it coughs up some new numbers. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.podium.com/">Podium</a> is back at the fundraising well this year, adding $201 million to its accounts at a $3 billion valuation (post-money).</p>
<p>The Utah-based company, which provides software services including communications and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/podium-rolls-out-payments-for-its-customer-focused-local-business-saas-service/">payments tools</a> to SMBs, last raised $125 million at a roughly $1.5 billion valuation. That deal was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/utahs-podium-raises-125m-series-c-led-by-yc-after-reaching-100m-arr/">announced</a> in April 2020.</p>
<p>Podium CEO Eric Rea <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-15/podium-s-valuation-doubles-to-3-billion-in-latest-fundraising?sref=gni836kR">told Bloomberg</a> that the company has &#8220;well over $100 million in annual recurring revenue.&#8221; TechCrunch confirmed the metric with the company, though Podium declined to be more specific regarding its current ARR.</p>
<p>Podium previously <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/tracking-podiums-revenue-growth-through-its-60m-series-b/">reached the $50 million ARR mark</a> around the time of its $60 million Series B in November 2018. And we know that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/utahs-podium-raises-125m-series-c-led-by-yc-after-reaching-100m-arr/">climbed to $100 million ARR toward the end of 2019</a>. This makes the question of <em>how far above</em> the $100 million ARR mark Podium is today rather important &#8212; we can&#8217;t effectively calculate the company&#8217;s growth rate without an up-to-date figure.</p>
<p>Recall that Podium felt cheap during its last raise, given its revenue base and $1.5 billion price tag. The company declined to share a growth target for 2021 or answer our question regarding whether it hopes to match this year&#8217;s growth rate in 2022. Given that it has an ocean of new capital, we were curious about how bold its growth plans were for the coming year. Surely money helps.</p>
<p>The company also declined to share IPO plan timing or notes on any notable shifts in its economics. Podium only wants to talk about its new fundraising and valuation today, apart from some very non-GAAP figures like how many &#8220;local businesses&#8221; use its service.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bummer, given that Podium, earlier in its life, was a great example of a company that was more transparent than most when it came to sharing financial information.</p>
<p>The lack of hard financial results makes Podium&#8217;s upcoming IPO &#8212; Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-15/podium-s-valuation-doubles-to-3-billion-in-latest-fundraising">quotes</a> an investor in the company saying that it will &#8220;definitely&#8221; go public &#8212; all the more curious. Given that we are going to see results for Podium&#8217;s current performance inside of its eventual S-1 filing, why not tell us now? (In an email, Podium said regarding its IPO timing that it is focused on &#8220;supporting as many local businesses as possible.&#8221;)</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">At CES 2018, Honda revealed several <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-09-honda-3e-concept-robots.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">companion mobility robot concepts</a>. It&#8217;s moving forward with at least one of them, an autonomous vehicle that can go off road. Honda and engineering company Black &amp; Veatch have been putting the second-gen Autonomous Work Vehicle (AWV) through its paces at a solar panel construction site.</p>
<p>This was the first field test in which several AWVs were working together. The vehicles towed trailers and carried construction materials, water and other supplies across the 1,000-acre worksite. The AWV can carry a payload of up to 399kg (880 pounds) and tow a trailer with a total weight of 750kg (1,653 pounds).</p>
<p>In a video that shows off the AWVs, a Black &amp; Veatch employee notes that it can take a while to travel across such a large site. So loading up the vehicles with materials and sending them to another location can make things more efficient and cut down on employees&#8217; travel time, freeing them up to work on other things.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234105" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/honda/" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">Honda</a> created a high-definition map of the site so operators could set start and end points for the AWVs. It says the vehicles stopped within centimeters of their destinations. Along with operating autonomously, the AWV can be remotely controlled.</p>
<p>The company claims the vehicle can run for up to eight hours on a single charge, even in a high-temperature environment. The AWV uses a number of sensors for navigation, including GPS, radar and LiDAR, as well as 3D cameras for remote monitoring. Honda says that even with a maximum payload capacity, the AWV has a range of up to 27.9 miles, depending on the use case.</p>
<p>The automaker is aiming to improve the performance and design of the AMV as it iterates on the prototype (it looks kinda cute as is). It might offer the ability to add attachments and tools as well. Honda hasn&#8217;t revealed plans to release a commercial version of the AMV just yet, though.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.worldofsos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOS</a> already has a number of vending machines in the wild, dotted around the map in its native Boston. The company just closed a $3.4 million round to expand its offering of health and wellness products in vending machines in bathrooms. The vending machines are touch screens that also double as a &#8220;visually rich advertising and marketing platform,&#8221; just in case you were getting nervous at the desperate shortage of advertising in the world around us.</p>
<p>The latest round was led by the cleverly named <a href="https://forlater.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For Later</a>, which is the investment arm of Boston-based retail incubator <a href="https://itsfornow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For Now</a>. Also participating in the round is a star-studded lineup of angel investors, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Khan family</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoe_Cruz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zoe Cruz</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerod_Mayo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerod Mayo</a>, a New England Patriots coach and former player; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jurhyu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ju Rhyu</a> of Hero Cosmetics and others.</p>
<p>SOS&#8217; machines have been installed in a number of venues around Boston, including Fenway Park, Prudential Center, Boston Children&#8217;s Hospital, and State Street Corporation&#8217;s offices, as well as FLA Live Arena in Sunrise, Florida.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232487" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our machines transform a moment of panic into a moment of empowerment and choice,” said Robina Verbeek, founder and co-CEO at SOS. “We believe that convenient access must be paired with exceptional products and an elevated retail experience. ‘Quick and easy’ shouldn’t mean ‘cheap and shoddy,’ especially when it comes to women’s health. Everyone deserves better.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two-woman founding team and the company&#8217;s co-CEOs are Susanna Twarog and Robina Verbeek. They met as colleagues at financial services company State Street, and combined forces to solve the perennial problem of broken, out-of-stock tampon machines.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232500" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-1-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232500" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2232500" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-1-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-1-1.png 1496w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-1-1.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-1-1.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-1-1.png?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-1-1.png?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Untitled-1-1.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2232500" class="wp-caption-text">SOS vending machine</p></div></p>
<p>The team built its first version of the machine in 2017, and deployed the first vending machine at a location in 2020. The company&#8217;s mission is to replace the unreliable, ugly old metal boxes with modern devices and services that &#8220;delivers essential personal care and beauty products from today&#8217;s leading brands.&#8221; The company hopes that its five design patents will hold the competition at bay for long enough to get a foothold in the market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We’re proud to partner with SOS to meet the wellness and personal needs of our staff, fans, and the South Florida community,” said Panthers Chief Commercial Officer Shawn Thornton. “We hope the SOS smart machines give patrons peace of mind knowing they can easily access these wellness products while enjoying concerts, games or events at FLA Live Arena.”</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The company&#8217;s next installation will bring an additional 35 SOS machines to the Florida Panthers&#8217; FLA Live Arena in Sunrise and five machines to the Panthers&#8217; IceDen in Coral Springs. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In the coming months, the company is aiming to expand to additional cities and locations across the U.S., including New York, Florida, California and beyond.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://mixpanel.com">Mixpanel</a> was a hot startup in 2014 when it nabbed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/18/mixpanel-raises-65-million/">a $65 million Series B</a> on an $865 million valuation, a sizable B round and valuation for those days. Today, seven years after that announcement, the company finally has a C round, a $200 million investment on a $1.05 billion valuation from Bain Capital Tech Opportunities.</p>
<p>The company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/how-mixpanel-got-its-startup-groove-back-by-focusing-on-its-core-product/"> has gone on record</a> with TechCrunch that there are lots of reasons for the gap, and when it <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/23/mixpanel-amir-movafaghi-ex-twitter-replaces-suhail-doshi-as-ceo.html">promoted COO Amir Movafaghi to CEO</a> in 2018, it was the first in a series of steps that it took to right the ship.</p>
<p>The company later decided to shut down adjacent messaging and A/B testing products to focus solely on the product analytics market. As it made these moves, it also began to work to improve slipping customer satisfaction metrics like its net promoter score (NPS), which was sitting at 15 when Movafaghi was promoted, according to the company.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233982" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As the focus shifted back to the core product, Mixpanel&#8217;s customer retention numbers, NPS and other related metrics have come back &#8212; NPS is up to 85 this year &#8212; and revenue improved alongside those metrics this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The business performance has continued to accelerate, and all of the [reasons] that we gave to you last time [we spoke] around company metrics, the acceleration on the monetization side, all of those things have just continued to improve and get better,&#8221; Movafaghi told me.</p>
<p>When he took over in 2018, he was leading a company with the bones of a successful startup with $100 million in revenue and close to a $1 billion valuation. Now that it has surpassed unicorn status, he doesn&#8217;t shy away from the fact that there were ups and downs in the company&#8217;s 12-year history.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our story, as you know, was not a straight line. Instead, there were definitely [points] at which we had to take inventory and ultimately put the company back on track.&#8221; He believes that perhaps they were a bit too early for the market, but as digital transformation accelerated during the pandemic, companies of all types increasingly needed the kind of product data analytics Mixpanel provides. Now, the company can take advantage of that with the new investment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dewey Awad, managing director at Bain Capital Tech Opportunities, said that he was impressed with how Movafaghi dealt with the challenges of taking over a company in transition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amir spent a lot of time thinking about the category, how the product fit in, what the [market] was that the company was successful in, and he doubled down on the product and the product-led sales motion, which required a lot more time, was much more complicated and required a lot more hiring,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But beyond Movafaghi&#8217;s leadership, he ultimately likes the focus of the company and believes that product analytics is still a young market with lots of growth potential. He said Bain believed that Movafaghi&#8217;s focus on the core product analytics market, and the decision to ax messaging and A/B testing, was absolutely the right way to go.</p>
<p>Mixpanel now has the capital to invest in moving the market share needle through partnerships and other methods, while continuing to invest in its core product for its target enterprise customers.</p>
<p>The company was founded in 2009 by Suhail Doshi and Tim Trefren and has raised $277 million with today&#8217;s round, according to Crunchbase data. Doshi was CEO from inception until 2018 when he moved to become chairman of the board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cloudflare/">Cloudflare</a> says it has blocked a distributed denial-of-service (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ddos/">DDoS</a>) attack that peaked at just under 2 Tbps, making it one of the largest ever recorded.</p>
<p>The internet company <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-blocks-an-almost-2-tbps-multi-vector-ddos-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in a blog post</a> that the attack was launched from approximately 15,000 bots running a variant of the original <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/mirai/">Mirai code</a> on exploited Internet of Things (IoT) devices and unpatched GitLab instances.</p>
<p>The DDoS attack comes just two weeks after <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2021/11/01/gitlab-unauthenticated-remote-code-execution-cve-2021-22205-exploited-in-the-wild/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rapid7 warned of a GitLab vulnerability</a> — rated a full 10.0 on the CVSS severity scale — that could be exploited to allow an attacker to remotely run code, like botnet malware, on an affected server. Rapid7 found that at least half of the 60,000 internet-facing GitLab instances remain unpatched, and warned that it expected &#8220;exploitation to increase&#8221; as details of the bug became public.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234013" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company wasn&#8217;t wrong; Cloudflare said it blocked the massive DDoS attack just one week later. From its analysis of the attack, Cloudflare believes that it was a multi-vector attack that combined both DNS amplification attacks along with <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ddos/udp-flood-ddos-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UDP floods</a>.</p>
<p>Cloudflare says the attack, which lasted less than a minute, was the largest it had witnessed to date. It comes just a month after Microsoft said it mitigated <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/business-as-usual-for-azure-customers-despite-24-tbps-ddos-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a “record-breaking” 2.4 Tbps DDoS attack</a> targeting one of its Azure customers in Europe.</p>
<p>While Cloudflare mitigated the attack in seconds, it warns that it witnessed multiple terabit-strong DDoS attacks last month, adding that this is unlikely a trend that’s going to slow down any time soon.</p>
<p>“Another key finding from our Q3 DDoS Trends report was that network-layer DDoS attacks actually increased by 44% quarter-over-quarter,” said Omer Yoachimik, product manager at Cloudflare. “While the fourth quarter is not over yet, we have, again, seen multiple terabit-strong attacks that targeted Cloudflare customers.”</p>
<p>Rapid7 has urged GitLab users to update the latest version of GitLab as soon as possible. “In addition, ideally, GitLab should not be an internet-facing service,” the company added. “If you need to access your GitLab from the internet, consider placing it behind a VPN.&#8221;</p>

Twitter said that Threader co-founder Marie Denis helped build the Reader feature, though Twitter did not integrate any of the actual Threader product into its own tech stack.</p>
<p>The terms of the acquisition are not disclosed, but Denis will join Twitter&#8217;s Longform team, working on features like Reader and other similar products. Threader will shut down in 30 days as part of the acquisition, so if fans of the app want to retain the Threader reading experience, they&#8217;ll have to join Twitter Blue for $2.99 per month.</p>
<p>This is just one of several acquisitions that Twitter has made recently &#8212; its most major ones were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">Revue</a>, a newsletter platform, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/twitter-acquires-social-podcasting-app-breaker-team-to-help-build-twitter-spaces/">Breaker</a>, which laid the foundation for Twitter Spaces. Just last month, Twitter acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/twitter-acquires-group-chat-app-sphere/">Sphere</a>, a group chat app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[Why do we care about one public company's planned exit from the public markets? Because Casper's demise as an independent, growth-oriented DTC company details what can go wrong for such firms.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Former venture-backed startup Casper is going private in an all-cash transaction, it <a href="https://ir.casper.com/news-and-events/news/news-details/2021/Casper-Sleep-Inc.-to-Be-Acquired-by-Durational-Capital-Management/default.aspx">announced</a> this morning. Since its early-2020 IPO, Casper has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/3-unicorn-takeaways-from-the-casper-one-medical-ipos/">struggled as a public concern</a>, seeing the majority of its value evaporate after its operating results failed to excite investors.</p>
<p>Casper will sell for $6.90 per share, or around a 94% &#8220;premium to the closing share price on November 12, 2021,&#8221; per its own mathematics. When it listed, Casper sold its stock for $10 per share, rising above $15 per share in its early life before falling as low as $3.18 per share more recently</p>

<hr />
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Why do we care about one public company&#8217;s planned exit from the public markets? Because Casper&#8217;s demise as an independent, growth-oriented DTC company details what can go wrong for such firms. And given that we&#8217;re seeing cash-hungry operations <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/heavily-vc-backed-salad-chain-sweetgreen-heads-toward-public-markets/">like Sweetgreen</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/what-rent-the-runways-ipo-filing-says-about-the-business-of-loaner-garments/">Rent the Runway list</a>, it&#8217;s worth digging into what happened at Casper.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220367 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>This is not to say that every direct-to-consumer (DTC) company is the same. Or even that Casper is entirely DTC; it isn&#8217;t. But we can learn from Casper all the same because it provides a living example of how a company can struggle post-IPO.</p>
<p>When we examine its results, it&#8217;s clear that cash was the issue and that the company&#8217;s share price likely prevented it from saving itself, while also providing an avenue for external rescue.</p>
<p>What the Casper saga means for DTC companies more broadly is nuanced, but we&#8217;ll take that on at the end. To the numbers!</p>
<h2>Why Casper had to sell</h2>
<p>Casper&#8217;s exit might feel like an inevitability in retrospect, but it&#8217;s worth remembering that the company enjoyed a brief return to pricing form earlier this year:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">HPE has confirmed that a &#8220;limited subset&#8221; of customer data was taken in a data breach involving its subsidiary Aruba Networks, a maker of networking equipment.</p>
<p>The enterprise technology giant said in <a href="https://www.arubanetworks.com/support-services/security-bulletins/central-incident-faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a> that an unauthorized person used a private key to gain access to customer data stored in its Aruba Central cloud. HPE did not say how the hacker obtained the private key, but said the key allowed access to cloud servers in multiple regions where customer data was stored.</p>
<p>HPE bought Aruba Networks in 2015 for $3 billion in cash. Aruba provides networking gear, like wireless access points, and network security for companies. Through its dashboard, Aruba Central, companies can centrally monitor and manage their Wi-Fi networks.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234039" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s the Wi-Fi data collected in Aruba Central that HPE said was compromised. HPE said two data sets were exposed: one for network analytics containing information about devices accessing a customer&#8217;s Wi-Fi network, and a second data set containing location data about devices on the network. HPE did not give more details about the granularity of the exposed location data, but noted that the data &#8220;could allow the general vicinity of a user&#8217;s location to be determined.&#8221;</p>
<p>Specifically, the data included details about a device, such as a device&#8217;s MAC and IP address, device hostname and operating system and, in some cases, the username of the user accessing a Wi-Fi network. HPE said usernames are chosen by customers but could include a user&#8217;s name or an email address.</p>
<p>Worse, although the data was both scrambled and encrypted, the company said the private key had permission to use the decryption key; it wasn&#8217;t clear if the data was ultimately decrypted. HPE said it was likely only a &#8220;very small amount, if any&#8221; data was exfiltrated. The company added that it wasn&#8217;t clear which specific customers or what files were taken because the company does not keep logs of individual file access.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.arubanetworks.com/support-services/security-bulletins/central-incident-faq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a>, the hacker first used the key on October 9, but HPE did not detect the intrusion until November 2. HPE automatically purges data from its cloud servers every 30 days, so the amount of compromised data was limited to records dating back to September 10.</p>
<p>HPE said it was notifying customers of the incident.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snapchat has <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/sounds-sony" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inked a deal</a> with Sony Music Entertainment to include its artists’ music in the app&#8217;s Sounds library. The company also revealed that it&#8217;s creating new AR music lenses. Soon, Snapchat will feature &#8220;Sound Lenses&#8221; with a pre-selected song embedded into the lens, a lens that transforms pictures of anyone to appear as if they are singing a song, and &#8220;Cameo Sound Lenses&#8221; that apply visual effects.</p>
<p>The company says that with more than 200 million users engaging with augmented reality on the platform every day, these new &#8220;Sound Lenses&#8221; will create a more immersive music experience for its users. Snapchat has been leveraging AR capabilities in several different ways over the past few years. Most recently, the app announced several updates to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/snap-emphasizes-commerce-in-updates-to-its-camera-and-ar-platforms/">AR-focused Lens Studio</a>.</p>
<p>As for Snapchat’s partnership with Sony Music Entertainment, it comes at a time when access to unique sounds is becoming a competitive advantage for social apps. With this latest launch, Snapchat users will be able to include fully licensed Sony Music artists&#8217; music in their snaps and send them to other users or post them to Snapchat Spotlight.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233985" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new partnership comes two weeks after Snapchat <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/snapchat-partners-with-nbcuniversal-to-give-users-access-to-more-audio-clips/">inked a deal with NBCUniversal</a> to give users access to licensed audio clips from various NBCU TV shows and movies. It’s worth noting that Snapchat also has partnerships with numerous studios and companies within the music industry, including Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, NMPA, Warner Chappell, Kobalt, BMG and more.</p>
<p>Snapchat has been looking to compete with TikTok, which has popularized short-form video sharing with posts set to music from a large catalog. For Snapchat, giving users access to different sounds is an important part of its efforts to compete with TikTok. Last year, the company launched Sounds, a music-powered feature that allows users to set their Snaps to music.</p>
<p>Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, says that since launching Sounds, videos created with music from Sounds have resulted in 521 million videos created and 31 billion views. But Sounds aren’t just used to help fuel Snap’s TikTok competitor. Since Sounds’ launch, nearly 45% of all Snapchat videos created with Sounds (across sends, posts and saves) were sent via direct message.</p>
<p>The new catalog of Sony Music Sounds will be made available to Snapchat users globally, across iOS and Android.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.K.-based software testing startup <a href="https://www.virtuoso.qa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virtuoso</a> has raised a $13.3 million Series A round led by <a href="http://paladincapgroup.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paladin Capital</a>. The round was joined by Mubadala Capital as well as existing U.K. investors Crane Venture Partners, Forward Partners and Downing Ventures.</p>
<p>Virtuoso says its SaaS software testing platform, which launched in 2019, uses machine learning and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to “make testing simpler and faster” and claims that QA teams can identify software bugs and errors much faster than manual processes.</p>
<p>The software testing automation market is projected to grow from $12.6 billion in 2019 to $28.8 billion in 2024, according to Global Market Insights. Virtuoso says it aims to create fully autonomous testing with little to no human interaction, enabling non-coders and coders to write automated tests in plain English.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233975" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Adil Mohammed, founder and CEO of Virtuoso, said: “The way software testing is currently being done is not fit for purpose. When done inefficiently, the QA and testing process can be a big barrier to growth. We want to change that.” Virtuoso plans to use the funding to expand its sales team, increase market share in the US, and develop its product.</p>
<p>Ken Pentimonti, principal and European manager, Paladin Capital Group, commented: “In the fragmented software testing automation market, Virtuoso is way ahead of the curve in terms of versatility, the tech stack and its ease of use.”</p>
<p>Virtuoso competes with companies such as Mabel, Leapwork, Testim, ACCELQ and Functionize.</p>
<p>Mohammed told TechCrunch over email: “A lot of the companies offer human-driven solutions characterised by a high degree of manual testing and non-system-driven automation with little to no ML or RPA. Virtuoso is way ahead of the curve in terms of versatility, the tech stack (execution and deployment speed), and ease of use.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tobii is bringing its eye-tracking tech to the iPad with TD Pilot, a case meant to turn Apple&#8217;s tablet into a powerful all-in-one tool for people with physical impairments. Equipped with TD Pilot, users can launch and use apps, type quickly and speak with a synthetic voice using nothing but their gaze.</p>
<p>IPadOS 15 brought native integration of eye-tracking hardware to these popular devices, and <a href="https://www.tobii.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tobii</a> is probably the most familiar name in that space. I&#8217;ve checked out plenty of their devices, both all-in-one slates and standalone peripherals for PCs, and they&#8217;ve always worked very well. But because of limitations on Apple&#8217;s side, eye-tracking has primarily been on Windows machines. I wouldn&#8217;t mind, myself, but some people prefer iOS and will now have the same access opportunity on that platform.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2232532" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2232532" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2232532" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg" alt="Front and back view of the TD Pilot ipad case" width="1024" height="457" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg 4832w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg?resize=300,134 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg?resize=768,343 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg?resize=680,304 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg?resize=1536,686 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg?resize=2048,915 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tobii-td-pilot.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2232532" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tobii</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232491" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TD Pilot is a large case that includes the eye-tracking gear up front (which is actually remarkably small — a little strip with cameras built in), and behind is not only a set of stereo speakers but a small screen for displaying text. So the device&#8217;s user can communicate via text or audio, sending either though Tobii&#8217;s own TD Talk text-to-speech app or another of their choice. (Not just speech — they can be the DJ too if they want.)</p>
<p>The device comes with access to the rest of Tobii&#8217;s little suite of apps as well, for configuration, symbol-based communication and all the rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is medically certified, and has been certified to meet Apple performance standards,&#8221; said Tobii Dynavox CEO Fredrik Ruben. &#8220;With that, users know that they can rely on market-leading technology that will continue to be updated and supported, and they can avoid insecure &#8216;one-time hacks&#8217; that may be developed for popular technologies.&#8221; This is no doubt a thinly veiled reference to other eye-tracking solutions for earlier versions of the OS that didn&#8217;t support the feature natively.</p>
<p>Tobii&#8217;s eye-tracking devices can be purchased by anyone, but they&#8217;re often, as the company explained, prescribed by a person&#8217;s doctor or therapist as part of a larger set of solutions catering to their individual needs. As such, it is frequently covered by insurance, but of course your mileage may vary. I asked for a specific cost but Tobii did not provide one.</p>
<p>Hopefully for those who would be most empowered by an eye-tracking solution, however, insurance or other methods will suffice to equip them with this useful gadget. It&#8217;s shipping today, so no need to wait. You can see it in action below:</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Prior to the global pandemic, technology for older folks was a nice to have, but now is “an absolute necessity to live your best life,” according to AARP's Andy Miller.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Technology aimed at older people, whether it be healthcare, fintech or entertainment, is not new, but a new community of startups, investors and global industry leaders are shining a light on what they say is an <a href="https://www.aarp.org/research/topics/economics/info-2019/longevity-economy-outlook.html#:~:text=The%20Longevity%20Economy%20outlook%20found,trillion%20to%20the%20U.S.%20economy." target="_blank" rel="noopener">$8.3 trillion opportunity</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://agetechcollaborative.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AgeTech Collaborative</a> from AARP is bringing together organizations, like T. Rowe Price, Walgreens, Cooley and QED Investors, to scale startup products and tools and get them in front of AARP’s 38 million members.</p>
<p>The collaborative kicked off with 50 participating startups, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/01/voiceitt-lets-people-with-speech-impairments-use-voice-controlled-technology/">Voiceitt</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/startups-at-ces-showed-how-tech-can-help-elderly-people-and-their-caregivers/">Rendever</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/san-diegos-trust-will-raises-6-million-for-online-estate-planning/">Trust &amp; Will</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/mighty-health-created-a-wellness-app-with-older-adults-top-of-mind/">Mighty Health</a>. Companies have the benefit of six testbeds to trial their products and will be able to bounce ideas off more than 10 investors and venture capitalists, top companies with a stake in the 50-plus community and service providers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233722" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Andy Miller, AARP senior vice president of innovation and product development, told TechCrunch that while the spending power of those over 50 is already $8.3 trillion, that is <a href="https://www.aarp.org/research/topics/economics/info-2019/longevity-economy-outlook.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected to triple in 30 years</a>.</p>
<p>Miller said the idea stemmed from AARP Innovation Labs, an accelerator he leads, which was attracting some 30 companies, but was not able to provide access to AARP’s membership. Instead, the organization began thinking of ways to give startups a path to scale, which included finding pilot opportunities and partnering with companies willing to test out products.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mighty Health created a wellness app with older adults top of mind&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/mighty-health-created-a-wellness-app-with-older-adults-top-of-mind/embed/#?secret=ZxxGzsArwQ" data-secret="ZxxGzsArwQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>AARP was also getting calls from venture capital firms eager to get the organization&#8217;s take on a startup targeting the 50-plus market, as well as other accelerator programs.</p>
<p>“We felt there was this enormous need to bring together this ecosystem,” Miller said. “Within this demographic, 10,000 people turn 65 every day, and the oldest millennials are 10 years from turning 50. There is a financial incentive, but ours is socially good by allowing people to age better. We can leverage the power of AARP, the ultimate connector where we have a unique vantage point, with VC, corporate and startups. If anyone should win the age stack, it should be AARP. We want everyone to be successful.”</p>
<p>Other organizations are also playing into the age tech space, looking for the next best innovations, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/28/aging-30tour/">Aging 2.0</a>, while startups continue to bring in funding for various products and services. For example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/health-tech-startup-bold-raises-7-million-in-seed-funding-for-senior-focused-fitness-programs/">Bold raised $7 million</a> earlier this year for its senior-focused fitness programs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prior to the global pandemic, technology for older folks was a nice to have, but now is “an absolute necessity to live your best life,” he added. From having to scan QR codes to access a restaurant menu to telemedicine appointments with doctors, it required older people to be more comfortable with technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to those two areas, Miller sees innovations in categories like voice, which is what Voiceitt is working on with technology to decipher grunts and sounds that translate into turning on lights, and fintech with products like intergenerational financial planning.</p>
<p>Fintech is also one of the areas that Nigel Morris, managing partner of QED Investors, has been keeping his eye on.</p>
<p>There is a need to understand retirement options and figure out whether they will pass money to their children and that people are no longer retiring at 60 and going off to the beach, but would rather take advantage of the gig economy, he said.</p>
<p>QED invests in four age tech companies, including Freewill, software for managed giving, and True Link, which helps caregivers manage finances.</p>
<p>“Companies are thinking of this problem, and this is the time,” Morris added. “This population is not classically cool and is overlooked because many investors don’t understand the population. There is so much opportunity and AARP putting this together is great. Being a founding member is a feather in our cap.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Monograph, a startup providing a cloud-based platform for architecture and design professionals to manage their projects, announced today that it has raised $20 million in its Series B funding round. New investor Tiger Global led the round, with participation from Tishman Speyer and existing investors Index Ventures and Homebrew Ventures.</p>
<p>The round brings Monograph’s total funding raised to $29.3 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/monograph-developer-of-project-and-cost-management-software-for-architects-raises-1-9-million/">since it was founded in 2019</a>. Monograph last raised in May 2021, bringing in $7.4 million for its Series A.</p>
<p>Three design technologists started the company &#8212; Robert Yuen, Moe Amaya and Alex Dixon &#8212; all of whom have a background in architecture. Its software helps architectural practices manage many different aspects of their operational systems, including timesheets, budgets, human resources and invoicing; $500 million worth of projects have been executed on the platform to date.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233585" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The San Francisco-based company has grown to 33 employees after beginning 2021 with just eight, CEO and co-founder Robert Yuen told TechCrunch in an email. The new funding will be used to further grow the product and engineering teams.</p>
<p>The pandemic has accelerated growth among smaller design firms as the demand for new residential renovations and construction grows, Yuen wrote. As hiring in the industry picks up pace, Monograph is building a virtual community of professionals in the field through sharing content and job openings, on top of investing in its core software product.</p>
<p>Yuen highlighted Monograph’s budgeting solution, which allows project managers to view project-level finances in real time, as particularly unique given the industry’s reliance on spreadsheets. According to Yuen, the typical project manager who does not use Monograph would have to wait an average of one month to understand whether they were under or over budget on a project.</p>
<p>John Curtius, partner at Tiger Global, was closely involved in the firm’s investment in Monograph.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Monograph is built for architects by architects, which is why it excels at providing a solution to minimize the time spent managing a project,” Curtius said in an email to TechCrunch.</p>
