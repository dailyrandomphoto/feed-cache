										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.crisp.nl/">Crisp</a>, an Amsterdam-based, online-only supermarket focused on fresh produce, has raised €30 million in a Series B financing led by leading Target Global and joined by Keen Venture Partners and the co-founders of Adyen and Takeaway.com. Crisp has now raised a total of €42.5 million to date. It plans to use the money to expand in the Netherlands, and eventually across Europe.</p>
<p>Crisp says its USP is seasonal products sourced directly from 600+ small and high-quality producers at an affordable price in the Netherlands. Customers order through a smartphone app and deliveries are the next day within a 1-hour time slot. It also uses a 100% electric fleet serving big cities and suburbs, and its model is to have zero food waste.</p>
<p>The European grocery market is currently worth €2 trillion, but access to customers for high-quality, smaller producers is still tricky and blocked by incumbents. Crisp is taking advantage of consumers moving online, and wanting fresher food.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tom Peeters, CEO and co-founder of Crisp, told my via online interview that “the differentiation on our model is that we offer quality and convenience. So, fish is super fresh fruits and produce is super fresh, etc. We basically stay away from the standard supermarket proposition that everything is always there, and you manage long shelf life. We&#8217;d rather build a very short chain sourcing directly at the source and bringing it in a very convenient way to you.”</p>
<p>He said it’s not a 15 minute delivery but the next day in order to ensure freshness. “The typical customer is a young family. An average order is 45 products and rather than offering all the brands, we on-boarded the long-tail of food producers in our digital marketplace, so we sourced from over 600 sources of food.”</p>
<p>He said: “Food in Holland is 40 billion euros, in Germany it is 200 billion. I think Europe combined it&#8217;s over two or 3 trillion. So that means basically we don&#8217;t need to spread thin over many countries in order to build a healthy business, not just healthy products, so we make money on every customer order.”</p>
<p>Founded in 2018, by serial entrepreneurs Tom Peeters, Michiel Roodenburg and Eric Klaassen Crisp claims to be now one of the fastest-growing supermarkets in the Netherlands, with a seven-fold in sales in 2020 and more than 85% of sales coming from repeat customers, it says.</p>
<p>Bao-Y van Cong, Investment Director at Target Global, headquartered in Berlin, said: “Crisp is building a world-class technology platform that is of value to both consumers and producers. The way we buy our food has not changed a lot since the 1950’s, creating inefficiencies in quality, affordability, and convenience. Crisp reflects the changing relationship that consumers today have with food: The European market for grocery shopping is starting to move online fast, super-accelerated by the pandemic. At the same time, we see a massive surge in demand for fresh and transparently sourced food.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Food delivery &#8212; whether it&#8217;s ready-made orders from restaurants, meal kits or groceries &#8212; has been one of the most-used services in this last year of living under the cloud of a global health pandemic, and today one of the companies with ambitions to build a pan-European empire in the third of these categories is announcing a major round of funding to help it get there.</p>
<p><a href="https://rohlik.cz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rohlik</a>, a Czech startup that has built an online grocery ordering and delivery business combining your usual grocery fare &#8212; which it procures itself wholesale, or offers in concert with established businesses like Marks &amp; Spencer &#8212; with items sourced from local small businesses, has picked up €190 million ($230 million at today&#8217;s rates).</p>
<p>It plans to use the funding to expand its footprint across metropolitan areas in its existing three markets &#8212; the Czech Republic, Hungary and Austria &#8212; as well as to break into Germany, Poland, Romania and other countries in the near future.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company &#8212; which has some 17 thousand items in its online store &#8212; saw revenues rise 101% in FY 2020 to €300 million on 750,000 customers, and it is profitable. This round will give it significantly more fuel to grow than its balance sheet would, Tomáš Čupr, Rohlik CEO and founder, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>In a market now full of companies offering online grocery delivery, from online arms of established brick and mortar sellers through to &#8220;digital native&#8221; brands, one of Rohlik&#8217;s unique selling points has been to tap into the specific shopping habits of average European urban consumers, who regularly combine shopping at smaller businesses alongside supermarkets.</p>
<p>&#8220;We found the sweet spot of great service, which is two-hour delivery turnaround ordered in windows of 15 minutes, and an amazing assortment. Traditionally you find supermarket assortments in online grocers, but what is the point of waiting for that? We have a supermarket, too, but we married it with local butchers, fishmongers, bakers, fruit and veg sellers, things you can’t buy in mass retail,&#8221; said Čupr. &#8220;We are saving people 5-7 shopping trips, not just the one to the supermarket, and that’s why we managed to scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>The round was led by Partech with significant participation also from Index Ventures. Quadrille Capital, J&amp;T, R2G, <del>Kaiser Permanente Ventures</del> and Enern (a current investor) were also in the round.</p>
<p>The valuation is not being disclosed but <a href="https://forbes.cz/tomas-cupr-je-kral-rohlik-i-s-miliardovou-investici-prekracuje-svuj-stin-a-jde-dobyt-zapad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes&#8217; Czech edition</a>, when reporting on the round being in the works in January, said it was over €600 million ($723 million). We understand from sources it is around $600 million.</p>
<p>Founded in 2014, Rohlik&#8217;s funding comes at an interesting and key moment in the online grocery business, in Europe and beyond.</p>
<p>First, we as consumers have proven out the immediate and lasting demand for these services in the last year.</p>
<p>Shelter-in-place orders, and a general move from large parts of the consumer population to socially distance to help keep down community spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, have led to huge surges of consumers using online food ordering for their grocery needs.</p>
<p>That caused, in many cases, for those systems to get overloaded. For example, Ocado here in the UK, where I am a customer, saw its system fall over with the demand, leading it to implementing strict online queuing systems; many companies were unable to keep up with stock demands and requests for delivery slots; etc.)</p>
<p>Even with some (very much not all) countries in Europe relaxing parts of their orders, grocery has remained a very-much used online category in markets where it is available. That is to say, whatever growing trends there were before a year ago, that adoption has accelerated and stuck.</p>
<p>Second, online grocery delivery has become a key area of interest for investors. Last year, we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/dija/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Dija &#8212; a new startup from former Deliveroo employees in London &#8212; was raising a round; Gorillas in Berlin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/gorillas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $44 million</a> in December; Ocado in the UK (which is listed here but is run like a startup) <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/566f8bc5-6419-4d57-aeb0-587d9d61a945" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised over $1 billion</a>.</p>
<p>These three are taking slightly different approaches to Rohlik in particular around what kind of models they are building around logistics and fulfillment by either taking on &#8220;dark&#8221; convenience stores in cities, as is the case with Gorillas, or large fulfillment centers well outside of urban centers, such as Ocado. The attraction in part with Rohlik is how it has used logistics technology combined with a close understanding of the market (one of Čupr&#8217;s previous startups was a restaurant delivery business, <a href="https://www.deliveryhero.com/delivery-hero-expands-business-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Delivery Hero</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re making a substantial bet and we’re not looking for any business that provides a substitute to existing services,&#8221; said Index partner Jan Hammer, in an interview. &#8220;We&#8217;ve invested in different models around the globe and we have good experiences with Good Eggs. As a tech investment firm, we look at commerce payments, warehouse software and related models that can be synergistic. The macro trend is universal offline to online migration through a better business model. That is the direction of travel. As a VC we would also say that it&#8217;s also down to the individuals involved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rohlik, Čupr said, uses large fulfillment venues that are not as big as out-of-town centers but located much closer to where their customers are based. (This could also potentially give the company an opportunity for expansion into new cities: as large supermarkets become less profitable, they can present themselves as a real estate opportunity for online delivery companies like Rohlik.)</p>
<p>Interestingly, a company probably most similar to of Rohlik&#8217;s closest competitors, Picnic from The Netherlands, last raised money in 2019, <a href="https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2019/11/picnic-raises-e250m-for-a-massive-automated-distribution-centre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$300 million</a>, to build an automated distribution center to serve its home country and Germany. Perhaps it will be next in line for a big round of money. (I&#8217;ll also note that both Index and Accel were reportedly interested in Gorillas but neither invested in the end. With Index now putting its bets on Rohlik, you have to wonder what Accel might do next, if anything.)</p>
<p>A lot of companies in this space up to now have been focused on national markets &#8212; Instacart has not expanded outside of North America, Ocado is only in the UK, and so on. The opportunity for a company like Rohlik is to export its model to more countries that have similar market dynamics to those it already serves.</p>
<p>“Rohlik is the most exciting player in the European online grocery industry,&#8221; said Omri Benayoun, General Partner at Partech, in a statement. &#8220;We are honored to partner with Rohlik’s founder Tomáš Čupr, whose passion for service, sustainability and vision for the grocery sector we share. Rohlik’s execution expertise has earned it the trust of both local merchants and global FMCG companies; allowing Rohlik to outperform on quality and price compared to the grocery giants.”</p>
<p><em>Updated with more updated numbers from Rohlik on its full-year figures, and some changes to the investor names in this round.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">According to an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1834584/000162828021003511/coupang-sx1a1.htm?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Anews%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link">amended S-1 filing</a>, South Korean e-commerce leader <a href="https://www.coupang.com/">Coupang</a> expects to price its initial public offering between $27 to $30 per share, potentially raising up to $3.6 billion. After the IPO, Coupang will have a total of 1.7 billion shares outstanding, including Class A and Class B. This means the means the pricing would give Coupang a potential market capitalization between $46 billion to $51 billion, a huge increase over the $9 billion valuation it reached after its last funding round in 2018, led by SoftBank Vision Fund.</p>
<p>Coupang and some of its existing shareholders will offer a total of 120 million shares during the IPO.</p>

<p>If Coupang’s IPO is successful, it would be a huge win for SoftBank Vision Fund, which will own 36.8% of its Class A shares after the listing.</p>
<p>Founded in 2010 by Bom Kim, Coupang is known for its ultra-speedy deliveries and is now the largest e-commerce company in South Korea, according to Euromonitor. According to the filing, Kim will hold 76.7% of voting power after the listing, while SoftBank Vision Fund will hold about 8.6%. Other investors that currently own 5% or more of Coupang’s shares include Greenoaks Capital Partners, Maverick Holdings, Rose Park Advisors, BlackRock and Ridd Investments.</p>
<p>Coupang filed to go public on the New York Stock Exchange last month, under the symbol CPNG. Based on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-01/south-korea-s-coupang-seeks-up-to-3-6-billion-in-new-york-ipo">Bloomberg</a> data, Coupang’s listing will be the fourth-biggest by an Asian company on a U.S. exchange, and the largest since Alibaba’s $25 billion IPO in 2014.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.compass.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compass</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the real-estate brokerage startup backed by </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/compassinc"><span style="font-weight: 400;">roughly $1.6 billion in venture funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, filed its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001563190/000119312521063859/d36119ds1.htm">S-1</a> Monday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move comes just under one year after the New York-based company</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/with-the-real-estate-industry-facing-headwinds-softbank-backed-compass-lays-off-15-of-staff-after/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> laid off 15% of its staff</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a result of the shifting economic fortunes created by the global response to the novel coronavirus pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to the IPO, SoftBank’s Vision Fund holds slightly more than a one-third stake in the company. Other investors include the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board, Fidelity, Wellington Management, and the Qatar Investment Authority, according to Crunchbase.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s last fundraise was in July 2019, when Compass — a company that has built a three-sided marketplace for the real estate industry, along with a wide set of algorithms to help make it work — raised a $370 million round of funding. That financing valued Compass at $6.4 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the greatest things about companies going public is that we get insight into their financials. Compass is not profitable but it did see a massive surge in revenue over the past few years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s revenues have increased from $186.8 million in 2016 to a whopping $3.7 billion last year, with much of the top-line revenue growth coming in the last two years, according to its S-1. Given the startup’s agency model, most of that revenue is paid out directly to the firm’s agents, who netted about $3 billion in commissions in 2020. Compass posted a net loss of $270 million in 2020, a net loss roughly in line with what it has experienced in the past two years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Total transactions on the platform grew from about 27,000 in 2018 to 145,000 in 2020, while total transaction volume (the value of the properties the company brokers) went up by about five-fold, from $34 billion to $152 billion last year. Since commissions on real estate are determined as fixed percentage of the value of the property, more transaction volume directly translates into more revenue for Compass. The company had 19,385 agents on its platform as of Dec. 31, 2020. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Compass had its share of trouble before the pandemic. In September 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported that the company had </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">lost a number of senior level individuals over the previous eighteen months including its chief financial officer, chief marketing officer and chief technology officer.</span></p>
<p><em>The story was updated post-publication to more accurately reflect the number of agents Compass has on its platform</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What if we no longer needed cameras to make videos and can instead generate them through a few lines of coding?</p>
<p>Advances in machine learning are turning the idea into a reality. We&#8217;ve seen how deepfakes swap faces in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/myheritage-now-lets-you-animate-old-family-photos-using-deepfakery/">family photos</a> and turn one&#8217;s selfies into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/reface-grabs-5-5m-seed-led-by-a16z-to-stoke-its-viral-face-swap-video-app/">famous video clips</a>. Now entrepreneurs with AI research background are devising tools to let people generate highly realistic photos, voices, and videos using algorithms.</p>
<p>One of the startups building this technology is China-based <a href="https://www.surreal.la/">Surreal</a>. The company is merely three months old but has already secured a seed round of $2-3 million from two prominent investors, Sequoia China and ZhenFund. Surreal received nearly ten investment offers in this round, founder and CEO Xu Zhuo told TechCrunch, as investors jostled to bet on a future shaped by AI-generated content.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Prior to founding Surreal, Xu spent six years at Snap, building its ad recommendation system, machine learning platform, and AI camera technology. The experience convinced Xu that synthetic media would become mainstream because the tool could significantly &#8220;lower the cost of content production,&#8221; Xu said in an interview from Surreal&#8217;s a-dozen-person office in Shenzhen.</p>
<p>Surreal has no intention, however, to replace human creators or artists. In fact, Xu doesn&#8217;t think machines can surpass human creativity in the next few decades. This belief is embodied in the company&#8217;s Chinese name, Shi Yun, or The Poetry Cloud. It is taken from the title of a novel by science fiction writer Liu Cixin, who tells the story of how technology fails to outdo the ancient Chinese poet Li Bai.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have an internal formula: visual storytelling equals creativity plus making,&#8221; Xu said, his eyes lit up. &#8220;We focus on the making part.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a way, machine video generation is like a souped-up video tool, a step up from the video filters we see today and make Douyin (TikTok&#8217;s Chinese version) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/kuaishou-ipo-hong-kong/">Kuaishou</a> popular. Short video apps significantly lower the barrier to making a professional-looking video, but they still require a camera.</p>
<p>&#8220;The heart of short videos is definitely not the short video form itself. It lies in having better camera technology, which lowers the cost of video creation,&#8221; said Xu, who founded Surreal with Wang Liang, a veteran of TikTok parent ByteDance.</p>
<h2>Commercializing deepfakery</h2>
<p>Some of the world&#8217;s biggest tech firms, such as Google, Facebook, Tencent and ByteDance, also have research teams working on GAN. Xu&#8217;s strategy is not to directly confront the heavyweights, which are drawn to big-sized contracts. Rather, Surreal is going after small and medium-sized customers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2118921" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2118921" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2118921" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/诗云-电商视频换脸.gif" alt="" width="640" height="360" /><p id="caption-attachment-2118921" class="wp-caption-text">Surreal&#8217;s face swapping software for e-commerce sellers</p></div></p>
<p>Surreal&#8217;s software is currently only for enterprise customers, who can use it to either change faces in uploaded content or generate an entirely new image or video. Xu calls Surreal a &#8220;Google Translate for videos,&#8221; for the software can not only swap people&#8217;s faces but also translate the languages they speak accordingly and match their lips with voices.</p>
<p>Users are charged per video or picture. In the future, Surreal aims to not just animate faces but also people&#8217;s clothes and motions. While Surreal declined to disclose its financial performance, Xu said the company has accumulated around 10 million photo and video orders.</p>
<p>Much of the demand now is from Chinese e-commerce exporters who use Surreal to create Western models for their marketing material. Hiring real foreign models can be costly, and employing Asian models doesn&#8217;t prove as effective. By using Surreal &#8220;models&#8221;, some customers have been able to achieve 100% return on investment (ROI), Xu said. With the multi-million seed financing in its pocket, Surreal plans to find more use cases like online education so it can collect large volumes of data to improve its algorithm.</p>
<h2>Uncharted territory</h2>
<p>The technology powering Surreal, called generative adversarial networks, is relatively new. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661">Introduced by machine learning researcher Ian Goodfellow</a> in 2014, GANs consist of a &#8220;generator&#8221; that produces images and a &#8220;discriminator&#8221; that detects whether the image is fake or real. The pair enters a period of training with adversarial roles, hence the nomenclature, until the generator delivers a satisfactory result.</p>
<p>In the wrong hands, GANs can be exploited for fraud, pornography and other illegal purposes. That&#8217;s in part why Surreal starts with enterprise use rather than making it available to individual users.</p>
<p>Companies like Surreal are also posing new legal challenges. Who owns the machine-generated images and videos? To avoid violating copyright, Surreal requires that the client has the right to the content they upload for moderation. To track and prevent misuse, Surreal adds an encrypted and invisible watermark to each piece of the content it generates, to which it claims ownership. There&#8217;s an odd chance that the &#8220;person&#8221; Surreal produces would match someone in real life, so the company runs an algorithm that crosschecks all the faces it creates with photos it finds online.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think ethics is something that Surreal itself can address, but we are willing to explore the issue,&#8221; said Xu. &#8220;Fundamentally, I think [synthetic media] provides a disruptive infrastructure. It increases productivity, and on a macro level, it&#8217;s inexorable, because productivity is the key determinant of issues like this.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hyzon Motors plans to produce fuel cells, including a critical component required to power hydrogen vehicles, at two U.S. factories in a move aimed at kickstarting domestic production at a commercial scale.</p>
<p>The hydrogen-powered truck and bus manufacturer has already leased a 28,000-square-foot facility in the Chicago suburb of Bolingbrook and plans to expand it by an additional 80,000 square feet. Production at the Chicago facility is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2021. The announcement comes just three weeks after Hyzon announced it would become a publicly traded company through a merger with Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corporation in a deal valued at $2.1 billion, and a little over one week after revealing plans to renovate a 78,000-square-foot factory in Monroe County, New York.</p>
<p>Hyzon is a new name with a nearly two decades of experience. The company was established in March of last year after spinning off from Singapore&#8217;s Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies, which has been developing commercial applications for fuel cells since 2003. Hyzon inked a deal in February with the New Zealand company Hiringa Energy for up to 1,500 fuel cell trucks on New Zealand&#8217;s roads by 2026. Now it is setting its sights on the North American hydrogen fuel cell vehicle market. Due to the lack of an established domestic hydrogen fueling network, the company is targeting heavy-duty vehicle customers that have a &#8220;back-to-base&#8221; business model.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Hyzon&#8217;s decision to build factories in the United States is noteworthy because production of fuel cell materials in the country lags far behind Europe and Asia. The U.S. also lacks the kind of national hydrogen refueling and infrastructure network found abroad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hydrogen is much more available in places like Germany or The Netherlands,&#8221; Hyzon CEO Craig Knight said in an interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;There&#8217;s already a number of commercial vehicle stations where you can just pull up and pay to fill up like you do with gasoline today in the U.S. It won&#8217;t be long before that is a reality, but for the moment we limit the dependence on networks of hydrogen stations by focusing on the customers that use back-to-base operating models, where you only need one piece of hydrogen infrastructure to fuel dozens or even sometimes hundreds of vehicles in a given area.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much of the hydrogen that&#8217;s produced in the U.S. is so-called &#8220;grey hydrogen,&#8221; or hydrogen that&#8217;s produced from natural gas. An increasing number of companies are pursuing &#8220;green hydrogen,&#8221; or hydrogen produced via electrolysis powered by renewable energy. Hyzon sources both types for its operations. Hydrogen production remains one of the main factors determining the rate of scale for fuel cell producers.</p>
<p>The Chicago facility will design, develop and produce the membrane electrode assembly, the fuel cell component that helps trigger the electrochemical reaction required to produce power. The company anticipates the new facility will be able to produce enough MEAs for up to 12,000 fuel cell-powered trucks annually.</p>
<p>Finished MEAs will be sent to the company&#8217;s recently announced fuel cell stack and system assembly plant in Monroe County, where the components will be assembled into complete fuel cells. From there, the fuel cells will be delivered to a partner truck manufacturer to be assembled into commercial heavy-duty vehicles. The company&#8217;s main assembly partner in the United States is Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary Fontaine Modification.</p>
<p>Hydrogen fuel cell technology is finding use cases in heavy-duty vehicles because trucking companies are frequently paid by how much weight they can transport, and how quickly they can do it. The time investment of battery charging and the loss of carrying capacity makes fuel cells an attractive alternative for companies looking to decarbonize their vehicle fleets.</p>
<p>Hyzon sees positive network effects and economies of scale associated with hydrogen fuel cell adoption — and increasing marginal costs of electric battery adoption. Although the company has not announced plans to dive into the light-duty vehicle market, it remains bullish on the value proposition of hydrogen fuel cells.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think at some point it becomes an increasing marginal cost of adoption for battery electric, because you run into infrastructure limitations around the electricity grid, around the size of depots and the capacity to build the charging infrastructure,&#8221; Knight said. &#8220;We believe there&#8217;s a dis-economy of scale attached to going battery electric when you&#8217;ve got really high utilization. We believe that some of the lighter vehicles will also start to move onto hydrogen. We&#8217;re not totally dependent on that for our model, but that&#8217;s our belief.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hyzon, which expects to be listed on the Nasdaq in late May or early June, will be listed under the ticker HYZN.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Known for its innovations in the payments sector, Square is now officially a bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearly one year after <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/ilc-update">receiving conditional approval</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Square said Monday afternoon that its industrial bank, Square Financial Services, has </span><a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-financial-services-begins-banking-operations"><span style="font-weight: 400;">begun operations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Square Financial Services completed the charter approval process with the FDIC and Utah Department of Financial Institutions, meaning it&#8217;s ready for business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bank, which is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, will offer business loan and deposit products, starting with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">underwriting, and originating business loans for Square Capital’s existing lending product.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Historically, Square has been known for its card reader and point-of-sale payment system, used largely by small businesses &#8212; but it has also begun facilitating credit for the entrepreneurs and smalls businesses that have used its products in recent years.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving forward, Square said its bank will be the “primary provider of financing for Square sellers across the U.S.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Square CFO and executive chairman for Square Financial Services Amrita Ahuja said that bringing banking capability in house will allow the fintech to “operate more nimbly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Square Financial Services will continue to sell loans to third-party investors and limit balance sheet exposure. The company said it does not expect the bank to have a material impact on its consolidated balance sheet, total net revenue, gross profit or adjusted EBITDA in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opening the bank “deepens Square’s unique ability to expand access to loans and banking tools to underserved populations,” the company said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewis Goodwin had been tapped to serve as the bank’s CEO, and Brandon Soto its CFO. With today’s announcement, Square also announced the following new appointments:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharad Bhasker, Chief Risk Officer</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Samantha Ku, Chief Operating Officer</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Homam Maalouf, Chief Credit Officer</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Grodsky, Chief Compliance Officer</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessica Jiang, Capital Markets and Investor Relations Lead</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The trend of fintechs becoming banks continues. In February, TechCrunch reported that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brex had </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/brex-applies-for-bank-charter-taps-former-silicon-valley-bank-exec-as-ceo-of-brex-bank/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">applied for a bank charter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YGU4h6Lvnc"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/brex-applies-for-bank-charter-taps-former-silicon-valley-bank-exec-as-ceo-of-brex-bank/">Brex applies for bank charter, taps former Silicon Valley Bank exec as CEO of Brex Bank</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Brex applies for bank charter, taps former Silicon Valley Bank exec as CEO of Brex Bank&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/brex-applies-for-bank-charter-taps-former-silicon-valley-bank-exec-as-ceo-of-brex-bank/embed/#?secret=YGU4h6Lvnc" data-secret="YGU4h6Lvnc" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fast-growing company, which sells a credit card tailored for startups, with Emigrant Bank currently acting as the issuer, said that it had submitted an application with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions (UDFI) to establish Brex Bank.</span></p>
<p>A number of fintech companies, or those with fintech services, have spun up products typically offered by banks, including deposit and checking accounts as well as credit offerings. Often, these are designed to provide capital to customers who might not be able to get funding on favorable terms from traditional banking institutions, but who might qualify for business-building loans from a provider who knows their company, like Square, inside and out.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[It's unicorn melting season, with gobs of investors hoping for liquidity while public markets are hot. Expect more Kalturas.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://corp.kaltura.com/">Kaltura</a>, a software company focused on providing video technology to other concerns, has filed to go public.</p>
<p>The Kaltura S-1 filing only partially surprised. TechCrunch previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/the-100m-arr-club-welcomes-four-new-members/">covered the company</a> as part of our ongoing $100 million ARR series focusing on private companies that have reached material scale. (TechCrunch has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/01/video-platform-kaltura-adds-advanced-analytics/">covered its product life</a> to a moderate degree.)</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1432133/000162828021003617/kalturas-1.htm#idaacbb16e45c4b55be4efdb687fb35b2_563">IPO documentation</a> details a business that did more than merely accelerate its growth in 2020, and more specifically, during the COVID-19 era. Seeing a company that powers video tooling do well when much of the world has transitioned to remote work and education is not a bolt from the blue. What is notable, however, is that the company&#8217;s revenue growth has accelerated yearly since at least 2018 and its final quarter of 2020 placed the company at a new growth rate maximum.</p>
<p>Public investors, hungry for growth, may find such a progression compelling.</p>
<p>Kaltura also has an interesting profitability profile: As its GAAP net losses scaled in the last year, its adjusted profitability improved. Depending on your stance regarding adjusted metrics, Kaltura&#8217;s bottom line will either irk or delight you.</p>
<p>This afternoon, let&#8217;s rip into the company&#8217;s S-1 and yank out what we need to know. It is IPO season, with SPACs galore and other private companies taking more traditional routes to the public markets, including <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1834584/000162828021003511/coupang-sx1a1.htm">Coupang announcing a price range for its traditional debut today</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/">Coinbase&#8217;s impending direct listing</a>.</p>
<p>For now we&#8217;ll focus on Kaltura. Let&#8217;s get into it.</p>
<h2>Inside Kaltura&#8217;s IPO filing</h2>
<p>When TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/the-100m-arr-club-welcomes-four-new-members/">last covered Kaltura&#8217;s financial results</a>, we noted that the company founded in 2006 had raised just north of $166 million, crossed the $100 million ARR mark, and was, per its own reporting, &#8220;profitable on an EBITDA.&#8221; Kaltura also told TechCrunch that it had margins in the 60% range and was growing at around 25% year over year. That was just over a year ago.</p>
<p>Do those figures hold up? In the Q1 2020 period Kaltura recorded $25.9 million in revenue, software margins of around 78% and blended gross margins of 59.8%. And the company had grown 16.6% from the year-ago quarter. In Kaltura&#8217;s defense, the company&#8217;s growth accelerated to 24% in the year, so its self-reported numbers were mostly fair. Better than, I think, most numbers we get from private companies.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup by an Apple alum that has become home to millions of low-skilled workers in India said on Tuesday it has raised an additional $12.5 million, just five months <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/31/apple-alums-jobs-app-for-indias-workers-secures-8-million/">after securing $8 million from high-profile investors</a>.</p>
<p>One-year-old <a href="http://apna.co">Apna</a> said Sequoia Capital India and Greenoaks Capital led the $12.5 million investment in the startup. Existing investors Lightspeed India and Rocketship VC also participated in the round in what is an extended Series A.The startup, whose name is Hindi for &#8220;ours,&#8221; has now raised more than $20 million.</p>
<p>More than 6 million low-skilled workers such as drivers, delivery personnel, electricians and beauticians have joined Apna to find jobs and upskill themselves. But there’s more to this.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>An analysis of the platform showed how workers are helping one another solve problems &#8212; such as a beautician advising another beautician to perform hair dressing in a particular way that tends to make customers happier and tip more, and someone sharing how they negotiated a hike in their salary from their employer.</p>
<p>“The sole idea of this is to create a network for these workers,” <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/nirmitparikh">Nirmit Parikh</a>, Apna founder and chief executive told TechCrunch in an interview. “Network gap has been a very crucial challenge. Solving it enables people to unlock more and more opportunities,” he said. Harshjit Sethi, principal at Sequoia India, said Apna was making inroads with “building a professional social network for India.”</p>
<p>The startup has become an attraction for several big firms, including Amazon, Flipkart, Unacademy, Byju&#8217;s, Swiggy, BigBasket, Dunzo, BlueStar and Grofers, which have joined as recruiters to hire workers. Apna offers a straightforward onboarding process &#8212; thanks to support for multiple local languages &#8212; and allows users to create a virtual business card, which is then shown to the potential recruiters. Parikh said Apna&#8217;s AI understands the cultural nuances, helping recruiters find the best candidates for their needs.</p>
<p>The past six months have been all about growth at Apna, said Parikh. The app, available on Android, had 1.2 million users in August last year, for instance. During this period, there have been 60 million interactions between recruiters and potential applicants, he said. The platform, which has amassed more than 80,000 employers, has a retention rate of over 95%, said Parikh.</p>
<p>“Apna has taken a jobs-centric approach to upskilling that we are very excited about. Lack of accountability has been the core issue with current skill / vocational learning alternatives for grey and blue-collar workers. Apna has turned the problem on its head by creating net-positive job outcomes for anyone who chooses to upskill on the platform,” said Vaibhav Agrawal, partner at Lightspeed India, in a statement.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119367" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119367" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2119367" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nirmit-parikh-apna.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nirmit-parikh-apna.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nirmit-parikh-apna.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nirmit-parikh-apna.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nirmit-parikh-apna.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nirmit-parikh-apna.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nirmit-parikh-apna.jpg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2119367" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nirmit Parikh</p></div></p>
<p>Parikh got the idea of building Apna after he kept hearing about the difficulty his family and friends faced in India in hiring people. This was puzzling to Parikh, as he wondered how could there be a shortage of workers in India when there are hundreds of millions of people actively looking for such jobs. The problem, Parikh realized, was that there wasn&#8217;t a scalable networking infrastructure in place to connect workers with employers.</p>
<p>Before creating the startup, Parikh met workers and went undercover as an electrician and floor manager to understand the problems workers were facing. That journey has not ended. The startup talks to over 15,000 users each day to understand what else Apna could do for them.</p>
<p>“One of the things we heard was that users were facing difficulties with interviews. So we started groups to practice them with interviews. We also started upskilling users, which has made us an edtech player. We plan to ramp up this effort in the coming months,” said Parikh, who also started an AI firm more than a decade ago to solve challenges with electricity flux and then another startup to solve for information overload. (The first startup is now being run by family and friends, and the second firm was sold to Intel, Parikh said.)</p>
<p>Parikh said the startup is overwhelmed each day with the response it is getting from its customers and the industry. Each day, he said, people share how they were able to land jobs, or increase their earnings. In recent months, several high-profile executives from companies such as Uber and BCG have joined Apna to scale the startup’s vision, he said, adding that the problem Apna is solving in India exists everywhere and the startup&#8217;s hope is to eventually serve people across the globe.</p>
<p>The app currently has no ads, and Parikh said he intends to not change that. &#8220;Once you get in the ad business, you start doing things you probably shouldn&#8217;t be doing,&#8221; he said. The startup instead plans to monetize its platform by charging recruiters, and offering upskill courses. But Parikh maintained that Apna will always offer its courses to users for free. The premium version will target those who need extensive assistance, he said. The startup also plans to expand its team.</p>
<p>As is the case elsewhere, millions of people lost their livelihood in India in the past year as coronavirus shut many businesses and workers migrated to their homes. There are over 250 million blue and grey-collar workers in India, and providing them meaningful employment opportunities is one of the biggest challenges in our country, said Sethi.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google over the weekend began to update many of its flagship iOS apps after a lengthy delay caused by the company&#8217;s failure to add Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=3wann9gh">newly required privacy labels</a> in a timely fashion. Though Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/google-to-add-app-store-privacy-labels-to-its-ios-apps-as-soon-as-this-week/">earlier this year</a> said it would &#8220;soon&#8221; begin to add the labels to its apps as they were updated, it has still yet to do so for a number of key properties &#8212; including Search, Photos, Assistant, Maps, Pay, Chrome and others.</p>
<p>Per Apple&#8217;s policy, developers cannot issue further updates until privacy labels are applied. That prevented Google from updating many of its top apps for a much longer period of time than usual &#8212; especially for a company of its size where minor updates containing bug fixes and performance improvements are issued on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Gmail, for example, hadn&#8217;t been updated for three months before the update that rolled out this weekend.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According their iOS App Store listings, Slides, Docs, Sheets and Calendar all received updates this weekend, as well. And over the past couple of weeks, updates for other newly labeled Google apps have also been restarted &#8212; including YouTube, YouTube TV, YouTube Music, Google Tasks and Google Podcasts, for example.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been tracking Google&#8217;s app updates <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OmRV-FPmtTNng9vCe_5sIlbejR0Gth6tQruQCNEhveQ/edit#gid=0">here</a> in Google Sheets. (Appfigures confirmed our spreadsheet&#8217;s accuracy by running it against its own data.)</p>
<p>This weekend&#8217;s set of newly updated apps aren&#8217;t the only ones from Google to have received their privacy labels in 2021. Labels can be applied without issuing an app update which makes them harder to spot, sometimes.</p>
<p>Across Google&#8217;s full suite of iOS apps, those apps with labels now include:</p>
<p>Google One, Google Podcasts, Google Stadia, Google Fit, Google Fi, Google Tasks, Google Chat, Onduo, Project Baseline, YouTube, YouTube TV, YouTube Music, YouTube Kids, YouTube Studio, Google Meet, Google Smart Lock, Motion Stills, Google Fiber, Google Ads, Wear OS, Google Calendar, Google Classroom, Google Slides, Google Sheets, Google Docs, Google Drive, Google Play Movies, Google Home, Fiber TV, Google Translate and Google Authenticator.</p>
<p>Google has not said why it is taking so long to apply its labels. It initially attributed its delay to add the privacy labels to its annual holiday code freeze &#8212; a time of the year when the company pauses updates on its apps while many people take time off.</p>
<p>But as the weeks turned into months, it was clear that Google was taking a much more cautious and methodical approach to applying the labels than other large tech companies. As a result, it&#8217;s received increased attention and scrutiny of its app updates.</p>
<p>In fact, every time a new Google app was updated with a label, it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2021/1/26/22250648/google-apple-app-store-privacy-label">made</a> <a href="https://www.imore.com/heres-how-much-data-youtube-collects-you-ios?amp">headlines</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-ios-apps-update-gmail-meet-sheets-docs-calendar-tasks-200335624.html">Engadget today reported</a> on Gmail and other apps being updated over the weekend, for example.</p>
<p>In mid-January, Google officially responded to the curiosity over its delays <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/our-work-keep-you-safe-and-control-your-privacy">with a blog post</a> explaining that its iOS apps would receive privacy labels as it received its next update. But the two have not necessarily gone hand-in-hand. Gmail <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/22/google-gmail-app-privacy-labels/">received</a> its privacy label back on February 22, according to reports, but hadn&#8217;t been updated until just now.</p>
<p>And the list of labeled apps is far longer than the list of updated ones.</p>
<p>Google has not responded to a request for comment at this time.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[“You’re seeing a lot of large companies … are now investing significant amounts into really trying to understand their emissions profile and prioritize emission reductions in a data-driven way."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Commitments to carbon neutrality keep coming from all corners of the business world &#8212; over the past few weeks, companies ranging from the fast-casual restaurant chain Sweetgreen to the security-focused networking IT company Palo Alto Networks to the online craft retailer Etsy committed to net-zero carbon emission plans.</p>
<p>As the companies look for ways to reduce their energy consumption, they&#8217;re turning to carbon offset programs as a stopgap measure until the energy grid decarbonizes, they implement technologies to reduce their energy consumption, or both.</p>
<p>This push toward corporate sustainability is creating all kinds of strange bedfellows and startup opportunities, with major corporate offset programs and the establishment of new startups focused on offsets creating channels for sustainable technologies to get to market.</p>
<p>The latest example of a company leveraging a sustainability angle to tie a corporate partner even closer to their business is the <a href="https://news.delta.com/delta-and-deloitte-commit-reducing-carbon-emissions-sustainable-fuel-agreement">agreement between Delta and Deloitte</a>, which involves the accounting and consulting firm paying Delta for renewable jet fuel to offset the emissions of its corporate travel.</p>
<p>To be clear, a better policy for Deloitte would be to cut back on non-essential travel significantly and focus on doing as much remote work as possible to reduce the need for flights. But in some cases business travel is unavoidable, and most folks want to get back to a pre-pandemic normal, which &#8212; at least in the U.S. and other countries &#8212; will include significantly ramping up air travel for a percentage of the population.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200218-climate-change-how-to-cut-your-carbon-emissions-when-flying">As the BBC noted</a>, air travel accounts for roughly 5 percent of the emissions that contribute to global climate change, but only a small percentage of the world actually uses air transport. <a href="https://theicct.org/publications/co2-emissions-commercial-aviation-2018">According to one analysis from the International Council on Clean Transport</a>, just 3 percent of the world&#8217;s population flies regularly. And if everyone in the world did fly, aircraft emissions would top the CO2 emissions of the entire U.S.</p>
<p>Which brings us back to Deloitte and Delta and startups.</p>
<p>Delta&#8217;s deal to buy sustainable aviation fuel that would offset a portion of the carbon emissions associated with Deloitte&#8217;s business travel is one small step toward greening the airline industry, but the question is whether it&#8217;s a significant first step or just an attempt to greenwash the unsustainable travel habits of a consulting industry that prides itself on such perks.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://aws.com">AWS</a> launched the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/28/amazon-debuts-a-scale-model-autonomous-car-to-teach-developers-machine-learning/">DeepRacer League in 2018</a> as a fun way to teach developers machine learning, and it&#8217;s been building on the idea ever since. Today, it announced the latest league season with two divisions: Open and Pro.</p>
<p>As Marcia Villalba wrote <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-deepracer-leagues-2021-season-launches-with-new-open-and-pro-divisions/">in a blog post</a> announcing the new league, &#8220;AWS DeepRacer is an autonomous 1/18th scale race car designed to test [reinforcement learning] models by racing virtually in the AWS DeepRacer console or physically on a track at AWS and customer events. AWS DeepRacer is for developers of all skill levels, even if you don’t have any ML experience. When learning RL using AWS DeepRacer, you can take part in the AWS DeepRacer League where you get experience with machine learning in a fun and competitive environment.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the company started these as in-person races with physical cars, the pandemic has forced them to make it a virtual event over the last year, but the new format seemed to be blocking out newcomers. Because the goal is to teach people about machine learning, getting new people involved is crucial to the company.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why it created the Open League, which as the name suggests is open to anyone. You can test your skills and if you&#8217;re good enough, finishing in the top 10%, you can compete in the Pro division. Everyone competes for prizes, as well, such as vehicle customizations.</p>
<p>The top 16 in the Pro League each month race for a chance to go to the finals at AWS re:Invent in 2021, an event that may or may not be virtual, depending on where we are in the pandemic recovery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook was <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-facebook-privacy-settlement-approval-20210227-okljqhsiargl7ijvzzfcotpyby-story.html">ordered to pay $650 million Friday</a> for running afoul of an Illinois law designed to protect the state&#8217;s residents from invasive privacy practices.</p>
<p>That law, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/bipa/">Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA)</a>, is a powerful state measure that&#8217;s tripped up tech companies in recent years. The suit against Facebook was first filed in 2015, alleging that Facebook&#8217;s practice of tagging people in photos using facial recognition without their consent violated state law.</p>
<p>Indeed, 1.6 million Illinois residents will receive at least $345 under the final settlement ruling in California federal court. The final number is $100 million higher than the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/29/facebook-will-pay-550-million-to-settle-class-action-lawsuit-over-privacy-violations/">$550 million Facebook proposed in 2020</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/illinois-facebook-users-to-get-more-than-300-each-in-privacy-settlement/">which a judge deemed inadequate</a>. Facebook <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/09/update-face-recognition/">disabled the automatic facial recognition tagging features in 2019</a>, making it opt-in instead and addressing some of the privacy criticisms echoed by the Illinois class action suit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A cluster of lawsuits accused Microsoft, Google and Amazon of breaking the same law last year after Illinois residents&#8217; faces were used to train their facial recognition systems without explicit consent.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="71UZWCkE1J"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/facial-recognition-lawsuit-vance-janecyk-bipa/">Lawsuits allege Microsoft, Amazon and Google violated Illinois facial recognition privacy law</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Lawsuits allege Microsoft, Amazon and Google violated Illinois facial recognition privacy law&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/facial-recognition-lawsuit-vance-janecyk-bipa/embed/#?secret=71UZWCkE1J" data-secret="71UZWCkE1J" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Illinois privacy law has tangled up some of tech&#8217;s giants, but BIPA has even more potential to impact smaller companies with questionable privacy practices. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/14/class-action-suit-against-clearview-ai-cites-illinois-law-that-cost-facebook-550m/">controversial facial recognition software company Clearview AI</a> now faces its own BIPA-based class action lawsuit in the state after the company <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210116/12585446068/appeals-court-rejects-clearviews-attempt-to-dodge-state-lawsuit-trying-to-make-it-federal-case.shtml">failed to dodge the suit by pushing it out of state courts</a>.</p>
<p>A $650 million settlement would be enough to crush any normal company, though Facebook can brush it off much like it did with the FTC&#8217;s record-setting $5 billion penalty in 2019. But the Illinois law isn&#8217;t without teeth. For Clearview, it was enough to make the company <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/clearview-ai-no-facial-recognition-private-companies">pull out of business in the state altogether</a>.</p>
<p>The law can&#8217;t punish a behemoth like Facebook in the same way, but it is one piece in a regulatory puzzle that poses an increasing threat to the way tech&#8217;s data brokers have done business for years. With regulators at the federal, state and legislative level proposing aggressive measures to rein in tech, the landmark Illinois law provides a compelling framework that other states could copy and paste. And if big tech thinks navigating federal oversight will be a nightmare, a patchwork of aggressive state laws governing how tech companies do business on a state-by-state basis is an alternate regulatory future that could prove even less palatable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter announced Monday that it would begin injecting new labels into users&#8217; timelines to push back against misinformation that could disrupt the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. The labels, which will also appear as pop-up messages in the retweet window, are the company&#8217;s latest product experiment designed to shape behavior on the platform for the better.</p>
<p>The company will attach notices to tweeted misinformation warning users that the content &#8220;may be misleading&#8221; and linking out to vetted public health information. These initial vaccine misinformation sweeps, which begin today, will be conducted by human moderators at Twitter and not automated moderation systems.</p>
<p>Twitter says the goal is to use these initial determinations to train its AI systems so that down the road a blend of human and automated efforts will scan the site for vaccine misinformation. The latest misinformation measure will target tweets in English before expanding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Twitter also introduced a new strike system for violations of its pandemic-related rules. The new system is modeled after a set of consequences it implemented for voter suppression and voting-related misinformation. Within that framework, a user with two or three &#8220;strikes&#8221; faces a 12-hour account lockout. With four violations, they lose account access for one week, with permanent suspension looming after five strikes.</p>
<p>Twitter introduced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/twitter-coronavirus-covid-19-misinformation-policy/">first pandemic-specific policies a year ago</a>, banning tweets promoting false treatment or prevention claims along with any content that could put people at higher risk of spreading COVID-19. In December, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/twitter-will-force-users-to-delete-covid-19-vaccine-conspiracy-theories/">Twitter added new rules focused on popular vaccine conspiracy theories</a> and announced that warning labels were on the way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the next Y Combinator demo day approaches, more startups from the current Winter 2021 batch are showing up in our inboxes. One of the most interesting from the mix is <a href="https://briohr.com/">BrioHR</a>, which is building human resources (HR) software for Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The company fits into a theme I&#8217;ve noticed amongst startups, namely a focus on taking proven software genre approaches to specific parts of the world, localizing them and building in-region winners. This theme is not new, of course, but it does feel slightly more pronounced amongst recent accelerator batches than before (TechCrunch covers Techstars, Y Combinator, 500 Startups and other accelerators as part of our startup focus). Perhaps this is the impact of so many accelerators going virtual, widening the founder pool from whom they might matriculate to include a more global group of founders.</p>
<p>Back to BrioHR itself, the company is announcing $1.3 million in fundraising, inclusive of its YC check. The investment was led by <a href="https://www.globalfounderscapital.com/">Global Founders Capital</a>, and saw participation from <a href="https://east.vc/">East Ventures</a> and angel investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TechCrunch caught up with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-croc-93669426">Benjamin Croc</a>, the company&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, who is located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (the city pictured in the image at the top of this post). The time zones were tricky to navigate, but the company&#8217;s vision was simple enough: A software-as-a-service (SaaS) HR software suite, tailored to fit the laws of the Southeast Asian region.</p>
<p>Croc and his co-founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nabil-oudghiri-870372b5/">Nabil Oudghiri</a>, founded the company in 2018, incorporating in the second half of the year after talking over their idea for a few months. BrioHR did not launch its product until the fourth quarter of 2019, opening for what Croc described as early adopters. The startup launched more broadly in the first quarter of 2020, right in time for COVID-19 to shake up the world.</p>
<p>Its fundraising came in two chunks, one in the middle of 2020 and one that came in the third quarter of the year; the first chunk of the raise was larger than the second. BrioHR raised the capital using a convertible note, with terms that Croc described as near to standard.</p>
<p>In our conversation, TechCrunch was curious about how prevalent SaaS as a model is in Malaysia and the other countries the startups wants to sell into. The co-founder said that while SaaS is not as well known in his part of the world as it is in the United States &#8212; not a huge surprise given that the U.S. is the largest SaaS market in the world &#8212; he praised the speed at which Southeast Asian countries adopt business trends; if Croc is right, his view could point to a very active subscription software market in the region in coming years.</p>
<p>BrioHR competes with local companies that are more focused on providing single solutions, like payroll management. From our discussion, it appears that Croc hopes that by going broad, in a feature sense, BrioHR will surpass legacy competitors. The startup is itself still building out its regional tooling, providing payroll support in only a handful of countries. It intends to expand that service to new countries this year, and be everywhere with its payroll product in two to three years, its co-founder said.</p>
<p>Notably, even though it has already raised capital, BrioHR intends to take part in Y Combinator&#8217;s demo day. Croc said it is taking part for optionality. TechCrunch read that as the company isn&#8217;t actively looking to raise more capital at the moment, but wouldn&#8217;t turn down another convertible note at a comfortable cap. Then again, what company at any demo day would?</p>
<p>Since launching out of its early-adopter program, Croc said that the company has grown 10x. That&#8217;s not hard from a small base, so the company&#8217;s 2021 growth will be more illustrative of its true near-term potential. Let&#8217;s see what new metrics it breaks out in a few weeks&#8217; time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab packed a ton of news into Monday to kick off this week: It&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-to-go-public-via-spac-at-valuation-of-4-1-billion/">going public via a SPAC merger</a>, for one, and it&#8217;s also building a new, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-debuts-plans-for-a-new-larger-reusable-rocket-for-launching-satellite-constellations/">larger launch vehicle called Neutron</a> to support heavier payloads. I spoke to Rocket Lab founder and CEO Peter Beck about why it&#8217;s building Neutron now, and why it&#8217;s also choosing to go public at the same time. Unsurprisingly, the two things are tightly linked.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have the benefit of flying Electron [Rocket Lab&#8217;s current, smaller launch vehicle] for a lot of customers. and we also have a Space Systems Division that supplies components into a number of spacecraft, including some of the mega constellations,&#8221; Beck told me. &#8220;So we have very strong relationships with a lot of different customers, and I think we get unique insight on where the industry is going, and where the where the pain points are.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those pain points informed Neutron, which is a two-stage reusable rocket. Rocket Lab already broke with Beck&#8217;s past thinking on what the launch market needed by developing partial reusability for Electron, and it&#8217;s going further still with Neutron, which will include a first stage that returns to Earth and lands propulsively on a platform stationed at sea, much like SpaceX&#8217;s Falcon 9. But the market has shifted since Rocket Lab built Electron — in part because of what it helped unlock.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The creation of Neutron came from two discrete factors: One, the current need in the marketplace today. Also, if you project it forward a little bit, Neutron will deliver the vast majority — over 90% of — all the satellites that are around or in some form of planning. And if you look at those satellites, 80% of them are megaconstellations by volume. So, in talking with a bunch of different customers, it was really, really apparent that a megaconstellation-building machine is what the market really needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beck says that combining that market need with a historical analysis that showed most large launch vehicles have taken off half-full resulted in them arriving at Neutron&#8217;s eight metric ton (just over 17,600 lbs.) total cargo mass capacity. It should put it in the sweet spot where it takes off full nearly every time, but also can still meet the mass requirement needs of just about every satellite customer out there, both now and in the future.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rocket Lab to go public via SPAC at valuation of $4.1 billion&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-to-go-public-via-spac-at-valuation-of-4-1-billion/embed/#?secret=99rJ1gG5lj" data-secret="99rJ1gG5lj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re covered in scars and battle wounds from the development of Electron. The one thing that Elon and I agree on very strongly is by far the hardest part of a rocket is actually scaling it — getting to orbit is hard, but actually scaling manufacturing is ridiculously hard. Now, the good news is that we&#8217;ve been through all of that, and manufacturing isn&#8217;t just as product on the floor; it&#8217;s ERP systems, quality systems, finance, supply chain and so on and so forth. So all that infrastructure is is built.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to the factory and manufacturing processes and infrastructure, Beck notes that Electron and Neutron will share size-agnostic elements like computing and avionics, and much of the work done to get Electron certified for launch will also apply to Neutron, realizing further cost and time savings relative to what was required to get Electron up and flying. Beck also said that the process of making Electron has just made Rocket Lab extremely attuned to costs overall, and that will definitely translate to how competitive it can be with Neutron.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because electron has a $7.5 million sticker price, we&#8217;ve just been forced into finding ways to do things hyperefficiently,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you&#8217;ve got a $7.5 million sticker price, you can&#8217;t spend $2 million on flight safety analysis, payload environmental analysis, etc. — you just can&#8217;t do that. With a $60 million or $80 million vehicle you can amortize that. So we&#8217;ve kind of been forced into doing everything hyperefficiently. And it&#8217;s not just systems; it includes fundamental launch vehicle design. So when we apply all of those learnings to Nutron, we really feel like we&#8217;re gonna bring a highly competitive product to the marketplace.&#8221;</p>

<p>As for the SPAC merger, Beck said that the decision to go public now really boils down to two reasons: The first is to raise the capital required to build Neutron, as well as fund &#8220;other&#8221; projects. The other is to acquire the kind of &#8220;public currency&#8221; to pursue the kinds of acquisitions in terms of business that Rocket Lab is hoping to achieve. Why specifically pursue a SPAC merger instead of a traditional IPO? Efficiency and a fixed capital target, essentially.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were actually sort of methodically stepping toward an IPO at the time and, we were just sort of minding our own business, but it was clear we were pursued very vigorously by a tremendous number of potential SPAC partners,&#8221; Beck told me. &#8220;Ultimately, on the balance of timelines, this just really accelerated our ability to do the things we want to do. Because, yes, as you pointed out, this kind of streamlined the process but also provided certainty around proceeds.&#8221;</p>
<p>The SPAC transaction, once complete, will result in Rocket Lab having approximately $750 million in cash to work with. One of the advantages of the SPAC route is that how much you raise via the public listing isn&#8217;t reliant on how the stock performs on the day — Beck and company know and can plan on that figure becoming available to them, barring any unexpected and unlikely barriers to the transaction&#8217;s closing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having all the capital we need, sitting there ready to go, that really sets us up for a strong execution,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you look at Rocket Lab&#8217;s history, we&#8217;ve only raised spend a couple of hundred million dollars to date, within all the things we&#8217;ve done. So capitalizing the company with $750 million — I would expect big things at that point.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You might call <a href="https://capp.fm">Cappuccino</a> the anti-Clubhouse, but the company has been iterating on its app concept for a couple of years — its CEO doesn’t have any strong opinions on Clubhouse. And it’s true that Cappuccino is an interesting social app on its own. It has been attracting a loyal user base, especially after a TikTok video went viral.</p>
<p>The startup says it is building an app that helps you record podcasts with friends. Many people have discovered podcasts over the past few years. Podcasts let you subscribe to audio shows and listen to episodes on demand.</p>
<p>At first, people subscribe to podcasts because of their interests. But if you talk about podcasts with your friends, they’ll tell you that they like a show in particular because of the personalities of the hosts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Listening to a podcast is a content consumption experience that feels like nothing else out there. You might watch all videos released by a particular YouTuber and you might think you know a lot about someone’s personal life by following them on Instagram.</p>
<p>But listening to someone for hours at a time with earbuds in your ears is a very intimate experience. When a podcast works, it feels like you’re sitting in a room with a few friends and just listening to what they have to say.</p>
<p>And yet, chances are your favorite podcast hosts are not your friends.</p>
<p>This is where Cappuccino fits. The app lets you create groups with your friends or your families. Members of the group can record a short audio message — a bean, as the startup calls it. They talk about what’s on their mind for a couple of minutes. The next morning, group members receive a notification saying that your morning cappuccino has been brewed.</p>
<p>When you hit play, a chill intro music starts playing followed by audio messages from your friends. It isn’t just a succession of voice memos — it feels like a relaxing mix of happy, funny, caring, thoughtful messages from your friends.</p>
<p>While Cappuccino is a social app, it is focused on your close friends and your family. You aren’t trying to get more followers and you are not sharing public posts. Everything is private by design and focused on groups of real-life friends.</p>
<p>In many ways, it reminds me of Snapchat’s group stories. But Snapchat wasn’t the main inspiration for Cappuccino — it was podcasting.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119170" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119170" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2119170" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cappuccino-screens.png" alt="" width="1024" height="717" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cappuccino-screens.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cappuccino-screens.png?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cappuccino-screens.png?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cappuccino-screens.png?resize=768,538 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cappuccino-screens.png?resize=680,476 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cappuccino-screens.png?resize=1536,1075 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cappuccino-screens.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2119170" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cappuccino</p></div></p>
<h2>Prototype early, iterate often</h2>
<p>I talked with the company&#8217;s co-founder and CEO Gilles Poupardin about the origin story of the app. Cappuccino isn’t Poupardin’s first startup. He had worked on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/whyd/">Whyd</a> for several years and lived the full startup experience — he raised founding rounds, chose to pivot, attended Y Combinator in the Bay Area, parted ways with his company’s CTO and chose to shutter the startup.</p>
<p>Among other things, Whyd worked on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/18/whyd-announces-its-voice-controlled-connected-speaker-for-299/">voice-controlled connected speaker</a> before Amazon’s Echo product lineup and Google’s Nest speakers really took off. It’s hard to compete with tech giants, even harder when you’re competing on the hardware front.</p>
<p>After that, the Whyd team worked on a service that lets you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/18/whyd-now-helps-companies-create-their-custom-voice-assistant/">create your own voice assistant</a>. That didn’t really take off as expected either.</p>
<p>During the summer of 2019, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olivierdesmoulin/">Olivier Desmoulin</a> reached out to Poupardin. Back then, Desmoulin was heading design for <a href="https://www.jumboprivacy.com">Jumbo</a>, an app that helps you stay on top of your online privacy.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Privacy assistant Jumbo raises $8 million and releases major update&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/privacy-assistant-jumbo-raises-8-million-and-releases-major-update/embed/#?secret=JpZiVPgpMU" data-secret="JpZiVPgpMU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“At the time, I didn’t know if I wanted to start a company again — I pivoted 15 times [with Whyd],” Poupardin told me.</p>
<p>But they started discussing about podcasts and AirPods — and audio at large — as the next frontier for social apps. The basic premise was simple. A lot of people were listening to podcasts, but very few people were creating their own podcasts.</p>
<p>There are three reasons why your neighbor doesn’t have its own podcast but sometimes posts stuff on Instagram and Snapchat:</p>
<ul>
<li>Podcasts are long-form content.</li>
<li>It’s technically complicated to record and release a podcast.</li>
<li>You are trying to attract an audience of people who don’t know you.</li>
</ul>
<p>With Cappuccino, the idea is to take a reverse stance on these three points: short content, easy to record and personal. It’s supposed to be a better experience for both people recording audio and people listening to audio.</p>
<p>The first version of Cappuccino isn’t an app, it’s a side project. “We created a group on WhatsApp, we invited 10 to 15 people and we asked them to record voice memos and send them all to Olivier,” Poupardin told me.</p>
<p>Every night, Olivier Desmoulin would fire up GarageBand and create a mix of all voice memos. In the morning, he would send a message to the group conversation on WhatsApp and write: “Hey, your cappuccino is here.”</p>

<p>After getting some positive feedback from group members, Pouparding and Desmoulin chose to move forward and create something that feels more like an app. But they both knew that creating a social app was incredibly hard when it comes to attracting users. They developed something quickly so that they weren&#8217;t wasting time developing something that nobody would use.</p>
<p>“We built the first version of the app in four days by using a hack — we were using <a href="https://airtable.com">Airtable</a> as the backend service,” Poupardin said.</p>
<p>Once again, feedback from beta users was pretty good. They showed the app to some investors and ended up raising $1.2 million from Alexia Bonatsos (Dream Machine, also a former TechCrunch editor), SV Angel, Kevin Carter (Night Capital), Niv Shrug Capital, Jean de La Rochebrochard (Kima Ventures), Kevin Kuipers, Willy Braun, Marie Ekeland, Solomon Hykes (founder of Docker), Pierre Valade (founder of Sunrise and Jumbo Privacy), Moshe Lifschitz (Basement Fund), Anthony Marnell, Bryan Kim and a bunch of others.</p>
<p>Gawen Arab who was the CTO at Whyd teamed up once again with Poupardin, proving that time is a flat circle. He&#8217;s now co-founder and CTO at Cappuccino.</p>

<h2>Letting people talk about you</h2>
<p>The Cappuccino team hasn’t been active when it comes to press relations or ads. It’s been a slow build up with some interesting spikes.</p>
<p>Last summer, Product Hunt super user <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/@chrismessina">Chris Messina</a> <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/cappuccino-4">created a post</a> about Cappuccino. It was a bit of a surprise as the startup wasn’t trying to get featured on Product Hunt. Still, the co-founders diligently answered questions from the Product Hunt community.</p>
<p>The following day, <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/newsletter/5868">Product Hunt’s newsletter</a> featured Cappuccino. It was titled “The next big audio social network?” That brought some new users to the app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119163" style="width: 289px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119163" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-2119163" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_9024.jpeg?w=279" alt="" width="279" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_9024.jpeg 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_9024.jpeg?resize=139,150 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_9024.jpeg?resize=279,300 279w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_9024.jpeg?resize=768,827 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_9024.jpeg?resize=632,680 632w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_9024.jpeg?resize=46,50 46w" sizes="(max-width: 279px) 100vw, 279px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2119163" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cappuccino</p></div></p>
<p>But things really started to take off when Brittany Kay Collier <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@brittanykaycollier/video/6927809320109247749">shared a video on TikTok</a> about Cappuccino a few weeks ago. She sent a direct message to Poupardin on Instagram, telling him that it was attracting a lot of views. The video ended up attracting around 3.8 million views and 850,000 likes.</p>
<p>Two days later, Poupardin sent her a job offer to join the team. He was secretly hoping she would say yes, and she was secretly dreaming about getting a job at a company like Cappuccino.</p>

<p>Over the past couple of weeks, Cappuccino attracted 225,000 new users. They created 130,000 groups and sent around one million audio stories.</p>
<p>When the team is reading public posts about Cappuccino <a href="https://twitter.com/cappuccino_fm/likes">on Twitter</a>, it feels like the app has found its core user base. The most loyal users seem to be young women in their twenties. They want to keep in touch with long-distance best friends.</p>
<p>They might be graduating from college and moving to a different part of the country. They might be stuck at home because of the current pandemic.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>And it seems like new users have no issue hitting the record button and telling stories — everybody is familiar with voice messages on WhatsApp and iMessage after all.</p>
<p>“Something that is interesting with audio messages as a medium is that you tell different stories from what you would tell by taking a photo for Instagram, sending a Snap or creating a video on TikTok,” Poupardin said.</p>
<p>But what about the elephant in the room then? Clubhouse has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/report-social-audio-app-clubhouse-has-topped-8-million-global-downloads/">topped 8 million downloads</a> already. Poupardin listed all the differences in social graph, audio format and user base. According to him, there’s enough room for multiple audio apps.</p>
<p>“With video, you have YouTube, Twitch and TikTok — those are all different formats. Audio is potentially going to follow the same trend,” Poupardin said. Social apps first took advantage of the camera in your smartphone, because the camera was <i>the</i> killer hardware feature. And audio seems like the natural next step.</p>
<p>He feels like he isn’t competing with other audio startups for now. He wants people to wake up and listen to Cappuccino instead of random music on Spotify. “It’s going to help people who feel lonely,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As building in public continues to gain popularity with early-stage startup founders, Murmur, coming out of stealth today, wants to leverage that natural transparency to a louder frequency.</p>
<p>Founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/aarondignan">Aaron Dignan</a>, Murmur helps startups create work agreements based on the policies of other startups. &#8220;Work agreements&#8221; is an intentionally broad phrase, but encapsulates everything that a team decides about how work works, from paternal leave strategies to strategic priorities to how hiring works.</p>
<p>“It’s everything you’ve ever argued about [within your startup],” Dignan said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It requires a healthy level of transparency within the ecosystem, meaning that a startup would have to be open with sharing its policies to the public in the first place. But, if Murmur works, it could help early-stage founders save time on the pain-staking process of figuring out how to build policies from scratch around hiring, OKR goals and vacation policies.</p>
<p>Instead, a new founder could just rely on other, seasoned founders, who have shared their policies for anyone to enjoy, and customize their own plan based around those practices.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The 10 benefits and policies any modern workplace should have&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/06/the-10-benefits-and-policies-any-modern-workplace-should-have/embed/#?secret=P44zqTRQni" data-secret="P44zqTRQni" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Today, Murmur <a href="https://www.notion.so/Murmur-raises-1-8M-to-scale-the-magic-of-working-agreements-c82e95c4c5584b84937f8a87d148db42">announced</a> that it has raised $1.8 million to scale its working agreements platform in a round led by Lerer Hippeau, with participation from SemperVirens, Human Ventures and Remote First Capital. Other investors include Steve Schlafman, Mariano Suarez-Battan (the CEO of Mural), Brian Sugar (the CEO of PopSugar) and Adam Pisoni (the co-founder of Yammer).</p>
<p>The company, still in private beta, will be launching to the public in early summer 2021.</p>
<p>Murmur is a web-based platform that allows startups to author, customize and plan policies that will shape a team’s culture. The platform helps teams go from proposal to decision with features like voting, edits and feedback throughout the process of creating an agreement. Instead of pushing a copy and paste of another startup’s policy, Murmur prompts founders to use the outsourced policies as seeds, and add customization as they go.</p>
<p>“Anybody can Google and find some company’s years-old processes; the trick is in making an inclusive ‘agreement’ with a real team all participating [and] the magic of keeping it and iterating it, and improving it,” Dignan said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2119098" style="width: 965px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2119098" loading="lazy" class="breakout  wp-image-2119098" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg" alt="" width="955" height="661" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg 3250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg?resize=150,104 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg?resize=300,208 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg?resize=768,532 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg?resize=680,471 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg?resize=1536,1063 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg?resize=2048,1418 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Explore.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 955px) 100vw, 955px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2119098" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Murmur</p></div></p>
<p>Right now, it is free for anyone to see listed company public agreements. But it costs money to use the Murmur platform to create and customize your own agreements off of this information. With this format, you can see that Dignan thinks that the conversion power of the company lies more in its platform than the content.</p>
<p>Dignan tells me that the team is still testing pricing strategies, but the current plan is a free trial followed by a monthly per-seat fee of $12 to $15 per month, per user. One day, companies could charge a premium for a “kit” of tools on their platform.</p>
<p>Murmur’s initial target for customers are startups that are growing fast and already work in public, such as Buffer, Basecamp, Lattice and Blinkist, but in the future, big enterprises could also see it useful.</p>
<p>Murmur is launching amid a general trend of companies that are pitching themselves as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/best-practices-as-a-service-is-a-key-investment-theme-to-watch-in-2021/">best-practices-as-a-service.</a> Companies in this space aren’t simply enabling other startups to use a fancy SaaS tool, they are not-so-gently pushing them to use those tools in the best possible way for the best possible outcome. Murmur, if it hits scale, could help the next generation of startups figure out the best way to start companies.</p>
<p>Dignan says that the startup “aims to do for working practices what GitHub did for code.”</p>
<p>Remote work is obviously a key catalyst for the company, since the transition has reminded teams that transparency, standards and communication is vital to a functioning organization.</p>
<p>While the startup currently only has Murmur working agreements on the platform, it plans to onboard the agreements of dozens of companies in the coming months. Even though the platform is what makes Murmur special, it’s clear that curating agreements from top companies plays a vital role in Murmur’s success.</p>
<p>It is not paying companies to publicly list their agreements, and the branding benefit of transparency is well worth the confidentiality cost of sharing due to recruitment benefits.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Best practices as a service is a key investment theme to watch in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/best-practices-as-a-service-is-a-key-investment-theme-to-watch-in-2021/embed/#?secret=JIH1rqBhkm" data-secret="JIH1rqBhkm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Dignan says connections from his <a href="https://www.bravenewwork.com/">book about the future of work</a> will help land those agreements. Writing a book about a changing world of work before a global pandemic turned everything upside down is ironic, but Dignan, it appears, doesn’t view Murmur as a pandemic pivot.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ve been thinking about this tool for seven years,” he said. But he didn’t think an opinionated tool would have a large enough total addressable market, and that anything that would scale would just reinforce the status quo. He didn’t build Murmur for a while because he thought that the ecosystem didn’t need “yet another customer engagement tool.”</p>
<p>So, he waited. And the pandemic, another peak of the Black Lives Matter movement and the election happened within one year.</p>
<p>“It was all signaling that the complexity is too much,” he said. “We need new ways of working, making decisions and organizing as people. And that felt like this huge moment where we plant the seed and in a few years&#8217; time, the market will be huge.”</p>
