										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most small businesses today don&#8217;t have a dedicated staff to handle their IT needs. Take restaurants, for an example. They have likely outsourced this job to contract IT professionals to save some expenses.</p>
<p>Every time they need to buy a point-of-sale machine, a printer, new computers, or assign business emails to employees, they reach out to a trusted IT advisor, who then works with vendor partners to secure products and services that the business needs.</p>
<p>A former investor at Accel spotted an opportunity in this space and is tackling it with her new startup <a href="https://www.zomentum.com/">Zomentum</a>. The U.S.-headquartered startup&#8217;s platform allows these IT partners to bring their entire sales process together, a phenomenon she said is helping these IT professionals increase their revenue and close more sales in less time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Businesses can&#8217;t afford to hire dedicated IT staff, so Zomentum is hoping to build a strong IT partner network that can serve as an effective sales channel to promote the hyperlocal IT market.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, three-year-old Zomentum announced it has raised $13 million in its Series A round led by Greenoaks Capital and existing investors Elevation Capital and Accel. The new round, which brings Zomentum&#8217;s to-date raise to $17.1 million, also saw participation from Eight Roads Ventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;SMBs are often so focused on helping customers that they end up strapped for time to select the right technology that suits their business needs. Increasingly, more and more IT channel partners are assuming the role of trusted advisors to these SMBs for their technology needs,&#8221; said Shruti Ghatge, co-founder of Zomentum.</p>
<p>Citing internal research, Zomentum said average IT partners on its platform are able to create documents 70% faster, close twice as many deals with a 600% increase in deal value, and are seeing 20% increase in conversion.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see an opportunity to leverage the power of AI and data science to enable business insights for these channel partners. We want our partners and their clients to leverage AI-enabled Business Intelligence to help gain actionable insights and take smart decisions, something that until now, was available only to enterprises,&#8221; said Rahil Shah, co-founder and chief technology officer of Zomentum.</p>
<p>More than 80% of Zomentum customers today are in the U.S., and Ghatge said the startup will deploy the fresh capital to expand its presence in the market and broaden its product offerings.</p>
<p><em>More to follow&#8230;</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pandemic and the world&#8217;s big shift to doing (even) more online has put an unprecedented amount of pressure on cybersecurity. Now, it looks like one of the big public players in that space, <a href="http://paloaltonetworks.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palo Alto Networks</a>, has made an acquisition that will help it address that challenge, specifically with security tools designed for those working in DevOps to handle vast volumes of security data more efficiently.</p>
<p>According to our sources and reports, the company is acquiring <a href="http://bridgecrew.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bridgecrew</a>, a startup out of Israel that automates the process of network monitoring and security remediation by translating the feedback into code. Its tools are used by fast-scaling, internet-based businesses like Robinhood, BetterHelp and OneMain Financial.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The acquisition was first rumored <a href="https://www.calcalist.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3890890,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier this month</a> in Israeli press as a deal worth more than $100 million. Two sources confirmed the talks to us at the time but said the deal had not yet been closed. Then, a report this morning in Israel&#8217;s <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3894051,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calcalist</a> said the acquisition is now valued at around $200 million, possibly more if you count earn-outs.</p>
<p>Sources close to the startup&#8217;s investors confirm to us that the papers have indeed now been signed on the deal, so expect an official announcement soon.</p>
<p>Spokespeople for both companies previously declined to comment on any deal when we asked earlier this month. We are reaching out to both again.</p>
<p>A $200 million price tag would represent a strong return for Bridgecrew and its investors.</p>
<p>The startup, backed by the likes of Battery Ventures, Operator Partners and <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/399506-86/company/profile#investors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than a dozen others</a>, has only raised around $18 million, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/bridgecrew-announces-14m-series-a-to-automate-cloud-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series A of $14 million last year</a>. According to <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/399506-86/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook data</a>, Bridgecrew had a valuation of about $40 million at the time of that last round.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity &#8212; specifically the need for better and more sophisticated solutions in the face of an increasing amount of breaches in an ever-growing threat landscape &#8212; has seen an increasing focus for years. Indeed, it&#8217;s one of the rising tides that has lifted Palo Alto Networks&#8217; boat.</p>
<p>But in the last year, the Covid-19 pandemic has brought more attention to cybersecurity and the need for more automation in it than ever before.</p>
<p>The reason is fairly obvious but is worth repeating: as more organizations migrate operations into distributed, digital-only, cloud-based environments, architectures have become more fragmented, complex and simply bigger and more of an exploitation target.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s presented a challenge for those provisioning security for these operations, and that has led to a new wave of companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/06/process-as-code-security-ops-orchestration-for-a-brave-new-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over the last several years</a> building automated solutions, merging DevOps with security monitoring.</p>
<p>“We founded Bridgecrew because we saw that there was a huge bottleneck in security engineering, in DevSecOps, and how engineers were running cloud infrastructure security,” Bridgecrew CEO and co-founder Idan Tendler told TechCrunch last year. Others in this wider space include PortShift (which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/cisco-acquires-portshift-to-raise-its-game-in-devops-and-kubernetes-security/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Cisco last year</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/11/accel-index-back-tines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tines</a> and many others.</p>
<p>Palo Alto Networks has <em>also</em> been building its own tools for DevOps security, namely with Prisma, which it introduced in 2019 and <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/press/2020/palo-alto-networks-announces-prisma-cloud-2-0--the-industry-s-only-comprehensive-cloud-native-security-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated last year</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear why Palo Alto would choose to supplement that with an outside acquisition, but it&#8217;s notable that Bridgecrew focuses on DevOps security specifically and it has seen a lot of traction in that area.</p>
<p>Its sweet spot appears to be customers who are building huge businesses themselves on cloud infrastructure and are using automation as part of bigger efforts to ensure better cybersecurity practices.</p>
<p>It counts customers like Databricks for its <a href="https://bridgecrew.io/platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flagship</a> Bridgecrew platform product, which provides security scanning and remediation in the form of code across a wide range of infrastructure environments. The company <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bridgecrew-celebrates-significant-growth-milestones-in-its-first-year-of-codified-cloud-security-301212217.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently said</a> that its customer base and monthly sign ups both tripled in the second half of last year.</p>
<p>It has also seen a lot of pick-up of <a href="https://www.checkov.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Checkov</a>, its open source infrastrcuture-as-code (IaC) scanner that it says works across cloud infrastructure in Terraform, Cloudformation, Kubernetes, Arm templates or Serverless Framework to detect misconfigurations.</p>
<p>Checkov passed a milestone of 1 million downloads last quarter, speaking to the company&#8217;s reputation and traction with the very customers that Palo Alto is looking to reach.</p>
<p>Notably, Bridgecrew says it&#8217;s working on other open source projects, so that could also be a focus for Palo Alto here.</p>
<p>Another takeaway from this news is how Israel continues to be fertile ground for hatching and growing cybersecurity businesses.</p>
<p>“Palo Alto Networks was established by Israeli founders, and Bridgecrew will be the seventh Israeli cybersecurity company acquired by Palo Alto in the recent years,&#8221; said Avihai Michaeli, a Tel Aviv-based senior investment banker and startup advisor.</p>
<p>We will update this story as we learn more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Carl Pei, co-founder of OnePlus, knows a thing or two about communities. At the Chinese smartphone maker, Pei fielded product and feature ideas from fans and held frequent gatherings to hear their feedback. At his <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/oneplus-co-founder-carl-pei-raises-7-million-for-his-new-venture/">new venture, Nothing</a>, Pei is going a step further.</p>
<p>London-headquartered firm said on Tuesday it will allow its community to invest $1.5 million in the company through a <a href="https://www.crowdcube.com/explore/investor-terms">community equity round</a> early next month. One community member will be elected to Nothing’s board of directors to always keep the firm in “check” and remind it of ‘what users want,” said Pei.</p>
<p>The startup, which recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-09/alphabet-s-vc-arm-backs-oneplus-co-founder-s-nothing-company">raised a $15 million</a> Series A round from Alphabet’s GV, said it will raise money from the community at the same valuation as implied in the Series A round. (The startup has raised an additional $7 million from high-profile executives including Kunal Shah of Cred, Tony Fadell, principal at Future Shape and inventor of the iPod, well-known YouTuber Casey Neistat, Kevin Lin, co-founder of Twitch, Steve Huffman, chief executive of Reddit, and Kim Fai Kok of Truecaller.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We want our community to be part of our journey from the very start and play an active role in it.” said Pei, who serves as the chief executive of Nothing. Pre-registrations to the financing option will open on February 16 at 10AM GMT, and the campaign will go live on March 2 at 10AM GMT.</p>
<p>Pei has yet to share what all products he wants to tackle at his new venture. So far he has said the startup plans to develop a pair of wireless headphones and smart and connected consumer electronics devices.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked him why he couldn’t do all of this at OnePlus. “When you want to build something new and different, the best way is to start-off on a clean sheet and with a change of environment,” he said.</p>
<p>This week, 9to5Google <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/15/essential-carl-pei-nothing-technologies/">reported</a> that Nothing had acquired some trademarks from Android creator Andy Rubin&#8217;s now-defunct Essential.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.revent.vc">Revent</a> — a new European early stage (pre-seed to series A) venture capital fund with an ‘impact’ focus — is coming out of the gate today, and is poised to reach its target of a €50m ($60m) fund, with the first close of that already completed. Focusing on environmental and societal problems, Revent  will be looking to fund startups with both ‘purpose and profit’. Headquartered in Berlin and investing across Europe it will hone in on companies in Climate-Tech, health and wellbeing, and economic empowerment.</p>
<p>The founding partners are Otto Birnbaum, who was previously with French VC Partech, but also worked at HelloFresh; Dr. Lauren Lentz formality of McKinsey and an expert in impact measurement;  Emily Brooke MBE, founder of Beryl, a micromobiilty startup; and Henrik Grosse Hokamp who worked previously for Partech’s late-stage fund.</p>
<p>Revent&#8217;s founder LP is Benjamin Otto, managing Partner at the Otto Group. Otto is part of the influential and powerful Otto family in Hamburg, founders of the Otto Group. Benjamin Otto also backed the launch of two other German VCs, e.ventures and Project A. Other investors in the fund include Max Tayenthal (N26), Sascha Konietzke (Contentful), Verena Pausder (Fox &amp; Sheep), Luis Hanemann (e.ventures), Benjamin Roth (Urban Sports Club) and Dr. Florian Heinemann (Project A).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Revent has so far made four investments: <a href="https://www.tomorrow.one/en-EU/">Tomorrow Bank</a>, a sustainable challenger bank based in Hamburg ; <a href="https://www.sylvera.io/">Sylvera</a>, a London-based company that developed AI-enabled monitoring of nature-based carbon offsetting projects; <a href="https://www.tmrow.com/">Tmrow</a>, a Denmark-based team building technology products for consumers and companies to understand and reduce their carbon footprint; and <a href="https://www.netpurpose.com/">net purpose</a>, an impact datastream for asset managers to understand the quantitative net impact of their portfolio, acting like a “Bloomberg” terminal of impact.<br />
 <br />
Commenting on the launch, Otto Birnbaum, Revent General Partner said: &#8220;We’re not acting as philanthropists, but rather aim to demonstrate that achieving very attractive financial returns is possible precisely because of the positive impact these companies will achieve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Benjamin Otto, Revent Anchor Investor said: “Social and ecological challenges have reached a new level of urgency. We depend on entrepreneurial innovation to find new solutions. With Revent, we want to create a platform for founders that not only provides them with optimal support but also contributes to a change in mindset: Entrepreneurial success and social-ecological impact can reinforce each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch, Brooke and Lentz said the “purpose economy” has been accelerated by the Covid pandemic, which has amplified many of the planet&#8217;s systemic problems, such as inequality of access to healthcare, EdTech, creating massive changes in the world of work. Their mission, they tell me, is to positively affect the lives of 1 million people and to abate 5 million tons of C02. In order to achieve this, the fund will link fund carry to its impact goals.</p>
<p>They also say they are seeing a new wave of founders who want to tackle these problems. While overall VC investment is up only by about 2%, investment in ‘impact’ spaces such as ed-tech and mental health is booming.</p>
<p>As Brooke told me on a call: “We want to build a new version of venture capital, that authentically and genuinely prioritizes environmental returns and societal returns, along with commercial.”</p>
<p>Lentz said: “We think that there is this generation of founders who are looking for an investor who really brings both financing and an impact mindset. So not a classical impact-first impact investor, or a classic VC that is only looking at the growth trajectory and the financial upside returns. And we think that this founder is looking for an investor who really believes that these two things reinforce each other, and that the returns are going to be generated by positive societal impact, and that there needs to be a European home for this kind of founder.”</p>
<p>The main question is, how are they going to measure the impact?</p>
<p>Lentz said: “We view this holistically, and we start very early, so when we&#8217;re in diligence we go through a structured process of basically trying to assess the team, the founder DNA, how committed are they to achieving positive impact. We&#8217;re investing very early, usually pre-product, so we need to understand what is the motivation for this team. And then we try to systemically look at the different dimensions of impacts or how deep the impact, how many people will they reach, what additionality are they offering. We go through a structured exercise during the due diligence. And then we do something a bit unique which is we do an impact forecast. And so before we pull the trigger and invest we basically take what the founders have told us, and what we have learned through our conversations about possible growth trajectories, and we try to make some estimates and assumptions around the depth of the impact that the company will have. So it might be how much carbon do we think that the company will be able to beat or avert over the next eight years, or how many lives would they be able to significantly affect and to what extent&#8230; We&#8217;re not building a 20,000 line model, but we are trying to put some rigour around what we expect to happen on the impact side. Only if we anticipate that the company is going to have very significant potential upside from a commercial point of view and also very significant impact upside would we invest.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://fronted.rent/">Fronted</a>, the London-based fintech aiming to make life easier for renters, including lending the cash needed for a deposit, has finally launched.</p>
<p>In March, its founders took the decision to &#8220;hibernate&#8221; the nascent business after the first lockdown and with the pandemic taking hold. But, now with regulatory approval from the FCA and rents falling in London, the startup is officially opening.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had a lot of great momentum and then when lockdown came it was like getting headshot from across the map,&#8221; Fronted co-founder and CEO Jamie Campbell tells me. &#8220;It was when we heard that people weren&#8217;t able to move [that] we knew it would be impossible to find early testers for the product and that is when we decided to look at different options. We knew lockdown would delay launching and the furlough scheme gave us options and time. In the end, it was an easy decision and, looking back, it was the right one&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by Campbell, Simon Vans-Colina and Anthony Mann — former employees at Bud, Monzo and Apple, respectively — and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/passion-capital-has-backed-fronted/">backed by Passion Capital</a>, Fronted is using open banking and other financial technology to offer a credit product designed to finance deposits directly. The pitch is that Fronted can lend more cheaply than existing options, such as credit cards, pay-day lenders and overdrafts, or insurance-backed membership schemes. And, crucially, at lower risk.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Passion Capital has backed Fronted, the startup that wants to offer loans to cover rent deposits&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/passion-capital-has-backed-fronted/embed/#?secret=JW61pl2sec" data-secret="JW61pl2sec" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Renting sucks — anyone who rents knows it,” Campbell <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/03/fronted/">told me last year</a>. “There are so many problems to solve and we intend to tackle them all bit by bit. But first, we are going to pay people’s rent deposits for them so they can pay us back in bite-size manageable amounts&#8221;.</p>
<p>To be able to apply for a Fronted rental deposit loan, you&#8217;ll need to be U.K. citizen, have a bank account with more than six months of transaction data and minimum income of £12,000. You are then asked to securely link your bank account data to Fronted via open banking, in order to assess your affordability beyond a simple credit score.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe [this] is a fairer way to determine whether or not someone qualifies for a deposit from us,&#8221; explains Campbell. &#8220;We are confident we are launching with a fair approach. We don&#8217;t, for instance, turn people away who are on benefits or furloughed&#8221;.</p>
<p>Fronted loans last 12 months and carry a 12.5% interest rate. However, there are no early repayment fees. Once a loan is agreed, the startup sends the money directly to the estate agent to be placed in the U.K.’s Deposit Protection Scheme, meaning that the loan never touches the renter’s hands (or wallet).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the timing looks good. Fronted says that 60% of all renters have no savings and are therefore not in a great position to move. Meanwhile, rents are falling as much as 12% in London, meaning that renters could save huge amounts of money simply by moving.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deposits are a huge impediment to social mobility; the amount of people who don’t move because they don’t have the money on hand is staggering,&#8221; adds the Fronted CEO, noting customers don&#8217;t just include those that have already found a place, but also those who are still looking.</p>
<p>&#8220;People who haven&#8217;t found a place, they are coming to us to see what deposit they could get and then going to find a property&#8230; For those people, we give them a maximum which is valid for 30 days so they can shop around knowing they have Fronted in their back pocket&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many countries hit hard by Covid-19 are beginning to see a glimmer of optimism from the arrival of vaccinations. Now, a promising travel startup that saw its growth arrested by the arrival and persistence of the pandemic is announcing a $97 million financing facility to help it stay the course until it can finally resume normal business.</p>
<p><a href="http://getyourguide.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GetYourGuide</a>, the Berlin startup that curates, organizes and lets travelers and others book tours and other experiences, has secured a revolving credit facility of €80 million ($97 million at current rates). The financing is being led by UniCredit, with CitiGroup, Silicon Valley Bank, Deutsche Bank and KfW also participating.</p>
<p>CFO Nils Chrestin said in an interview that the funding will let GetYourGuide come &#8220;sprinting out of the gates&#8221; when consumers are in a better position to enjoy travel experiences again.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;">The capital could be used potentially for normal business expenses, for acquisitions or investments, or other strategic initiatives, such as more investment into the company&#8217;s in-house Originals tour operations or new services to book last-minute experiences, he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: -0.1px; font-size: 1.125rem;">And even if a lot of tourism has really slowed down, there are still people taking short-distance trips or buying activities in the cities where they live (and are not leaving). While some metro areas like London are essentially only open for booking well in advance (when the hope is lockdown restrictions might be eased), other cities like Rome or Amsterdam have activities available for booking today.</span></p>
<p>GetYourGuide&#8217;s latest financing news underscores how some startups &#8212; specifically those whose business models have <em>not</em> lended themselves well to pandemic living &#8212; are getting more creative with their approaches to staying afloat.</p>
<p>GetYourGuide has raised more than $600 million in equity capital since 2009, with its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/16/getyourguide-picks-up-484m-passes-25m-tickets-sold-through-its-tourism-activity-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series E of $484 million in 2019</a> (before the pandemic) valuing it at well over $1 billion.</p>
<p>But more recently, the startup backed by the likes of SoftBank, Temasek, Lakestar, and others has been shoring up its position with alternative forms of finance.</p>
<p>In October, GetYourGuide closed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/getyourguide-closes-133m-convertible-note-as-travel-startups-continue-to-weather-the-covid-19-storm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convertible note of $133 million</a>. While it has yet to raise the equity round that would covert that note &#8212; it could be up to 18 months before another equity round is closed, CEO and co-founder Johannes Reck told me at the time &#8212; this latest revolving debt facility is giving the startup another efficient route to accessing money.</p>
<p>Unlike equity rounds (or notes that can convert into equity), revolving debt facilities are non-dilutive, flexible lines of credit, where companies can quickly draw down funds as needed up to the full value of the facility. After repaying with interest, they can re-draw up to the same limit again.</p>
<p>In that regard, revolving debt facilities are not unlike credit cards for consumers, and similarly, they are a sign of how banks rate GetYourGuide, and perhaps the travel industry more generally, as strong candidates for paying back, and eventually bouncing back.</p>
<p>“We are very happy to help GetYourGuide continue its growth trajectory during this extraordinary situation that we find ourselves in”, says Jan Kupfer, head of corporate and investment banking, Germany, at UniCredit, in a statement. “The successful financing also shows once again our unique tech advisory approach, where we combine our deep tech expertise with the broad product range of a pan-European commercial bank.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Extraordinary situation&#8221; is perhaps an understatement for the rough year that travel businesses have had.</p>
<p>There do remain parts of the industry that have yet to make the leap to digital platforms &#8212; experiences, the focus of GetYourGuide, is very much one of them &#8212; and that makes for very interesting and potentially big businesses.</p>
<p>But between government-imposed travel restrictions, and people reluctant to venture far, or mix and mingle with others, startups like GetYourGuide have essentially found themselves treading water until things get moving again.</p>
<p>Last October, GetYourGuide said it had passed 45 million ticket sales in aggregate on its platform, but that figure was only up by 5 million in 10 months. As we pointed out at the time, that speaks both to a major slowdown in growth and to the struggles that companies like it are facing, and it is very likely far from the projections the startup had originally made for its expansion before the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the only one: <a href="http://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/covid-19-and-the-aviation-industry-impact-and-policy-responses-26d521c1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">air travel</a>, <a href="https://www.pwc.co.uk/press-room/press-releases/pwc-hotels-forecast--covid-19-pandemic-prompts-most-volatile-out.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hotels</a>, and other sectors that fall into the travel and tourism industries have largely been stagnating or in freefall or decline this year. Many believe that those who will be left standing after all of this will have to collectively brace themselves for potentially years of financial turmoil to come back from it.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Airbnb presents an alternative reality, at least for the moment. It appears to have <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ABNB?p=ABNB&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">captured investors&#8217; attention</a> and since going public in December has been on a steady upswing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2021/02/15/why-airbnb-stocks-rally-isnt-justified/?sh=290112291f32" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Analysts</a> may say that there hasn&#8217;t been a lot of news coming out about the company to merit that rise, but one explanation has been that the optimism has more to do with its longer-term potential and for how tech-savvy routes to filling travel needs will indeed be the services that people will use before the rest.</p>
<p>That could be part of the pitch for GetYouGuide, too. Chrestin said that the company believes that travel in the U.S. market, a key region for the startup, is looking like it might rebound in Q2 or Q3. Yet even if it doesn&#8217;t, the company has the runway to wait longer.</p>
<p class="p1">Chrestin noted that GetYourGuide has &#8220;reinvented internal processes&#8221; and is operating much more efficiently now. &#8220;If it weren’t for the global hardship this crisis is causing, we would look back and say it was quite transformational,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;The company is very well capitalized and fully funded to profitability. Even if the current travel volume stayed like this for three years, we would not run out of capital,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;We have sufficient capital even for that scenario, but we don’t think that will happen.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="" data-block="true" data-editor="7to42" data-offset-key="cov6h-0-0">
<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://en.uncoveredfund.com/">Uncovered Fund</a>, a VC firm targeting early-stage startups in Africa, announced today that it has launched its $15 million fund which is expected to close at the end of June this year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Tokyo-based outfit founded by <a href="https://jp.linkedin.com/in/takuma-terakubo-5a53281a1">Takuma Terakubo</a> in 2019 will invest $50,000 to $500,000 in African startups in seed and Series A stages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Uncovered Fund, Terakubo was the CEO of Leapfrog Ventures. Together with Japanese startup incubator, Samurai Incubate, they launched <a href="https://samurai-incubate-africa.asia/#:~:text=Samurai%20Incubate%20Africa%20supports%20growth,innovation%20on%20the%20African%20continent.">Samurai Incubate Fund</a>; a fund focused on early-stage African startups. During his time there, the firm raised more than $4.5 million targeted at startups in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, South Africa, Ghana and Nigeria. It also financed over 10 startups with checks similar to Uncovered Fund&#8217;s ($50,000 to $500,000).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terakubo doesn&#8217;t say why he left Samurai Incubate Fund. But according to him, Uncovered Fund&#8217;s investment methodology is different from his previous firm because it doesn&#8217;t bring only money to the table.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We do not make scattered, one-shot, small investments, but rather we provide long-term growth support, including follow-on investment. In addition, we not only invest, but we also multiply the huge assets of Japanese companies to grow the business and provide technical support and finance as well,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per who these corporations are, Terakubo isn’t disclosing names just yet but says he hopes to do so in the coming months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uncovered Fund focuses on startups based in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa playing in retail, fintech, healthtech, logistics, MaaS, agritech, and smart city sectors. The general partner says the firm invests in these sectors because &#8220;they are basic behaviors in people&#8217;s lives, and we believe it is important to improve convenience as quickly as possible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, it has backed five startups across these sectors and markets. They include Kenyan e-commerce platform, <a href="https://sky.garden/home">Sky Garden</a>; US-based and Africa-focused healthtech startup <a href="https://rxalldelivered.com/home">RxAll</a>; Francophone Africa mobility startup, <a href="https://gozem.co/en/">Gozem</a>; Kenyan fintech company <a href="https://lipalater.com/">LipaLater</a>; and YC-backed Nigerian digital freight startup, <a href="https://www.send.ng/">SEND Technologies</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of these companies are doing business in other countries, and Terakubo says that the firm is willing to fund startups in other African countries as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are looking for African startups to expand their business across multiple countries. So, we welcome startups from any country as long as the business can scale.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uncovered Fund joins other Asian early-stage VC firms like <a href="http://www.fhub.io/">Future Hub</a>, <a href="https://kepple-africa-ventures.com/home_eng">Kepple Africa</a>, and recently launched <a href="https://www.sherpa.africa/">Sherpa Ventures</a> who have launched within the past four years and funded over 50 African startups during that period. Terakubo says his VC firm hopes to increase this number by backing 15 startups this year and further the synergy between African founders and Asian investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are looking into joint development from Africa to Asian markets, and that is the big vision we have for the future,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As a VC and also an entrepreneur, I&#8217;m looking forward to the challenge of working with African entrepreneurs to create that future.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">From the chemical refineries that line the Gulf Coast to oilfields of West Texas, heavy industry has always been a big part of the economy in the Lone Star State.</p>
<p>Now, as venture capital moves in to the state as part of an exodus from California, a new fund is combining Texas&#8217; industrial past with its high technology future.</p>
<p>That fund is Ironspring Ventures, which has closed its first investment vehicle with $61 million nearly two years after it launched its fundraising efforts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The fruit of a partnership between Adam Bridgman and Peter J. Holt, the co-founders of an earlier investment vehicle called Holt Ventures, and Ty Findley, a former investor at G.E. Ventures and the Pritzker Group, the firm&#8217;s mission is to &#8220;accelerate digital adoption across legacy heavy industries,&#8221; according to Bridgman.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each member of the Ironspring team has a long history with industrial technologies and deep roots in the Texas economy. Findley, a managing partner, grew up &#8220;in the middle of nowhere in East Texas&#8221; but comes from a family of entrepreneurs who built businesses along the Texas and Louisiana border. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;I joined up with our other co-founder and managing partner, Peter Holt,&#8221; said Bridgman. &#8220;That was really step one for us pursuing this broader mission of investing in legacy industry at the early stage of digital innovation. We were fortunate to find a strong cultural alignment and rare experience with Ty [Findley]. After co-investing over a period of time we got to know each other very well. We joined forces and it&#8217;s been a nice journey over the last year-and-a-half of formally launching and formally closing the fund in December.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first deal that the three men invested in together was <a href="https://www.augmentir.com/">Augmentir</a>, a service providing information and support for remote workers. &#8220;Everything comes back to these words &#8216;digital industrial&#8217; for us,&#8221; said Findley. &#8220;There&#8217;s this massive gap where people forget that almost the majority of GDP in this country is manufacturing.&#8221;</p>
<p>So far, Ironspring has invested in four portfolio companies, Mercado, which is developing a service to improve the import process; Icon Build, a company developing 3-D printing tools and technologies for the building industry;  FastRadius, which brings design tools and services for prototyping and industrial design; and GoContractor, a safety and compliance management service.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s average check size is around $2.5 million and investments will range from $1 million on the low end to $4 million on the high end, according to the firm&#8217;s partners. That means looking for what the firm called &#8220;post-seed&#8221; deals.</p>
<p>And the firm is looking for technology that is transforming how businesses design products, build them, and provide services and operate across the wide range of industrial output.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to organize around those themes,&#8221; said Bridgman. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Parler returns from limbo, Uber lobbies Europe and we have more details about Notion&#8217;s outage. This is your Daily Crunch for February 15, 2021.</p>
<p><strong>The big story: Parler is back online</strong></p>
<p>The social network known for its far-right user base was dropped by infrastructure provider Amazon Web Services for posts advocating violence. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/parler-crawls-back-online-empty-and-with-a-tea-party-ceo/">Now it&#8217;s back online</a>, albeit with all old posts and content removed for reasons that are currently unclear.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company says the new site is built with “sustainable, independent technology and not reliant on so-called ‘Big Tech’ for its operations.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to a new website, Parler also has a new chief executive. Following the ouster of John Matze, Parler is now led by interim CEO Mark Meckler, founder of the Tea Party Patriots — one of the groups involved in organizing the January 6 pro-Trump demonstration that turned into a storming of the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p><strong>The tech giants</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/uber-lobbies-for-prop-22-style-gig-work-standards-in-the-eu/">Uber lobbies for ‘Prop 22’-style gig work standards in the EU</a> — The ride-hailing and on-demand food delivery giant has published a white paper in which it lobbies European policymakers for what it describes as a “new standard” for platform work.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/gm-unveils-a-refreshed-chevy-bolt-ev-and-its-bigger-yet-compact-crossover-sibling/">GM unveils a refreshed Chevy Bolt EV and its bigger, yet compact crossover sibling</a> — The new vehicles share much of the same DNA but have their own distinct differences.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">In an earlier article, I wrote about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/how-and-when-to-build-marketing-teams-at-deep-tech-companies/?tpcc=ECTW2020">how and when to build go-to-market teams at deep tech companies</a>. There, I noted that it is more important for growth hires at deep tech companies to have functional expertise than industry expertise.</p>
<p>But how do deep tech companies connect and cultivate strong relationships with talented nontechnical growth people outside of their industry? In this article, I answer this question, articulating exactly how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write role descriptions that entice talented growth people.</li>
<li>Create company marketing materials that brands your startup well to talent.</li>
<li>Craft thoughtful end-to-end candidate experiences for growth talent.</li>
<li>Close top growth candidates.</li>
</ul>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Incredible growth people are independent and creative and are drawn to environments that explicitly value these traits.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Write a job description that explains how you operate</h2>
<p><strong>Underscore the autonomy. </strong>Incredible growth people are independent and creative and are drawn to environments that explicitly value these traits. Growth talent wants to know that they have room to experiment, fail and iterate with the support and trust of their company. Highlight the creative agency you give to your growth team. Paint the role as one of managing a subset of the startup and its initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Show you are ready for a growth marketer.</strong> Do not expect your growth person to be a panacea for the company. Growth people work cross-functionally, but there are boundaries where the growth role starts and ends. Growth people cannot sell a product that is not ready. Growth people cannot fix product bugs. Growth people cannot replace excellent customer service. Ensure your role description is clear on what the growth person would do and what they would lean on other teams for. Demonstrate that you have a team structure in place where a growth marketer could fit in and thrive.</p>
<p><strong>Articulate your talent needs.</strong> Growth is a broad category. Some growth marketers are more creative. Others are more quantitative. Some have more industry experience. Others have more functional experience. Be clear on what type of growth marketer you need and how this person’s talents would complement those of the existing team.</p>
<h2>Use marketing to share your history and chart the future</h2>
<p><strong>Generate excitement and establish credibility. </strong>People can naturally be skeptical about new technologies and younger companies. Do anything you can to ameliorate these concerns. Link to relevant news articles from well-known publications and thought leaders in your industry. Incorporate customer testimonials that speak to the transformative impact your product creates. Name drop well-known advisors, investors and team members.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dick Costolo and Adam Bain, renowned early Twitter execs who served as the company&#8217;s CEO and its chief operating officer, respectively, have quietly closed a second venture fund just one-and-a-half years after disclosing they&#8217;d secured $135 million for a debut fund for their firm, <a href="https://01a.com/">01 Advisors</a>.</p>
<p>According to an<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1841862/000184186221000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml"> SEC filing</a>, they wrapped up their second fund late last week with $325 million in capital commitments from 81 investors.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the firm and hope to share more soon. In the meantime, its strategy appears to center around more concentrated bets in both the consumer and enterprise spheres &#8212; with checks going out both early and sometimes later in a startup&#8217;s trajectory.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Among these recipients is <a href="https://literati.com/">Literati</a>, a nearly five-year-old, Austin, Texas-based book club subscription service that raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/literati-raises-40m-for-its-book-club-platform/">$40 million</a> in Series B funding in January led by Felicis Ventures; <a href="https://tipalti.com/">Tipalti</a>, a 10-year-old, Israel-based company that develops automation software for global payments and raised $150 million in Series E funding at a <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3854791,00.html">$2 billion valuation</a> back in October (01 Advisors joined as a follow-on investor); and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/spoton">SpotOn Transact</a>, a payments software startup that raised <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/spoton-raises-50m-to-help-smbs-operate-more-efficiently/">$50 million</a> in Series B funding last year led by 01 Advisors. (Worth noting: the company raised a $60 million <a href="https://finledger.com/2020/09/23/payments-software-startup-spoton-raises-60-million-to-help-smbs/">Series C round</a> just six months later. DST Global led that next round, with participation from 01 Advisors and others.)</p>

<p>In fact, numerous of the outfit&#8217;s investments have hit the gas during the pandemic, including the San Francisco-based mental health and wellness platform <a href="https://www.modernhealth.com/">Modern Health</a>, which last week announced <a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/modern-health-raises-another-74m-meet-employers-demand-mental-health-benefits">$74 million</a> in Series D funding just a few months after announcing a $51 million Series C funding. The startup, reportedly now valued at $1.17 billion, has raised roughly $170 million to date; 01 Advisors has joined the last two rounds.</p>
<p>01 Advisors has itself largely remained the same size since it publicly launched in August 2019, years after Costolo and Bain began investing in startups on an individual and joint basis.</p>
<p>In addition to Costolo and Bain and Dave Rivinus, who spent four years in corporate development and finance at Twitter and is also a founding partner of the firm, Kelly Kovacs is a partner at the firm. Kovacs was Costolo&#8217;s chief of staff at Twitter before joining Color Genomics in a similar capacity, then founding her own startup meant to empower executive assistants. She joined 01 Advisors full time in 2018.</p>
<p>Lacey Behrens has meanwhile the firm&#8217;s operations manager since 2019.</p>
<p>01 Advisors also recently listed a position for a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2402733898/?refId=mQHT%2BbwWSZKMXf4ODhRcqw%3D%3D">senior associate</a>.</p>
<p>Costolo, who great up in Troy, Michigan, found himself in the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2020/10/01/some-business-leader-should-face-a-firing-squad-former-twitter-ceo-dick-costolo-suggests-in-angry-tweet/?sh=4f51d65d7b94">headlines</a> in October when he fired off an incendiary tweet about the decision of Coinbase founder and CEO Brian Armstrong to publicly discourage employee activism and political discussions at work, a stance that drove <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/brian-armstrongs-new-problem-60-plus/">at least 60 employees</a> to take a severance package offered to them afterward.</p>
<p>While some business leaders were quick to praise Armstrong, Costolo wasn&#8217;t shy about hiding his disgust over Armstrong&#8217;s position. “Me-first capitalists who think you can separate society from business are going to be the first people lined up against the wall and shot in the revolution,” he tweeted. “I&#8217;ll happily provide video commentary.”</p>
<p>Bain, a long-suffering-yet-<a href="https://dawgpounddaily.com/2021/02/14/cleveland-browns-dark-horse-super-bowl-contender/">cautiously-optimistic</a> Browns fan, has meanwhile been busy, too. In addition to scouting for startups, he now sits on the public company boards of both the real estate tech outfit Opendoor and the space tourism company Virgin Galactic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.naturesfynd.com/">Nature’s Fynd</a>, the food technology company with a new food offering cultivated from fungus found in the wilds of Yellowstone National Park, is releasing its first products for pre-order. </span></p>
<p>Pitching both a non-dairy cream cheese and meatless breakfast patties, Nature&#8217;s Fynd had managed to attract some serious investors, including Al Gore&#8217;s Generation Investment Management and the Bill Gates-backed investment fund, Breakthrough Energy Ventures. The company most recently<a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/natures-fynd-raises-80m-series-b-for-alternative-protein/"> raised $80 million in its last round of funding</a>.</p>
<p>The company is<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/20/from-lab-grown-meat-to-fermented-fungus-heres-what-corporate-food-vcs-are-serving-up/"> part of a wave of innovative products</a> using a range of bacteria, fungi and plants to create meat alternatives. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/17/alternative-protein-companies-have-raised-a-whopping-1-5-billion-through-july-of-this-year/">companies developing meat alternatives raised well over $1 billion in financing</a> and investors show no sign of slowing down in their commitments to the industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The commercial launch of the Fy Breakfast Bundle, vegan and non-GMO alternatives to traditional breakfast products, will be the first commercial test for Nature&#8217;s Fynd as it looks to go to market.</p>
<p>These limited release bundles are available for $14.99 plus shipping, according to the company, and the products will be available across the 48 contiguous U.S. states.</p>

<p>The company&#8217;s product is grown using fermentation technology to cultivate the bacteria that Nature&#8217;s Fynd&#8217;s chief scientists discovered during their research into organisms around Yellowstone National Park.</p>
<p>Nature&#8217;s Fynd touts the resilience and efficiency of the microbe it discovered, leading to a more sustainable production process that uses a fraction of the land, water and energy resources that traditional animal husbandry requires, the company said.</p>

Using our novel liquid-air surface fermentation technology, we&#8217;re creating a range of sustainable foods that nourish our bodies and nurture our planet for generations to come. We&#8217;re really excited to be at the beginning of this journey with the launch of our first-ever limited release of Fy Breakfast Bundles,” said Nature’s Fynd CEO Thomas Jonas. “We’ve deeply studied our consumers and we know that Fy’s unique versatility, which delivers great tasting meat and dairy alternatives for every occasion, is highly appealing.” </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[An increasing number of higher education institutions are investing in entrepreneurial pipelines that help students launch startups after graduation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, 15 top U.S. universities joined forces to launch a one-stop shop where corporations and startups can discover and license patents.</p>
<p>Working in concert, Brown, Caltech, Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, the University of Illinois, Michigan, Northwestern, Penn, Princeton, SUNY Binghamton, UC Berkeley, UCLA, the University of Southern California and Yale formed The University Technology Licensing Program LLC (UTLP)  to create a centralized pool of licensable IP.</p>
<p>The UTLP arrives as more higher education institutions are beefing up their investment in the entrepreneurial pipeline to help more students launch startups after graduation. In some instances, schools serve as accelerators, providing students with resources and helping them connect with VCs to find seed funding.</p>
<p>To get a better look at the new program and more insight into the university-to-startup pipeline, we spoke to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jennifer Dyer, executive director, <a href="https://stevens.usc.edu/jennifer-dyer/">USC Stevens Center for Innovation</a></li>
<li>Orin Herskowitz, senior vice president of Intellectual Property and Tech Transfer, <a href="https://techventures.columbia.edu/orin-herskowitz">Columbia University</a></li>
<li>Marc De Leeuw, partner, <a href="https://www.sullcrom.com/lawyers/Marc-DeLeeuw">Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><strong>The UTLP initiative seems to be more focused on licensing IP to existing companies, rather than accelerating university startups.</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Orin Herskowitz:</strong> The UTLP effort is really much more about licensing to the somewhat broken interface between universities and very large companies in the tech space when it comes to licensing intellectual property. But I know USC and Columbia and many of our peers, especially over the last three to seven years, have pivoted in a massive way to helping our faculty students fulfill their entrepreneurial dreams and launch startups around this exciting university technology.</p>
<h2><strong>The word “broken” jumped out at me. Historically, what has the problem been?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Orin Herskowitz:</strong> Universities have traditionally been a source of amazing, life-saving and life-improving inventions, for decades. There&#8217;s been a ton of new drugs and medical devices, cybersecurity improvements, and search engines, like Google, that have come out of universities over the years, that were federally funded and developed in the labs, and then licensed to either a startup or the industry. And that&#8217;s been great. At least over the last couple of decades, that interface has worked really, really well in some fields, but less well in others. So, in the life sciences, in energy, in advanced materials, in those industries, a lot of the time, these innovations that end up having a huge impact on society are based really on one or two or three core eureka moments. There&#8217;s like one or two patents that underlie an enormous new cancer drug, for instance.</p>
<p>In the tech space though, it&#8217;s a very different dynamic because, a lot of the time, these inventions are incredibly important and they do launch a whole new generation of products and services, but the problem is that a new device, like an iPhone, or a piece of software, might rely on dozens or even hundreds of innovations from across many different universities, as opposed to just one or two.</p>
<h2><strong>Obviously not every breakthrough necessitates the launch of a startup. I assume that the vast majority of these things that are coming would make the most sense to work with existing companies.</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Jennifer Dyer:</strong> We&#8217;ve all had this renewed focus on innovation within the university and really helping our students and faculty that want to start companies, launch those companies. If you look at the space, helping educate our students that launching a company in a high-tech space may mean that they have to go out and acquire 100 different licenses, so maybe it doesn&#8217;t make sense. We&#8217;re going to be doing nonexclusive licensing, and it doesn&#8217;t preclude anyone from moving forward with this technology. This is probably the first pool for nonstandard essential patents in the high-tech space, which makes it somewhat unique. Because if you look back, most of the pools have been around standard essential patents.</p>
<h2><strong>The question of exclusivity is an interesting one. You wouldn’t grant exclusive rights for the right fee?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.trafi.com/">Trafi</a>, the Lithuanian startup that created a platform that lets users plan, book and pay for various modes of transportation within a city, is expanding beyond the European market where it got its start to tackle one of the most congested urban areas in the world.</p>
<p>The company said it has reached an agreement to provide its mobility-as-a-service platform in Bogota, Colombia.</p>
<p>Trafi&#8217;s platform is a white label product. But underneath the name — whether it&#8217;s Yuomov in Zurich, Jelbi in Berlin or MVG in Munich — is the same underlying technology. The company, which operates in seven European cities, is able to capture transportation data to provide real-time route planning for users. It also handles the payment system, which helps it stand apart from some of its competitors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Trafi doesn&#8217;t just work with cities, however. The company&#8217;s tech is also used by Google, Lyft and Gojek — to name a few.</p>
<p>In Bogota, the platform will pull together all the forms of public transit, including buses and trams, as well as local taxis and e-bikes. Users can use the single-payment system to book and pay for the various modes of transportation. The app includes real-time departure information, a &#8220;nearby function&#8221; that will show the user all mobility options available within their location and &#8220;intermodal routing,&#8221; which proposes combinations of up to three different modes such as taking an e-bike to the bus stop.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2112601" style="width: 3010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/trafi.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2112601" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2112601 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/trafi.jpg" alt="Trafi" width="3000" height="2000" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/trafi.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/trafi.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/trafi.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/trafi.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/trafi.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/trafi.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/trafi.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/trafi.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2112601" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Trafi</p></div></p>
<p>Bogota is just the start. Trafi co-founder and CEO Martynas Gudonavičius told TechCrunch that the company plans to expand to other LatAm cities. The company will target capital cities in other LatAm countries first, places like São Paulo in Brazil. Gudonavičius said Trafi will seek out contracts with smaller and medium-sized cities in the region as well. Any city with digital ticketing and various modes of transportation, including scooter and bicycles, buses and ride-hailing, is a good fit for the company, he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Latin America is a superb example where mobility-as-a-service can really strive,&#8221; Gudonavičius said. &#8220;This is why we&#8217;re in Bogota, it&#8217;s this young, dynamic, fast-growing population. And we are here to help them do the big transition from transportation patterns and behavior they have at the moment, to a mobility-as-a service concept.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trafi is hiring for a director in the region and plans to hire more people in all departments this year. It&#8217;s also eyeing an expansion into Asia in the second half of 2021. Gudonavičius wouldn&#8217;t provide specific details, but said the company had a short list of cities it wanted to enter. He specifically noted that Trafi planned to expand to a city in Japan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chalk one up for <a href="https://jigsaw.co">Jigsaw</a>, an &#8220;anti-superficial&#8221; dating app that has scored £2.7 million ($3.7 million) in seed funding to put toward U.S. expansion. The round is led by a lead generation company for online dating companies, called The Relationship Corp., with backing from angel investors in the U.S. and U.K. &#8220;primarily&#8221; in the tech sector.</p>
<p>As the startup&#8217;s name suggests, Jigsaw adds a little cryptic fun to the transactional business of swiping photos of other singles in search of dating chemistry in a bid to offer a less superficial experience.</p>
<p>Albeit their (patented) anti-superficial twist looks a tad gimmicky at first blush: They literally superimpose a digital jigsaw over the faces of users, with pieces removed gradually the more you interact &#8212; and the f<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ull face only revealed after a pre-set amount of in-app engagement. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Digital filters are also banned, per the app&#8217;s <a href="https://jigsaw.co/faq/topics#?category=account-and-settings&amp;question=XtpCCRAAACEAXF1W&amp;topic=support">FAQ</a>; they only want &#8220;real&#8221; selfies. So no cute cat ears, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">They&#8217;ve got a few more tricks up their sleeve but don&#8217;t want to offer a public reveal of the planned features we guessed were coming just yet (but, well, a quick glance at the app and it&#8217;s basically a half finished jigsaw puzzle of their product roadmap).</span></p>
<p>The U.K. startup &#8212; which was founded back in 2016 by a couple of friends, Alex Durrant (co-founder and CEO) and Max Adamski (co-founder and CPO), when they were at university (and finding the dating app scene frustratingly superficial, as they tell it, going on to quit their jobs and go all in on the project in 2018) &#8212; launched its puzzle-faced dating experience in London in 2019; and opened up to the U.S. in November last year.</p>
<p>Jigsaw has some 150,000+ registered users across those two markets at this point, with 50,000 in the U.S. &#8212; and an appetite to step things up over the pond now that they&#8217;re flush with new funds.</p>
<p>Durrant says the team is hoping to hit half a million U.S. users in the next six months. They reckon there&#8217;s a trend toward less superficial swiping in the American dating app scene that Jigsaw is well-positioned to tap into.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not insane and think people look better with puzzles over their faces, I promise, the puzzle is our middle finger to the superficial dating industry,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It exists as you say to encourage more meaningful/sustained interactions and to help users look beyond the looks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently, Jigsaw&#8217;s face-shielding mechanism involves a puzzle made up of 16 pieces. All photos start with one piece removed &#8220;so you get a sneak peek&#8221;. Another then comes off when a user likes (matches with) the person so at the start of chatting there are two pieces revealed.</p>
<p>More pieces are removed as the pair mutually exchange messages until there&#8217;s no more puzzle bits left. Hopefully you also won&#8217;t run out of conversation at that point.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over six messages each (12 in total) is what we believe is the minimum needed for a meaningful conversation,&#8221; says Durrant. &#8220;That’s why the jigsaw puzzle currently unveils fully after seven messages are exchanged (14 pieces revealed in total), revealing the face underneath. This number has been tested and this is the current sweet spot for our users.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jigsaw isn&#8217;t unique in the concept of shielding facial visuals to encourage dating app users to do more chatting and less mindless swiping. There are a whole bunch of &#8220;slower reveal&#8221; style twists aimed at reducing &#8220;dating app fatigue&#8221; &#8212; as another app, <a href="https://inyn.app">INYN</a>, which also limits the velocity of the profile reveal, puts it.</p>
<p>Another app which blurs users&#8217; photos until they do some chatting is <a href="http://taffy.chat">Taffy</a>. There&#8217;s also Muslim matchmaking app <a href="https://www.veil.mobi/">Veil</a> &#8212; which offers a “digital veil” feature (aka an opaque filter) that it applies to all profile photos, male and female, until a mutual match is made.</p>
<p>Other &#8220;anti-superficial&#8221; dating apps, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/11/meet-willow-the-dating-app-where-love-isnt-based-on-lust/">Willow</a>, try a Q&amp;A style approach &#8212; getting users to answer questions to see more photos. The list goes on.</p>
<p>Still, Jigsaw has come up with perhaps the most visually obvious (and gamified) twist on this slow-reveal format. And being so immediately, well, obvious, it might make its &#8220;slow reveal&#8221; twist stick for longer than the average &#8220;love is blind&#8221; alternative dating app.</p>
<p>Its seed investment is not about buying users, either. We made sure to check.</p>
<p>The Relationship Corp. does offer user acquisition/traffic generation services to dating apps &#8212; including those it invests in &#8212; but in Jigsaw&#8217;s case the investment is a straight equity investment, per Durrant. So it&#8217;s at least sounding confident in its ability to grow.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re super low-key but are known in the industry,&#8221; says Durrant of the lead seed investor. &#8220;Steve Happas their CEO is ex-Match and&#8230; sits on our advisory board [as part of the investment]. We had an option to work with them to acquire users but instead, they are supporting our internal team in an advisory capacity.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Parler, a social network adopted by the far right and recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/parler-is-officially-offline-after-aws-suspension/">kicked off AWS</a> for its userbase&#8217;s habit of advocating violence, is back online. The restoration questions the notion that &#8220;big tech&#8221; can take and keep an unwanted presence offline, but Parler&#8217;s return is not quite a triumph, and its new CEO doesn&#8217;t suggest much of a change in philosophy.</p>
<p>Users can now log in to Parler on the web, but when they do they will find that all their old posts and content have been removed. It&#8217;s unclear whether this was a consequence of the hurried exit from AWS last month, a scorched-earth policy regarding the content that got the site in hot water in the first place or for some other reason.</p>
<p>Fortunately <em>someone </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/scraped-parler-data-is-a-metadata-goldmine/">had the presence of mind to make a backup</a>, though not with the intention of restoring it. <a href="https://twitter.com/donk_enby">@donk_enby</a> scraped millions of posts and media files from the site for posterity, something that has already borne fruit as researchers have used the files to show, for example, where certain users were on the day of the Capitol riots. (She is currently pointing out various problems with the new Parler&#8217;s web rollout.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new site is described in a statement as using &#8220;sustainable, independent technology and not reliant on so-called &#8216;Big Tech&#8217; for its operations.&#8221; The new host is SkySilk, seemingly a reseller of OVHcloud, and I&#8217;ve asked if the company plans to enforce its <a href="https://www.skysilk.com/terms/">terms</a>, which generally but not specifically prohibit things like threats of violence.

<p>Update: SkySilk has issued a statement explaining that it is hosting Parler because of its position on free speech, which reads in part:</p>
<blockquote><p>Skysilk does not advocate nor condone hate, rather, it advocates the right to private judgment and rejects the role of being the judge, jury, and executioner. Unfortunately, too many of our fellow technology providers seem to differ in their position on this subject.</p>
<p>SkySilk truly believes and supports the freedom of speech and more specifically the rights afforded to us in the First Amendment. This is a non-negotiable issue for us. And while we may disagree with some of the sentiment found on the Parler platform, we cannot allow first amendment rights to be hampered or restricted by anyone or any organization.</p>
<p>SkySilk will support Parler in their efforts to be a nonpartisan Public Square as we are convinced this is the only appropriate course of action.</p></blockquote>
<p>Parler, for its part, aims to make itself a bit less of an easy target by upping its moderation game. The site will supposedly be using both AI and human moderators to watch for content that could rock the boat — though Facebook has been trying this for years and still hasn&#8217;t quite got the hang of it.</p>
<p>They may have an easier job of it, considering Parler is still <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/">barred from the Google Play Store and iOS App Store</a>. That&#8217;s a huge damper on activity, since mobile users make up a large part of social networks. So the flood of content the site could not adequately monitor in early January may have slowed to a trickle. (I&#8217;ve asked the company for more information on this and other matters and will update this post if I hear back.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the operation is being overseen by a new interim CEO after the ouster of John Matze by the board. The one to fill the role is Mark Meckler, founder of the Tea Party Patriots, staunch opponents of Obamacare and big fans of debunked COVID-19 treatment hydroxychloroquine. The group was also behind the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/twitter-donald-trump-jr-frontline-doctors-viral-video-misinformation/">infamous &#8220;America&#8217;s Frontline Doctors&#8221;</a> event and was one of the organizers of the March to Save America that turned into the Capitol Riots.</p>
<p>Meckler&#8217;s pedigree suggests that despite the claimed moderation improvements, this is hardly Parler turning a new leaf, and SkySilk may be disappointed that its &#8220;nonpartisan public square&#8221; will be led by a hyperpartisan conservative activist (and is funded and populated by same). With the deliberate (and apparently unavoidable) break with &#8220;Big Tech,&#8221; however it is defined, and a CEO who embodies the same qualities that ran amok before, it seems a lot more like stubborn defiance than introspection and graceful compromise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GoPuff, the U.S.-based startup that operates its own &#8220;microfulfillment&#8221; network and promises to deliver items such as over-the-counter medicine, baby food and alcohol in 30 minutes or less, is in talks to acquire the U.K.&#8217;s <a href="https://www.fancyapp.live/">Fancy Delivery</a>, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>According to sources, terms of the acquisition are still being fleshed out, and the deal has yet to get over the line. However, an announcement could come in the next few weeks if not sooner. GoPuff declined to comment. Fancy&#8217;s founders couldn&#8217;t be reached before publication, either.</p>
<p>Launched late last year, Fancy currently operates in four cities in the U.K. and is a graduate of the Silicon Valley accelerator Y Combinator. It has a strikingly similar model to its potential buyer, leading some to describe it as a mini goPuff. The two companies are fully vertically integrated, meaning they each contract their own fleet of drivers and operate their own microfulfillment centres &#8212; sometimes dubbed &#8220;dark stores&#8221; &#8212; designed specifically for online ordering and hyperlocal delivery.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Strategically, the potential acquisition of Fancy looks to be a good fit, and most notably would signal goPuff&#8217;s intent to expand to the U.K. via purchasing a nascent local player rather than starting entirely from scratch. Sources tell me Fancy will continue to operate under the Fancy brand and that goPuff intends to invest in its growth, including hiring and opening additional fulfillment centers. One source tells TechCrunch the acquisition will be an all-stock deal.</p>
<p>GoPuff was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gopuff-funding/">recently valued at $3.9 billion</a> and has raised $1.35 billion in funding to-date (backers include Accel, D1 Capital Partners, Luxor Capital and SoftBank Vision Fund). It already operates in 500 U.S. cities, and isn&#8217;t shy of making acquisitions, either, most recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/gopuff-acquires-bevmo/">purchasing alcohol-focussed BevMo</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Europe is seeing a slew of startups inspired by goPuff&#8217;s vertically integrated model sprouting up. They include Berlin&#8217;s much-hyped <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/gorillas/">Gorillas</a> and London&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/dija/">Dija</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/">Weezy</a>, and France&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/cajoo-promises-grocery-deliveries-in-15-minutes/">Cajoo</a>, all of which claim to focus more on fresh food and groceries, where margins are arguably tighter. There&#8217;s also the likes of <a href="https://tryzapp.com/">Zapp</a>, which is still in stealth and more focused on a higher-margin convenience store offering.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s becoming harder for the U.S. to ignore the very real effects of global climate change &#8212; and despite the efforts of naysayers, it&#8217;s not a push to renewables that&#8217;s to blame for the outages sweeping the nation. It&#8217;s the country&#8217;s energy infrastructure.</p>
<p>Severe weather conditions caused by global warming have now caused massive blackouts across some of the largest cities in the United States. The inability of the U.S. power grid to withstand the stresses caused by extreme weather events shows that the nation needs a massive investment plan to upgrade energy infrastructure in an effort to make it more resilient.</p>
<p>These problems are now painfully apparent to the 29 million residents of Texas who are now subject to rolling blackouts caused by the frigid weather sweeping across the country.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Electric Reliability Council of Texas said it had &#8220;entered emergency conditions and initiated rotating outages at 1:25 a.m. today,&#8221; <a href="http://www.ercot.com/news/releases/show/225210">in a statement</a>. The Texas grid shed 10.5 gigawatts of load &#8212; or enough to power 2 million homes at its peak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Extreme weather conditions caused many generating units – across fuel types – to trip offline and become unavailable,&#8221; the energy provider said in a statement.</p>
<p>Part of the problem lies with natural gas generators that supply much of the power to the grid in Texas, according to Princeton professor Jesse Jenkins, who has a joint appointment in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and the Andlinger Center for Energy and Environment.</p>
<p>Citing a market participant, Jenkins <a href="https://twitter.com/JesseJenkins/status/1361348544154664961?s=20">noted on Twitter</a> that roughly 26 gigawatts of thermal energy is offline because natural gas is being diverted to provide heat instead of power. Only about 4 gigawatts of wind is offline because of icing, Jenkins noted.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Confidential info from a market participant in ERCOT: As of ~10 AM Eastern time, the system has ~30 GW of capacity offline, ~26 GW of thermal &#8212; mostly natural gas which cant get fuel deliveries which are being priorities for heating loads &#8212; and ~4 GW of wind due to icing. <a href="https://t.co/Bfpn0WeRIq">https://t.co/Bfpn0WeRIq</a></p>
<p>&mdash; JesseJenkins (@JesseJenkins) <a href="https://twitter.com/JesseJenkins/status/1361348544154664961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 15, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The current blackouts have nothing to do with renewables and everything to do with cold weather slowing down natural gas production because of freeze-offs and spiking demand for heating at the same time.</p>
<p>As Dr. Emily Grubert, an assistant professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering and, by courtesy, of Public Policy at the Georgia Institute of Technology, noted, the problem is more of a total systems issue than one associated with renewable power.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us be absolutely clear: if there are grid failures today, it shows the <em>existing</em> (largely fossil-based) system cannot handle these conditions either,&#8221; Grubert <a href="https://twitter.com/emilygrubert/status/1361011767439220748?s=20">wrote on Twitter</a>. &#8220;These are scary, climate change-affected conditions that pose extreme challenges to the grid. We are likely to continue to see situations like this where our existing system cannot easily handle them. <em>Any</em> electricity system needs to make massive adaptive improvements.&#8221;</p>
<p>Renewable energy and energy storage can potentially provide a solution to the problem and help contribute to a more resilient grid. Residential energy developer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/residential-renewable-energy-developer-swell-is-raising-450-million-for-distributed-power-projects-in-three-states/">Swell Energy raised $450 million</a> in financing late last year to begin development of several projects across three states that would pair distributed, residential solar energy generation with battery storage to create what are called virtual power plants that can ease stress on energy grids in times of increased demand.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Residential renewable energy developer Swell is raising $450 million for distributed power projects in three states&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/residential-renewable-energy-developer-swell-is-raising-450-million-for-distributed-power-projects-in-three-states/embed/#?secret=gy9WGHdfEZ" data-secret="gy9WGHdfEZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Utilities are increasingly looking to distributed energy resources as valuable ‘grid edge’ assets,” said Suleman Khan, CEO of Swell Energy, in a statement, at the time of the announcement. “By networking these individual homes and businesses into virtual power plants, Swell is able to bring down the cost of ownership for its customers and help utilities manage demand across their electric grids.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other companies, like <a href="https://www.evolvemyenergy.com/">Evolve Energy</a> or <a href="https://www.griddy.com/">Griddy</a>, try to help consumers manage costs by charging them wholesale rates for power. Those companies can only be economical when the rates for wholesale power are low. Right now, with demand for power skyrocketing, prices for energy in the ERCOT have surged above $5,000 per MW and hit the $9,000 cap in many nodes, according to Bloomberg Energy reporter Javier Bias.</p>
<p>The blackouts in Texas today and in California in January show that the current grid in the United States needs an overhaul. Whether it’s heavily regulated markets like California or a free market like Texas, current policy can&#8217;t stop the weather from wreaking havoc and putting people&#8217;s lives at risk.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.lengow.com">Lengow</a> has a new landlord as <a href="https://www.marlinequity.com">Marlin Equity Partners</a> has acquired a majority stake in the company. Lengow operates a software-as-a-service platform to optimize e-commerce listings. Terms of the deal are undisclosed.</p>
<p>In particular, many sellers now list their items on multiple e-commerce websites at once. For instance, a company could have its own e-commerce website and also sell products on Amazon, eBay, etc. And you may have noticed the same third-party sellers on different marketplaces.</p>
<p>Manually listing items across multiple e-commerce platforms would be extremely tedious. Behind the scenes, Lengow tries to automate as many steps as possible. First, you can import your products by connecting Lengow with your product information management system (PIM) or your e-commerce back end — it can run on Akeneo, Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You can then publish your products on multiple sales channels at once. It can be a marketplace, a price comparison website, a social network or an adtech platform. Examples include Amazon, Google Shopping, Criteo, Instagram, etc.</p>
<p>Lengow also helps you track orders, create rules when you’re running low on stock and manage your advertising strategy. Essentially, it’s the glue that makes all the moving parts of e-commerce stick together. There are 4,600 merchants using Lengow globally.</p>
<p>Marlin describes the deal as a growth investment. The firm plans to increase the value of Lengow in the coming years as it hasn’t reached its full potential yet. “We are looking forward to leveraging our operational and financial resources to support Lengow’s growth trajectory and continued international expansion,” Marlin principal Roland Pezzutto said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has agreed to pay a €1.1 million fine over misleading star ratings for hotels in France.</p>
<p>The tech giant had been applying its own (algorithmic) system of ratings for hotels applied via its search engine and on Google Maps. But back in 2019, following a number of complaints by hoteliers, the French national competition and consumer watchdog (DGCCRF) instigated an investigation into this propriety rating system.</p>
<p>The probe revealed that the tech giant had replaced the standard classification system of the public tourist board (Atout France) with a star rating system powered by its own criteria &#8212; and which it had applied to more than 7,500 establishments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Safe to say Google&#8217;s concept of a &#8220;five star&#8221; hotel was not the same as the Atout France version. And the consumer watchdog found that Google&#8217;s presentation for classifying tourist accommodation &#8212; including identical use of the term &#8220;stars&#8221; on the same scale from 1 to 5 &#8212; to be confusing for consumers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This practice was particularly damaging for consumers, misled about the level of services what they could expect when booking accommodation. It also resulted in prejudice for hoteliers whose establishments were wrongly presented as lower ranked than in the official ranking of Atout France,&#8221; the watchdog writes in a <a href="https://www.economie.gouv.fr/dgccrf/classement-trompeur-des-hebergements-touristiques-par-google-une-enquete-de-la-dgccrf-0">press release</a> on the sanction (which we&#8217;ve translated from French).</p>
<p>The DGCCRF concluded that Google had engaged in a deceptive business practice &#8212; and, with the public prosecutor, it proposed the sanction announced today on Google Ireland (the tech giant&#8217;s European HQ) and Google France.</p>
<p>As well as agreeing to pay the fine, Google has changed hotel star ratings in France &#8212; agreeing to display the official Atout France ratings. So tourists in France can be confident that a five-star hotel they see on Google Maps has an official standard attached to it which can&#8217;t be influenced by any of the usual online growth hacking tactics.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Google confirmed the conclusion of the DGCCRF&#8217;s action, telling TechCrunch: &#8220;We have now settled with the DGCCRF and made the necessary changes to only reflect the official French star rating for hotels on Google Maps and Search.”</p>
