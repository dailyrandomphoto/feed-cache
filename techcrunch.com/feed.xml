</div><p id="speakable-summary">Over the past year, Latin America has been covered heavily in the international news as the COVID-19 pandemic led many to question our endurance in the face of a crisis. But the region’s mega-fundraising rounds and shiny new unicorns have countered with optimism around its budding tech ecosystem.</p>
<p>When we first shared LatAm&#8217;s digital acceleration story in last year’s <a href="https://www.atlantico.vc/latin-america-digital-transformation-report">Latin America Digital Transformation Report</a>, we believed we were at the peak of digital growth catalyzed by the pandemic. E-commerce penetration was at an all-time high and the market cap of public technology companies was growing much faster than the region’s GDP. But with 2021 came all the second- and third-order effects of the crisis, further accelerating a continentwide tech expansion to a pace beyond any projections.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atlantico.vc/latin-america-digital-transformation-report-2021">In this year&#8217;s report</a>, we dedicate 200 slides of data-rich analysis, primary research, private company data and case studies to tell the story of this “second wave” of change we are witnessing. Ranging from the rapid adoption of sustainable technologies to the welcoming of a new local creator economy, we detail the surprising changes the pandemic has brought to consumer preferences, workplace dynamics, business models and the geopolitical influence on the fast-changing tech sector.</p>
<p>An initial top-down view paints a clear picture of a region at an inflection point. The Atlantico Digital Transformation Index, which measures tech penetration by tracking the value of public technology companies as a percentage of GDP, rose to 3.4% in 2021 from 2.3% in 2020 for LatAm as of August.</p>

<p>Similarly, based on an internal analysis of private company data, we estimate that the value of regional unicorns reached $105 billion, more than double last year’s figure of $46 billion. Eight new unicorns have already been minted this year, nearly reaching 2020’s rate by midyear.</p>

<p>Much has been written about Latin American fintechs, which last year drew 40% of the region’s venture capital investment. The revolution witnessed over the last five years, which produced the likes of Nubank (the world’s largest digital bank), was sparked by a mix of changing consumer demands, a concentrated banking sector and a pro-innovation regulatory environment. We are now seeing the second-order effects of the fintech boom, as the same set of conditions arise in other soon-to-be disrupted sectors.</p>
<p>In the insurance space, similar changes are giving way to innovative models like <a href="https://www.180s.com.br/">180<sup>o</sup></a> in Brazil and <a href="https://gobetterfly.com/en/">Betterfly</a> in Chile. The former, founded by prior Nubankers, takes embedded insurance to the max, pioneering an insurance-as-a-service model that enables any company to create bespoke insurance products for its customers and seamlessly integrate them into their core experience. In the case of Betterfly, we see the rise of a novel benefits platform that lets companies offer a life insurance product that rewards healthy habits and charitable donations.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We sat down with Canva co-founder Melanie Perkins at Disrupt 2021 to talk about how she has approached fundraising, and how she's managed to grow Canva's free and paid user base at a rapid clip.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Design software startup Canva has been making news of late. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/canva-raises-200-million-at-a-40-billion-valuation/">just raised $200 million at a $40 billion valuation</a>, and co-founders Melanie Perkins and Cliff Obrecht gave the vast majority of their equity (around $13 billion) to charity through the Canva Foundation.</p>
<p>We sat down with Perkins at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 to talk about how she has approached fundraising, what she&#8217;s looking for in a potential acquisition, how she&#8217;s managed to grow Canva&#8217;s free and paid user base at a rapid clip, and what it actually means to be a &#8220;mission-driven company.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conversation kicked off with Perkins charitable donation. She clarified that her and Obrecht&#8217;s $13 billion-ish give-back was the vast majority of their equity in the company, around 30%. This is a relatively big chunk of equity for growth-stage founders who have raised so many rounds, but Perkins explained how the company has tackled fundraising with a focus on preserving equity.</p>
<blockquote><p>With early-stage startups, it was very common that you had to raise a 20% to 25% round. We&#8217;ve had a very different approach. We&#8217;ve raised in the early stages. We couldn&#8217;t really be that selective about investors. But investors were very selective about who actually believed in our vision. So it worked out well. But in the time since, we&#8217;ve done many rounds. Now, we do a much smaller round at the next value inflection point.</p>
<p>We know, or we hope, that Canva is going to continue to grow rapidly in the right direction. So the valuation today is obviously going to be much smaller than the valuation over the years to come. Rather than taking like a 15% to 25% hit in one single round, which means that you can only do a few rounds over the course of a company&#8217;s lifetime, we&#8217;ve done much smaller incremental rounds. This has meant that, because we knew that we were wanting to build a big company, we didn&#8217;t overcapitalize or overdilute in the early stages. And so we&#8217;ve done many, many rounds, that are much smaller amounts, comparative to the size of the round.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every year, more than 100,000 people in the United States wait for an organ donation. More than a dozen people will die each day still waiting. Such is the brutal math and the necessary optimism required to work in the organ procurement world.</p>
<p>For the past several decades, a private network of now 57 organ procurement organizations (OPOs) have sprouted up, all broadly affiliated with <a href="https://unos.org">UNOS</a>, the United Network for Organ Sharing, a non-profit whose goal is to match donated organs with potential recipients.</p>
<p>It’s a unique facet of the medical world, and also one that is surprisingly more like a tech startup than might first meet the eye. From early beta products to a much more professional and modern tech stack, the network and its affiliates have strived to improve the speed and reliability of the organ transplantation process.</p>
<p>I wanted to look at some of the organization’s most recent initiatives, including improved logistics and planning infrastructure, while also exploring some of the more science fiction projects: xenotransplantation, drone-delivery systems, and organ viability platforms. So I interviewed a number of folks at both UNOS and two OPOs to hear what’s cutting edge, and what remains a dream for the future.</p>
<h2 id="A guy with a phone number">A guy with a phone number</h2>
<p>Joel Newman, senior communications strategist at UNOS, where he has worked nearly three decades, said that “transplantation has always been unique in the sense that everybody&#8217;s got to collaborate and communicate in real time — not always with people they know.” Perhaps surprisingly given the life-and-death stakes of organ transplantation, “a lot of those arrangements were shockingly informal.”</p>
<p>In fact, they were so informal in the early years, that matching donors to recipients was operated out of a voicemail inbox.</p>
<p>Howard Nathan, the current president of organ procurement organization Gift of Life (and the longest serving president of any OPO, having taken the role in 1984), said that one man, Don Denny, ran much of the collaboration infrastructure in the early years as organ transplantation became more viable in the 1980s.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Denny, who moved to Pittsburgh in 1977, created his own status system for patients from one to four, with one indicating the most urgent organ needs (the rating system is the opposite today). “He’d record every day this message” on his voicemail, Nathan described, “and you listened to this recording.” From there, “you’d look at your donor in the ICU where you had permission from the family, and if it’s a match, you’d call.” Nathan says that Denny coordinated 2,700 transplants over 4.5 years, all from his recorded voicemails and phone calls.</p>
<p>UNOS was formed in 1977 and eventually incorporated in 1984. By 1986, it had developed more computerized systems to handle the organ matching process, using the latest communications technology: faxes. Rick Hasz, who is today vice president of clinical services at Gift of Life and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gift-of-life-president-and-ceo-howard-m-nathan-to-step-down-richard-d-hasz-jr-named-as-successor-to-lead-nations-top-organ-procurement-organization-301319585.html">will succeed Nathan as president in 2022</a>, said that the technology wasn’t all that reliable. “When I started we had thermal paper faxes,” he said. “If you didn’t allocate quickly, then that thermal paper dissolved and you’d lose the list.”</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, UNOS has continued to evolve its technology over time with the needs of organ donors, donor hospitals, organ recipients, and transplantation centers. It relies on a web-based application, and even has a mobile app now.</p>
<p>Amy Putnam, director of IT customer advocacy at UNOS, said that one big breakthrough came with a mobile app to reduce errors. “Back in 2012, we worked on a change called <a href="https://unos.org/technology/transnet/">TransNet</a>, and TransNet is a mobile application, it&#8217;s built on iOS and Android, that allows the OPOs to electronically package and label organs,” she said. “As you can imagine at three in the morning, most people&#8217;s handwriting is not very legible, and you end up with a lot of data entry errors, and that&#8217;s where TransNet really helped.”</p>
<p>The real gain of building the system though was being able to work collaboratively with all of the organization’s OPO affiliates and refine processes based on feedback from all of its users.</p>

<p>Calls and communications are key for coordinating transplantations. Organ donations are typically sudden, can happen almost anywhere, and OPOs have just hours to get the organ from the donor hospital into a recipient patient at a transplant center. Not only that, but which patient waiting on a list has to be determined with extreme speed, with potentially dozens of transplant centers interested in a particular organ. Processing all those requests, in real-time, is the huge emphasis of UNOS’ modern tech stack.</p>
<p>Newman explained some of the intricate work that is involved. “Kidneys can often be transplanted within about 24 hours. Once they are recovered, obviously shorter is better and probably most of them go in 12 hours or less,” he said. “When you&#8217;re looking at livers and pancreas, it&#8217;s probably ideally less than eight hours. Hearts and lungs go down to about four to six hours.” The time that an organ is viable after losing blood supply is known as the ischemic time.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, UNOS has developed much more elaborate tracking systems to understand where organs are. Julie Kemink, chief clinical officer at LifeSource, an OPO, said that “what you see now is similar to what you might see with an Amazon package… you see that it is shipped… but you don’t necessarily know” where precisely it is, she said.</p>
<p>However, new updates to UNOS’ infrastructure are starting to deliver real-time location information for every organ. “Now it’s more like an Uber — you can see where it is physically at all times,” she said.</p>
<p>Adding GPS coordinates for each organ sounds like a simple proposition, but required immense coordination. Since donor hospitals, organ procurement organizations, and transplantation centers are all different entities, defining a universal standard for location was challenging. Furthermore, since organs tend to arrive quite randomly, having the right equipment and trackers on hand in every part of the country proved its own hurdle.</p>
<p>Now with better logistics information, transplant surgeons can get real-time updates on organ arrival times. If an organ is traveling by plane in the cargo hold and the plane arrives at an airport early, doctors can be notified that it’s running ahead of schedule and prep a patient earlier. Similarly, if vehicle traffic is delaying an organ’s arrival, transplant centers can push back a patient’s pre-op procedures.</p>
<p>With more data available, UNOS is now exploring a “travel app” or what Putnam dubbed a kind of “Expedia for organs.” She said, “It allows the OPOs or transplant hospitals to enter in some specific information about the donor hospital [and] the recipient center, and it will give them options, it will show them flight options, it will show them travel time if they&#8217;re going to travel by car.” She said the app, which is entering a pilot phase, could eventually allow organs to be fully ticketed right in the app experience.</p>
<p>That infrastructure is critical, because UNOS has been updating how it defines distance for organs. For decades, the organization and its OPO affiliates used a regional boundary system — organs in, say, Minnesota would be given first to recipients in Minnesota, and then if none could be found, they would be offered to nearby regions and so on.</p>
<p>That was a simple system, but one that could be taken advantage of, particularly by the wealthy. More than a decade ago, a controversy erupted when <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/Economy/story?id=7902416&amp;page=1">Steve Jobs received an organ transplant in Tennessee</a>, despite not living in the state. He did so through a process then known as “multiple listing” — for those with the means, a recipient could register on as many regional organ donor waiting lists as possible. If a match was found anywhere nationwide, the recipient could quickly charter a private plane to wherever the organ was and essentially cut the time they waited on a list.</p>
<p>Now, UNOS uses a distance algorithm that’s based on actual radius, and not just arbitrary regional boundaries. That still leads to some incongruities. Kemink of LifeSource, which is the OPO serving the Minneapolis regional area, said that “being in Minnesota — we are in proximity to both coasts… so we do have opportunities to place organs throughout the country.” That’s unlike the options available for the coasts. “In California, getting a heart from New York is basically impossible,” she noted.</p>
<p>In addition to better logistics, UNOS has optimized its platform for integration. “As you could imagine, most people hate having multiple usernames and passwords, they hate multiple solutions. So the biggest thing was integration, give us integration,” Putnam said about recent upgrades.</p>
<p>Part of that integration story was adding more ways to upload patient data and imagery files. Now, doctors can “upload and actually see the coronary angiography to see that [a heart] is the right match for a recipient,” Kemink said. That improves decision times on offers, and ultimately increases the viability of an organ transplant.</p>

<p>As organ transplantations have become more frequent — 39,000 were conducted in the United States <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics">according to government data</a> — there are increasingly large datasets available to finely tune the network’s allocation strategy and ultimately improve the number of organs that are successfully transplanted.</p>
<p>“Right now, we&#8217;re working on a project to introduce predictive analytics into the organ offer process, and looking at some analytics related to what is the probability of survival if they were to accept this organ,” Putnam said. If they decline an organ, then “what&#8217;s the probability and the timeframe until they will get a similar or better organ?” UNOS is currently working on a pilot to get feedback from its clients on these changes, and also ensure that the explainability of the algorithm is extremely clear given the highly sensitive nature of organ donations.</p>
<p>The network has also been piloting since last year a feature it dubs “offer filters,” which transplant centers can upload to the network’s platform to automate more decision around potential organ matches. Putnam said, “What we did is we looked at kidney acceptance data, historically, and said, ‘Are there offers that we know there&#8217;s no way a transplant center would ever accept?’”</p>
<p>Newman of UNOS said that “there have always been some screening criteria that centers could put in, but this allows actually a little bit more filtering of, ‘You know it&#8217;s not like I would never accept a donor older than 70 years old, but if it&#8217;s gonna be a donor older than 70 years old <i>and</i> it&#8217;s gonna take more than six hours to get here, I’m not interested.” UNOS expects a national rollout sometime later this year.</p>
<h2 id="The future of organ donations">The future of organ donations</h2>
<p>As critically important as the organ procurement process is, much of the gains the past decade have ultimately been a function of better IT applications and implementations. The big question a lot of startup founders and venture capitalists are interested in is the viability of “moonshot” ideas that can radically change organ availability for patients in need.</p>
<p>One project, using drones to deliver organs, has already been trialed. Nathan of Gift of Life said that “right now, the drone thing has been done — they’ve done one case” and also noted that “there is another group in Maryland that is experimenting with it too.” He’s somewhat skeptical about the technology given the distances organs have to travel (potentially hundreds of miles) and the potential for damage to the organ itself. “You don’t want to put the organ at risk,” he said.</p>
<p>Then there are a set of technologies including cryogenics and warm profusion which are designed to increase ischemic time (or eliminate it entirely), giving organ procurement organizations more time to get organs to the patients most in need of them. Several devices and systems are running through FDA trials now, and are expected to arrive and be put into practice over the course of the next decade.</p>
<p>Kemink of LifeSource pointed to blood-type matching and age as two criteria that could improve organ distribution with better organ viability technologies. “AB blood type is the most uncommon blood type, so there aren’t that many patients who are waiting for that blood type,” she said. At any given time, “there might not be a recipient that fits,” and so cryogenics could keep the organ “on ice” until the right patient shows up who needs it. Similarly, donated organs need to match the size required by the recipient. “You can’t take a heart from a 12-year-old and put it in a 70-year-old,” she said, since the sizes wouldn’t match the bodies. “We could preserve it until the person that needs it is there … that would be another tremendous advancement.”</p>
<p>There have also been advances in procuring organs from patients who die from circulatory death, in what are known as DCDs, or donations after circulatory death. Nathan said “there are 2.8 million people who die every year in this country, [and] only about 20,000 of those people are medically suitable to be an organ donor.” That’s one reason there is a huge wait time for organs.</p>
<p>Hasz noted that advances for procuring organs in these contexts have increased the likelihood that viable organs could be found. “Up until the last couple of years, nothing really changed: it was quite limited to liver and kidneys,” he said. But “in the past few years, the opportunity of helping more people with heart and lung transplants” arose, and “200 hearts have been used.” Ultimately with these new technologies, “we think it can expand the donor pool by 30% for DCD hearts.”</p>
<p>Finally, we get to what is known as xenotransplantation, or moving organs from animals to humans. Such experiments have gone on for decades, and progress has been somewhat elusive. Hasz said “10-15 years is always what you hear about xenotransplantation.” That said, he notes that new technologies like CRISPR have allowed for more progress in the space in recent years, potentially opening a pathway for animal organs to solve the shortage of human organs available.</p>
<p>For all the changes and new technologies though, the basic equation of organs in the United States remains the same: people need to check yes in order for lives to be saved. “The biggest thing that we need is more people to say yes to donations,” Kemink said. “Nobody gets a transplant unless people say yes to donation.” Today, roughly half of Americans are organ donors, and solving that isn’t about technology so much as about reminding people of the power of life — and what they can offer others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world of vertical farming has seen a massive uptick in interest over the past decade, as the world grapples with concerns over resource use, farmable area and exploding population growth. While promising, there are still plenty of question marks surrounding the technology, including the diversity of crops one can grow indoors at scale.</p>
<p>Newark, New Jersey-based AeroFarms is one of the U.S. leaders in the space, finding its most success in the world of microgreens. It’s a bit of a produce department niche, but it commands high prices and allows for quick turnover in the farming facilities.</p>
<p>Brewer Goose Island’s U.K. division this week announced that it’s collaborating with the startup on a Session IPA called Hail Hydro. The name (apparently Hooked on &#8216;Ponics was taken) is a nod to the use of hydroponics (though, as the company’s name implies, it actually primarily specializes in aeroponics) for growing the beer’s hops. The hops are being grown in AeroFarm’s Newark facility, with a process it claims can yield 390 times greater productivity per year, with as much as 95% less water use.</p>
<p>Is the partnership a bit of a gimmick? Kind of, yeah. More than anything, it’s a nice bit of marketing for both companies and a demonstration that the technology can be used for more than just microgreens. The back of the cans note:</p>
<blockquote><p>Celebrate the super-human efforts of our partner AeroFarms who is fighting climate change by growing hops indoors with no pesticides using their vertical farming for elevated resilience and flavor.</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s also a QR code for a virtual “tour” of the AeroFarms facilities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At TechCrunch Disrupt 2021, Slack founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield and Salesforce COO Bret Taylor discussed their $28 billion merger, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">announced last December</a>, which the Department of Justice signed off on this summer but shareholders still seem to be second-guessing. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">At least, they aren&#8217;t convinced of the value that Slack brings to Salesforce if one uses as a barometer the performance of Salesforce&#8217;s shares — they&#8217;re valued roughly where they were a year ago.</span></p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			I think Microsoft believes that in order to kill Slack, they&#8217;re going to have to kill Zoom first.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Taylor, perhaps naturally, sounded unconcerned, suggesting that major acquisitions can take time to digest. &#8220;When we do acquisitions, just by the way we finance them, it often takes us a handful of quarters for our shareholders to really understand the strategic rationale [and] see that we can execute on the integration.&#8221;</p>
<p>To Taylor&#8217;s point, Salesforce has only in the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/after-spending-28b-salesforce-announces-first-direct-integrations-with-slack/"> last month</a> begun to weave Salesforce features into Slack, whose newest feature, Clips, allows users to record themselves or their screens to send as videos to their colleagues. Users can also &#8220;do speech-to-text and create a transcript of these videos that are indexed for search so they&#8217;re findable later,&#8221; said Butterfield, explaining, as did Taylor, that Slack remains very much focused on asynchronous communications.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.cellinobio.com/">Cellino</a>, a company developing a platform to automate stem cell production, presented today at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 to detail how its system, which combines A.I. technology, machine learning, hardware, software &#8212; and yes, lasers! &#8212; could eventually democratize access to cell therapies. It aims to bring down costs associated with the manufacturing of human cells, while also increasing yields.</p>
<p>Founded by a team whose backgrounds include physics, stem cell biology, and machine learning, Cellino operates in the regenerative medicine industry. This space is currently undergoing a revolution, where new developments in gene and cell therapies could lead to breakthrough cures for a number of leading diseases. For example, the use of personalized human retinal cells <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31854278/">could be transplanted</a> to halt or reverse age-related macular degeneration, which can cause blindness. But today, such cell therapies are out of reach for most people because the process of cell production hasn&#8217;t been automated or made scalable and efficient.</p>
<p>Instead, human cells being used now in these clinical trials are mostly being made by hand by scientists who are looking at cells and evaluating &#8212; using their many years of training and expertise &#8212; which cells are low quality and need to be removed. They then scrape away those unwanted cells with a pipette tip. The process, as you can imagine, is time-consuming and produces only a small yield. In this manual process, you&#8217;d see a yield of about 10% to 20% of cells that would be able to pass the final quality assurance tests required for human transplant.</p>
<p>Cellino is working to improve this process in order to produce more cells of higher quality. Its goal is to push the yield to at least 80% over the next three years.</p>
<p>To do so, Cellino&#8217;s system is automating all the human steps in the production process using machine learning techniques.</p>
<p>To identify which cells are high quality or low quality, the company is collecting large training data sets where it&#8217;s teaching algorithms to make determinations about cell quality based on a variety of factors. This includes the cell morphology &#8212; meaning, the shape, size, and density of cells. Fluorescence-based surface markers can also be used to identify other factors of importance to the line of cells being produced, like the location of proteins on the cell, for example.</p>
<p>By using machine learning and AI to do the identification based on standard and well-accepted biological assays used by the FDA, the system could move away from human annotation and the variability that introduces into the process of human cell production.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After Cellino&#8217;s software has identified which low-quality cells need to be removed, it then uses a laser to target them. The laser creates large enough <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavitation">cavitation</a> bubbles to kill the cell, but it&#8217;s done in a highly localized way where you&#8217;re not harming the neighboring cells, as thermal heat does not dissipate to the nearby cells. This is also a more precise technique than the manual method. (Cellino&#8217;s system has a 5-micron resolution, while cells are 10-15 microns in size). This results in a throughput of about 5,000 cells per minute, which is highly efficient compared with manual techniques.</p>
<p>Over time, this automation and efficiency could bring the cost down from nearly a million dollars per patient, which is what clinicians have to pay today to run a clinical trial, when outsourcing cell production. Cellino aims to get the cost down into the tens of thousands of dollars over time.</p>
<p>By scaling cell production, personalized cell therapies could also help a broader range of patients compared with other techniques relying on banks of stem cells. These aren&#8217;t always genetically diverse samples, leaving smaller ethnic groups out of the progress being made in this space. Banked cells also require recipients to take immunosuppressants, as the cells aren&#8217;t your own and the body may reject them.</p>
<p>The use of lasers is an idea developed by Cellino co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nabihasaklayen/">Nabiha Saklayen</a>, who patented an invention in cellular laser editing while at Harvard earning her Ph.D. in Physics. She was encouraged to turn the technology into a startup by her collaborators, who <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/combining-physics-and-biology-lasers-and-machine-learning-for-personalized-medicine/">included</a> had leading biologists like George Church and David Scadden.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not all scientists become entrepreneurs, and I became an entrepreneur because I had an amazing support network around me,&#8221; notes Saklayen, of the push to join the startup space. She immediately recruited <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marinna-madrid-phd-64bb2591/">Marina Madrid,</a> an applied physicist she had worked with for years on the co-invention of laser-based intracellular delivery techniques, as her other co-founder. To gain more mentorship about growing a startup, Saklayen turned to the Boston area startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know anything about startups. I wanted to work with people who knew how to build companies, how to commercialize technology, how to build instruments &#8212;  and the Boston ecosystem is fantastic in that way. So I started connecting with lots of people in those early weeks &#8212; anybody that was in the biotech realm or Harvard Business School,&#8221; Saklayen explains.</p>
<p>This led her to Cellino co-founder and CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wagnerm/">Mattias Wagner</a>, who had built companies before in the optics and instrumentation space.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how the founding team came together. It was very complimentary because Marina and I were co-inventors of the original technology that inspired the platform and Mattias brought this tremendous background in semiconductors and optical instrumentation,&#8221; says Saklayen.</p>
<p>Since its 2017 founding, Cellino has gone on to raise <a href="https://www.cellinobio.com/news/cellino-closes-16m-seed-financing-led-by-the-engine-and-khosla-ventures/">$16 million in seed funding</a> in a round co-led by The Engine and Khosla Ventures, with participation from Humboldt Fund and 8VC.</p>
<p>The company is now collaborating with the NIH on compatibility studies. Currently, that means Cellino is making stem cells on its system which it&#8217;s then comparing with the ones made at the NIH that are already being tested in humans for personalized cell therapies for retinal diseases. Cellino later hopes to use its system to address areas like Parkison&#8217;s, muscle disorders, and skin grafts, among others.</p>
<p>The company wanted to present at TechCrunch Disrupt to share more about what it&#8217;s building and to source new talent.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me, it&#8217;s about talking about this idea around democratization and industrialization of cell therapies. I really want to get that message out because that is the movement we need to drive over the next decade for all of these cell therapies to be accessible to all patients,&#8221; says Saklayen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cellino&#8217;s angle is also very unique in the sense that, because we have this automated system to manufacture human cells, our system could make cells for every human being &#8212; in this country, in the world,&#8221; she continues. &#8220;And there are a lot of cell therapy approaches that are looking to use off-the-shelf cells and off-the-shelf therapies, which will only work for certain parts of the population. As the U.S. becomes more diverse, ethnically, we need personalized solutions for everybody.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Safaricom-owned product provides basic access to financial services like sending and receiving money and purchasing airtime</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Yet, some Kenyans still lack other digital financial services from savings to investments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, people in the country saved up to $13 billion, and more than 70% of them used informal saving groups and cooperatives to do this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on her experience, Kidanu teamed up with Alexis Roman and Bubunyo Nyavor last year to start <a href="https://www.withkoa.com/">Koa</a> to help Kenyans save and invest their money better</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. She is the COO of the company, while Roman and Nyavor act as the CEO and CTO, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>Koa is one of 20 companies competing for $100,000 and the Disrupt cup in this week&#8217;s TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield competition.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an interview with TechCrunch, Roman said when the team began market research to understand how Kenyans saved, they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were intrigued</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to discover that many people </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">were dissatisfied</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the current traditional saving options.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from being offline models, savings with microfinance banks, cooperatives and informal saving groups have manual, expensive and opaque processes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It was shocking that when we spoke to people, and they told us their experience in their cooperatives and savings groups, we wondered why they aren&#8217;t better alternatives,&#8221; Roman said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;People often use access as a keyword when describing the problem behind how financial services are used. But for us, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> access is not the problem; it is how easy or efficient it is to access the service. It was this obvious observation that made us start Koa.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digitally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, some banks offer savings products to Kenyans. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Koa still sees an opportunity because banks are generally a less popular savings destination for an average Kenyan evident in the aforementioned stats</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders are banking that it will be different with Koa. Its first product is a savings app that allows consumers to deposit, save and earn interest on their money. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When users log into the app, they can begin to create savings goals in different pockets, a replica of what exists offline &#8212; where users would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">normally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> save across different informal savings groups for various reasons</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But despite this huge opportunity, Koa has had to battle with two challenges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, infrastructure, which is a necessity for the company so it can take deposits. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Kenya, a fintech startup would typically need to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">partner with a financial institution. But collaboration between banks and fintech in Kenya is quite exasperating and even lags that of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nigeria, a country <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/a-leaked-bill-for-nigerian-startups-reveals-a-theme-of-licenses-fees-fines-and-sentences/">riddled with its own set of regulatory challenges</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second issue Koa faced was trust, an area in which informal savings groups and cooperatives have excelled by relying on word of mouth.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Koa has been able to scale past both challenges. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">After securing some partnerships and engaging the necessary regulatory bodies to take deposits, Koa makes it easy for Kenyans to make deposits without having them go through the lengthy traditional KYC process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since beta launching in April 2021, the company has onboarded around 5,000 customers who use its savings product. But w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ith savings being the lowest-hanging fruit for fintech apps, Roman says the plan for Koa is to offer more products along the line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one, Roman sees promise in offering embedded finance and banking-as-a-service tools that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> would enable other startups to launch fintech products at a faster pace. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And given Koa&#8217;s entry point with savings, Roman believes the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is poised</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to build the rails of digital financial services in the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately the plan is to become a digital banking platform that offers other services like lending and investments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While we offer direct to consumer savings apps, we can then turn around and go to other companies to help them offer savings or other financial products to their customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They wouldn&#8217;t have to go through all the struggles and burdens through regulatory hoops if we can help them achieve that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In the long run, we want to become a digital financial institution.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside savings, Koa also provides financial and educational content for users to help with engagement. Users on the platform have now saved more than $40,000 and Roman says the company is heading toward a double-digit growth week-on-week </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in both </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">users and deposits. Koa also recently raised an undisclosed pre-seed investment from angel investors across Africa, Europe and the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before starting Koa, Roman </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led strategy at Helium Health, one of Africa&#8217;s well-funded health tech startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kidanu worked with MEST Africa, a pan-African incubator and accelerator, as well as a business lead. Nyavor, on the other hand, is a serial founder and has led engineering teams at various African tech companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m bullish on our team. I&#8217;m </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> excited about working with these people who are all very focused on customers and how we can provide the best experience for them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that&#8217;s a differentiator for us in the market,&#8221; said the CEO.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Once the darlings of Wall Street and venture capital as recently as the beginning of this year, China’s edtech firms are now wondering if they will be able to remain solvent long enough to see the beginning of the next.</p>
<p>In a series of sweeping regulations, the central government has taken a wrecking ball to an education and test-prep industry worth billions, the collective value of both the schedules and wallets of the country’s urban, middle-class families.</p>
<p>The most impactful <a href="http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2021-07/24/content_5627132.htm">policies</a> were introduced in July, and they include a ban on any for-profit tutoring services focused on the country’s core public school curriculum, oriented around the make-or-break high school and university entrance exams. Limits were also set on the times during which students could attend classes, restricting class schedules to no later than 9pm on weekdays, and allowing only extracurricular courses on weekends.</p>
<p>The regulations have been catastrophic for leading Chinese edtech companies. The stock of New Oriental Education and Technology Group (NYSE: EDU) is down 86% on the year, while that of rival TAL Education Group (NYSE: TAL) has seen over 93% of its value wiped out since hitting its all-time peak as recently as February. As much as 50 to 80% of such firms’ revenue came from tutoring — activities that have now been banned. Their executives are faced with the unpleasant task of turning around billion-dollar Titanics before they sink.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1kGLnSDMfU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/">China&#8217;s expected edtech clampdown may chill a key startup sector</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;China&#8217;s expected edtech clampdown may chill a key startup sector&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/embed/#?secret=1kGLnSDMfU" data-secret="1kGLnSDMfU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Though July’s ban on for-profit tutoring has rightly received much of the attention, there has been a consistent deluge of policies meant to restructure what it means to receive an education in the world’s most populous nation. English education, once highly prioritized, is now taking a back seat in the state curriculum, and a <a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202108/1230903.shtml%23:~:text=VIPKID%25252C%252520a%252520Chinese%252520one%25252Don,which%252520has%252520banned%252520teachers%252520based">ban</a> on hiring online foreign teachers has left some of the country’s most popular edtech firms wondering how they will survive. In case parents and tutors try to circumvent the rules by working with one another directly, regulators have also outlawed private tutoring online, or at unregistered venues such as hotels, cafes, or private homes.</p>
<p>What we are seeing now is widespread scrambling for all involved: parents re-drafting their plans for their children’s educational futures, educators moving underground, and edtech entrepreneurs trying desperately to overhaul their firms’ business models before burning through their limited time and capital. The economic forces of supply and demand around education have changed little. The question now is how regulation is redirecting those forces.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of the seemingly infinite number of idiomatic couplets in the Chinese language, there are few that more consistently apply to discussions of political economy than “上有政策，下有对策 (shàng yǒu zhèng cè , xià yǒu duì cè),” loosely translated as “the rulers make the rules, while their subjects find loopholes.” As recent regulations have turned the country’s education industry on its head, the question so many are asking now is how and where the loopholes can be found.</p>
<h2>The competitive crisis for the children of China</h2>
<p>Though crackdowns, repression, and regulatory overhauls are an ongoing theme throughout today’s China, much of the recent education policy can be understood through the lens of the country’s demographic crisis. In May, the release of 2020’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57067180">census data</a> revealed a birth rate slowdown more severe than even many pessimists anticipated, prompting what appears to be a greater sense of urgency from officials to remove burdens on families and encourage a baby boom.</p>
<p>In an intensely competitive system in which not all children can succeed, and yet are expected to support their parents and often two sets of grandparents into old age, many families have grown to feel trapped, obligated to invest ever-increasing time and money just so their children can keep pace. As a Beijing-based mother surnamed Yi explained, “I am one of millions of parents who has spent so much money for extra training for my child, in the hope that it will help them be outstanding. But the result is that if everyone takes this training, it is not different than before, except that the family has greater financial burden, and the child suffers from greater stress … thus, I support the government’s decision to close these schools.”</p>
<p>China’s demographic crunch also presents the country’s leaders with a potential shortage in vocational and technical skilled labor, threatening the long-term viability of the world’s dominant manufacturing superpower. As education policymakers seek to ease pressure on parents and children fighting to get one of the precious few spots at the country’s elite universities, they also aim to increase the appeal of vocational training and careers through <a href="http://en.moe.gov.cn/documents/laws_policies/201902/t20190214_369281.html">greater emphasis</a> and reform of that oft-overlooked part of the education system.</p>
<h2>Picking up the pieces after edtech’s collapse</h2>
<p>With U.S.-listed edtech giants seeing their value evaporate overnight, the U.S. financial media has understandably focused its questions on the industry’s future. Yet the fates of such firms and their remaining employees still looks rosier than those of others.</p>
<p>For smaller players unable to access a liquidity lifeline to keep themselves afloat, bankruptcy has been the only option. That’s the case with China’s subsidiary of <a href="https://thepienews.com/news/staff-students-owed-millions-wall-street-english-shuts/">Wall Street English</a>, the high-end language-training centers which were once mainstays of Beijing and Shanghai’s upscale shopping malls. Rocked by consecutive shockwaves from the COVID-19 outbreak and travel restrictions that have complicated the recruitment and retention of native English speakers, these new regulations have scared off both customers as well as investors who could provide rescue capital. In the aftermath, the company abruptly closed its doors.</p>
<p>Such a sudden closing can be particularly hard on employees, especially if bankruptcy is involved. In China’s white-collar industries, layoffs can actually be tantamount to a small windfall for an exiting employee due to the country’s labor laws. In most situations, an employee will receive a <a href="https://www.lehmanbrown.com/insights-newsletter/china-labour-law-hiring-firing-china/">severance package</a> equal to one month’s salary, plus a month’s salary for each year that the employee worked for the company. It is not uncommon for companies to offer even more generous packages in an attempt to shed staff expeditiously and with minimal conflict.</p>
<p>Yet when companies face sudden demises, both employees and customers alike are often left holding the bag. For one woman who worked in sales for Wall Street English for over a decade explained, “when the ship is sinking slowly, there are many lifeboats available. But sometimes the boat sinks too quickly to even get in a lifeboat.” In her case, she is hoping her tenure at the company may place her towards the front of the line for a modest payout as the company’s bankruptcy proceedings moves forward. However, she says she will consider herself lucky to even receive the back pay she is owed, as one U.S.-listed edtech firm is rumored to be paying out severance packages worth only 2,000RMB (or roughly $300).</p>
<p>For Western-based educators who had been teaching virtually, confusion seems to be a dominant theme. One British teacher (we’ll call him “Ed”) who had worked for Beijing-based online education startup Whales English, the end came in the form of a roughly three-week whirlwind of anxiety. One of a number of firms who hired freelance overseas teachers to deliver remote English classes to children in China, July’s regulations meant its was no longer legally compliant.</p>
<p>According to Ed’s account of events, the company was continuing to expand, advertise, and hire until July 28, when management announced that they would be suspending all hiring of new teachers. By August 7, teachers were informed that Whales English would be cancelling all new courses, yet those which had already begun and been paid for would be allowed to finish. Teachers were also encouraged to free up as much of their schedules as possible, as parents scrambled to use their pre-paid classes while they still could.</p>
<p>Around this time, Ed says, rumors began to circulate that the company had laid off as much as two thirds of its workforce at its Beijing headquarters, and parents and teachers began to organize contingency plans for circumventing Whales’ online platform, against the company’s wishes. On August 18, Ed and the rest of the teaching staff were informed that all classes were to be immediately suspended, in response to what Ed suspects were updated orders from authorities.</p>
<p>Though frustrated with the company’s inconsistent communication, Ed counts his blessings. He reports that he has received full and timely payment for his work, and has already moved on, having accepted a teaching position at a school in Japan.</p>
<p>In the 14,000-plus member Facebook group for teachers of VIPKid, one of China’s most well-known edtech companies, stories like Ed’s are commonplace. Yet for many teachers, the flexibility and regularity offered by Chinese edtech platforms are not easily replaced. As the pandemic has placed additional childcare pressure on parents, many with education and teaching backgrounds have used these platforms to make ends meet while being able to remain at home with their children and limit their exposure to the virus. Equivalent work may prove difficult to find.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean teachers aren’t trying. Loopholes and inconsistent enforcement are creating a grey market for tutoring and other teaching services, not dissimilar to that of the illegal sex trade or undocumented migrant labor. Demand hasn’t changed, but regulations have forced large corporate entities to avoid direct involvement with such business. Due to this, the trade will move underground and thus workers (in this case, teachers) have little option other than to freelance without protection of the law.</p>
<h2>Parents, the state, and the Chinese Dream</h2>
<p>For parents, responses to the education crackdown have been driven along lines of wealth and class. <a href="https://www.sohu.com/a/488174519_161795">Reports</a> have already begun to circulate of in-home “nannies” with teaching skills and qualifications, paid as much as 30,000RMB (roughly $4,600) per month, so as to be officially compliant with regulations while still receiving similar after-school tutoring as before. As always, new loopholes are just waiting to be found.</p>
<p>For many of China’s wealthiest and most well-connected families, the new regulations change little of their plans for their children’s education. For several parents spoken to for this article, circumventing the Chinese education system has long been a primary objective. For some, this has been achievable through acceptance into one of China’s many international schools, whose international baccalaureate (IB) curriculum prepares students for attending university overseas while also avoiding the country’s grueling entrance exams.</p>
<p>For others, success and privilege have afforded them the opportunity to send their children to school abroad. In some cases, this has meant moving themselves and their wealth out as well. “For more and more parents, studying overseas seems to be the best, or only option,” explained a retired executive surnamed Gao, who now lives in the U.S., where her daughter also studies.</p>
<p>From the wealthiest elite to the middle class, there appears to be a shared theme: for parents who came of age during China’s historic economic miracle, both social and economic advancement were not just seen as possible, but expected in order to simply keep pace with one’s peers. And if advancement is expected, stagnation is failure. If stagnation is failure, moving backward is disastrous.</p>
<p>As economic growth slows, Chinese president Xi Jinping calls for “common prosperity,” and vocational and industrial training are emphasized over higher education, some parents are finding that their dreams are at odds with the country’s new strategy. “Despite the state’s broader goal, would it be okay with me if my daughter couldn’t receive higher education? I think the answer is no,” a Shanghai mother surnamed Li shared bluntly. &#8220;The mindset change will take time. Maybe it’s a bit selfish, but it’s true. I’m very supportive of education equality, but only if my kid is one of the lucky ones.”</p>
<p>For all the talk of money, what many parents worry about their children missing out on is something less tangible: “<i>suzhi</i> (素质),” a term loosely translated as “human quality,” encompassing ethics, ambition, education, and social class. For a Beijing teacher surnamed Guo, it is this element that he worries about for his daughter. “I know that society needs vocational workers, and that they can even make more money than those who attend university. But even if she makes less money, I will still want her to attend a university.” To him, the education his child receives and the future salary she will earn are secondary in importance to the social circles she develops. “[Vocational school students] have a reputation for being lazy, for smoking and drinking, and misbehaving. The friends she’ll make in school are friends she’ll have her whole life. I want her to have high-quality friends,” he said.</p>
<p>As China’s regulators overhaul not just education but many of the country’s most central institutions in an attempt to address its most daunting challenges, many are finding that the expectations which they once held must now radically change. Yet amidst all the uncertainty, what is unlikely to change is the drive and ingenuity to advance one’s self, family, and ambitions. After all, the authorities will always have their rules, and the people will always find their loopholes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can take a pregnancy test or colon cancer test from your bathroom, or, these days, a COVID-19 test from the comfort of your living room. You might one day be able to get a breast cancer screening at home, too, if you have a urine sample and an artificial nose. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the vision behind <a href="https://www.thebluebox.tech/">The Blue Box</a>, a startup competing this week at TechCrunch Disrupt’s Startup Battlefield. The company, founded by Judit Giró Benet while pursuing her Master’s at the University of California Irvine, is developing an at-home handheld device designed to screen urine samples for breast cancer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, founded in January of this year,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is in the process of scientifically validating The Blue Box – which includes both hardware and artificial intelligence components. The Blue Box has been awarded equity-free prizes from Argal (€2,000), the 2020 James Dyson Prize (£35,000), a grant from the Tarragona region of Catalonia (€4,000), and a prize for winning the <a href="https://pitch.tech/">pitch.tech</a> competition ($10,000). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benet imagines a product where you might be able to slip a urine sample into an $80 box, have your sample analyzed by a machine learning algorithm (that algorithm is being trained right now), and have test results sent to your phone in about 30 minutes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You would have a Blue Box at home and the whole family could use it at home with the frequency your doctor tells you [to],” Benet tells TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benet says the device is modeled after a series of studies showing that dogs are able to pick up distinctly cancerous smells. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, </span><a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/60/6/814.short"><span style="font-weight: 400;">early-stage studies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have shown that specially trained Labrador Retrievers can accurately identify early-stage colon cancer in both breath and stool samples. Urine, the particular bodily fluid of interest to The Blue Box, also has proved to be useful for cancer sniffing dogs. In </span><a href="https://www.auajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1016/j.juro.2014.09.099"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, German Shepherds were able to identify prostate cancer patients by sniffing out “volatile organic compounds” present in urine samples. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One June </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8230505/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 trial </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">on 40 breast cancer patients, 142 patients with non-breast malignant disease, and 18 healthy people found that a trained Labrador Retriever could accurately identify the breast cancer patients’ urine samples 40 out of 40 times in double blind-tests. The authors concluded that a screening method based on detecting compounds in urine </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">warranted further study. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blue Box is designed to help sniff out breast cancer, sans the dog component. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might think of The Blue Box itself as a replacement for the dog, and the AI component as a digital brain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key for The Blue Box will be clinically validating both parts of the equation. Benet declined to share the specific cancer biomarkers that The Blue Box will test urine samples for – though she noted that they are pulled from scientific literature. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, Benet says The Blue Box has a minimum viable hardware product that’s “fully functional.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next piece of the puzzle is training the machine learning algorithm to recognize late state breast cancer. So far, the company reports a 95 percent classification rate for their algorithm on metastatic breast cancer (a very late stage) – which means if can accurately categorize 95 percent of those samples. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s a first step for the company, but the goal is to be able to detect cancer before it reaches that especially dangerous stage. On that front, The Blue Box is still in the throes of clinical validation. The Blue Box, she says, is currently being studied at University Hospital Joan XXII in Tarragona, Catalonia, and University Hospital Sant Joan in Reus, Catalonia, in a study led out of the University of California, Irvine. So far, they&#8217;ve collected more than 40 urine samples. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should The Blue Box be able to prove that their technology can accurately detect early-stage </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">breast cancer, there’s evidence that at-home cancer screening tests can gain regulatory approval. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2014, </span><a href="https://www.cologuard.com/faq/is-cologuard-fda-approved"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the FDA granted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> premarket approval to Cologuard, a prescription stool test that is designed to detect colon cancer in average-risk individuals. For many screening tests, the critical measure of success is sensitivity or the ability of the test to accurately detect a disease when it is present  –  the sensitivity of colorguard for the detection of colon cancer was </span><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1311194"><span style="font-weight: 400;">92.3 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per a study in the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New England Journal of Medicine. </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To follow in those footsteps The Blue Box would also need to have rigorous clinical data to earn pre-market approval and will have to demonstrate high sensitivity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blue Box is also technically a medical device that delivers oncology-related information, which means it will need to work with the FDA to demonstrate its validity before going to market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are a medical device so we will need to go through the FDA and the MDR [the European equivalent of the FDA]. We will start this phase by 2023,” she says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the many arguments made in favor of at-home cancer testing is that it could help close a screening gap. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the context of colon cancer, fear, whether over the procedure itself or the result, have </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6531912/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">consistently been</span></a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2946825/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">identified as barriers </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to testing in studies, but other barriers &#8212; cost, lack of insurance or transportation, or skepticism about screening guidelines &#8212; also remain powerful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breast cancer screenings, argues Bénet, face some of the same barriers that colonoscopies do. There is room for improvement in terms of screening. In 2019, 76.4 percent of women in the US aged 50 and over had gotten a mammogram in the last two years. This number has remained relatively stable since 1998, per the </span><a href="https://progressreport.cancer.gov/detection/breast_cancer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">National Cancer Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, though the pandemic also resulted in a </span><a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/CCI.20.00068"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spike in missed screenings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will likely affect more recent statistics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4135000/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2014 study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on underserved women found that the largest barriers to obtaining mammograms was fear of cost (even if the service was free, the fear persists), mammogram-related pain, and the fear of receiving bad news. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blue Box, perhaps like Cologuard, seems poised to tackle fears of mammogram-related pain (urine samples are painless). Benet has also thought about the process of receiving the bad news her product might deliver.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benet says the company is working on incorporating a “virtual doctor” within The Blue Box app that can communicate with a user once they’ve received a diagnosis. “We will try to train this bot so that it can sense the mental state of the patient,” says Benet. “If she&#8217;s processing the news correctly, if she needs help from a medical professional.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That feature, she says, should be unveiled in the next few months. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At-home testing isn’t a universal salve to the multifaceted reasons people don’t get cancer screenings. But there is evidence that these at-home tests do reach people who might otherwise forgo a screening. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At-home screening tests, for instance, have allowed healthcare systems to mail out tests to people who might otherwise miss an appointment. A </span><a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/postscript/covid-19-increases-allure-home-colon-cancer-testshttps://newsroom.uw.edu/postscript/covid-19-increases-allure-home-colon-cancer-tests"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2018 review paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> found that when people received colon cancer tests by mail, colon cancer screenings went up about 22 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Blue Box is still in its early validation phase, but if the company can make a similar dent in the breast cancer screening world, Benet hopes it will lead to more people catching breast cancer during early, critical stages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe that with The Blue Box we will be able to finally create a change that should have happened many, many years ago,” she says. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While Apple and Fortnite&#8217;s big, dramatic lawsuit didn&#8217;t seem to reach the conclusion either party actually wanted, its resolution offered some hope for Fortnite lovers that the title could be finding its way back to the App Store and onto their Apple devices.</p>
<p>And yet&#8230; It seems that legalese will once again get in the way of the battle royale. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1440711467888615431?s=20">tweet thread</a> today from Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, communications between him and Apple&#8217;s legal team seem to cement that Apple has no interest in bringing Fortnite back while Epic continues to appeal the court&#8217;s recent decision, a process Sweeney estimates could keep Fortnite out of the App Store for another five years or more.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apple lied. Apple spent a year telling the world, the court, and the press they’d &quot;welcome Epic’s return to the App Store if they agree to play by the same rules as everyone else&quot;. Epic agreed, and now Apple has reneged in another abuse of its monopoly power over a billion users.</p>
<p>&mdash; Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1440711467888615431?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 22, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Sweeney shared an email sent by himself to Apple&#8217;s Phil Schiller and a terse reply from Apple&#8217;s legal team, which detailed that &#8220;Apple has exercised its discretion not to reinstate Epic&#8217;s developer program account at this time. Furthermore, Apple will not consider any further requests for reinstatement until the district court&#8217;s judgment becomes final and nonappealable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the full text of the email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Dear Gary,</p>
<p class="p1">I am responding to your recent request that Apple reinstate Epic&#8217;s developer program account, which was terminated for cause last year. Epic committed an intentional breach of contract, and breach of trust, by concealing code from Apple and making related misrepresentations and omissions. In its decision, the court recognized that &#8220;Apple had contractual rights to act as it did. It merely enforced those rights as [Epic&#8217;s] own internal documents show Epic Games expected.&#8221; ECF No. 812 at 178-79. The court further found that &#8220;Apple&#8217;s termination of the [Developer Program License Agreement] and the related agreements between Epic Games and Apple was valid, lawful, and enforceable.&#8221; Id. at 179. Following that decision, Mr. Sweeney has publicly said that Epic &#8220;[wouldn&#8217;t trade [an alternative payment system] away to get Fortnite back on iOS.&#8221; In light of this and other statements since the court&#8217;s decision, coupled with Epic&#8217;s duplicitous conduct in the past, Apple has exercised its discretion not to reinstate Epic&#8217;s developer program account at this time. Furthermore, Apple will not consider any further requests for reinstatement until the district court&#8217;s judgment becomes final and nonappealable.</p>
<p class="p1">Sincerely,</p>
<p class="p1">/s/ Mark A. Perry</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The courts ruled in their decision earlier this month that Apple was &#8220;not in violation of antitrust law,&#8221; that Epic Games had to repay Apple the lost App Store fees, and &#8212; most interestingly &#8212; that Apple could not continue to block alternative forms of payment inside the App Store. The decision greatly complicates Apple&#8217;s App Store economics, but Apple still did not appeal the court&#8217;s decision, framing it as an overwhelming win for the company overall. Epic Games was less satisfied, appealing the decision and pledging to &#8220;fight on.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a press call with reporters immediately following the ruling, Apple had indicated that they would welcome Fortnite back if Epic Games agreed to follow the same rules as every other developer on the App Store &#8212; though this statement was notably made ahead of Epic&#8217;s official appeal of the court&#8217;s decision.</p>
<p>In a tweet further down in his thread, Sweeney called Apple&#8217;s refused reinstatement of Fortnite&#8217;s developer account, &#8220;another extraordinary anticompetitive move by Apple, demonstrating their power to reshape markets and choose winners and losers.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Apple for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cloudsmith.com/">Cloudsmith</a>, a cloud platform for software supply chain management, has raised a $15 million Series A funding round led by Tiger Global, which it claims is the largest ever Series A funding round in Northern Ireland since 2005 (according to PitchBook data). The company plans to use the new funding to hire 60 new employees and expand its US sales and engineering teams.</p>
<p>Other investors in the round include Shasta, Amaranthine, Sorenson, and Leadout Capital as well as previous investors Frontline, MMC, and Techstart. Docker CEO Scott Johnston, Nextdoor CEO Sarah Friar, and Puppet CEO Yvonne Wassenaar also participated in the round.</p>
<p>The Belfast-headquartered startup allows businesses to manage all the incoming software it uses via the cloud, meaning you don’t have to have dedicated support staff in the office which requires dedicated staffing, VPNs, and licenses.</p>
<p>Cloudsmith says its software scans for security vulnerabilities and has customers in Europe, the US, the Middle East, and Australia, including the Internet Systems Consortium, Carta, and Font Awesome.</p>
<p>Cloudsmith was founded in 2016 by former NYSE developers Alan Carson and Lee Skillen and announced a £2.1 million seed investment round led by Frontline Ventures, MMC Ventures, and Techstart in 2019.</p>
<p>Alan Carson, Co-Founder &amp; CEO of Cloudsmith, said: “Cloudsmith was built to tackle the complexity of managing software assets, which is a key challenge for any company to secure their software supply chains. Our service allows our customers to track and control the distribution of any software asset and provides tooling to minimize the risks of utilizing open-source software. It’s a massive problem for the whole industry and our investors, led by Tiger Global, understand the need for a fully managed cloud-native solution that Cloudsmith provides.”</p>
<p>Vidya Raman, Principal at Sorenson Ventures, said: “While package management is by no means a new or flashy software space, it is a critical component of the software development lifecycle. The need for both cloud-native software development and secure software supply chains has resulted in the need to reinvent package management. That’s where Cloudsmith’s Continuous Packaging platform has come in and continues to lead that market. It is in the new world that Cloudsmith truly shines.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch over a call, Carson added: “If you think about the last 10 years, it&#8217;s been about, building automated pipelines. For companies to do deployments or distribute their software to other companies, they need tools, but they also need to move the assets around and store the assets that are both being pulled into that process and generated by that process and that&#8217;s what CloudSmith ultimately does.”</p>
<p>He added: “Other companies tend to have legacy solutions. Our product is fully managed and makes it a lot easier for companies. They don&#8217;t have to put any resource behind keeping it up, we&#8217;ll handle it for them. So the total cost of ownership is lower. And they can spend more time actually crafting the software rather than worrying about how to store and distribute it within their internal systems.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The global pandemic, along with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/digital-transformation/">digital transformation</a> it accelerated, broadened corporate attack surfaces exponentially. As a result, there were almost 1,800 publicly reported data breaches in the first six months of 2021 alone, accounting for the exposure of 18.8 billion records. Among these were devastating, large-scale breaches of consumer names, contact details, and financial records, such as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/the-accellion-data-breach-continues-to-get-messier/">ongoing Accellion compromise</a> that has impacted over 100 companies, organizations, and government agencies, and the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/t-mobile-says-at-least-47m-current-and-former-customers-affected-by-data-breach/">T-Mobile breach that exposed the details of 47 million customers</a>.</p>
<p>Tide Foundation, a Sydney-based, five-person startup competing in TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield this week, claims that its &#8220;first-of-its-kind&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/encryption/">encryption</a> protocol could make this so-called “cyber breach pandemic” &#8212; a tagline the non-profit was using before the global crisis struck &#8212; a thing of the past.</p>
<p>However, tackling cybercrime hasn’t always been the mission of Tide co-founders Michael Loewy and Yuval Hertzog. In fact, the startup was born out of the team’s prior business, a marketing platform called Ziva that helped to connect enterprises with consumers over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/iot/">Internet of Things</a> (IoT) devices. While the business grew quickly, attracting a number of big-name enterprise clients, Ziva soon ran into a privacy problem when architecting a campaign for Kellogg’s. The campaign in question was a “Special K Fitness Challenge,” with participants sharing data from wearables with rewards based on the number of kilometers completed.</p>
<p>“We collected accounts of tens of thousands of people, and we knew everything about their lives &#8211; way beyond what they knew themselves; their habits, health, and even their nutrition,” said Hertzog, who runs the technology side of the startup. “This was a treasure trove for enterprises, but we couldn’t avoid the fact that we’re sitting on very sensitive information.”</p>
<p>Tide realized that it needed to safeguard this data but failed to find an existing solution that ticked all of the boxes. That’s when Tide, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/blockchain/">blockchain</a>-based encryption method, was masterminded.</p>
<p>The protocol, which the startup claims is the first &#8220;true&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/zero-trust/">zero trust</a> authentication method, can be deployed into an organization to encrypt sensitive data, such as customer records and financial information. Each record has its own encryption key, and each key is controlled by a decentralized guardian.</p>
<p>“No one has nailed a proper zero trust model, because no one really has zero in their trust model. We are the only one offering an entirely zero trust model,” said Loewy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It’s “virtually impossible” to hack, too, according to the startup. The key is split between a group of nodes, and no node has access to or knowledge of the whole key, or the authority to act on its own. This makes malicious access to your key almost impossible.</p>
<p>“When &#8211; not if &#8211; you hack it, you have to invest resources to hack at least 20 computers, at 20 locations around the world, and even then you reach a fraction of the data you are after,” said Hertzog, adding that while Tide has worked to make its technology hacker-proof, it’s also been keen to ensure it passes the “grandpa test.”</p>

<p>“This link between the human world and the computer world is very challenging. We put a lot of effort into human interaction, and we built a way for human beings to engage with the system through the simplest mechanism that exists today, which is username and password,&#8221; said Hertzog. “It’s definitely not foolproof, but at least with us, it’s billions of times harder to attack you using a password. Saying that, our technology starts with supporting usernames and passwords, but it can support biometric authentication.”</p>
<p>To date, the Tide Foundation has raised the equivalent of $2 million, primarily from Angel investors, and the five-year-old startup has also secured the backing of some big names in the cybersecurity world. Willy Susilo, a distinguished professor at the School of Computing and Information Technology in Wollongong, Australia, is an adviser to the company, alongside the likes of former Microsoft director Peter Ostick and Tom Dery, former global chairman of M&amp;C Saatchi.</p>
<p>The well-supported startup is now focused on getting Tide out to the market, and as a result of the pandemic and the cybersecurity chaos that ensued, it’s already in demand.</p>
<p>“We were talking to companies abut privacy and protection before the pandemic, and the response we got was that ‘if we get hacked, we’re in good company,'&#8221; Hertzog said. “The conversation changes after Covid. We’ve been chased down by the academic world, healthcare, law practices, and critical infrastructure &#8211; an entire area that is completely exposed.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“We’re always trying to stick something up a women’s something.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steviemichellecline/">Stevie Cline</a>, the co-founder of <a href="https://www.prenome.com/">Prenome</a>, is tired of how invasive diagnostic processes are for women, even with modern technology and broader healthcare advancements. So, she teamed up with her former co-worker, Sarah Brozio, to launch a startup all about providing actionable insights to women &#8211; no poking or prodding needed.</p>
<p>Prenome, going through TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield this week, is launching a saliva-based genetic test, paired with a behavioral app, to help women navigate gestational diabetes, a common condition that comes up while pregnant.</p>
<p>The startup’s success is rooted inextricably to data. In May, Prenome began recruiting patients who have had gestational diabetes for a clinical study, OneInSeven. The co-founders are using this data to build a more accurate pipeline of information about women’s health conditions, one that represents the actual diversity of women in the United States.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2201148" style="width: 961px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2201148" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2201148" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/s.14.png" alt="Prenome could help pregnant women better predict and manage gestational diabetes" width="951" height="951" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/s.14.png 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/s.14.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/s.14.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/s.14.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/s.14.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/s.14.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/s.14.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/s.14.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/s.14.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/s.14.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 951px) 100vw, 951px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2201148" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Prenome</p></div></p>
<p>Once Prenome extracts a genetic risk score, it combines it with a risk score built off of social determinants, with factors like previous trauma, disposable income, proximity to grocery stores. By combining these two factors, Prenome claims it can accurately predict gestational diabetes at a 90% accuracy rate, compared to the 80% baseline today.</p>
<p>The co-founders picked gestational diabetes over the plethora of other women’s health conditions because it has a strong genetic component. Cline explained how gestational diabetes is predictable and preventable, which gives Prenome a chance at screening high-risk individuals and also providing interventions that will help them prevent getting gestational diabetes early on.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once Prenome is able to develop technology that helps women navigate gestational diabetes, it can use that insight to better address associated conditions, such as infertility and polycystic ovary syndrome.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;People think that genetic diseases are usually caused by a single gene or a single chromosomal disorder, like Down Syndrome or Cystic Fibrosis,&#8221; Crozio said. &#8220;[They] wanted this idea that one gene equals one problem so we can fix that &#8211; but that&#8217;s actually really untrue for most of our health.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>She explained part of the driver for the biobank is to be able to mine it for more and more indications on triggers within women&#8217;s health conditions. Similar to hormonal health, genetic health is complicated yet key in understanding the common threads between these conditions.</p>
<p>Prenome’s biggest stance may be that it doesn’t want to test for any condition that it can’t intervene or improve on.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re never going to do a test [for] risk [of] Alzheimer&#8217;s in your 80s because there&#8217;s nothing really right now that we can do to prevent that from happening, women don’t need more stress” Cline said. “If we are telling you [that you are] high risk, it&#8217;s something that you can improve on, we can intervene on, we can provide for.”</p>
<p>Over a year since launch, Prenome has so far filed patents on both its test and methodology. It also plans to publish research with data from its OneInSeven Study.</p>
<p>The saliva-based test, which it hopes to release in 2022, is working to get CLIA-certified, which would allow physicians to order it for their patients. Eventually, Prenome will pursue FDA-approval, which would allow Prenome to go direct-to-consumers.</p>
<p>“Having doctors feel like they are cut out of the loop and that they are not important and part of the women&#8217;s health cycle is detrimental for us,” Cline said. “We really want to focus on how we engage people [and] get them to want to get their patients to use our tests.”</p>
<p>Prenome early strides have been noticed, and bet on. So far, Prenome has attracted $1 million worth of interest from investors, including Cleo Capital, OnDeck&#8217;s Runway Fund, Johns Hopkins University, Wing VC, First In Ventures and A-Level Capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">New Zealand-based electric utility bike company Ubco announced a partnership with TPK Holdings, a Taiwanese electric components manufacturing company, onstage at the Micromobility America conference in San Francisco on Wednesday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As part of the agreement, TPK will be leading Ubco&#8217;s Series B with a $10 million investment, bringing the company&#8217;s total funding to $23 million. TPK will also bring the company significant supply chain support as well as scaling and manufacturing capabilities in the near future.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The partnership enables us to scale from being a producer that does individual production runs of some number of bikes to a point where we can get into rolling production and scale that up to thousands and potentially tens of thousands of vehicles,&#8221; Katherine Sandford, Ubco&#8217;s CEO and executive chair, told TechCrunch.</p>

<p dir="ltr">TPK also invested in Ubco&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/electric-utility-bike-startup-ubco-raises-10-million-to-fund-its-global-expansion/">$10 million convertible note round in June</a>, alongside a range of U.S. and New Zealand-based investors like Seven Peak Ventures, Nuance Capital, GD1, Snowball Effect and Enterprise Angels. At the time Ubco said the funding would help it expand internationally, specifically with an eye to the United States.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the initial stage of the partnership, TPK&#8217;s large network of global suppliers will help Ubco ramp up production of its flagship 2X2 electric utility bike, which comes in an off-road version geared for farmers and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/ubco-2x2-adventure-bike-review-utility-that-shreds/">city version</a> geared for last-mile logistics. Ubco currently has two production factories in China, one for the bikes and one for the batteries. Having TPK&#8217;s support on the supply side will ultimately help reduce costs of production, says Sandford.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ubco is also gearing up to release two new vehicles for which TPK will provide dedicated manufacturing support. The company hopes to begin production for the <a href="https://www.ubcobikes.com/frx1-trail-bike/">FRX1</a>, an off-road trail bike for the recreational market, in 2022, and is working on a prototype for pre-release of a four-wheel utility vehicle the same year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ubco says the commitment from TPK also allows it to double down on its ESG values.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;TPK&#8217;s deep experience in manufacturing supply chains, particularly with complex electronics, will be invaluable in solving the industry-wide challenge of product recycling and end of life through collaboration,&#8221; said Sandford. &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This funding allows UBCO to be more bullish in standing up R&amp;D projects, such as cell chemistry work, that require more investment to bring to light of day. Further, it enables us to grow the team in critical supporting roles like increasing our testing capabilities and focusing on the management of our products at end of life.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Ubco co-founder Timothy Allan <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/electric-utility-bike-startup-ubco-raises-10-million-to-fund-its-global-expansion/">previously told TechCrunch</a> that the company is dedicated to ensuring a responsible end-of-life of its vehicles, which starts with making sure the product is modular enough to be broken down into its composite parts to be recycled the right way.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;When combined with our focus on building an intelligent platform, which enables subscription business models, we create a circular lifecycle where we are incentivized to maximize the usable life of the product,&#8221; said Sandford. &#8220;This additional funding helps us get the platform, operations and commercials in place to bring this circular mentality to the next level.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Weather forecasting is a notoriously challenging field, but it’s an endeavor that is becoming ever more vital to the daily functioning of our planet. Climate change is intensifying the scale and devastation of natural disasters, from wildfires and typhoons to floods and cyclones. Knowing precisely when and where a disaster strikes (or, even, just getting a few hours advanced notice) can drastically change the outcome for the populations affected.</p>
<p>In this field, Microsoft sees both an opportunity to do good as well as a lucrative niche to secure for its cloud computing service Azure. Through its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth">AI for Earth</a> program, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/12/microsoft-launches-ai-for-earth-to-give-2m-in-services-to-environmental-projects/">which we last covered during its launch in 2017</a>, the company has compiled a series of offerings into what it dubs a “planetary computer.” Those offerings include APIs for identifying objects as well as species of plants and animals. AI for Earth offers <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-earth-grants">grants</a> for scientists and others to use Azure in their own research and modeling. The program joins other Microsoft cloud initiatives such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/29/microsoft-takes-wraps-off-40m-ai-for-health-initiative/">AI for Health</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/07/microsoft-commits-25m-to-its-ai-for-accessibility-program/">AI for Accessibility</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jD7u7S4Qp1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/12/microsoft-launches-ai-for-earth-to-give-2m-in-services-to-environmental-projects/">Microsoft launches AI for Earth to give $2M in services to environmental projects</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Microsoft launches AI for Earth to give $2M in services to environmental projects&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/12/microsoft-launches-ai-for-earth-to-give-2m-in-services-to-environmental-projects/embed/#?secret=jD7u7S4Qp1" data-secret="jD7u7S4Qp1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>I’ve been focusing on all aspects of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/disaster-response/">disaster response stack</a> the past few months, so I was curious how the so-called planetary computer was performing and where the barriers are to better modeling of natural disasters. Bruno Sánchez-Andrade Nuño, program director of the project, told me that the ambitions of the project remain as strong as ever.</p>
<p>“The goal is to have a planetary computer to help everyone manage earth’s ecosystems, since that is the only way to be efficient when disaster happens,” he said. While the program is focused on “reduction, response and recovery,” it is the response stage which gets most interesting since decisions have to be made as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Sánchez-Andrade Nuño noted that AI has advanced tremendously fast over the past couple of years, particularly in domains relevant to the environment. “AI doesn’t need as much data as a lot of people think,” he said. “There has been a lot of progress with retraining algorithms … [and] we do a lot of work to onboard people to understand AI and how you can build an extremely efficient deep learning [model].”</p>
<p>One big challenge for applying AI to earth systems is simply the number of disciplines required to congregate in order for modeling to be successful. However, many disciplines remain aloof from each other, and no gap is wider than between scientists and AI researchers. Sánchez-Andrade Nuño sees an opportunity for the program to continually engage all sides into combatting some of the toughest challenges facing the planet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are “different dynamics because of different incentives — in the science community there is an incentive to create more knowledge, [but] for the modelers, [they want to] create good answers quickly,” he explained. “How can you make decisions quickly under uncertainty?”</p>
<p>One way of bridging that gap is through what he dubbed “upskilling,” or offering more AI training to scientists. “It’s all part of the same strategy … of helping people do environmental analytics faster and better,” he said. Nowhere is that harder than around geospatial analytics. “Computers are really good at one dimensional … they are not very good with things that are near each other.” He noted that he had originally trained in astrophysics, but upskilled himself in GIS (geographic information systems).</p>
<p>The effort involved in upskilling advanced AI skills has declined as libraries have expanded and common AI models are both well-behaved and also have prodigious educational materials available to understand them. “You used to need a PhD, and today, you need 10 lines of code,” he said.</p>
<p>That increasing power though is leading folks to believe that AI can solve every planetary problem. It cannot, or if you’re optimistic, cannot <i>yet</i>. “We are trying to reduce the hype of AI,” he said. “If you don’t know what AI is, you won’t trust what it is.” The program has been emphasizing explainability in a lot of its initiatives, so that scientists and AI researchers together can understand the outputs that come out of models.</p>
<p>That mission is increasingly aligned with relevant government agencies. Recently, the AI for Earth program <a href="https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/Media/News-Stories/Article/2693893/erdc-microsoft-agreement-aims-to-analyze-risk-of-extreme-weather-in-the-cloud/">signed a partnership</a> with the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center to improve the agency’s coastal monitoring system.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is increasing maturity in a lot of modeling even if there is more work to be done. “Right now, I would argue, we are still in the mezzanine phase,” Sánchez-Andrade Nuño said. “A lot of processes need a lot of ad-hoc processing than we should.” The good news is that more and more people are stepping into the field and trying to connect the dots, and in the process, improve the world’s disaster response capabilities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The tools you use most often are the ones you think about the least.<a href="https://calendly.com/"> Calendly</a>, an app that helps people plan, schedule and follow up on meetings, may be a perfect example of that.</p>
<p>Today, some 10 million people send Calendly links to millions of others to sort out meeting slots. But perhaps because its purpose is to get people from one step to the next in their day, and from using one piece of software to the next, Calendly tends not to get much attention.</p>
<p>That was the case, at least, until last year. The COVID-19 pandemic sent many of us home to work, and as commutes were cut out and people couldn&#8217;t meet at work, we suddenly found ourselves in a meeting frenzy. Calendly came into its own, and investors took notice.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;We are seeing strong usage in spite of the changes in how people work for the simple fact that human connection and collaboration are ultimately what drives a business forward.&#8221;					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Created out of founder Tope Awotona’s need for a tool to organize his life better, Calendly by nature kept a low profile even as it grew. But the combination of pandemic-fueled growth and major funding effectively changed that overnight. Earlier this year, we explored how the Atlanta-based company came virtually out of nowhere to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/how-atlantas-calendly-turned-a-scheduling-nightmare-into-a-3b-startup/">raise $350 million at a $3 billion valuation</a>.</p>
<p>That’s a heavy load to lay on a founder and a startup, and it was the starting point of our fireside chat at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021. If the product works well, how do you take it to the next level — and frankly, why should you?</p>
<p>&#8220;The question I had at the time [of that funding round] was, will the company take it as a distraction and become enamored with the publicity that comes with that? Or will we stay focused and continue to work really hard for our customers and partners and ourselves?” Awotona said. “Nine months later, it&#8217;s very clear that we&#8217;ve done the latter. Our culture and values have more or less remained the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company continues to stay focused on the “prosumers” who fueled its growth. These are individuals who gravitated to Calendly not because their company mandated it, but because they may have been sent a link for a meeting by someone else, became impressed with the UX, and started using it themselves — the classic kind of virality that has spurred a lot of technology to ubiquity.</p>
<p>Alongside that focus on prosumers, Calendly is also doubling down to build tools to address groups of users — starting from teams and going all the way up to large organizations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brave, the startup behind the eponymous non-tracking browser, has launched a non-tracking video conferencing add-on out of beta &#8212; letting all users make and receive video calls straight from their browser.</p>
<p>The tool, called Brave Talk, has been in beta testing since May last year. And Brave told us it&#8217;s had some 14,000 daily active users over this period &#8212; aka, earlier adopters and developers tapping in via Brave&#8217;s <a href="https://brave.com/download-nightly/">test version</a>.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s been made open access &#8212; with Brave making a pitch to Internet users of &#8220;privacy-focused&#8221; video conferencing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many other video conferencing providers, including Zoom, monitor calls, metadata, and images, and the records of that data can be sold or shared without user consent,&#8221; it writes in a <a href="https://brave.com/talk/">blog post</a> announcing the wider launch.</p>
<p><span class="il">&#8220;Brave</span> <span class="il">Talk</span> users can enable multiple layers of encryption on calls, so an eavesdropper cannot listen in on users’ calls, and our servers don&#8217;t save metadata, so calls, images, and activities are never recorded or shared without user consent,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l0aWoHApbs0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The video calling software is a subscription offering costing $7 per month for premium features (like group calls and call recording) &#8212; but basic one-to-one calls are free and unlimited. (NB: <span class="il">Brave&#8217;s</span> Android and iOS apps only currently offer <span class="il">Brave</span> <span class="il">Talk</span> Premium but will have the free version too &#8220;in the coming weeks&#8221;).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Users initiating a video call must do so from within the Brave browser however recipients need only be using any &#8220;modern browser&#8221; (so basically Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera etc) to participate in a video chat.</p>
<p>While Brave is touting its non-tracking credentials as a differentiating plus for the video conferencing software vs mainstream players like Zoom, it&#8217;s worth noting that Brave Talk does not (yet) have end-to-end encryption rolled out.</p>
<p>Brave says it&#8217;s using the Jitsi as a Service open source video meeting platform from 8&#215;8 &#8212; which relies on WebRTC open source technology to enable developers to embed HD video directly into the browser.</p>
<p>On encryption it says users can enable different layers in the settings. It describes the current strongest level of encryption available in both free and premium versions of Brave Talk as &#8220;Video Bridge Encryption&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This setting ensures that the video and audio streams are encrypted using keys generated by the participants, which prevents eavesdropping on the Video Bridge Server,&#8221; said co-founder and CEO Brendan Eich. &#8220;Video Bridge Encryption can be enabled under &#8216;Security Options&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we find the phrase &#8216;end to end encryption&#8217; to be confusing and overloaded, Brave Talk refers to the setting as &#8220;Video Bridge Encryption,&#8221; he also told us, adding: &#8220;End to end encrypted calls are just one dimension of privacy and security when participating in video calls. Even when using encryption, most of the &#8216;Big Tech&#8217; video tools actively collect and store data about your call: Who the participants were, when the call took place and for how long, and a host of other information.</p>
<p>&#8220;The anonymous credential system employed by Brave Talk ensures that we don&#8217;t know who users are and who they are talking to, and we can&#8217;t link them across sessions. Brave Talk is a privacy-by-default tool that does not track users.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pushed for more clarity on the difference between Video Bridge Encryption (VBE) and E2EE, he also told TechCrunch: &#8220;The reason that we refer to it as &#8216;Video Bridge Encryption&#8217; and not &#8216;End to End Encryption&#8217; is that, while VBE does ensure that audio and video remain encrypted from Brave, 8&#215;8, and any other passive eavesdroppers, we are still working with 8&#215;8 on a way to make this more robust against active attackers by automatically authenticating meeting participants.</p>
<p>&#8220;When that work is complete, we will feel comfortable introducing it as full end to end encryption, and it will provide significant advantages over platforms like Zoom, which require participants to read a security code out loud to confirm end to end encryption is working.&#8221;</p>
<p>Internet users wanting to kick the tyres of <a href="https://talk.brave.com">Brave Talk</a> &#8212; which was previously called Brave Together &#8212; will first need to download the Brave browser in order to initiate a call. Receiving calls doesn&#8217;t require using Brave, as mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Per Eich, Brave recently passed 36 million monthly active users across its suite of anti-tracking products &#8212; which also includes a search engine and a Firewall+VPN.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Sethi draws on her decade-plus cybersecurity experience to talk about the role of the modern CISO and how the next-generation of CISOs can stay ahead.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Starting a new job can be stressful at the best of times. During lockdown, it can be a real challenge.</p>
<p>Rinki Sethi joined Twitter as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/twitter-ciso-rinki-sethi/">its chief information officer a year ago</a> during the peak of the pandemic. Like most companies, Twitter had closed its offices, requiring its thousands of employees — and new hires — to work from home. For someone who thrives in the office, Sethi said going in as a new, entirely remote employee came with its own complexities.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you&#8217;re leading a security organization, one of the biggest things is trust, and one of the things you have to lean in on is building trust with the people that are driving security — your own team,&#8221; Sethi said during a wide-ranging virtual fireside interview at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021. Building those working relationships over video calls is much tougher, she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m used to doing that in person.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sethi is no stranger to cybersecurity and has previously held senior cybersecurity positions at IBM, Intuit, Palo Alto Networks, and most recently served as Rubrik&#8217;s CISO. Now as Twitter&#8217;s CISO, she oversees efforts to protect Twitter&#8217;s information and technology assets — entirely remotely for the time being. While that comes with its own challenges, there have also been upsides.</p>
<p>The pandemic didn&#8217;t just change how companies respond to cyber threats, it changed how we work. Remote work has broken down barriers to the global talent pool, once restricted by who could relocate to be near the office. We&#8217;re talking more about mental health in the workplace, and there&#8217;s a greater focus than ever on the people that keep companies running.</p>
<p>These factors don&#8217;t just make for a stronger workforce, they make for a more secure workforce. &#8220;There&#8217;s some &#8216;people-aspect&#8217; to everything,&#8221; said Sethi. &#8220;Making sure your employees are feeling good; that they&#8217;re able to do their best work; that they&#8217;re mentally in a good space. I think that&#8217;s one of the most important things that tools, technology, applications and monitoring are not going to be able to solve for.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup called <a href="https://lounge.place/">Lounge</a> wants to reimagine work for the fully remote era where tools like Slack, Zoom, and Teams have fallen short in terms of helping companies build culture and creating relationships between employees who have never yet met in person &#8212; and now, it seems, never will. Instead of offering message boards and profiles that reduce a user&#8217;s identity to a photo and short bio, Lounge&#8217;s richer profiles aim to communicate more about the person, like their timezone, weather, location, team, and their participation in company events &#8212; like a steps or meditation challenge. It also offers tools that allow employees to get to know one another and connect on a more personal level, like drop-in audio chat and photo sharing.</p>
<p>The idea for Lounge comes from co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexyoungkwon/">Alex Kwon</a>, CEO, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?keywords=jason%20jardim&amp;origin=RICH_QUERY_SUGGESTION&amp;position=1&amp;searchId=cff5403e-0bb7-4a9b-9793-153091a4c6a3&amp;sid=h%3Bf">Jason Jardim</a>, CTO, who had previously worked together at Life360. During the pandemic, the two had been developing a family to-do list type of app while working remotely. While that project was scrapped, the co-founders learned a lot about remote work &#8212; and its pitfalls &#8212; during this time.</p>
<p>Kwon had never before worked remotely, he says, and found the experience lacking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doing a once-a-day stand-up on a Zoom call and then just being chatty here and there with a one-hour delay on Slack was just way too lonely for me,&#8221; he explains.</p>
<p>He said it lacked the same magical spark you get from having real conversations with co-workers, which can also often lead to new ideas. That type of in-person collaboration is one key reason why many <a href="https://www.idropnews.com/news/apple-employees-are-leaving-over-inflexible-remote-work-policies/163620/">companies</a> want their staff back in the office, pandemic or not.</p>
<p>But Kwon believes in-person is not the only way to introduce camaraderie among a team and grow a company&#8217;s culture.</p>
<p>&#8220;People have been [forming] relationships online ever since the origin of the internet,&#8221; he says. &#8220;People meet in games and get married online in World of Warcraft. And the majority of my friends now have met their significant others on dating apps. And where do they start? Online.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So if friendship and love can happen online, Kwon argues, then work-related camaraderie can, too.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2206712" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2206712" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2206712" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-rooms.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-rooms.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-rooms.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-rooms.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-rooms.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-rooms.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-rooms.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-rooms.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2206712" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lounge</p></div></p>
<p>The co-founders began experimenting with ways to feel more connected, including at one point, a 24/7 Zoom call so they could just chat as inspiration struck. But that felt too invasive and kids were often interrupting. Always-on audio had a similar problem. This ultimately led to the development of a simple app that allowed them to quickly connect over audio chats with just a tap, but while respecting each other&#8217;s privacy.</p>
<p>The success of this app to solve their own remote work issues led them to scrap their to-do list startup idea and work on Lounge instead.</p>
<p>Today, Lounge presents employees as visualizations of virtual desks which are grouped by teams, projects, or even by hobby or interests. That way, it&#8217;s easy to see who&#8217;s working on what, similar to how company org charts would work. But the desks offer a more personalized experience. The visualizations reflect the person&#8217;s time zone and even their weather, by including little windows that let you see if it&#8217;s nighttime or daytime, for instance. You&#8217;ll also see the person&#8217;s profile photo and other data &#8212; like the steps they&#8217;ve taken a company-wide challenge.</p>

<p>In addition to the employees&#8217; own desks, Lounge also introduces the concepts of multi-person &#8220;rooms.&#8221; Unlike Slack channels focused only on topics or projects, Rooms can be designed to serve almost any purpose. They can even represent a virtual version of what in traditional offices would have been a physical space. You may join rooms for townhall meetings or whiteboard sessions or even hang out virtually with fellow teammates in a public room like the company cafeteria, for example.</p>
<p>Rooms can be locked or unlocked. If you&#8217;re heads-down on a project, you don&#8217;t have to respond to your visitors &#8212; you can lock the room instead. Visitors can then leave a private DM by typing into the chat, as you would with Slack. But if a room is open, you can click to engage with the co-worker synchronously over audio. This is the virtual version of walking up to someone&#8217;s desk and saying hi, except now you&#8217;re using an online tool to do so. The other person will hear your greeting then unmute themselves to respond and have an audio conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of it as a combination of Zoom calls and Slack,&#8221; says Kwon.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2206713" style="width: 323px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2206713" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2206713" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-photos.png?w=313" alt="" width="313" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-photos.png 776w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-photos.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-photos.png?resize=138,300 138w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-photos.png?resize=768,1669 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-photos.png?resize=313,680 313w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-photos.png?resize=707,1536 707w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/lounge-photos.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2206713" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Lounge</p></div></p>
<p>Lounge is also working on a photo-sharing feature, inspired by Kwon&#8217;s earlier startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/oneminute">Oneminute</a>, which allows people to snap and share random photos that would then appear on their virtual desks for a time and in other places in the app. The idea here is to give people a sense of what you&#8217;re up to or to share something more personal &#8212; like a photo of your dog or a weekend hobby. This is something employees already do in Slack channels today. But now they could contribute to an ongoing stream of shared photos that could help new hires learn about their teammates and find reasons to start chatting with them.</p>
<p>The startup has been in private beta with select customers since April but has hundreds of signups on its waitlist. So far, it&#8217;s been targeting smaller teams under 20 employees. Today, Lounge is launching into an open beta, with apps for Mac, web, and iOS being prioritized.</p>
<p>Lounge has raised $1.2 million in funding from investors including Unusual Ventures, Hustle Fund, Translink, Unpopular Ventures, and other angels.</p>
