										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What&#8217;s it like raising a round in 2021? How has it changed over the last few months, as some glimmer of normalcy seems, at least, within reach? What do early-stage founders (and investors!) need to know about the current state of the industry?</p>
<p>Few are in a better place to outline this than Avlok Kohli, the CEO of <a href="https://angel.co/v/venture">AngelList Venture</a> who will let you know at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2?promo=angelistventurepost">TC Early Stage on July 8-9</a>. With more than $2.2 billion in assets under management and over 5,000 startups funded on the platform, AngelList has data-driven insights that just about no one else could offer. Kohli joined AngelList Venture as CEO in mid-2019, giving him a remarkably unique view of the industry through a particularly wild time.</p>
<p>Kohli also knows what it&#8217;s like to be a founder, having been in that seat multiple times. In 2014 he founded Fastbite, a low-cost meal delivery service; in 2015, he <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/08/square-caviar-fastbite/">sold it to Square</a>. He dove back in with a daily house cleaning service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/15/fairy-housecleaning/">called Fairy</a> in 2017, and sold it to Postmates at the beginning of 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;re super excited to announce that Avlok Kohli will join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2?promo=angelistventurepost">TC Early Stage on July 8-9</a> to get us all up to speed on the state of play in early-stage investing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Washington DC Attorney General Karl Racine announced a new antitrust suit against Amazon Tuesday, accusing the company of stifling competition by exerting control over third-party sellers.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in DC Superior Court, alleges that Amazon fixed prices on its massive online retail platform by blocking third-party sellers from selling their products for less elsewhere. Racine argues that this kind of arrangement means that sellers roll Amazon&#8217;s hefty fees into their prices, creating an &#8220;artificially high&#8221; price floor across the online retail market.</p>
<p>That practice may run afoul of the District of Columbia’s Antitrust Act. The AG&#8217;s office argues that the practice allows Amazon to exert monopoly power in online retail.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Amazon has used its dominant position in the online retail market to win at all costs. It maximizes its profits at the expense of third-party sellers and consumers, while harming competition, stifling innovation, and illegally tilting the playing field in its favor,&#8221; Racine said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We filed this antitrust lawsuit to put an end to Amazon’s illegal control of prices across the online retail market. We need a fair online marketplace that expands options available to District residents and promotes competition, innovation, and choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DC AG lawsuit is the latest state-level effort to take tech&#8217;s most powerful companies down a notch. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/google-state-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-paxton/">Google</a> are both facing multi-state lawsuits for alleged anticompetitive behavior, even as federal lawmakers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/klobuchar-antitrust-law-enforcement-reform-act-booker-markey/">creep toward major antitrust reform</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.whatnot.com">Whatnot</a> exists with one primary goal in mind: to give people a place to buy and sell collectibles (like Pokémon cards, sports cards, pins, etc) in a safe, authenticated way.</p>
<p>The company started out with intentions of being a GOAT/StockX-style resale marketplace, where the products up for sale lived on neat little pages with row after row of static images. As they started experimenting with other formats, they found one that really seemed to catch on: livestream sales. Think QVC or the Home Shopping Network&#8230; but instead of hosts in huge studios selling jewelry and patio furniture, it&#8217;s users with smartphones selling Charizard cards and Yoda figurines.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2088789" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2088789" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2088789" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatnot-auction.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="637" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatnot-auction.jpg 1449w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatnot-auction.jpg?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatnot-auction.jpg?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatnot-auction.jpg?resize=768,478 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatnot-auction.jpg?resize=680,423 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/whatnot-auction.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2088789" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Whatnot</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/whatnot-wants-to-be-the-goat-of-collectible-toys-starting-with-funko-pop-figurines/">wrote about Whatnot last year</a>. In the short time since, the company has raised three increasingly large rounds: $4 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/whatnot-raises-4m-as-it-gets-into-livestreamed-auctions-and-pokemon-cards/">in December</a>, $20 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/whatnot-raises-20m-for-its-live-streaming-platform-built-for-selling-pokemon-cards-and-other-collectibles/">in March</a>, and, as of this morning, another $50 million.</p>
<p>While Whatnot still offers the more standard product pages to give sellers a 24/7 presence on the site, the livestreaming side of things has become the primary driver — by far. Co-founder Grant LaFontaine tells me that livestreaming is currently &#8220;95% of the focus&#8221;; it&#8217;s where most of their sales are happening, and what users seem to care most about.</p>
<p>Another thing users seem to care about? Sports cards. Whatnot opened up the site to sports card sellers in January, and it almost immediately took over as the site&#8217;s best selling category. The one category now accounts for &#8220;millions of dollars&#8221; in sales each month, the company says.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Whatnot team itself is growing quickly as well. When I first spoke to them, it was just a handful of employees; by January of this year, they were up to ten. Today it&#8217;s 45 fulltimers. By the end of the year, says Grant, they expect to be nearing one hundred.</p>
<p>While anyone can sell on Whatnot&#8217;s marketplace, only users that have been vetted/invited can sell via livestream. This helps to keep fraud low; sellers know that if they try to sneak in fake cards or rip anyone off, their access to livestreaming — and thus their audience — could vanish.</p>
<p>The company tells me that this Series B round was led by Anu Hariharan of Y Combinator Continuity fund, and backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Animal Capital, and a number of angels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Salesforce dominates the world of CRM today, but while it&#8217;s a popular and well-used tool for organizing contacts and information, it doesn&#8217;t have all the answers when it comes to helping salespeople and marketers sell better, especially when meetings are not in person. Today, one of the startups that has emerged to help fill the gap is announcing a round of growth funding on the back of a huge year for its business.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.qualified.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qualified</a> &#8212; which builds better interactions for B2B sales and marketing teams that already use Salesforce by tapping into extra data sources to develop a better profile of those visiting your website, in aid of improving and personalizing the outreach (hence the name: you&#8217;re building <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_generation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;qualified&#8221; leads</a>) &#8212; has picked up $51 million in funding. The startup will be using the Series B to continue building out its business with more functionality in the platform, and hiring across the board to expand business development and more.</p>
<p>Led by Salesforce Ventures, the funding round also included Norwest Venture Partners and Redpoint Ventures, both previous backers, among others. As with so many rounds at the moment &#8212; the venture world is flush with funding at the moment &#8212; this one is coming less than a year after Qualified&#8217;s last raise. It closed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/qualified-series-a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$12 million Series A</a> in August of last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Qualified was co-founded by two Salesforce veterans &#8212; ex-Salesforce CMO Kraig Swensrud and ex-SVP of Salesforce.com Sean Whiteley &#8212; serial entrepreneurs who you could say have long been hammering away at the challenges of building digital tools for sales and marketing people to do their jobs better online. The pair have founded and sold two other startups filling holes to that end: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/12/getfeedback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GetFeedback</a>, acquired by <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/newsroom/surveymonkey-to-acquire-getfeedback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SurveyMonkey</a>; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2006/08/21/salesforce-dives-deep-into-google-adwords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kieden, acquired by Salesforce</a>.</p>
<p>The gap that they&#8217;re aiming to fill with this latest venture is the fact that when sales and marketing teams want to connect with prospects directly through, say, a phone call, they might have all of that contact&#8217;s information at their disposal. But if those teams want to make a more engaged contact when someone is visiting their site &#8212; a sign that a person is actually interested and thinking already about engaging with a company &#8212; usually the sales and marketing teams are in the dark about who those visitors are.</p>
<p>&#8220;We founded Qualified on the premise that a website should be more than a marketing brochure, but not just a sales site,&#8221; Swensrud, who is the CEO, said in an interview.</p>
<p>Qualified has built a tool that essentially takes several signals from Salesforce as well as other places to build up some information about the site visitor. It then uses it to give the sales and marketing teams more of a steer so that when they reach out via a screen chat to say &#8220;how can I help?&#8221; they actually have more information and can target their questions in a better way. A sales or marketing rep might know which pages a person is also visiting, and can then use the conversation that starts with an online chat to progress to a voice or video call, or a meeting.</p>
<p>If a person is already in your Salesforce rolodex, you get more information; but even without that there is some detail provided to be slightly less impersonal. (Example: when I logged into Qualified to look around the site, a chat popped up with a person greeting me &#8220;across the pond&#8221;&#8230; I&#8217;m in London.)</p>
<p>Qualified also integrates with a number of other tools that are used to help source data and build its customer profiles, including <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Slack, Microsoft Teams, 6sense, Demandbase, Marketo, HubSpot, Oracle Eloqua, Clearbit, ZoomInfo and Outreach.</span></p>
<p>Additional data is part and parcel of the kinds of information that sales and marketing people always need when reaching out to prospective customers, whether it&#8217;s via a &#8220;virtual&#8221; digital channel or in person. However, in the last year &#8212; where in-person meetings, team meetings, and working side-by-side with those who can give advice have all disappeared &#8212; having extra tools like these arguably have proven indispensable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sales reps would heavily rely on their ‘road warrior’ image,&#8221; Swensrud said. &#8220;But all that stuff is gone, so as a result every seller is sitting at an office, at home, expecting digital interactions to happen that never existed before.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it seems some believe that even outside of Covid-19 enforcing a different way of doing things, the trend for &#8220;virtual selling&#8221;, as it&#8217;s often called, is here to stay: Gartner forecasts that by 2025, some 80% of B2B sales interactions will take place in digital channels. (So long to the expense account lunch, I guess.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s because of the events of 2020, plus those bigger trends, that Qualified has seen revenues in the last year grow some 800% and its net customer revenue retention rate hover at 175%, with funding rounds come in relatively close succession in the wake of that.</p>
<p>There is something interesting to Qualified that reminds me a bit of more targeted ad retargeting, as it were, and in that, you can imagine a lot of other opportunities for how Qualified might expand in scenarios where it would be more useful to know why someone is visiting your site, without outright asking them and bothering them with the question. That could include customer service, or even a version that might sell better to consumers coming to, say, a clothes site after reading something about orange being the new black.</p>
<p>For now, though, it&#8217;s focused on the B2B opportunity.</p>
<p>There are a number of tools on the market that are competing with Salesforce as the go-to platform for people to organise and run CRM operations, but Swensrud is bullish for now on the idea of building specifically for the Salesforce ecosystem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our product is being driven by and runs on Salesforce,&#8221; he noted, pointing out that it&#8217;s through Salesforce that you&#8217;re able to go from chatting to a phone call by routing the information to the data you have on file there. &#8220;Our roots go very deep.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding round today is a sign that Salesforce is also happy with that close arrangement, which gives it a customization that its competitors lack.</p>
<p>“Qualified represents an entirely new way for B2B companies to engage buyers,” said Bill Patterson, EVP of CRM Applications at Salesforce, in a statement. “When marketing and inbound sales teams use this solution with Sales Cloud&#8230; they see a notable impact on pipeline. We are thrilled about our growing partnership with Qualified and their success within the Salesforce ecosystem.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ontvpass.com/">Struum</a>, the new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/former-disney-and-discovery-execs-to-launch-struum-a-classpass-for-streaming-services/">streaming service from former Disney and Discovery execs</a>, is today officially launching to the public. Unlike traditional on-demand streamers, such as Netflix, the Struum model is more akin to a &#8220;ClassPass for streaming,&#8221; as its plan is to aggregate content from smaller video services then provide access under its own subscription.</p>
<p>Today, the streaming landscape is dominated by larger subscription services, including Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, HBO Max, Disney+, and YouTube, who together have a 75% share of the market, according to Nielsen. But Struum believes there&#8217;s a potential for another service powered by the long tail of  the over 250 niche and speciality streamers.</p>
<p>Many of these smaller services offer their own subscriptions, but will never achieve Netflix-size scale because of their more limited catalog and scope. Struum offers them an alternative path to revenue. Each month, Struum customers will pay a $4.99 subscription fee to access the Struum app where they&#8217;re then provided with 100 &#8220;credits&#8221; they can use to sample and consume content &#8212; just as ClassPass did with gym classes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over time, if the customer continues to use their subscription to routinely access content from one service, they can then opt to become a subscriber to that service from within the Struum app. This part of the business isn&#8217;t all that different from Amazon Prime Video Channels or others like it. But the difference is that Struum&#8217;s sampling model is what helped the customer discover the niche streamer in the first place.</p>
<p>Struum, meanwhile, generates its own revenue from customers&#8217; subscriptions, which it shares with its content partners. It won&#8217;t say what sort of cut it takes, however.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2156741" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2156741" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2156741" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Struum-Browse-04-12-21.jpg?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Struum-Browse-04-12-21.jpg 751w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Struum-Browse-04-12-21.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Struum-Browse-04-12-21.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Struum-Browse-04-12-21.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Struum-Browse-04-12-21.jpg?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Struum-Browse-04-12-21.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2156741" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Struum</p></div></p>
<p>At launch, there are more than 25 partners available through the Struum app, including Tastemade, Tribeca, Cheddar News, Kocowa, Dekkoo, Magellan TV, History Hit, Gusto, Young Hollywood, Indieflix, Filmbox, Echoboom Sports, Social Club TV, Cinedigm, Magnolia Pictures, Little Dot Studios, Group 9, Stingray and SPI/Filmhub.</p>
<p>Later this summer, the lineup will grow to more than 50 partners, with additions that include BBC SELECT, REVOLT, France Channels, InsightTV, Docubay, FuelTV, The Great Courses Signature Collection, Shout Factory TV, OUTtv, SVTV, CGOOD TV and Alchimie.</p>
<p>In total, Struum&#8217;s partners will provide customers with access to tens of movies and TV shows across a range of categories and genres, like classic films, indies, foreign content, cult hits, lifestyle programming, reality, true crime, and more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2156737" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2156737" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2156737" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Struum-MyContent-04-12-21.jpg?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Struum-MyContent-04-12-21.jpg 751w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Struum-MyContent-04-12-21.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Struum-MyContent-04-12-21.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Struum-MyContent-04-12-21.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Struum-MyContent-04-12-21.jpg?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Struum-MyContent-04-12-21.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2156737" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Struum</p></div></p>
<p>Struum&#8217;s app guides users to their interests through a simple interface where it curates content into editorial groupings organized much like the rows of recommendations you&#8217;d find in Netflix. This includes the company&#8217;s own picks (&#8220;Struum Selects&#8221;), as well as groupings by genre &#8212; like Comedy, Action Thrillers, LGBTQ + Documentaries, Class Movies, Incredible Science, and others. You can also browse by type from categories across the top, to filter by only Movies, TV shows or Shorts.</p>
<p>When you find something you want to watch, you can click a button to stream the content for a certain amount of credits. You can then view that content at any time for the next 30 days and even download it for offline access.</p>
<p>At launch, Struum&#8217;s service is available on iOS and web, and supports AirPlay and Chromecast. This summer, it will expand to more platforms, including Android, Apple TV, Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, and Roku.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2156740" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2156740" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2156740" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Struum-Details-04-12-21.jpg?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Struum-Details-04-12-21.jpg 751w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Struum-Details-04-12-21.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Struum-Details-04-12-21.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Struum-Details-04-12-21.jpg?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Struum-Details-04-12-21.jpg?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Struum-Details-04-12-21.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2156740" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Struum</p></div></p>
<p>The idea for the company comes from founders Lauren DeVillier, the former head of Product for Discovery Ventures; Eugene Liew, former vice president of Product and Technology at Disney+; Paul Pastor, former executive vice president of Strategy, Revenue and Operations at Discovery Networks; and Thomas Wadsworth, the former lead of Advanced Product Development for Walt Disney Imagineering.</p>
<p>The team came together in 2020, just before the Covid-19 pandemic broke out across the U.S., which drove increased demand for streaming content. And though that demand may be here to stay, it remains to be seen whether Struum&#8217;s ClassPass-like model makes the best sense for streaming&#8217;s long tail.</p>
<p>Despite its unique streaming business model, the service will effectively compete with AVOD (ad-supported video on demand) players in terms of aggregating both older and niche content. AVOD services &#8212; like Tubi, Pluto TV, The Roku Channel, IMDb TV, and others &#8212; also help users who can&#8217;t find anything they want to watch on their preferred paid subscription apps. And they often aid consumers who are in search of a particular movie or show but don&#8217;t want to pay for a rental. Struum believes by aggregating content it can encourage these users to pay for yet another subscription.</p>
<p>In other words, Struum will have to convince users to change their existing TV habits in order to find success, and that&#8217;s a risky bet.</p>
<p>But Struum believes the fragmentation of the streaming market may actually work in its favor. As consumers get fed up so many different services and content that jumps around as rights owners forge new licensing agreements, Struum could step in as someone&#8217;s fourth subscription.</p>
<p>We view ourselves as the ultimate complementary service and a perfect fit for TV and film lovers who are increasingly frustrated by the costs, complexity and effort required to discover and watch what they want,&#8221; noted Struum CEO Lauren DeViller.</p>
<p>Struum is backed by a multi-million-dollar investment from former Disney CEO Michael Eisner through his firm, Tornante Company. Other investors include Firstlight Media, whose technology powers the video service, and Gaingels, which focuses on backing LGBTQ+ founders and allies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the major issues facing companies these days isn&#8217;t finding relevant data, so much as moving it to where it&#8217;s needed. Enter <a href="https://airbyte.io/">Airbyte</a>, an early stage startup that is building an open source data integration platform to help solve that problem. Today the company announced a $26 million Series A, just a couple of months after announcing its $5.2 million seed round.</p>
<p>Benchmark led the investment with help from 8VC, Accel, SV Angel, Y Combinator and multiple tech industry luminaries. The company has raised over $31 million, all of it coming this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re building is an open source data integration platform to bring data wherever it is, whether it&#8217;s a database, a file or an API into the destination of your choice whether it is a data warehouse or a data lake,&#8221; company co-founder and CEO Michel Tricot told TechCrunch. This involves building connectors to various data types. The company is providing the open source platform and an SDK to build connectors, and inviting the community to add their own connectors, while building some too.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Things are moving quickly for the startup. In addition to the funding, it released its Connected Development Kit or CDK earlier this month. &#8220;It&#8217;s a local framework that enables you to build a custom connector within two hours instead of two or three days,&#8221; company co-founder John Lafleur explained. To this point, the community has contributed approximately 20% of the platform&#8217;s 70 connectors, but the two founders expect that percentage to increase as the CDK has time to spread in the community.</p>

<p>Airbyte was founded just last year and the company plans to spend this year trying to expand the rapidly growing community, which is up to 1200 members and 500 active users to this point. The long-term plan is to build a hosted version, which they will charge for, while continuing to work on the open source project.</p>
<p>Chetan Puttagunta, general partner at Benchmark, who is leading today&#8217;s investment, says that Benchmark has a long history of investing in open source startups including being an early investor in Red Hat, as well as Elastic, MongoDB, Acquia and many others.</p>
<p>He says that his firm approached Airbyte after seeing a lot of developer activity in the community in a short time. &#8220;We reached out to them just based on our involvement in the developer community. We started seeing Airbyte spike everywhere, and it started to become very quickly the de facto standard for how folks wanted to integrate data. And that was a remarkable achievement for a company that has been around for just several months.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rapid growth has led to the number of employees doubling to 14 in a short time. When it comes to diversity and inclusion, the founders have actually <a href="https://handbook.airbyte.io/">written a company handbook</a> that includes a detailed section with definitions and goals <a href="https://handbook.airbyte.io/company/diversity-inclusion-and-belonging">around diversity and inclusion</a>, not something you often see from an early stage company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We try to constantly improve on diversity inclusion and belonging, which is a continuous [thing]. [We] never would think it was done, We always have room to improve,&#8221; Tricot said.</p>

		<blockquote>
			Expensify may be the most ambitious software company ever to mostly abandon the Bay Area as the center of its operations.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s history is tied to places representative of San Francisco: The founding team worked out of Peet&#8217;s Coffee on Mission Street for a few months, then crashed at a penthouse lounge near the 4th and King Caltrain station, followed by a tiny office and then a slightly bigger one in the Flatiron building near Market Street.</p>
<p>Thirteen years later, Expensify still has an office a few blocks away on Kearny Street, but it&#8217;s no longer a San Francisco company or even a Silicon Valley firm. The company is truly global with employees across the world — and it did that before COVID-19 made remote working cool.</p>
<p>&#8220;Things got so much better when we stopped viewing ourselves as a Silicon Valley company. We basically said, no, we&#8217;re just a global company,&#8221; CEO David Barrett told TechCrunch. That globalism led to it opening a major office in — of all places —a small town in rural Michigan. That Ironwood expansion would eventually lead to a cultural makeover that would see the company broadly abandon its focus on the Bay Area, expanding from a headquarters in Portland to offices around the globe.</p>
<p>It makes sense that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/">a company founded by internet pirates</a> would let its workforce live anywhere they please and however they want to. Yet, how does it manage to make it all work well enough to reach $100 million in annual revenue with just a tad more than 100 employees?</p>
<p>As I described in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/expensify-ec1-culture/">Part 2 of this EC-1</a>, that staffing efficiency is partly due to its culture and who it hires. It&#8217;s also because it has attracted top talent from across the world by giving them benefits like the option to work remotely all year as well as paying SF-level salaries even to those not based in the tech hub. It&#8217;s also got annual fully paid month-long &#8220;workcations&#8221; for every employee, their partner and kids.</p>
<p>Yet the real story is how a company can become untethered from its original geography, willing to adapt to new places and new cultures, and ultimately, give up the past while building the future.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[TechCrunch sat down with Brian Chesky, Airbnb co-founder and CEO, to discuss the future of travel and what it was like leading the world's biggest travel startup during a global pandemic.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As we transition from the pandemic to whatever comes next, Airbnb is evolving. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/airbnb-doubles-down-on-flexible-search-improves-the-host-flow-in-preparation-for-summer-2021/">announced a major redesign of its website</a> and introduced a bevy of features focused on both hosts and guests today. All told, the release includes more than 100 new features or upgrades, with the goal of increasing and diversifying the supply side of the business to not only fuel overall growth but also meet the changing demands of guests.</p>
<p>The changes come in response to the way travel has evolved during the pandemic; Airbnb as a company has changed, too.</p>
<p>TechCrunch sat down with Brian Chesky, Airbnb co-founder and CEO, to discuss the future of travel, how his company worked to support a changing market and what it was like leading the world&#8217;s biggest travel startup during a global pandemic.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about today&#8217;s update, you can check out our article on it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/airbnb-doubles-down-on-flexible-search-improves-the-host-flow-in-preparation-for-summer-2021/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The TL;DR version is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>New search flexibility around dates, destinations and matching criteria.</li>
<li>Easier onboarding and efficiency for hosts.</li>
<li>Increased and enhanced customer support.</li>
</ul>
<p>From a very high level, the first change is designed to help drive demand, the second to boost supply and the third to keep both sides of the marketplace healthy.</p>
<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s interview with Chesky follows. It has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: A lot of the announcement today comes from the fact that we&#8217;ve been through more than a year of a pandemic and travel has evolved, and you are responding to that. As a CEO, you&#8217;ve been through so many big moments, from the IPO to the early launch days to a long regulatory journey. Where does leading a company during a pandemic fit into the CEO journey for you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brian Chesky:</strong> Yeah, Jordan, I would probably say that I never thought we would do anything as crazy as starting Airbnb. I kind of assumed, until last year, that that would probably be the craziest story I&#8217;ll ever have. Little did I know that a travel company in a pandemic might even be crazier than starting a company based on strangers living together. I kind of feel like I&#8217;m now 39 going on 49. It was definitely the craziest year ever.</p>
<p>Our business initially dropped 80% in eight weeks. I say it&#8217;s like driving a car. You can&#8217;t go 80 miles an hour, slam on the brakes, and expect nothing really bad to happen. Now imagine you&#8217;re going 80 miles an hour, slam on the brakes, then rebuild the car kind of while still moving, and then try to accelerate into an IPO, all on Zoom.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft today announced PyTorch Enterprise, a new Azure service that provides developers with additional support when using PyTorch on Azure. It&#8217;s basically Microsoft&#8217;s commercial support offering for PyTorch.</p>
<p><a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> is a Python-centric open-source machine learning framework with a focus on computer vision and natural language processing. It was originally developed by Facebook and is, at least to some degree, comparable to Google&#8217;s popular TensorFlow framework.</p>
<p>Frank X. Shaw, Microsoft&#8217;s corporate VP for communications, described the new PyTorch Enterprise service as providing developers with &#8220;a more reliable production experience for organizations using PyTorch in their data sciences work.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With PyTorch Enterprise, members of Microsoft&#8217;s Premier and Unified support program will get benefits like prioritized requests, hands-on support and solutions for hotfixes, bugs and security patches, Shaw explained. Every year, Microsoft will also select one PyTorch version for long-term support.</p>
<p>Azure already made it <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/develop/pytorch/">relatively easy to use PyTorch</a>, and Microsoft has long invested in the library by, for example, taking over the development of PyTorch for Windows <a href="https://pytorch.org/blog/microsoft-becomes-maintainer-of-the-windows-version-of-pytorch/">last year</a>. As Microsoft noted in today&#8217;s announcement, the latest release of PyTorch will be integrated with Azure Machine Learning and the company promises to feed back to the public PyTorch distribution the PyTorch code it gets from developers.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TCFgTT5AZS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/5-machine-learning-essentials-non-technical-leaders-need-to-understand/">5 machine learning essentials nontechnical leaders need to understand</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;5 machine learning essentials nontechnical leaders need to understand&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/5-machine-learning-essentials-non-technical-leaders-need-to-understand/embed/#?secret=TCFgTT5AZS" data-secret="TCFgTT5AZS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Enterprise support will be available for PyTorch version 1.8.1 and up on Windows 10 and a number of popular Linux distributions.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new enterprise-level offering by Microsoft closes an important gap. PyTorch gives our researchers unprecedented flexibility in designing their models and running their experiments,&#8221; said Jeremy Jancsary, senior principal research scientist at Nuance. &#8220;Serving these models in production, however, can be a challenge. The direct involvement of Microsoft lets us deploy new versions of PyTorch to Azure with confidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this new offering, Microsoft is taking a page out of the open-source monetization playbook for startups by offering additional services on top of an open-source project. Since PyTorch wasn&#8217;t developed by a startup, only to have a major cloud provider then offer its own commercial version on top of the open-source code, this feels like a rather uncontroversial move.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Unlike in other years, this year&#8217;s Microsoft Build developer conference is not packed with huge surprises &#8212; but there&#8217;s one announcement that will surely make developers&#8217; ears perk up: The company is now using OpenAI&#8217;s massive GPT-3 natural language model in its no-code/low-code Power Apps service to translate spoken text into code in its recently announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-launches-power-fx-a-new-open-source-low-code-language-for-its-power-platform/">Power Fx language</a>.</p>
<p>Now don&#8217;t get carried away. You&#8217;re not going to develop the next TikTok while only using natural language. Instead, what Microsoft is doing here is taking some of the low-code aspects of a tool like Power Apps and using AI to essentially turn those into no-code experiences, too. For now, the focus here is on Power Apps formulas, which despite the low-code nature of the service, is something you&#8217;ll have to write sooner or later if you want to build an app of any sophistication.</p>
<p>&#8220;Using an advanced AI model like this can help our low-code tools become even more widely available to an even bigger audience by truly becoming what we call no code,&#8221; said Charles Lamanna, corporate vice president for Microsoft’s low-code application platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="8I6xrknY62"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-launches-power-fx-a-new-open-source-low-code-language-for-its-power-platform/">Microsoft launches Power Fx, a new open source low-code language</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Microsoft launches Power Fx, a new open source low-code language&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-launches-power-fx-a-new-open-source-low-code-language-for-its-power-platform/embed/#?secret=8I6xrknY62" data-secret="8I6xrknY62" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In practice, this looks like the citizen programmer writing &#8220;find products where the name starts with &#8216;kids&#8217; &#8221; &#8212; and Power Apps then rendering that as <em>&#8220;Filter(‘BC Orders’ Left(‘Product Name’,4)=&#8221;Kids&#8221;)&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p>Because Microsoft is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/22/microsoft-invests-1-billion-in-openai-in-new-multiyear-partnership/">an investor in OpenAI</a>, it&#8217;s no surprise the company chose its model to power this experience.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2156679" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GPT-3-Power-Fx-GIF_Under-embargo-until-May-25-@8am-PT.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2156679" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2156679" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GPT-3-Power-Fx-GIF_Under-embargo-until-May-25-@8am-PT.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2156679" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that while this makes programming easier, Microsoft itself stresses that users still have to understand the logic of the application they are building. &#8220;The features don’t replace the need for a person to understand the code they are implementing but are designed to assist people who are learning the Power Fx programming language and help them choose the right formulas to get the result they need. That can dramatically expand access to more advanced app building and more rapidly train people to use low code tools,&#8221; the company explains in today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>To some degree, this isn&#8217;t all that different from using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/natural-language/q-and-a-intro">natural language query functions</a> that are now available in tools like <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/excel-blog/introducing-natural-language-queries-in-ideas/ba-p/1594687">Excel</a>, PowerBI or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/analyzing-text-in-a-google-sheet-using-cloud-natural-language-api-and-apps-script">Google Sheets</a>. These, too, translate natural language into a formula, after all. GPT-3 is probably a bit more sophisticated than this and capable of understanding more complex queries, but translating natural language into formulas isn&#8217;t all that new.</p>
<p>The long-term promise here, though, is for tools like this to become smarter over time and be able to handle more complicated programming tasks. But that&#8217;s a big step up from what is essentially a translation problem, though. More complex queries require more of an understanding of a program as a whole. A formula, for the most part, is a pretty self-contained statement but a similar model that could generate &#8220;real&#8221; code would have to contend with a lot more context.</p>
<p>These new features will go live in public preview in English to users in North America by the end of June.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its annual Build conference today, Microsoft announced a couple of new features for version 91 of its Edge browser that, like so much at Build this year, aren&#8217;t earth-shattering (developer velocity!) but nice quality-of-life upgrades for its users. Since Microsoft develops Edge in the open, these may also feel familiar to those who keep a close eye on the Edge roadmap &#8212; indeed, I think I&#8217;ve seen most of these in Edge 90 already&#8230;</p>
<p>One new feature is Startup Boost, which allows Edge to start up almost instantly. The way Microsoft does this is pretty straightforward. It simply loads some of the core Edge processes whenever you boot up your Windows machine, so when you task Edge with starting up, there isn&#8217;t all that much work left to do. This shouldn&#8217;t have too much of an effect on your Windows 10 bootup time, so it&#8217;s probably a trade-off worth making, but I also can&#8217;t recall anybody complaining about browser startup times in the last couple of years either.</p>
<p>The other new feature is &#8220;sleeping tabs,&#8221; which does pretty much what you expect it to do. It puts your tabs to sleep so they don&#8217;t use up unnecessary memory and CPU cycles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RDYdmp8WO1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/03/browsers-are-interesting-again/">Browsers are interesting again</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Microsoft first announced that it was testing this feature <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/12/09/sleeping-tabs-beta-performance/">back in December</a>. At the time, the Edge team said that it reduces memory usage by 32% and helps improve battery life as well, given that sleeping tabs use 37% less CPU on average compared to non-sleeping tabs.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Google&#8217;s Chrome browser, which shares much of its underlying technology with Edge, also features tools to limit resource usage, including what Google calls &#8220;tab freezing,&#8221; as does virtually every other major browser today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its (virtual) Build conference today, Microsoft launched a number of new features, tools and services for developers who want to integrate their services with Teams, the company&#8217;s Slack competitor. It&#8217;s no secret that Microsoft basically looks at Teams, which now has about 145 million daily active users, as the new hub for employees to get work done, so it&#8217;s no surprise that it wants third-party developers to bring their services right to Teams as well. And to do so, it&#8217;s now offering a set of new tools that will make this easier and enable developers to build new user experiences in Teams.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot going on here, but maybe the most important news is the launch of the enhanced Microsoft Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code.</p>
<p>&#8220;This essentially enables developers to build apps easier and faster &#8212; and to build very powerful apps tapping into the rich Microsoft stack,&#8221; Microsoft group program manager Archana Saseetharan explained. &#8220;With the updated toolkit [&#8230;], we enable flexibility for developers. We want to meet developers where they are.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2156680" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Shared-Stage-GIF_Under-embargo-until-May-25-@8am-PT.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2156680" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2156680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Shared-Stage-GIF_Under-embargo-until-May-25-@8am-PT.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="562" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2156680" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>The toolkit offers support for tools and frameworks like React, SharePoint and .NET. Some of the updates the team enabled with this release are integration with Aure Functions, the SharePoint Framework integration and a single-line integration with the Microsoft Graph. Microsoft is also making it easier for developers to integrate an authorization workflow into their Teams apps. &#8220;Login is the first kind of experience of any user with an app &#8212; and most of the drop-offs happen there,&#8221; Saseetharan said. &#8220;So [single-sign on] is something we completely are pushing hard on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team also launched a new Developer Portal for Microsoft Teams that makes it easier for developers to register and configure their apps from a single tool. ISVs will also be able to use the new portal to offer their apps for in-Teams purchases.</p>
<p>Other new Teams features for developers include ways for developers to build real-time multi-user experiences like whiteboards and project boards, for example, as well as a new meeting event API to build meeting-related workflows for when a meeting starts and ends, for example, as well as new features for the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/microsoft-makes-teams-video-meetings-less-tiring-with-its-new-together-mode/">Teams Together mode</a> that will let developers design their own Together experiences.</p>
<p>There are a few other new features here as well, but what it all comes down to is that Microsoft wants developers to consider Teams as a viable platform for their services &#8212; and with 145 million daily active users, that&#8217;s potentially a lucrative way for software firms to get their services in front of a new audience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teams is enabling a new class of apps called collaborative apps,&#8221; said Karan Nigam, Microsoft&#8217;s director of product marketing for Teams. &#8220;We are uniquely positioned to bring the richness to the collaboration space &#8212; a ton of innovation to the extensibility side to make apps richer, making it easier with the toolkit update, and then have a single-stop shop with the developer portal where the entire lifecycle can be managed. Ultimately, for a developer, they don&#8217;t have to go to multiple places, it&#8217;s one single flow from the business perspective for them as well.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its Build developer conference today, Microsoft announced a new set of Azure services (in preview) that businesses can now run on virtually any CNCF-conformant Kubernetes cluster with the help of its <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-arc/">Azure Arc</a> multi-cloud service.</p>
<p>Azure Arc, similar to tools like Google&#8217;s Anthos or AWS&#8217;s upcoming <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/eks-anywhere/">EKS Anywhere</a>, provides businesses with a single tool to manage their container clusters across clouds and on-premises data centers. Since its launch back in late 2019, Arc enabled some of the core Azure services to run directly in these clusters as well, though the early focus was on a small set of data services, with the team also later adding some machine learning tools to Arc as well. With today&#8217;s update, the company is greatly expanding this set of containerized Azure services that work with Arc.</p>
<p>These new services include <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/">Azure App Service</a> for building and managing web apps and APIs, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/">Azure Functions</a> for event-driven programming, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/logic-apps/">Azure Logic Apps</a> for building automated workflows, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-grid/">Azure Event Grid</a> for event routing and <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/api-management/">Azure API Management</a> for&#8230; you guessed it&#8230; managing internal and external APIs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The app services are now Azure Arc-enabled, which means customers can deploy Web Apps, Functions, API gateways, Logic Apps and Event Grid services on pre-provisioned Kubernetes clusters,&#8221; Microsoft explained in its annual &#8220;Book of News&#8221; for this year&#8217;s Build. &#8220;This takes advantage of features including deployment slots for A/B testing, storage queue triggers and out-of-box connectors from the app services, regardless of run location. With these portable turnkey services, customers can save time building apps, then manage them consistently across hybrid and multicloud environments using Azure Arc.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The highest chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has delivered a blow to anti-surveillance campaigners in Europe by failing to find that bulk interception of digital comms is inherently incompatible with human rights law &#8212; which enshrines individual rights to privacy and freedom of expression.</p>
<p>However today&#8217;s Grand Chamber <a href="https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng-press#{&quot;itemid&quot;:[&quot;003-7028496-9484349&quot;]}">judgement</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/europes-top-court-confirms-no-mass-surveillance-without-legal-limits/">underscores</a> the need for such intrusive intelligence powers to be operated with what the judges describe as &#8220;end-to-end safeguards&#8221;.</p>
<p>Governments in Europe that fail to do so are opening such laws up to further legal challenge under the European Convention on Human Rights.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Grand Chamber ruling also confirms that the UK&#8217;s historic surveillance regime &#8212; under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (aka RIPA) &#8212; was unlawful because it lacked the necessary safeguards.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Big Brother Watch now out. Looking at the dissents, it does not look good for anti-surveillance campaigners: &#39;with the present judgment the Strasbourg Court has just opened the gates for an electronic “Big Brother” in Europe&#39; <a href="https://t.co/1HqKz64qS5">https://t.co/1HqKz64qS5</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Michael Veale (@mikarv) <a href="https://twitter.com/mikarv/status/1397123680883314689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Per the court, &#8216;end-to-end&#8217; safeguards means that bulk intercept powers need to involve assessments at each stage of the process of the necessity and proportionality of the measures being taken; that bulk interception should be subject to independent authorisation at the outset, when the object and scope of the operation are being defined; and that the operation should be subject to supervision and independent &#8216;ex post facto&#8217; review.</p>
<p>The Grand Chamber judgement identified a number of deficiencies with the bulk regime operated in the UK at the time of RIPA &#8212; including that bulk interception had been authorised by the Secretary of State, rather than by a body independent of the executive; categories of search terms defining the kinds of communications that would become liable for examination had not been included in the application for a warrant; and search terms linked to an individual (e.g. specific identifiers such as an email address) had not been subject to prior internal authorisation.</p>
<p>The court also found that the UK&#8217;s<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> bulk intercept regime had breached Article 10 (freedom of expression) because it had not contained sufficient protections for confidential journalistic material.</span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>While the regime used for obtaining comms data from communication service providers was found to have violated Articles 8 (right to privacy and family life/comms) and 10 &#8220;as it had not been in accordance with the law&#8221;.</p>
<p>However, the court held that the regime by which the UK could request intelligence from foreign governments and/or intelligence agencies had had sufficient safeguards in place to protect against abuse and to ensure that UK authorities had not used such requests as a means of circumventing their duties under domestic law and the Convention.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The Court considered that, owing to the multitude of threats States face in modern society, operating a bulk interception regime did not in and of itself violate the Convention,&#8221; it added in a press release. </span></p>
<p>The RIPA regime has since replaced by the UK&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/29/yes-the-uk-now-has-a-law-to-log-web-users-browsing-behavior-hack-devices-and-limit-encryption/">Investigatory Powers Act</a> (IPA) &#8212; which put bulk intercept powers explicitly into law (albeit with claimed layers of oversight).</p>
<p>The IPA has also been subject to a number of human rights challenges &#8212; and in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43928147">2018</a> the government was ordered by the UK High Court to revise parts of the law which had been found to be incompatible with human rights law.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s Grand Chamber judgement relates specifically to RIPA and to a number of legal challenges brought against the UK&#8217;s mass surveillance regime by journalists and privacy and digital rights campaigners in the wake of the 2013 mass surveillance revelations by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden which the ECHR heard simultaneously.</p>
<p>In a similar ruling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/13/uks-mass-surveillance-regime-violated-human-rights-law-finds-echr/">back in 2018</a> the lower Chamber found some aspects of the UK&#8217;s regime violated human rights law &#8212; with a majority vote then finding that its <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">bulk interception regime had violated Article 8 because there was insufficient oversight (such as of selectors and filtering; and of search and selection of intercepted communications for examination; as well as inadequate safeguards governing the selection of related comms data). </span></p>
<p>Human rights campaigners followed up by requesting and securing a referral to the Grand Chamber &#8212; which has now handed down its view.</p>
<p>It <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">unanimously </span>found there had been a violation of Article 8 <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">in respect of the regime for obtaining communications data from communication service providers.</span></p>
<p>But by <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">12 votes to 5 it ruled there had been no violation of Article 8 in respect of the UK’s regime for requesting intercepted material from foreign governments and intelligence agencies.</span></p>
<p>In another <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">unanimous vote the Grand Chamber found </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">there had been a violation of Article 10, concerning both the bulk interception regime and the regime for obtaining communications data from comms service providers.</span></p>
<p>But, again, by <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">12 votes to 5 it ruled there had been no violation of Article 10 in respect of the regime for requesting intercepted material from foreign governments and intelligence agencies.</span></p>
<p>Responding to the judgement in a <a href="https://bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/2021/05/uk-mass-surveillance-found-unlawful-by-europes-highest-human-rights-court/">statement</a>, the privacy rights group Big Brother Watch &#8212; which was one of the parties involved in the challenges &#8212; said the judgement &#8220;confirms definitively that the UK’s bulk interception practices were unlawful for decades&#8221;, thereby vindicating Snowden&#8217;s whistleblowing.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>&mdash; Big Brother Watch (@BigBrotherWatch) <a href="https://twitter.com/BigBrotherWatch/status/1397186423174967307?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The organization also highlighted a dissenting opinion from Judge Pinto de Alburquerque, who wrote that:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Admitting non-targeted bulk interception involves a fundamental change in how we view crime prevention and investigation and intelligence gathering in Europe, from targeting a suspect who can be identified to treating everyone as a potential suspect, whose data must be stored, analysed and profiled (…) a society built upon such foundations is more akin to a police state than to a democratic society. This would be the opposite of what the founding fathers wanted for Europe when they signed the Convention in 1950.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In further remarks on the judgement, Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, added: &#8220;Mass surveillance damages democracies under the cloak of defending them, and we welcome the Court’s acknowledgement of this. As one judge put it, we are at great risk of living in an electronic &#8216;Big Brother&#8217; in Europe. We welcome the judgment that the UK’s surveillance regime was unlawful, but the missed opportunity for the Court to prescribe clearer limitations and safeguards mean that risk is current and real.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue our work to protect privacy, from parliament to the courts, until intrusive mass surveillance practices are ended,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p><a href="https://privacyinternational.org/press-release/4522/human-rights-groups-win-european-court-human-rights-claim-uk-mass-surveillance">Privacy International</a> &#8212; another party to the case &#8212; sought to put a more positive spin on the outcome, saying the Grand Chamber goes further than the ECHR&#8217;s 2018 ruling by &#8220;providing for new and stronger safeguards, adding a new requirement of prior independent or judicial authorisation for bulk interception&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Authorisation must be meaningful, rigorous and check for proper &#8216;end-to-end safeguards&#8217;,&#8221; it added in a statement.</p>
<p>Also commenting publicly, the Open Rights Group&#8217;s executive director, Jim Killock, said: “The court has shown that the UK Government’s legal framework was weak and inadequate when we took them to court with Big Brother Watch and Constanze Kurz in 2013. The court has set out clear criteria for assessing future bulk interception regimes, but we believe these will need to be developed into harder red lines in future judgments, if bulk interception is not to be abused.&#8221;</p>
<p>“As the court sets out, bulk interception powers are a great power, secretive in nature, and hard to keep in check. We are far from confident that today’s bulk interception is sufficiently safeguarded, while the technical capacities continue to deepen. GCHQ continues to share technology platforms and raw data with the US,&#8221; Killock went on to say, couching the judgment as &#8220;an important step on a long journey&#8221;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even as 2021 shapes up to see a record number of launches, demand is growing fast. Companies like <a href="https://phantomspace.com/">Phantom Space Corporation</a> aim to fill it with mass manufacturing techniques never yet seen in the space industry. Now the company has acquired StratSpace, a satellite program designer and manager, Phantom Space announced Tuesday. It&#8217;s a critical step toward building out a turnkey space transportation and manufacturing service, Phantom Space co-founder Michal Prywata told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“[StratSpace] has all the know-how, all the tools, the satellite structures, communication systems that can make a spacecraft operate,” he explained. “Which is very critical for us, because we want to be one of the first companies that covers that full spectrum of service from start to finish.” The company declined to disclose the terms of the acquisition.</p>
<p>Phantom Space’s bet is that combining a mass rocket manufacturing strategy with acquisitions that position it as a &#8220;one-stop shop&#8221; will help bring down the cost of space access. Prywata said the company’s aiming to charge $4 million for a dedicated launch that would bring up to 450 kilograms to low Earth orbit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We’re talking about hundreds to potentially thousands a year,” Prywata said, referring to the number of launches the company eventually hopes to achieve. “As of right now, the market certainly supports hundreds of launches a year.”</p>
<p>They&#8217;re big aspirations for a company that has not yet begun even flight testing a rocket model. Phantom Space said it is outsourcing many components, like the engine and avionics system, that can take years to develop, to get it there. For other components and services, it&#8217;s looking to use an acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re looking at acquisitions pretty aggressively because we feel there&#8217;s an opportunity now to start integrating these types of technologies and companies within one umbrella and create this overall infrastructure of a company that can take ideas and bring them to space,” he said. That includes building satellites, integration, launch and data communication. “We&#8217;re trying to cover that full spectrum, where we can help other companies that have some application that they want to launch into space, we can help them get there, because we have all these specific pieces that can make it all happen.”</p>
<p>Phantom Space is aiming to launch its two-stage Daytona rocket for the first time in the first quarter of 2023, with stage-level testing commencing in early 2022. Daytona, the company&#8217;s &#8220;workhorse&#8221; launch vehicle, comes in at 61 feet in height and can carry 450 kilograms to LEO on eight engines. While the Daytona is totally expendable, the company has plans to reuse its larger Laguna rocket model.</p>
<p>The company has signed a right of entry for Space Launch Complex 5 at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, which will likely be the location of its first launches. It also just signed an agreement with the Pacific Spaceport Complex in Alaska, where Astra (another company looking toward mass rocket manufacturing) completes its launches, and it’s planning on eventually having launch agreements with Cape Canaveral Spaceport in Florida.</p>

<p>But even if flight testing goes smoothly, reaching hundreds or even thousands of launches per year is still currently impossible given the small number of spaceports in the country.</p>
<p>“That said, having launch capability just in the U.S. isn&#8217;t enough, because you won&#8217;t be able to get to hundreds a year just out of those three sites,” Prywata said. So, the company is also looking at a site in northern Sweden, northern Australia and Brazil. It’s also in talks with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to license spaceports that are restricted to horizontal launches only to allow for vertical launch.</p>
<p>Phantom Space&#8217;s acquisition of StratSpace is only going to be the first of many, Prywata said. “We’re still small so we’re trying to grow aggressively,” he said. “So we’re starting with these smaller acquisitions but very key acquisitions to enable our overall strategy.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">People in a Beijing suburb will begin to see autonomous delivery mini-vans across their neighborhood, moving cautiously alongside human delivery riders belting down the streets.</p>
<p>Beijing has greenlighted JD.com, Meituan and Neolix to trial self-driving delivery vehicles on designated public roads in the Yizhuang Development Area, an economic and technological growth pilot initiated by the municipal government of the capital city, according to an announcement made by local authorities at a mobility conference on Tuesday. Yizhuang has aggressively rolled out 5G coverage in part to<a href="http://www.china.org.cn/china/2019-08/30/content_75155825.htm"> prepare the infrastructure for autonomous driving ventures</a>.</p>
<p>All three companies are using dainty box-on-wheels vehicles similar to those of Nuro to shuffle goods around. Three-year-old Neolix, backed by Chinese electric vehicle startup Li Auto, focuses on making self-driving vehicles for retail, surveillance and other city services, while both JD.com and Meituan are tech heavyweights that find unmanned delivery increasingly important to their existing core business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Online retailer JD.com hires its own in-house delivery staff while Meituan relies on a national network of riders to bring restaurant takeout to customers. Both have been working on autonomous driving technologies internally in recent years and are also testing small fleets of delivery drones in China.</p>
<p>Neolix will place 150 delivery robots on Beijing roads by June. JD.com declined to disclose its deployment number. Meituan can&#8217;t be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>At the Tuesday event, authorities from the Beijing pilot zone also <a href="http://www.chinanews.com/cj/2021/05-25/9485293.shtml">laid out</a> rules for operating zero-occupant delivery vehicles in the area. The robots are categorized as &#8220;non-motor vehicles,&#8221; which suggests they will be moving next to bicycles and electric scooters instead of faster-moving cars. Road conditions in Chinese cities are often much more complicated than in the United States, even on sidewalks and bike lanes thanks to unpredictable pedestrians, unleashed pets and reckless scooter riders.</p>
<p>Importantly, the rules also stipulate that the robots need to have safety drivers &#8220;on the spot and remotely.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2157081" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2157081" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2157081 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46681621951252_.pic_hd.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46681621951252_.pic_hd.jpg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46681621951252_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46681621951252_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46681621951252_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46681621951252_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/46681621951252_.pic_hd.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2157081" class="wp-caption-text">Neolix&#8217;s delivery robot / Photo: Neolix via WeChat</p></div></p>
<p class="p1">JD.com says its technology allows every remote safety driver to monitor up to 50 operating delivery robots simultaneously. Its vehicles will carry packages from logistics centers and supermarkets to nearby office buildings, residential complexes and school campuses. Customers will then fetch their order directly from the van using a pick-up code sent to them through a text message.</p>
<p>Neolix&#8217;s vehicles in the pilot area, in comparison, act more like mobile vending machines peddling snacks and lunchboxes to workers around office complexes. Users can place their order on a little screen attached to the robot, pay by a QR code and get their ice cream or warm bento instantaneously.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Lordstown is not the only SPAC that is going to see some daylight between its pitch and its performance. But it's a pretty stark reminder that SPAC decks are sales pitches, not promises.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The lackluster performance of shares in companies that have combined with special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) in recent quarters took another hit yesterday when Lordstown Motors reported its first-quarter results.</p>
<p>Lordstown, part of a wave of electric-vehicle companies that raised capital and went public via SPACs, announced lower-than-expected 2021 vehicle production, higher capital expenditures (capex) for the year, and the need to raise more capital. For holders of its equity, the news was a disappointment, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/lordstown-motors-slashes-production-forecast-for-its-electric-pickup/">TechCrunch explored after the results dropped</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Shares of Lordstown are down 14% in pre-market trading after falling in after-hours trading yesterday evening.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s more to the Lordstown mess than merely a single bad quarter. What the company reported is somewhat contradicted by its SPAC deck, a document that every startup combining with a blank-check company releases. They are often cheery and full of good news. With just a little capital, the company in question is going to scale rapidly in the coming years, with improving profitability to boot.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1995210" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Then the deal is sold, capital is raised, entities combine, and the startup in question becomes public, with earnings calls commencing on a quarterly cadence. That&#8217;s where the rubber meets the road.</p>
<p>Lordstown&#8217;s earnings mess and the resulting dissonance with its own predictions are notable on their own, but they also point to what could be <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-startup-leaders-spacs-have-lost-their-allure-11621774800?mod=djemalertNEWS">shifting sentiment regarding SPAC combinations</a>. Returns <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c7c0f11c-b678-491d-9173-fe49ea29b4b8">are lackluster</a>, the SEC is <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/spacs-ipos-liability-risk-under-securities-laws">worried about too-rosy forecasts</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/us-congress-hold-hearing-spacs-ramping-up-scrutiny-2021-05-21/">Congress is looking into the boom</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re taking a look into Lordstown&#8217;s results this morning, but don&#8217;t think that we&#8217;re only singling out one company; others fit the bill, and more will in time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.eys3d.com/">EYs3D Microelectronics</a>, a fabless design house that focuses on end-to-end software and hardware systems for computer vision technology, has raised a $7 million Series A. Participants included ARM IoT Capital, WI Harper and Marubun Corporation, which will each serve as strategic investors.</p>
<p>Based in Taipei, Taiwan, eYs3D was spun out of <a href="http://www.etron.com/en/aboutus/company.php">Etron</a>, a fabless IC and system-in-package (SiP) design firm, in 2016. It will use its new funding to build its embedded chip business in new markets. The company’s technology, including integrated circuits, 3D sensors, camera modules and AI-based software, have a wide range of applications, such as robotics, touchless controls, autonomous vehicles and smart retail. EYs3D’s products have been used in the Facebook Oculus Rift S and Valve Index virtual reality headsets, and Techman Robots.</p>
<p>ARM, the microprocessor company, will integrate eYs3D’s chips into its CPU and NPUs. WI Harper, a cross-border investment firm with offices in Taipei, Beijing and San Francisco, will give eYs3D access to its international network of industrial partners. Marubun Corporation, a Japan-based company that distributes semiconductors and other electronic components, will open new distribution channels for eYs3D.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a press statement, ARM IoT Capital chairman Peter Hsieh said, “As we look to the future, enhanced computer vision support plays a key role in ARM’s AI architecture and deployment. eYs3D’s innovative 3D computer vision capability can offer the market major benefits, and we are pleased to partner with the company and invest in the creation of more AI-capable vision processors.”</p>
<p>The new funding also will be used to expand eYs3D’s product development and launch a series of 3D computer vision modules. It also will work with new business partners to expand its platform and hire more talent.</p>

<p>EYs3D’s chief strategy officer James Wang told TechCrunch that the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-chip-shortage-is-bad-taiwans-drought-threatens-to-make-it-worse-11618565400">global chip shortage and Taiwan’s drought</a> haven’t significantly impacted the company’s business or production plans, because it works with Etron as its integrated circuits manufacturing service.</p>
<p>“Etron Technology is one of the major accounts for the Taiwanese foundry sector and has strong relationships with the foundries, so eYs3D can receive products for its customers as required,” he said. “Meanwhile, eYs3D works closely with its major customers to schedule a just-in-time supply chain for their production pipelines.”</p>
<p>The company’s systems combine silicon design and algorithms to manage information collected from different sensor sources, including thermal, 3D and neural network perception. Its technology is capable of supporting visual simultaneous location and mapping (vSLAM), object feature depth recognition and gesture-based commands.</p>

<p>Yang said eYs3D can provide end-to-end services, from integrated circuit design to ready-to-use products, and works closely with clients to determine what they need. For example, it offered its chip solution to an autonomous robot company for obstacle avoidance and people-tracing features.</p>
<p>“Since their expertise is in robotic motor controls and mechanicals, they needed a more complete solution for a design module for 3D sensing, as well as object and people recognition. We provided them with one of our 3D depth camera solutions and SDK along with middleware algorithm samples for their validation,” said Yang. “The customer took our design package and seamlessly integrated our 3D depth camera solution for proof-of-concept within a short period of time. Next, we helped them to retrofit the camera design to fit in their robot body prior to commercialization of the robot.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.hyro.ai/">Hyro</a>, formerly Airbud, is today announcing the close of a $10.5 million Series A financing round led by Spero Ventures, with participation from Twilio and Mindset Ventures. Existing investors Hanaco Ventures, Spider Capital and Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Hyro is an enterprise application, currently aimed at the healthcare sector but with eyes on new verticals, that adds an intelligent layer of voice chat or text chat to any application or website.</p>
<p>The company calls itself an adaptive communications platform, which essentially means that customers use plug-and-play tools to get information to end-users in a conversational way, whether that be voice or chat. It can integrate with contact centers, chatbots, SMS and other forms of communication. Essentially, Hyro targets information-heavy industries that often have to communicate with end-users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This type of scenario, in the words of co-founder Israel Krush, usually leads to a terrible experience for the end user and a costly, inefficient process for the organization. The problem was no more apparent than in the healthcare sector during the pandemic. End users would flood platforms for information regarding the virus, the vaccine, testing, etc., but ask those redundant questions in myriad ways. On the enterprise side, the answers to those questions were changing over time.</p>
<p>Hyro allows these organizations to easily edit and change that information and deliver it to end users in an efficient way. But perhaps most importantly, Hyro scrapes information from the website to set up its own conversational tree, so the client doesn&#8217;t have to do a lot of heavy lifting up front.</p>

<p>Krush says that the problem is big, which means that the space is crowded. He views Twilio&#8217;s participation in this round of fundraising as a differentiator.</p>
<p>&#8220;The market is crowded so it&#8217;s really hard to differentiate yourself from the crowd,&#8221; said Krush. &#8220;Even though we have great technology, everyone says they have great technology. Twilio coming into this round and the partnership we&#8217;re trying to develop around contact centers really attests to the differentiation of our approach, to the scalability and the modularity of our approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that Hyro is not a healthcare company &#8212; &#8220;it&#8217;s really about serving any enterprise.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyro healthcare customers include Carroll, Wheelpros, Mercy Health, University of Rochester Medical Center and Weill Cornell Medicine, but the company plans to use this new funding to scale into more verticals, with an aim toward real estate, government and other information-heavy industries. </span></p>
<p>This latest round brings Hyro&#8217;s total funding to $15 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/propy-a-blockchain-verified-platform-for-selling-houses-raises-funding-from-tim-draper/">wrote about Propy</a> using blockchain technology to smooth real-world real estate sales by introducing the concept of smart contracts. Propy was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-entire-real-estate-deal-takes-place-online-using-cryptocurrency-technology-1506462545">the first</a> blockchain startup to make that work. Now the company is pushing the boundaries again, by <em>auctioning a real apartment as an NFT</em>. Although one might want to brush this aside as a stunt, the event is designed to make the point that it could well be done legally. And, by golly, they are going to try.</p>
<p>The auction will be of the NFT attached to a modern, brand new, one-bedroom apartment in Kiev, Ukraine, that Propy previously made history with by making it the first-ever blockchain-based real estate sale.</p>
<p>The NFT created by Propy will, it says, transfer real ownership of the property. Just in case you haven&#8217;t been paying attention, NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are cryptographic &#8220;tokens&#8221; that represent a unique asset — such as a piece of art, music or other collectibles — and certify ownership digitally. NFTs have set the crypto-world alight with their potential to be applied to just about anything, including a work of art by Banksy which was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/mar/09/nfts-flying-cats-burning-banksy-digital-art-crypto-art-bitcoin-rocketing">then burnt</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once someone has won the NFT of the apartment at auction, the NFT will include access to the ownership transfer paperwork; a digital artwork NFT by a popular Kiev graffiti artist, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chizz.xr/">Chizz</a> (a physical painting of the digital artwork is painted on a wall of the apartment) and the apartment pictures. But obviously, the apartment is the main asset here.</p>
<p>The auction itself will happen over a 24-hour period, with the initial listing starting at $20,000. Details for the NFT sale are <a href="https://propy.com/browse/propy-nft/">available here</a> and will be updated with any new information as the auction proceeds.</p>
<p>The apartment in question is currently owned by <a href="https://twitter.com/arrington">Michael Arrington</a>, founder of this very news site, and now a crypto investor with <a href="http://arringtonxrpcapital.com/">Arrington XRP Capital</a>.</p>
<p>Investors in Propy &#8212; which says it has so far processed $1 billion worth of transactions via its platform &#8212; include Arrington himself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/propy-a-blockchain-verified-platform-for-selling-houses-raises-funding-from-tim-draper/">and Tim Draper</a>, former founder of DFJ.</p>

<p>Natalia Karayaneva, CEO of Propy said: “This NFT will go down in history. For Propy it is a major milestone in leveraging the promise of blockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFT) to achieve &#8216;self-driving&#8217; real estate transactions and real estate participation in the decentralized finance economy.”</p>
<p>Here’s how this is all going to work: Arrington has signed legal papers designed by Propy’s lawyers for the NFT to transfer ownership to a future buyer. Propy then conducts the NFT auction and receives payment in cryptocurrency. The winner in the auction becomes the owner within a minute, after filling out KYC details.</p>
<p>The Kiev property is owned by a USA-based entity, and when the auction completes, the new owner of the NFT becomes the owner of the entity and thus the property itself. This process is repeated every time the NFT attached to the property is resold.</p>
<p>In an interview with me, Karayaneva said: “We were brainstorming and this appeared to be a natural development of our white paper of 2017. And in fact, many things we transact, real estate, via property, we are actually already kind of doing NFTs, but with our unique smart contracts. But now the NFT concept provides a different approach, where a property can be transferred between two wallets, peer to peer.</p>
<p>“Thus we do not need to change the name of the owner in the land registry. And this applies to many countries, as well as the United States. This model will work for the United States, and overall, there is this notion of buying real estate via LLC in the United States to preserve the privacy of the owner.</p>
<p>Over the same call, Arrington added: “Coming at this from a crypto angle, we’ve seen what happens how DeFi gets plugged into credit markets. If I have an NFT or any DeFi asset I can then borrow against it, without a middleman. Right now, if I have a real piece of real estate, there is no way for me to borrow against it, without a middleman, because I have to go through a bank and get a mortgage or whatever. And it&#8217;s also the friction, all of the costs in terms of speed and how long it takes.</p>
<p>“If we can find a way to plug real estate and other real-world assets into DeFi, I think that the amount of credit that can be created around that is in the trillions, eventually. And so I think that has to happen. The questions around this are legal and regulatory… The legal stuff around this is tough, and so Propy has done a lot of work with that. But if they do, I think that the idea of an NFT representation of a real-world asset purely from the point of view of ease of trade and ease of access to credit markets is a big idea.”</p>
