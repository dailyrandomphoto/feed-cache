										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are few challenges messier and more fraught than the U.S. healthcare system, but a growing number of startups are looking at ways to address shortcomings in standards of care through tech. We had three such companies share our virtual stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 this year, including <a href="https://www.cityblock.com/">Cityblock Health</a> president and co-founder Toyin Ajayi, <a href="https://goforward.com/">Forward</a> CEO and founder Adrian Aoun, and <a href="https://carbonhealth.com/?lng=en">Carbon Health</a>&#8216;s Eren Bali.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just say this conversation got heated — fast.</p>
<p>The main point of contention arose around defining what constitutes customer-centric healthcare and Aoun&#8217;s stance that, regardless of what else is involved in a company&#8217;s approach, starting from a point of working with insurers disqualifies a company from making any consumer-centricity claims.</p>
<p>&#8220;We keep saying that these companies are kind of consumer-centric,&#8221; Aoun said, referring to the panelists. &#8220;But in many ways I think one of the things that you realize is that when you get in bed with the insurance companies, which, whether it&#8217;s a Carbon or a Cityblock, at the end of the day, [if] you get in bed with the insurance companies, unfortunately, your incentive is basically not to go build a good consumer product.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your incentives are actually not the right thing — they&#8217;re not what the consumer needs,&#8221; he added. &#8220;So at the end of the day, you&#8217;re [referring to Eren and Carbon] launching a scheduling feature. We&#8217;re launching a heart health program that eliminates high blood pressure for 40% of our members. You&#8217;re launching a new way to bill; I&#8217;m launching cancer prevention.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ajayi took issue with the binary Aoun was trying to establish and explained why it&#8217;s actually not such a clear-cut division between working with insurers and having a real and meaningful focus on patient outcomes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adrian has said, either you get reimbursed by insurance, or you build a consumer or patient-centered company. And you know, in parentheses, that only very wealthy people can afford. What we found is actually that&#8217;s not binary; there is another path, which is partner with insurers, but take risk on the total cost of care and outcomes. So we do not bill for a community health worker coming to your home, holding your hand, telling you that you matter and helping understand what goes on in your life. But we absolutely are incentivized to do that and to innovate in that space, because that allows us to earn the right to provide healthcare to people that make them healthier.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/e41ad0dd-6845-42a0-b61c-8cdd1a6b6e9b?dark=false" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:Equity" data-rapid_p="7" data-v9y="1">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>Today we got the gang together &#8212; <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:Natasha" data-rapid_p="8" data-v9y="1">Natasha</a> and <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:Danny" data-rapid_p="9" data-v9y="1">Danny</a> and <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="http://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:Alex" data-rapid_p="10" data-v9y="1">Alex</a> &#8212; to chat about the most recent IPOs in tech-land, namely debuts from Freshworks and Toast.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has covered their pair of firms somewhat closely during their IPO run, as they each have some notable characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Freshworks&#8217; IPO provided a fresh window into how public market investors are willing to value growth-oriented software companies out the gate. The news is good. Which means that we could see more unicorns looking to list in coming months.</li>
<li>Toast&#8217;s IPO provided a lens by which we could gauge public-market sentiment for hybrid software-and-payments companies. The answer? That the stock market is pretty dang enthused about the companies in question.</li>
</ul>
<p>So it&#8217;s a good news day for unicorns, for tech startups, and for Boston, a city that Danny has many thoughts about. Please send him your complaints, and not the show. We take no responsibility.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Disrupt week, so we&#8217;ll have more in a few days but until then we&#8217;ll see you at the event!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The fervor around Dogecoin delivered big revenues for stock-trading app Robinhood, and the company announced Wednesday that it&#8217;s wandering deeper down the crypto rabbit hole, sharing that it will soon begin testing crypto wallets for its users.</p>
<p>The crypto wallets, which Robinhood says it will begin rolling out next month over time to users on its <a href="https://www.wenwallets.com/">waitlist</a>, will allow users to trade, send and receive crypto tokens inside the app. The update brings Robinhood an oft-requested feature for crypto users, and brings the app deeper into the crypto ecosystem. Users had previously been able to buy and sell a few cryptocurrencies including Dogecoin and Bitcoin, but had been unable to send those coins to external wallets or receive them from elsewhere.</p>
<p>The move will open Robinhood up to many of the opportunities in the crypto space that rivals like Coinbase have been able to capitalize on. It simultaneously pushed the company into an area with even more regulatory obscurity. This week, Coinbase <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/following-sec-lawsuit-threat-coinbase-cancels-launch-of-lend-product/">abandoned</a> a long-planned lending product after the SEC threatened to sue the company.</p>

<p>2020 and 2021 have been breakout years for the cryptocurrency world, with coins bouncing up and down throughout the period but reaching gains much higher overall. <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">Coinmarketcap</a> estimates the global market cap for cryptocurrencies stands at just shy of $2 trillion.</p>
<p>Investors seem bullish about the company leaning deeper into the crypto space, Robinhood&#8217;s stock was up more than 10% in trading today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab long ago graduated from underdog launch provider to industry heavyweight (with funding to match). Now the company is planning to go to the moon, Mars and Venus in the next decade. But it may come as a surprise that the company planned to go beyond Earth&#8217;s orbit from the very beginning, as founder Peter Beck explained at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021. In fact, it was in plain sight the whole time.</p>
<p>Beck explained with a touching anecdote that his own ambition to explore and learn from space goes back to his youth. &#8220;You know, the earliest childhood memory I have is standing outside in the bottom of the South Island, a little town in New Zealand called Invercargill, on a cold winter&#8217;s night looking at a crystal clear sky with my father,&#8221; he recalled. &#8220;He was pointing out to me that all the stars in the sky have planets on them, and perhaps on one of those planets, that could be somebody looking back and asking the same questions that I was asking.</p>
<p>&#8220;That really was the point in time where I decided that space was the thing that I was going to do. That memory stuck with me, you know, forever. I always felt that, if I could have the opportunity to go out into those stars and explore and perhaps ask or answer, one of the biggest questions in mankind&#8217;s history — &#8216;Are we the only life in the universe or not?&#8217; — I would take that chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, many of us as children had aspirations to become astronauts and intrepid space explorers, but he put in the work, and has been &#8220;tremendously fortunate,&#8221; as well, he noted.</p>
<p>But more to the point, he said that the plan to go from low-lift rides to orbit to designing spacecraft and interplanetary missions has been part of the company all along.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Qikfox isn’t your average browser. Not only has it been built to protect consumers from the proliferation of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/scams/">online scams</a>, but it&#8217;s also on a mission to democratize content publishing and bring it to the masses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Qikfox, which has already raised seed capital from longtime venture investor Tim Draper and is exhibiting at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Startup Alley</a> this week, first started life as a browser extension. It has since morphed into a full-fledged premium <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/browser/">browser</a> that comes complete with its own search engine, built-in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/antivirus/">antivirus</a>, and the “world’s first” browser-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/decentralized/">decentralized</a> identity system.</p>
<p>“The motivation behind the product was that internet browsers are not taking ownership of what they are serving the consumers,” Tarun Gaur, founder and CEO of Qikfox told TechCrunch. “They are hosting a buffet of 4 billion web pages, and the internet was not conceived for this deluge of content</p>
<p>“Other internet browsers are focused on either the developer or primarily on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/privacy/">privacy</a>. However, you cannot solve privacy if you don’t first solve safety and security.”</p>
<p>The idea for Qikfox came after Gaur’s tech-savvy mother fell victim to an online scam after clicking on a fake advertisement hosted on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/google/">Google</a>. To ensure the growing boomer population doesn’t follow suit, Qikfox employs 78 different signals that are able to ascertain if online businesses are legitimate.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Our browser is able to identify these websites and blocks you from accessing them,” Gaur says. “It’s almost impossible for a consumer to get scammed.”</p>
<p>This, combined with its built-in antivirus system that not only scans and protects the browser but also the users’ entire system, makes Qikfox the safest browser on the market, according to Gaur. “Benchmarks show that we completely beat our competitors hands-down on privacy and security,&#8221; he claims.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Gaur, who previously founded Tringapps, a mobile and cloud-first turnkey software consulting company, doesn’t want to stop there. He’s also developing an advanced feature that will flag counterfeit products on e-commerce websites such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/amazon/">Amazon</a>, and even plans to turn Qikfox into a full-fledged operating system.</p>
<p>However, his ultimate mission is to make the web more participatory and democratic through the use of zero-code content publishing and universally discoverable handles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“There have been many attempts to build a decentralized internet but these have all failed. Not because the technology isn’t there, but because nobody knew how to control spam,&#8221; Gaur said. “So we built a very disruptive IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) kind of technology that goes far beyond what IPFS and decentralized internet technologies do today. It completely eliminates the need for domain name systems.”</p>
<p>Gaur, in a bid to reduce the entry barrier for non-tech consumers to participate in the digital economy, has developed Smart Stacks, a zero-code content publishing platform that makes content universally discoverable.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“We want to create a decentralized replacement for whatever Google is doing today with the cloud,” Gaur added.</p>
<p>Qikfox, which costs $180 per year, is currently available on an invite-only basis in North America, has so far amassed more than 4,000 subscriptions. Gaur plans to bring the browser to the U.K. and Europe in the next 90 days.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What will an AI-infused world look like in 20 years? Sinovation founder and AI thought leader Kai-Fu Lee and breakout sci-fi author Chen Qiufan (aka Stanley Chen) make an educated guess in "AI 2041."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Where will today&#8217;s technologies lead us over the next 20 years, and what will an AI-infused world look like across the globe? Sinovation founder and AI thought leader Kai-Fu Lee and breakout sci-fi author Chen Qiufan (aka Stanley Chen) make an educated guess in <a href="https://www.ai2041.com/">&#8220;AI 2041: Ten Visions for Our Future&#8221;</a> a set of 10 stories and 10 essays exploring and explaining the potential and pitfalls of AI.</p>
<p>After reading the book — I&#8217;ll be publishing a review shortly and TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/the-next-healthcare-revolution-will-have-ai-at-its-center/">recently posted an excerpt</a> — I talked with Lee and Chen at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 about how the collaboration came about, how their points of view coincided and differed, and why they think the future will be how they describe it.</p>
<p><em>(Quotes have been lightly edited for clarity.)</em></p>
<p>Lee and Chen found each other a few years ago — one a successful thought leader and entrepreneur in AI, the other an author whose incisive depictions of near-future dilemmas earned him international acclaim. They decided to collaborate on a hybrid work that would have narratives born out of informed speculation and expository pieces illustrated by narrative.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207109" style="width: 308px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AI_currency.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207109" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2207109" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AI_currency.jpeg" alt="" width="298" height="450" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AI_currency.jpeg 298w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AI_currency.jpeg?resize=99,150 99w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AI_currency.jpeg?resize=199,300 199w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AI_currency.jpeg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2207109" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Currency | Random House</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really to tell the whole story of AI, because AI is so important. Everyone should know more about it, but it&#8217;s also a little bit intimidating because it sounds technical,&#8221; Lee told me. &#8220;And what better way to tell the story than by truly telling stories?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew each other briefly back in the day in Google, and I was always thinking about writing a book about future technology, based on very specific science, facts and theories,&#8221; Chen said. &#8220;But without Kai-Fu, I couldn&#8217;t do that, because I&#8217;m not the expert in the domain.&#8221;</p>
<p>The result of their collaboration is &#8220;AI 2041&#8221;: Ten stories by Chen set in the titular year, all over the world, with people from all walks of life encountering AI in the many ways that the authors think it may come to shape society over the next two decades. Each story is followed by an explanatory essay by Lee that goes into the technical aspects and why they might lead to that future.</p>
<p>The stories are independent but happen in something like a shared world, each illustrating a potential application, conflict or change in thinking that AI could lead to. Importantly, the AI is recognizable as an evolution of existing technologies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started with a framework of four things,&#8221; said Lee. &#8220;One is I wanted to cover around 15 technologies in 10 stories. I also wanted to order them so that they go from easy to hard, so it&#8217;s kind of like an AI textbook — you know, you learn it by reading stories. Then we both wanted it to be in different industries, like education and healthcare and so on, to show that AI impacts everywhere. And then lastly, Stanley wanted it to be in 10 different countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Take for example the story &#8220;Gods Behind the Masks.&#8221; It concerns a talented deepfake creator working out of Lagos who knows the ins and outs of generative adversarial networks, image inspection, media pathways and so on. He is tasked with creating a video of a long-dead celebrity that fools not just people watching it, but the hosting service’s automated scanners, the government’s facial recognition algorithms and all the rest — but he begins to suspect there’s an unsavory motive behind it all (I won’t spoil the rest).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer just announced that he will stepping down from the role next year and transition to a part-time position as a &#8220;Senior Fellow&#8221; at the company. It&#8217;s one of the biggest leadership departures for Facebook in recent memory.</p>
<p>He will be replaced in the role by long-time executive Andrew Bosworth who has most recently led the company&#8217;s Facebook Reality Labs. Bosworth will continue to lead the AR/VR organization in his new role.</p>
<p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/note-from-mark-zuckerberg/">shared a note</a> on the departure in the company&#8217;s newsroom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I want to take a moment to thank Schrep for his extraordinary contributions to our community and our company over the last 13 years. He has played a critical role in almost everything we’ve done — from building and scaling our teams to mentoring many of our key leaders, and from helping us develop new technologies like AI and VR to operating our infrastructure and business services at global scale. Schrep and I have had a close partnership over the years, and in addition to being a great leader, he’s also a great person and a close friend. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Schroepfer joined the company in August of 2008, according to his LinkedIn, a time when Facebook was riding high on a $15 billion valuation but was soon to encounter a harsher investment environment during the recession which led it to raise a series of down rounds. The company went on to have the biggest technology IPO in history and is currently trading at a market cap just south of $1 trillion.</p>
<p>The road to riches has left Facebook with plenty of tech challenges which have led to more than a handful of controversies. Schroepfer&#8217;s lengthy tenure has been most notably marked by Facebook embrace of artificial intelligence and the algorithmic news feed which promotes content to users based on what Facebook believes will interest the user the most. The company also relies heavily on artificial intelligence for tasks like content moderation. The company&#8217;s reliance on algorithmic promotion and data collection have been&#8230; controversial at times.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="sXWIH2uF1W"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/instacart-hires-facebook-executive-as-new-ceo-ahead-of-expected-ipo/">Instacart hires Facebook executive as new CEO ahead of expected IPO</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Schroepfer&#8217;s exit from Zuckerberg&#8217;s inner circle is an important moment for the company. Though Facebook has seen a handful of high profile exits in recent years, including Facebook app chief Fidji Simo, Ad boss Carolyn Everson, Chief Revenue Officer David Fischer and VR head Hugo Barra, none have been as close to the CEO as Schroepfer.</p>

<p>Bosworth, who joined Facebook in January of 2006, has been one of the company&#8217;s more vocal executives, sharing, at times, controversial opinions about the company and technology industry at large. He has previously led the company&#8217;s hardware divisions and ad divisions, most recently helming AR/VR operating which Facebook has long promoted as a major pillar for the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a difficult decision because of how much I love Facebook and how excited I am about the future we are building together,&#8221; Schroepfer wrote in a<a href="https://www.facebook.com/schrep/posts/10159715842464443"> Facebook post</a>. &#8220;This change in role will allow me to dedicate more time to my family and my personal philanthropic efforts while staying deeply connected to the company working on key initiatives including recruiting and developing technical talent and continuing to foster our AI investments in critical technologies like PyTorch.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve never struggled to click the correct one of three different download buttons on one of those &#8220;YouTube to mp4&#8221; websites, well, haven&#8217;t you led an honorable internet life! But now, YouTube is testing a feature for Premium subscribers that might render those bootleg websites somewhat obsolete.</p>
<p>From now through October 19, Premium users can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/new">test a feature</a> that lets them download videos from their browser. This test, which brings an existing mobile feature to the web, is part of an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/youtube-premium-subscribers-get-a-new-perk-with-launch-of-testing-program/">ongoing program</a> that allows Premium users to test out what the platform is working on.</p>
<p>Videos will be downloadable by default for Premium users &#8212; uploaders don&#8217;t need to opt-in. Subscribers with access to the latest versions of Chrome, Edge, or Opera browsers can click a &#8220;Download&#8221; button while watching a video, or click a 3-dot menu while browsing. Then, users will be able to access their downloaded videos on a downloads feed, which is also accessible via sidebar navigation.</p>

<p>Unlike those third-party sites, YouTube won&#8217;t give you a video file to store on your hard drive forever.</p>
<p>Instead, YouTube tells TechCrunch, the viewer gains access to a cached version of the video &#8212; it&#8217;s like downloading a Netflix show to watch offline while you&#8217;re on a plane. Users can view their downloaded videos by navigating to the YouTube website while they&#8217;re offline. Then, they will see text showing that they are offline, which will take them to a new page showing the videos they&#8217;ve downloaded.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The feature also works on YouTube&#8217;s <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/24/youtube-install-pwa/">Progressive Web App</a> (PWA). Downloaded YouTube videos will remain available as long as the user&#8217;s device connects to the internet at least once every 30 days.</p>
<p>The feature was first spotted by <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/09/22/youtube-gets-official-video-downloads-on-the-web-saving-you-from-using-some-very-sketchy-sites/">Android Police</a>, which noticed the changes to the YouTube.com/new website. YouTube declined to say if and when it may have more officially communicated the test to its users, but typically, Premium members can browse the available experiments as a perk that comes with a YouTube Premium subscription.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/giving-users-more-transparency-their-google-ad-experience/">announced</a> a change to its online ads, which will now display new disclosures that allow web searchers to see not just who the advertiser is and why the ad was served to you, but also what other ads the advertiser has run with Google, starting with the most recent. The changes are a part of Google&#8217;s broader revamp of its ads business in the face of increased regulatory scrutiny and a broader shift across the tech industry to technologies that promote transparency and consumer privacy.</p>
<p>In this case, Google is building on last year&#8217;s launch of its <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads/advertiser-identity-verification-for-transparency/" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://blog.google/products/ads/advertiser-identity-verification-for-transparency/&quot;}">advertiser identity verification program</a>, which requires advertisers to disclose their personal information &#8212; including documents that prove they are who they say they are and those that confirm which country they operate from &#8212; as well as details about what they&#8217;re selling. These disclosures began rolling out last year to advertisers who buy ads from Google&#8217;s network. So far, Google says it&#8217;s begun verifying advertisers in over 90 countries worldwide.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s including expanded disclosures in its &#8220;About this Ad&#8221; product, too.</p>
<p>Within these new advertiser pages, anyone will be able to click to learn more about the advertiser and access a menu where they can view all the ads a specific advertiser has run over the past 30 days.</p>
<p>Google presents this as a useful tool from a consumer perspective, by noting how a consumer who saw a product for sale, like a coat, could use the tool to learn more about a brand and its other products. But it&#8217;s clearly also useful as a means of identifying possible bad actors in the advertising ecosystem, as it would showcase a history of the advertisers&#8217; ads in one public-facing destination.</p>

<p>From here, users will also more easily be able to report an ad for violating Google <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6008942">policies</a> around things like prohibited or restricted content, such as counterfeit goods, dangerous products, inappropriate content, abuse, violations of interest-based ad policies, ads that deceive the user, noncompliance with local election laws and regulations, and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The changes come about at a time when Google&#8217;s approach to online advertising had been shifting. Google hints at its broader strategy today, saying the new ad disclosures &#8220;build on our efforts to create a clear and intuitive experience for users who engage with ads on Google products.&#8221; It also noted that over 30 million users interact with its ads transparency and control menus on a daily basis. For a feature that&#8217;s relatively buried in the product &#8212; you have to click the tiny &#8220;i&#8221; icon to access these menus &#8212; that speaks to Google&#8217;s massive global scale.</p>
<p>To date, Google has also announced a number of significant moves in the ads space, including the addition of <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2018/02/how-chromes-ad-filtering-works.html?m=1">integrated ad-blocking in Chrome</a>, new <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ads/update-our-political-ads-policy/">limits to political ad targeting</a>, and it announced <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/6/24/22548700/google-cookies-ban-delay-floc-tracking">plans</a> to move away from third-party cookies &#8212; though these have <a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/google-grants-a-third-party-cookie-reprieve-delays-deprecation-by-two-years/">since been delayed</a>.</p>
<p>Google notes that <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6014595?hl=en">election</a> ads will continue to be available in its <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/political-ads/home?hl=en">political transparency report</a>. With these ads, the company also displays the &#8220;paid for by&#8221; disclosure to ensure users understand who paid for the ad. However, alll non-political content will appear in the advertiser pages, it says.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[No one roots for a pandemic, but for companies like Peloton, the timing couldn’t have been better. People on the fence about buying a treadmill or stationary bike went for it as their options shrunk.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Unprecedented&#8221; only begins to scratch the surface of this past year-and-a-half. Entire industries have been made and broken as the global population struggled to adapt to the largest pandemic in a century. Connected fitness falls firmly in the category that made it.</p>
<p>It’s fair to say that 2020 and 2021 have been transformative for home fitness. Years spent building products that let anyone work out at home paid massive dividends as people struggled to find alternative ways to exercise amid gym closures and a dramatic uptick in sedentary lifestyles.</p>
<p>No one roots for a pandemic, of course, but for companies like <a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/">Peloton</a>, the timing couldn’t have been better. Many who were on the fence about purchasing a pricey treadmill or stationary bike were pushed over the edge as their in-person options shrunk. In February, the company said its subscriber count rose to 1.67 million, up 134% from a year earlier.</p>
<p>But the past few years haven’t been all smooth sailing for the company. From increased competition and early supply chain struggles to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/peloton-apologizes-agrees-to-treadmill-recall/">treadmill recall</a> that shook up the industry, there have been several recent roadblocks on the company’s climb.</p>
<p>Peloton CEO John Foley had initially pushed back on the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) reports, but ultimately agreed to recall its Tread+ in May, following reports of 70 injuries, including the death of a six-year-old.</p>
<p>At TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 this week, Foley — joined by Peloton chief content officer Jennifer Cotter — discussed broader safety issues with the category, noting that the unfortunate circumstances behind the recall have forced the company to take a closer look at product safety.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>What’s the difference between International Entrepreneur Parole and the latest proposed startup visa? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you think the startup visa will become a reality? If so, when?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Financial Founder</strong></p>
<p>Dear Financial,</p>
<p>Thank you for your questions! As you likely know, U.S. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) recently introduced the <a href="https://lofgren.house.gov/sites/lofgren.house.gov/files/7.26.21%20-%20LIKE%20Act%20Full%20Text.pdf">Let Immigrants Kickstart Employment (LIKE) Act</a>, which creates both a startup visa and a startup green card.</p>
<p>Jeff Farrah, general counsel of the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA), recently discussed the LIKE Act with me on my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/089-advocating-for-international-startup-founders-with-jeff-farrah-of-national-venture-capital-association/">podcast</a>. The NVCA is working on building support for the LIKE Act on Capitol Hill. However, Congress is currently focusing on the budget reconciliation and infrastructure bills, which means the LIKE Act is taking a back seat to those bills for now — and the timing of the LIKE Act remains uncertain.</p>
<h2>How to support the LIKE Act</h2>
<p>Farrah says there are things that we can do to support the LIKE Act to become a law and create an official startup visa in the United States. If you live or work in Lofgren’s district, which covers much of Silicon Valley, write her a letter thanking her for introducing the LIKE Act and share your story.</p>
<p>If you live or work in the U.S. outside of Lofgren’s district, write a letter to your congressional representatives, share your story, and let them know why a startup visa and path to a green card for founders is important. (Remember, do not claim to be a U.S. citizen if you aren’t since that could get you permanently barred from the United States!)</p>
<p>You can also ask your friends — immigrants and U.S. citizens alike — to write letters to their representatives in Congress. And if you have friends living abroad who want to come to the U.S. to start their venture, they could write to the congressional representative of the district where they are hoping to create their business and jobs in the U.S.</p>
<p>Now, let’s examine the differences between the proposed LIKE Act and our current new program for startup founders.</p>

<h2>International Entrepreneur Parole versus LIKE Act</h2>
<p>Like a non-immigrant visa, the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/073-international-entrepreneur-parole-is-back/">International Entrepreneur Parole</a> (IEP) allows its holder to stay temporarily in the United States. However, IEP is not a visa, so the process in which it is given and extended is different from visas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There’s a lot of value in waste; just ask metals processing company <a href="https://nthcycle.com/">Nth Cycle</a>, which has developed a technology to help mining and recycling companies recover every bit of critical minerals from their operations.</p>
<p>The company calls its technology “electro-extraction,” and Nth Cycle’s founder and CEO Megan O’Connor likened it to a water filter in a recent interview with TechCrunch. “We found a way to electrify that,” she explained. “We push an electrical current across that filter, and that electricity that we push across is how we can selectively remove the metals of interest.”</p>
<p>Currently, all signs suggest that metal recovery and recycling will be key to electrifying the economy, especially as so many zero-emission technologies rely on critical minerals: lithium, cobalt, nickel and manganese, which exist in varying but ultimately finite amounts in the natural environment.</p>
<p>To solve this issue, Nth Cycle has developed an electro-extraction system that stands at less than 1,000 square feet and can process 5 tons of material per day – a key differentiator from big, traditional recyclers that use hydro- and pyrometallurgical techniques that require more capital and generate a greater footprint. The system can accept “black mass,” a powdery waste substance that’s generated from the battery recycling process, and turn that waste into valuable minerals like nickel, cobalt and manganese.</p>
<p>On the mining front, Nth Cycle can work at the front or back end of the mining process, either helping companies extract value out of sites that are low grade, meaning they have relatively low metal content. It could help mine operators to potentially unlock a huge amount of untapped minerals.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re looking at a lot of the untapped resources we have here in North America, because we have all of the materials we need for the energy transition, we just don&#8217;t have a way to mine them sustainably yet.”</p>
<p>Nth Cycle’s modular unit can also process tailings, or waste from mining operations, and can collect up to 30% of metals that were not extracted in the original mining process.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once commercialized, Nth Cycle plans to own and operate the units, with its customers owning any of the product that’s recovered.</p>
<p>O’Connor said she sees companies like battery recyclers Redwood Materials and Li-Cycle as partners rather than competitors, because Nth Cycle isn’t in the business of collecting batteries, as well as processing them.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2201864" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2201864" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2201864 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nth-cycle-lab-work-hero-1b-1.jpg" alt="Nth Cycle wants to revolutionize metals processing for recyclers and mine operators" width="800" height="534" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nth-cycle-lab-work-hero-1b-1.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nth-cycle-lab-work-hero-1b-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nth-cycle-lab-work-hero-1b-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nth-cycle-lab-work-hero-1b-1.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nth-cycle-lab-work-hero-1b-1.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/nth-cycle-lab-work-hero-1b-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2201864" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://nthcycle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nth Cycle <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>“We&#8217;re really only innovating on the chemical recycling side of things,” she said. “We&#8217;re really trying to create a much more efficient way to pull these metals out of black mass. We&#8217;re not trying to compete to collect batteries like the other folks in the face. We&#8217;re not on the logistics side.”</p>
<p>The company’s approach is also much lighter on the capital expenditure side. Hydro- and pyrometallurgical facilities can cost millions of dollars to construct, a cost that simply isn’t feasible for a lot of waste collectors. Nor is it always workable for waste collectors and mining companies to ship the waste to recyclers, O’Connor said, especially if it’s low-grade material.</p>
<p>“For the vast majority of distributed waste, it&#8217;s not feasible to ship it to those centralized [recycling] facilities,” she said.</p>
<p>Nth Cycle was founded exactly one day after O’Connor defended her dissertation in environmental engineering at Duke University. “We actually sat at a bar in Boston, had a beer over it, and the next day I signed up online to become an LLC,” she said. “We’ve been working to commercialize ever since.”</p>
<p>Following her PhD, she was an entrepreneurial fellow at Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s Innovation Crossroads, a two-year program for energy and advanced manufacturing entrepreneurs working on novel technologies. There, she received $500,000 in funding to scale the technology and prepare it for demonstration to private funders.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the company will be announcing several deals for full commercial scale units and is aiming to close its Series A over the next few months. Thus far, the company has raised $1.25 million in non-dilutive grants and $3.2 million in seed funding from climate tech VC firm Clean Energy Ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pollutants pouring from smokestacks around the world may be bad news for the atmosphere, but if you catch them before they get out there, you could reduce emissions and collect some valuable materials at the same time. That&#8217;s what <a href="https://www.carbixcorp.com/">Carbix</a> aims to do with its carbon-sequestering reactor, which would extract minerals from emissions while staying carbon-negative.</p>
<p>Carbix, which presented today at the Disrupt Startup Battlefield, is capitalizing on the pressure being placed on industries to decarbonize or face fines and high taxes. Cement manufacturing alone accounts for some 8 percent of carbon emissions, and executives are scrambling to go green.</p>
<p>It turns out that minerals needed for cement and many other industries are being literally thrown away — puffed out of flues and allowed to settle wherever they drift. In fact, these minerals are valuable enough that Carbix can afford to pay factories for the privilege of siphoning them off and reselling them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re essentially paying emitters for stock they would normally dump into the wind — they have no incentive not to do this,&#8221; said Carbix founder Quincy Sammy.</p>
<p>The process is an accelerated version of what happens in nature: atmospheric carbon dioxide interacting with certain abundant minerals and slowly forming other ones — like calcium carbonate, limestone. Turning CO2 into stone is the basis of several startups in what we might call the permanent carbon sequestering market; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/heimdal-pulls-co2-and-cement-making-materials-out-of-seawater-using-renewable-energy/">Heimdal</a> does it using seawater and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/44-01-secures-5m-to-turn-billions-of-tons-of-carbon-dioxide-to-stone/">44.01</a> is injecting high-carbon water into fields of reactive minerals. Carbix, of course, is going to artificial sources.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/X1-PFD-process-flow-diagram.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2199879" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/X1-PFD-process-flow-diagram.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="456" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/X1-PFD-process-flow-diagram.jpg 3223w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/X1-PFD-process-flow-diagram.jpg?resize=150,67 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/X1-PFD-process-flow-diagram.jpg?resize=300,133 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/X1-PFD-process-flow-diagram.jpg?resize=768,342 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/X1-PFD-process-flow-diagram.jpg?resize=680,303 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/X1-PFD-process-flow-diagram.jpg?resize=1536,683 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/X1-PFD-process-flow-diagram.jpg?resize=2048,911 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/X1-PFD-process-flow-diagram.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>It works like this: Carbix goes to a big emitter of CO2 and particulates and analyzes the stream being blown out. From that they can predict what carbonate minerals they can isolate and what they&#8217;ll need to do it. Then the output of the facility will be routed through one of Carbix&#8217;s reactors, in which the various effluvia are combined with raw reactive minerals — gypsum, lime kiln dust, and others sourced from nearby to lower the logistics impact — and out come useful substances like ingredients for making cement, glass, and other things. They cart those off and sell the raw materials that would have otherwise disappeared into the atmosphere (and eventually landed on a glacier somewhere).</p>
<p>The reactor, currently in a scale prototype called X1, is the most obviously defensible IP here, and Sammy said that the bulk of the seed round they&#8217;re putting together will go towards building the production-scale X2, which will have several hundred times the reactor space. Each X2 should be able to handle about 16,000 tons of carbonates per year per reactor, which corresponds to about 8,000 tons of CO2. They can operate in parallel, and Sammy estimated that a good size emitter might use 10 at a single facility.</p>

The X2 will be larger by an order of magnitude at least.</p></div></p>
<p>The simplest arrangement would be for the emitter to pay for the upfront costs of the installation, with the understanding of mutual benefits to come. Carbix would then regularly pay for the materials it extracts — a double benefit since the emitter would normally not earn any money on them but the emissions would count towards caps. Sammy didn&#8217;t rule out profit sharing or other agreements but this would be the preferred setup.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re breaking new ground with these companies, so reciprocity is key,&#8221; Sammy said. And while cement manufacturing is the first vertical they&#8217;re targeting, the Carbix process can be adapted to plenty of other industries.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be tied to any specific sector — flue gas is flue gas. That&#8217;s why the project is end-to-end; we guide people through it. We&#8217;re demonstrating that we can work in any industry,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>As with any hardware company working at industrial scales, there are a lot of upfront costs. Carbix is working on a seed round to cover the expense of building and certifying the X2 reactor so it can be insured and financed through ordinary channels. After that comes the reciprocal back-scratching arrangements that benefit everyone involved.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">David Moeller wasn&#8217;t looking to start another company. He had already earned the serial entrepreneur badge with CodeGuard, a website backup startup, and his hardware company Claw Hanging Systems.</p>
<p>But a series of car break-ins prompted Moeller to search for a product that would keep his vehicle safe. What he found was a gap in the market and an opportunity to fill it.</p>
<p>Moeller spent several years researching and developing prototypes and business plans for what would eventually become <a href="https://keep.tech/">Keep Technologies</a>. The Atlanta-based startup, which debuted virtually at the TechCrunch Startup Battlefield, was officially founded in fall 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was really looking for a reason not to start this,&#8221; Moeller said, noting that he spent months conducting market research, a patent study, surveying consumers and then eventually building out a prototype. &#8220;I had just sold my company, and at the time I was thinking, I should be focusing on golf and I&#8217;ve got a young daughter. I wanted to find the red flag or a reason not to do this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moeller didn&#8217;t find that reason. Instead, he developed a suite of smart devices for safety and security in vehicles and an accompanying cloud service and a mobile app. Its flagship product is the Knight, an intrusion and motion detector that locks into the cup holder of a vehicle. And yes, the cup holder can still be used.</p>
<p>Keep&#8217;s technology, of which it has secured five utility patents and another 16 pending, has already attracted several investors. Moeller initially used his own funds to bootstrap Keep. The company has since raised $4 million from several investors, including Cloudflare co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince, Tom Noonan, who is the founding partner of early-stage technology investment firm TechOperators, Bert Ellis of Ellis Capital, Kenzie Lane Innovation CEO Tripp Rackley and Jerry Perullo, who is the chief information security officer of the Intercontinental Exchange.</p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>Keep Technology&#8217;s Knight device connects to the OBD port in a vehicle. The cord can run underneath the floorboard and then up to the center console of the vehicle, where cup holders are typically located. The Knight is placed into the cup holder and becomes activated once the owner twists the device so it is anchored into its location.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Knight cannot be uninstalled by anyone but the user, Moeller told TechCrunch, adding that some of its patents are related to alarm functionality during the installation and the removal of the device. The Knight is equipped with a camera that provides a 180-degree view. It also has cellular bandwidth, as well as passive infrared (PIR) and microwave sensors to detect motion outside and inside the car.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2205290" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/KNIGHT-in-vehicle.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2205290" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2205290 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/KNIGHT-in-vehicle.jpg" alt="Keep Technologies KNIGHT in vehicle" width="2000" height="1334" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/KNIGHT-in-vehicle.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/KNIGHT-in-vehicle.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/KNIGHT-in-vehicle.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/KNIGHT-in-vehicle.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/KNIGHT-in-vehicle.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/KNIGHT-in-vehicle.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/KNIGHT-in-vehicle.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2205290" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Keep Technologies</p></div></p>
<p>What this all means is that the Knight can record video of a person breaking into the vehicle, send that data to the cloud and push it to the user&#8217;s mobile device. Keep Technologies also has a monitoring service that can view the video on the car owner&#8217;s behalf and take action and notify the police.</p>
<p>The aim, of course, is to prevent break-ins — not just record the bad actors messing with the vehicle or stealing items from it. The device communicates via Bluetooth either with an accompanying fob or the user&#8217;s mobile app. Either way, once the owner locks and moves out of range of the vehicle, the device automatically arms itself.</p>
<p>If someone approaches the vehicle and looks inside, the device will go into deterrent mode by flashing an LED light and making a loud chirping noise. This isn&#8217;t akin to the loud exterior alarms on the market today. The flash of light and loud chirp only occurs if someone is lingering by the vehicle and stops once they leave. If they choose to open the vehicle, a buzzer that emits a sound of up to 120 decibels — Moeller describes this as 100 screaming babies — goes off and the fisheye lens records and transmits the video.</p>
<p>For the Knight product, Moeller said the company is targeting $299 for the device and $50 a year for the subscription. If the user wants professional monitoring, Keep is aiming for a price that is about $30 a month. The company plans to launch the product in mid-2022.</p>
<h2>The winding road to Keep</h2>
<p>Moeller, who earned his mechanical engineering degree from Georgia Tech, started his professional life in a more traditional manner by taking a job at GE where he worked for four years in the Midwest, China and Dallas. He left for business school at Harvard University intending to make a career switch to investment banking. It was here that the entrepreneurial bug first bit.</p>
<p>On a whim, Moeller and a friend tried out for a reality show called American Inventor, a precursor to Shark Tank that aired on ABC in summer 2007. The pair invented a bicycle rack called The Claw and ended up being one of the six finalists. They would eventually license the product to Whirlpool and more than million units have been sold through Lowe&#8217;s, Home Depot and Amazon.</p>
<p>Moeller had spent half of that summer filming the reality TV show and the other half interning at an investment banking firm.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the end of the summer, I decided to do entrepreneurship even if I made no money,&#8221; Moeller said. &#8220;That experience really changed my mindset around taking big risks and what can happen when you do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Launching Claw Hanging Systems led Moeller to his next startup called CodeGuard. The Claw founders had built a website in order to collect pre-orders for the product once the show debuted. The aim, Moeller explained, was to be able to show Whirlpool or another company, that there was demand for the product. But the website crashed the day before American Inventor aired.</p>
<p>A few years later, Moeller co-founded website backup startup CodeGuard with a professor at Georgia Tech. The company launched at TechCrunch Disrupt 2011 and became a finalist in the competition. CodeGuard partnered with Cloudflare shortly after and was acquired in 2018 by Sectigo.</p>
<p>Moeller stayed on at Sectigo for another two years. During this time, he started working on nights and weekends on hardware for neuroscience labs. This would eventually become Neuromatic Devices, a spinout from Georgia Tech and MIT. Moeller ended up selling assets from Neuromatic.</p>
<p>It was around the time that Sectigo acquired CodeGuard that Moeller experienced a series of car break-ins. The last one, which was right after he and his wife had moved to a new neighborhood in Atlanta, pushed him to find any kind of security device or product that could prevent future theft.</p>
<h2>Eye toward future products</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keep-Product-Suite.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2205288 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keep-Product-Suite.jpg" alt="Keep Technologies Product Suite" width="6415" height="3600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keep-Product-Suite.jpg 6415w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keep-Product-Suite.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keep-Product-Suite.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keep-Product-Suite.jpg?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keep-Product-Suite.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keep-Product-Suite.jpg?resize=1536,862 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keep-Product-Suite.jpg?resize=2048,1149 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Keep-Product-Suite.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6415px) 100vw, 6415px" /></a></p>
<p>The company has developed other products, as well — most with a chess theme — including a less expensive version called the Pawn that doesn&#8217;t have a camera and still detects motion and intrusion, as well as a windshield-mounted device that provides 360 degrees of visibility called the Rook.</p>
<p>Moeller said the Knight, Pawn and Rook are just the beginning for the company. The company of 11 people, including Moeller, is also working on other security devices and sensors, including a guard for catalytic converters, which are a favorite of thieves. Other add-ons products coming in the future include a car seat monitoring sensor, a device that monitors the door, trunk and gas cap, in-cup wireless charging and a tag that provides additional GPS tracking.</p>
<p>Keep has also architected a product called Lookout, a small puck that goes on the windshield and can record traffic stops. With this, Moeller isn&#8217;t trying to squeeze into the dashcam industry; instead he believes partnering with some leading providers to integrate into their devices is potentially a better path.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Dan Cohen was on the hunt for a coating that could keep ice, snow and frost off of solar panels when he discovered a technology that could cut costs and reduce the environmental footprint of a broad section of products from aircrafts and drones to medical devices, pipelines and even sailboats.</p>
<p>And it would prompt Cohen to found his own startup, <a href="https://www.flite.tech/">Flite Material Sciences</a>, which debuted virtually at TechCrunch Startup Battlefield.</p>
<p>Cohen never found the perfect coating for those panels, one of the projects he had undertaken as CTO of the solar company. The coating would change the color of the panel, need to be applied every year or contain toxic materials. The answer came from a professor at the University of Rochester&#8217;s Institute of Optics, who claimed he could keep ice and rain and snow and frost off the panels and off the structures with no coating at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought, okay, that&#8217;s a little counterintuitive, but let&#8217;s go see what he has,&#8221; Cohen said. The professor introduced Cohen to the field of laser surface functionalization. Instead of a coating, which gives the glass, plastic or metal the ability to repel water, he used a laser to retexture the material allowing it repels water by itself. The process also works to prevent rust, ice and repel oil on a variety of surfaces, including semiconductors and even human bone and teeth.</p>
<p>Cohen was impressed and inquired whether a solar panel manufacturer had already licensed the technology. It turns out, the technology wasn&#8217;t licensed to any company, in any industry.</p>
<p>The University of Rochester agreed to license the technology and Flite Materials Science was born in 2018 to commercialize it. The startup spent the first year learning about the technology, researching the IP and understanding product market fit. It also went through several accelerator programs, including TechStars and <a href="https://centech.co/en/nouvelles/centech-announces-the-companies-chosen-for-its-fall-acceleration-program">Centech</a> in Montreal.</p>
<p>Now, Cohen is aiming to take the technology to a commercial scale and apply it to aerospace, life sciences and other industries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>The texturizing process mimics what can be found in nature. Take a lotus leaf, for instance. That leaf can sit in water all day but still seem perfectly dry, Cohen explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you look at it under a powerful enough microscope, you see that it&#8217;s actually extremely rough, that there are these very sharp spikes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And so theories started to emerge about why water can&#8217;t stay on these sharp spiky surfaces.&#8221;</p>
<p>Early research that tried to create these textures focused on a combination of gases and chemicals. University of Rochester professor Chunlei Guo came up with a novel way of using lasers with a high pulse rate — like a quadrillion pulses per second — to transform the material without building up a lot of heat.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is putting in lots of energy, but the pulses make it possible to be more of a sculptor,&#8221; Cohen said. &#8220;It moves material around or redeposits it back on without just burning it away.&#8221;</p>
<p>That last point is critical. The technique that Flite is licensing and plans to commercialize doesn&#8217;t take away or weaken the surface. It merely reshapes the texture to give the metal or plastic the ability to repel water, oil and ice.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>The company is currently &#8220;scrambling&#8221; to conduct as many customer validation projects as possible,&#8221; Cohen said, adding that those projects that prove how this could work on specific products and industries. Flite Material Science has completed a few projects and has more lined up.</p>
<p>About 16 companies have expressed a strong interest to do these tests in the next year and about 150 more are waiting for us to have the capacity to participate, Cohen said.</p>
<p>Flite Material Sciences has fewer than 10 employees, but Cohen hopes to hire more once the company closes a round of funding in the third or fourth quarter of this year.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s research led it to home in on aerospace and defense. The company is also &#8220;doing quite a bit of work&#8221; for oil and gas and semiconductors and sees demand from automotive and packaging, said Cohen, adding that those last two industries will likely have to wait until unit economics have come down.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you or your kid have any sort of respiratory issue, figuring out what&#8217;s happening minute-by-minute — and how well treatment is working — is a stressful, frustrating, and anxiety-filled process. I imagine it&#8217;s all of the above and more in the middle of a friggin&#8217; RESPIRATORY DISEASE pandemic.</p>
<p><a href="http://stethome.com">StethoMe</a>, a team competing in this week&#8217;s TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield competition, is looking to help alleviate some of this for children with asthma and their parents. It has built a smart, connected stethoscope that can help parents perform lung examinations at home, sending high-fidelity recordings directly to their kid&#8217;s doctor and using machine-learning to help flag potential concerns.</p>
<p>This is the device:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207001" style="width: 551px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207001" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2207001" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/stethome-new.png?w=541" alt="" width="541" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/stethome-new.png 796w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/stethome-new.png?resize=119,150 119w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/stethome-new.png?resize=239,300 239w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/stethome-new.png?resize=768,965 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/stethome-new.png?resize=541,680 541w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/stethome-new.png?resize=40,50 40w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207001" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> StethoMe</p></div></p>
<p>Turn it on, use your phone to tell it what kind of exam you want to perform, and the built-in screen will walk you through the process. It&#8217;ll tell you where on the chest to place the device, whether or not the room you&#8217;re in is quiet enough, and more. After measuring across 6-8 points, it&#8217;ll provide you a report with details like respiratory rate, heart rate, and whether or not it detected any audio abnormalities — including wheezing, rhonci (gurgling sounds caused by fluid), or crackles.</p>
<p>From there, you&#8217;re able to send a link to the report directly to your kid&#8217;s doctor, where they can hear the recorded audio from each point on the chest. A scrubbable spectrogram, meanwhile, provides a visual overview of each recording and flags and labels any abnormalities detected by the system. That report looks like this:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207053" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207053" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2207053" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/StethoMe-dashboard.png?w=630" alt="" width="630" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/StethoMe-dashboard.png 2524w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/StethoMe-dashboard.png?resize=139,150 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/StethoMe-dashboard.png?resize=278,300 278w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/StethoMe-dashboard.png?resize=768,829 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/StethoMe-dashboard.png?resize=630,680 630w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/StethoMe-dashboard.png?resize=1424,1536 1424w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/StethoMe-dashboard.png?resize=1898,2048 1898w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/StethoMe-dashboard.png?resize=46,50 46w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207053" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> StethoMe</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This information is meant to help parents and their doctors detect asthma attacks earlier and more accurately, and to help determine how well long-term medications are working — is one medication better than another at alleviating harder-to-detect symptoms? Did bumping up the dosage slightly help?</p>
<p>Co-founder Wojciech Radomski tells me their product is already certified as a medical device in the EU, having obtained a CE mark for both the AI and the device; the FDA approval process in the U.S., meanwhile, is underway.</p>
<p>At TechCrunch Disrupt, the company announced a deal wherein Poland&#8217;s Ministry of Health has purchased 1,000 devices to run a pilot test with over 100 doctors over the next half a year. &#8220;During this last month [alone],&#8221; Radomski tells me, &#8220;they&#8217;ve already made over 70,000 recordings.&#8221;</p>
<p>To maybe straddle the edge of too personal here: I freakin&#8217; love this idea. I had asthma growing up. It dominated my life for a few years; even once the doctors got it under control (thanks science, love yooou), six-year-old me was <em>always</em> convinced I was having or about to have an asthma attack. The fear of being unable to breathe triggered crushing anxiety, which in turn convinced me I couldn&#8217;t breathe. While I can&#8217;t speak to how well this thing works at this point (that&#8217;s the FDA&#8217;s job), I wish I could package this thing up and stick it in a time machine and send it back to lil&#8217; me in 1993 with a note that says &#8220;Use this, breathe easier.&#8221; (and maybe &#8220;p.s. buy bitcoin early&#8221; but I guess we shouldn&#8217;t screw with the timeline <em>too</em> much.)</p>
<p>StethoMe says it has raised a few rounds at this point (a $400K pre-seed, $2M seed, and $2.5M Series A) and received nearly $3M in grants from Poland&#8217;s National Center for Research and Development.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Buying and selling on marketplace websites like Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace often lead to meeting a stranger somewhere to complete the purchase and pick up the item.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/social-networking/news/facebook-marketplace-monthly-active-users-now-at-1-billion-shops-crosses-250-million-mark-zuckerberg-2424412#:~:text=Million%20Mark%3A%20Zuckerberg-,Facebook%20Marketplace%20Monthly%20Active%20Users%20Now%20at%201%20Billion,Crosses%20250%20Million%20Mark%3A%20Zuckerberg">over 1 billion Facebook Marketplace users per month</a>, <a href="https://nymbull.com/">Nymbull</a> founder Jackson Wegelin doesn’t think that’s necessary for peer-to-peer transactions. And he estimates that between interacting with potential buyers and dealing with no-shows, each sale takes about a week to complete.</p>
<p>His company, which participated in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/">Startup Alley</a> at TechCrunch Disrupt, aims to eliminate a lot of that hassle and get completed sales down to an average of two to three days through the creation of a patented remote lock and sales website that enables users to list their item on the Nymbull website and share that link on the marketplace of their choice. He refers to it as “lock it, list it, leave it.”</p>
<p>Sellers purchase the lock — similar to a bicycle lock — to lock up items for sale at their location of choice for potential buyers to inspect the item. If the buyer is satisfied, they complete the payment through the Nymbull website to get the unlock code. The company uses Stripe and offers charge-back protection to both parties.</p>
<p>“There has been lots of evolution in marketplaces,” Wegelin said. “We have pizza companies using lockers as do people for dropping keys for Airbnbs, as well as Amazon pick-up lockers. This became more normal as COVID hit and people started social distancing and wanting non-contact transactions.”</p>
<p>The idea for the company came to Wegelin in 2016 when he had a grill that he wanted to sell. He lives on a busy main street in his neighborhood and thought about listing the item and locking it to a tree in the front of his house so people could look at it. While searching for remote locks that would enable him to unlock it after someone bought the grill, he came up short.</p>
<p>An inventor by nature — he holds 70 U.S. patents as an electrical and mechanical engineer — and set out to build one of his own. A year later, he started filing patents for the Nymbull lock and now has four issued patents.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Wegelin, based in Ohio, now has 500 locks and is experimenting with sales on Nymbull’s website, which he expects to launch soon. He is still working on pricing for the locks and item posting. However, he said it will be a subscription model for sellers, while buyers will pay a few dollars for each transaction.</p>
<p>Sellers will be able to put a free hold on items for a certain number of hours and have flexibility to offer more holding time for the buyer to decide on the purchase. For those needing longer, potential buyers can ask for a day or two hold by paying a few dollars.</p>
<p>As he was testing out the locking system, one of the most common questions he received was how to lock up an item of clothing, like a shirt. He tested out methods of looping the lock through the sleeves and a hanger that he hung on an over-the-door hook. Other sellers have gotten creative with drilling holes in plastic containers that can be locked to a fence, Wegelin said.</p>
<p>Ultimately, he wants Nymbull to be the mediator between buyer and seller so that items can be safely purchased and sold without either party having to interact at all if it is not needed, Wegelin said.</p>
<p>“The lock keeps people honest and helps buyers see what they are paying for it,” he added. “There are lots of opportunities where we can take this, such as food pick-up, medication delivery or unattended pick-ups.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Over the past year, Latin America has been covered heavily in the international news as the COVID-19 pandemic led many to question our endurance in the face of a crisis. But the region’s mega-fundraising rounds and shiny new unicorns have countered with optimism around its budding tech ecosystem.</p>
<p>When we first shared LatAm&#8217;s digital acceleration story in last year’s <a href="https://www.atlantico.vc/latin-america-digital-transformation-report">Latin America Digital Transformation Report</a>, we believed we were at the peak of digital growth catalyzed by the pandemic. E-commerce penetration was at an all-time high and the market cap of public technology companies was growing much faster than the region’s GDP. But with 2021 came all the second- and third-order effects of the crisis, further accelerating a continentwide tech expansion to a pace beyond any projections.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.atlantico.vc/latin-america-digital-transformation-report-2021">In this year&#8217;s report</a>, we dedicate 200 slides of data-rich analysis, primary research, private company data and case studies to tell the story of this “second wave” of change we are witnessing. Ranging from the rapid adoption of sustainable technologies to the welcoming of a new local creator economy, we detail the surprising changes the pandemic has brought to consumer preferences, workplace dynamics, business models and the geopolitical influence on the fast-changing tech sector.</p>
<p>An initial top-down view paints a clear picture of a region at an inflection point. The Atlantico Digital Transformation Index, which measures tech penetration by tracking the value of public technology companies as a percentage of GDP, rose to 3.4% in 2021 from 2.3% in 2020 for LatAm as of August.</p>

<p>Similarly, based on an internal analysis of private company data, we estimate that the value of regional unicorns reached $105 billion, more than double last year’s figure of $46 billion. Eight new unicorns have already been minted this year, nearly reaching 2020’s rate by midyear.</p>

<p>Much has been written about Latin American fintechs, which last year drew 40% of the region’s venture capital investment. The revolution witnessed over the last five years, which produced the likes of Nubank (the world’s largest digital bank), was sparked by a mix of changing consumer demands, a concentrated banking sector and a pro-innovation regulatory environment. We are now seeing the second-order effects of the fintech boom, as the same set of conditions arise in other soon-to-be disrupted sectors.</p>
<p>In the insurance space, similar changes are giving way to innovative models like <a href="https://www.180s.com.br/">180<sup>o</sup></a> in Brazil and <a href="https://gobetterfly.com/en/">Betterfly</a> in Chile. The former, founded by prior Nubankers, takes embedded insurance to the max, pioneering an insurance-as-a-service model that enables any company to create bespoke insurance products for its customers and seamlessly integrate them into their core experience. In the case of Betterfly, we see the rise of a novel benefits platform that lets companies offer a life insurance product that rewards healthy habits and charitable donations.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We sat down with Canva co-founder Melanie Perkins at Disrupt 2021 to talk about how she has approached fundraising, and how she's managed to grow Canva's free and paid user base at a rapid clip.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Design software startup Canva has been making news of late. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/canva-raises-200-million-at-a-40-billion-valuation/">just raised $200 million at a $40 billion valuation</a>, and co-founders Melanie Perkins and Cliff Obrecht gave the vast majority of their equity (around $13 billion) to charity through the Canva Foundation.</p>
<p>We sat down with Perkins at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 to talk about how she has approached fundraising, what she&#8217;s looking for in a potential acquisition, how she&#8217;s managed to grow Canva&#8217;s free and paid user base at a rapid clip, and what it actually means to be a &#8220;mission-driven company.&#8221;</p>
<p>The conversation kicked off with Perkins charitable donation. She clarified that her and Obrecht&#8217;s $13 billion-ish give-back was the vast majority of their equity in the company, around 30%. This is a relatively big chunk of equity for growth-stage founders who have raised so many rounds, but Perkins explained how the company has tackled fundraising with a focus on preserving equity.</p>
<blockquote><p>With early-stage startups, it was very common that you had to raise a 20% to 25% round. We&#8217;ve had a very different approach. We&#8217;ve raised in the early stages. We couldn&#8217;t really be that selective about investors. But investors were very selective about who actually believed in our vision. So it worked out well. But in the time since, we&#8217;ve done many rounds. Now, we do a much smaller round at the next value inflection point.</p>
<p>We know, or we hope, that Canva is going to continue to grow rapidly in the right direction. So the valuation today is obviously going to be much smaller than the valuation over the years to come. Rather than taking like a 15% to 25% hit in one single round, which means that you can only do a few rounds over the course of a company&#8217;s lifetime, we&#8217;ve done much smaller incremental rounds. This has meant that, because we knew that we were wanting to build a big company, we didn&#8217;t overcapitalize or overdilute in the early stages. And so we&#8217;ve done many, many rounds, that are much smaller amounts, comparative to the size of the round.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every year, more than 100,000 people in the United States wait for an organ donation. More than a dozen people will die each day still waiting. Such is the brutal math and the necessary optimism required to work in the organ procurement world.</p>
<p>For the past several decades, a private network of now 57 organ procurement organizations (OPOs) have sprouted up, all broadly affiliated with <a href="https://unos.org">UNOS</a>, the United Network for Organ Sharing, a non-profit whose goal is to match donated organs with potential recipients.</p>
<p>It’s a unique facet of the medical world, and also one that is surprisingly more like a tech startup than might first meet the eye. From early beta products to a much more professional and modern tech stack, the network and its affiliates have strived to improve the speed and reliability of the organ transplantation process.</p>
<p>I wanted to look at some of the organization’s most recent initiatives, including improved logistics and planning infrastructure, while also exploring some of the more science fiction projects: xenotransplantation, drone-delivery systems, and organ viability platforms. So I interviewed a number of folks at both UNOS and two OPOs to hear what’s cutting edge, and what remains a dream for the future.</p>
<h2 id="A guy with a phone number">A guy with a phone number</h2>
<p>Joel Newman, senior communications strategist at UNOS, where he has worked nearly three decades, said that “transplantation has always been unique in the sense that everybody&#8217;s got to collaborate and communicate in real time — not always with people they know.” Perhaps surprisingly given the life-and-death stakes of organ transplantation, “a lot of those arrangements were shockingly informal.”</p>
<p>In fact, they were so informal in the early years, that matching donors to recipients was operated out of a voicemail inbox.</p>
<p>Howard Nathan, the current president of organ procurement organization Gift of Life (and the longest serving president of any OPO, having taken the role in 1984), said that one man, Don Denny, ran much of the collaboration infrastructure in the early years as organ transplantation became more viable in the 1980s.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Denny, who moved to Pittsburgh in 1977, created his own status system for patients from one to four, with one indicating the most urgent organ needs (the rating system is the opposite today). “He’d record every day this message” on his voicemail, Nathan described, “and you listened to this recording.” From there, “you’d look at your donor in the ICU where you had permission from the family, and if it’s a match, you’d call.” Nathan says that Denny coordinated 2,700 transplants over 4.5 years, all from his recorded voicemails and phone calls.</p>
<p>UNOS was formed in 1977 and eventually incorporated in 1984. By 1986, it had developed more computerized systems to handle the organ matching process, using the latest communications technology: faxes. Rick Hasz, who is today vice president of clinical services at Gift of Life and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gift-of-life-president-and-ceo-howard-m-nathan-to-step-down-richard-d-hasz-jr-named-as-successor-to-lead-nations-top-organ-procurement-organization-301319585.html">will succeed Nathan as president in 2022</a>, said that the technology wasn’t all that reliable. “When I started we had thermal paper faxes,” he said. “If you didn’t allocate quickly, then that thermal paper dissolved and you’d lose the list.”</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, UNOS has continued to evolve its technology over time with the needs of organ donors, donor hospitals, organ recipients, and transplantation centers. It relies on a web-based application, and even has a mobile app now.</p>
<p>Amy Putnam, director of IT customer advocacy at UNOS, said that one big breakthrough came with a mobile app to reduce errors. “Back in 2012, we worked on a change called <a href="https://unos.org/technology/transnet/">TransNet</a>, and TransNet is a mobile application, it&#8217;s built on iOS and Android, that allows the OPOs to electronically package and label organs,” she said. “As you can imagine at three in the morning, most people&#8217;s handwriting is not very legible, and you end up with a lot of data entry errors, and that&#8217;s where TransNet really helped.”</p>
<p>The real gain of building the system though was being able to work collaboratively with all of the organization’s OPO affiliates and refine processes based on feedback from all of its users.</p>

<p>Calls and communications are key for coordinating transplantations. Organ donations are typically sudden, can happen almost anywhere, and OPOs have just hours to get the organ from the donor hospital into a recipient patient at a transplant center. Not only that, but which patient waiting on a list has to be determined with extreme speed, with potentially dozens of transplant centers interested in a particular organ. Processing all those requests, in real-time, is the huge emphasis of UNOS’ modern tech stack.</p>
<p>Newman explained some of the intricate work that is involved. “Kidneys can often be transplanted within about 24 hours. Once they are recovered, obviously shorter is better and probably most of them go in 12 hours or less,” he said. “When you&#8217;re looking at livers and pancreas, it&#8217;s probably ideally less than eight hours. Hearts and lungs go down to about four to six hours.” The time that an organ is viable after losing blood supply is known as the ischemic time.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, UNOS has developed much more elaborate tracking systems to understand where organs are. Julie Kemink, chief clinical officer at LifeSource, an OPO, said that “what you see now is similar to what you might see with an Amazon package… you see that it is shipped… but you don’t necessarily know” where precisely it is, she said.</p>
<p>However, new updates to UNOS’ infrastructure are starting to deliver real-time location information for every organ. “Now it’s more like an Uber — you can see where it is physically at all times,” she said.</p>
<p>Adding GPS coordinates for each organ sounds like a simple proposition, but required immense coordination. Since donor hospitals, organ procurement organizations, and transplantation centers are all different entities, defining a universal standard for location was challenging. Furthermore, since organs tend to arrive quite randomly, having the right equipment and trackers on hand in every part of the country proved its own hurdle.</p>
<p>Now with better logistics information, transplant surgeons can get real-time updates on organ arrival times. If an organ is traveling by plane in the cargo hold and the plane arrives at an airport early, doctors can be notified that it’s running ahead of schedule and prep a patient earlier. Similarly, if vehicle traffic is delaying an organ’s arrival, transplant centers can push back a patient’s pre-op procedures.</p>
<p>With more data available, UNOS is now exploring a “travel app” or what Putnam dubbed a kind of “Expedia for organs.” She said, “It allows the OPOs or transplant hospitals to enter in some specific information about the donor hospital [and] the recipient center, and it will give them options, it will show them flight options, it will show them travel time if they&#8217;re going to travel by car.” She said the app, which is entering a pilot phase, could eventually allow organs to be fully ticketed right in the app experience.</p>
<p>That infrastructure is critical, because UNOS has been updating how it defines distance for organs. For decades, the organization and its OPO affiliates used a regional boundary system — organs in, say, Minnesota would be given first to recipients in Minnesota, and then if none could be found, they would be offered to nearby regions and so on.</p>
<p>That was a simple system, but one that could be taken advantage of, particularly by the wealthy. More than a decade ago, a controversy erupted when <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/Economy/story?id=7902416&amp;page=1">Steve Jobs received an organ transplant in Tennessee</a>, despite not living in the state. He did so through a process then known as “multiple listing” — for those with the means, a recipient could register on as many regional organ donor waiting lists as possible. If a match was found anywhere nationwide, the recipient could quickly charter a private plane to wherever the organ was and essentially cut the time they waited on a list.</p>
<p>Now, UNOS uses a distance algorithm that’s based on actual radius, and not just arbitrary regional boundaries. That still leads to some incongruities. Kemink of LifeSource, which is the OPO serving the Minneapolis regional area, said that “being in Minnesota — we are in proximity to both coasts… so we do have opportunities to place organs throughout the country.” That’s unlike the options available for the coasts. “In California, getting a heart from New York is basically impossible,” she noted.</p>
<p>In addition to better logistics, UNOS has optimized its platform for integration. “As you could imagine, most people hate having multiple usernames and passwords, they hate multiple solutions. So the biggest thing was integration, give us integration,” Putnam said about recent upgrades.</p>
<p>Part of that integration story was adding more ways to upload patient data and imagery files. Now, doctors can “upload and actually see the coronary angiography to see that [a heart] is the right match for a recipient,” Kemink said. That improves decision times on offers, and ultimately increases the viability of an organ transplant.</p>

<p>As organ transplantations have become more frequent — 39,000 were conducted in the United States <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics">according to government data</a> — there are increasingly large datasets available to finely tune the network’s allocation strategy and ultimately improve the number of organs that are successfully transplanted.</p>
<p>“Right now, we&#8217;re working on a project to introduce predictive analytics into the organ offer process, and looking at some analytics related to what is the probability of survival if they were to accept this organ,” Putnam said. If they decline an organ, then “what&#8217;s the probability and the timeframe until they will get a similar or better organ?” UNOS is currently working on a pilot to get feedback from its clients on these changes, and also ensure that the explainability of the algorithm is extremely clear given the highly sensitive nature of organ donations.</p>
<p>The network has also been piloting since last year a feature it dubs “offer filters,” which transplant centers can upload to the network’s platform to automate more decision around potential organ matches. Putnam said, “What we did is we looked at kidney acceptance data, historically, and said, ‘Are there offers that we know there&#8217;s no way a transplant center would ever accept?’”</p>
<p>Newman of UNOS said that “there have always been some screening criteria that centers could put in, but this allows actually a little bit more filtering of, ‘You know it&#8217;s not like I would never accept a donor older than 70 years old, but if it&#8217;s gonna be a donor older than 70 years old <i>and</i> it&#8217;s gonna take more than six hours to get here, I’m not interested.” UNOS expects a national rollout sometime later this year.</p>
<h2 id="The future of organ donations">The future of organ donations</h2>
<p>As critically important as the organ procurement process is, much of the gains the past decade have ultimately been a function of better IT applications and implementations. The big question a lot of startup founders and venture capitalists are interested in is the viability of “moonshot” ideas that can radically change organ availability for patients in need.</p>
<p>One project, using drones to deliver organs, has already been trialed. Nathan of Gift of Life said that “right now, the drone thing has been done — they’ve done one case” and also noted that “there is another group in Maryland that is experimenting with it too.” He’s somewhat skeptical about the technology given the distances organs have to travel (potentially hundreds of miles) and the potential for damage to the organ itself. “You don’t want to put the organ at risk,” he said.</p>
<p>Then there are a set of technologies including cryogenics and warm profusion which are designed to increase ischemic time (or eliminate it entirely), giving organ procurement organizations more time to get organs to the patients most in need of them. Several devices and systems are running through FDA trials now, and are expected to arrive and be put into practice over the course of the next decade.</p>
<p>Kemink of LifeSource pointed to blood-type matching and age as two criteria that could improve organ distribution with better organ viability technologies. “AB blood type is the most uncommon blood type, so there aren’t that many patients who are waiting for that blood type,” she said. At any given time, “there might not be a recipient that fits,” and so cryogenics could keep the organ “on ice” until the right patient shows up who needs it. Similarly, donated organs need to match the size required by the recipient. “You can’t take a heart from a 12-year-old and put it in a 70-year-old,” she said, since the sizes wouldn’t match the bodies. “We could preserve it until the person that needs it is there … that would be another tremendous advancement.”</p>
<p>There have also been advances in procuring organs from patients who die from circulatory death, in what are known as DCDs, or donations after circulatory death. Nathan said “there are 2.8 million people who die every year in this country, [and] only about 20,000 of those people are medically suitable to be an organ donor.” That’s one reason there is a huge wait time for organs.</p>
<p>Hasz noted that advances for procuring organs in these contexts have increased the likelihood that viable organs could be found. “Up until the last couple of years, nothing really changed: it was quite limited to liver and kidneys,” he said. But “in the past few years, the opportunity of helping more people with heart and lung transplants” arose, and “200 hearts have been used.” Ultimately with these new technologies, “we think it can expand the donor pool by 30% for DCD hearts.”</p>
<p>Finally, we get to what is known as xenotransplantation, or moving organs from animals to humans. Such experiments have gone on for decades, and progress has been somewhat elusive. Hasz said “10-15 years is always what you hear about xenotransplantation.” That said, he notes that new technologies like CRISPR have allowed for more progress in the space in recent years, potentially opening a pathway for animal organs to solve the shortage of human organs available.</p>
<p>For all the changes and new technologies though, the basic equation of organs in the United States remains the same: people need to check yes in order for lives to be saved. “The biggest thing that we need is more people to say yes to donations,” Kemink said. “Nobody gets a transplant unless people say yes to donation.” Today, roughly half of Americans are organ donors, and solving that isn’t about technology so much as about reminding people of the power of life — and what they can offer others.</p>
