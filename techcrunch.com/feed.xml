										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite efforts from companies to create equitable environments, it&#8217;s clear that employees of a certain demographics, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/googles-co-lead-of-ethical-ai-team-says-she-was-fired-for-sending-an-email/">Black</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/pinterests-22-5m-settlement-highlights-techs-inequities-say-former-employees-who-alleged-discrimination/">women</a>, sometimes have very different experiences from their counterparts. Glassdoor aims to better surface those experiences through a new feature that allows folks to filter ratings by demographics.</p>
<p>Up until now, Glassdoor only presented an overall ranking for a specific company, so there was no way to easily determine if, for example, Black women feel the same as white men, or if Latino men feel similarly to Asian men. In addition to race, Glassdoor now allows people to filter by gender identity, parental or caregiver status, disability, sexual orientation and veteran status.</p>
<p>Overall, Black employees are less satisfied at work in comparison to all employees, <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/research/black-at-work-employee-satisfaction">according to new preliminary research from Glassdoor</a>. The research is based on the more than 187,000 employees across more than 3,300 companies who have provided demographic data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2114170" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114170" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2114170" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DI-Race-Ethnicity-Mobile-Glassdoor.jpg?w=400" alt="" width="300" height="510" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DI-Race-Ethnicity-Mobile-Glassdoor.jpg 501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DI-Race-Ethnicity-Mobile-Glassdoor.jpg?resize=88,150 88w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DI-Race-Ethnicity-Mobile-Glassdoor.jpg?resize=177,300 177w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DI-Race-Ethnicity-Mobile-Glassdoor.jpg?resize=400,680 400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/DI-Race-Ethnicity-Mobile-Glassdoor.jpg?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114170" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Glassdoor</p></div></p>
<p>That same research showed Apple had the highest overall company rating among Black employees, with an average rating of 4.2 out of five. Apple&#8217;s overall company rating from that sample size is 3.9.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because these data are so new — having been collected within just the last four months — it’s important to resist the urge to make sweeping claims based on early data,&#8221; Glassdoor Data Scientist Amanda Stansell and Chief Economist Andrew Chamberlain said in the report. &#8220;The averages we’ve reported above are not derived from representative probability samples of company workforces — they represent data shared anonymously by Glassdoor users at this time. Readers should therefore take some caution in making conclusive, company-wide inferences about the state of race and employee satisfaction.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve ever tried to hop on the bus in San Francisco and were bummed to find that Apple Pay wasn&#8217;t an option (unlike in New York, Beijing, and plenty of other major cities): good news! That&#8217;s changing. Apple has announced that support for Clipper (the payment system for BART, Muni, Caltrain, AC Transit, and a bunch of other Bay Area transit agencies) is officially on the way. You&#8217;ll soon be able to just tap your iPhone or Apple Watch to the card reader and be on your way.</p>
<p>Apple says that Apple Pay will work across all 24 agencies where Clipper is accepted, meaning it should play friendly with:</p>
<ul>
<li>AC Transit</li>
<li>BART</li>
<li>Caltrain</li>
<li>City Coach</li>
<li>County Connection</li>
<li>Dumbarton Express</li>
<li>FAST</li>
<li>Golden Gate Ferry</li>
<li>Golden Gate Transit</li>
<li>Marin Transit</li>
<li>Muni</li>
<li>Petaluma Transit</li>
<li>SamTrans</li>
<li>San Francisco Bay Ferry</li>
<li>Santa Rosa CityBus</li>
<li>SMART</li>
<li>SolTrans</li>
<li>Sonoma County Transit</li>
<li>Tri Delta Transit</li>
<li>Union City Transit</li>
<li>Vine</li>
<li>VTA</li>
<li>WestCAT</li>
<li>Wheels</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple does mention that it&#8217;ll work with the optional &#8220;Express Transit&#8221; feature built into Wallet, allowing you to make these relatively small transit transactions without requiring Face ID or Touch ID verification — a nice touch for when there&#8217;s 10 people waiting to get on behind you and you&#8217;d rather not have to deal with convincing your phone that you are, in fact, you.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So when will it officially roll out? Good question — and one that Apple isn&#8217;t answering yet. In an e-mail announcing the coming Clipper support, they say it&#8217;s &#8220;Coming soon,&#8221; but don&#8217;t get any more specific than that. A tweet from the @BayAreaClipper account, meanwhile, narrows it down to &#8220;this spring&#8221; and reiterates that Google Pay support is coming soon, as well.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re going mobile! Clipper is coming to Apple Pay and Google Pay this spring. Stay tuned for more details! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/clippercard?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#clippercard</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As part of the grant-making associated with the U.S. Department of Transportation&#8217;s Infrastructure for Rebuilding America program, the agency will for the first time carve out some of that program&#8217;s $889 million budget for projects addressing climate change and environmental justice.</p>
<p>The projects will be evaluated on whether they were planned as part of a comprehensive strategy to address climate change, or whether they support strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as deploying zero-emission-vehicle infrastructure or encouraging shifts in modes of transportation or vehicle miles traveled, <a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDOT/bulletins/2c222d8/">the agency said in an announcement</a>.</p>
<p>“As we work to recover and emerge from this devastating pandemic stronger than before, now is the time to make lasting investments in our nation’s infrastructure,” said Secretary Pete Buttigieg, in a statement. “We are committed to not just rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, but building back in a way that positions American communities for success in the future—creating good paying jobs, boosting the economy, ensuring equity, and tackling our climate crisis. The INFRA grant program is a tremendous opportunity to help achieve these goals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Racial equity will also be considered, according to the agency&#8217;s announcement. Requirements will include equity-focused community outreach and projects designed to benefit underserved communities, along with projects that are located in opportunity, empowerment or promise zones or choice neighborhoods.</p>
<p>The new programs show just how quickly federal dollars could be made available to startups that are looking at electrification and provide more strength to the tailwinds already propelling the electric vehicle industry &#8212; and its attendant charging networks moving forward.</p>
<p>Large infrastructure projects could receive grants of $25 million or more while small projects must have grant requirements that meet a minimum threshold of at least $5 million, according to the DOT.</p>
<p>Eligible project costs could include: reconstruction, rehabilitation, acquisition of property (including land related to the project and improvements to the land), environmental mitigation, construction contingencies, equipment acquisition and operational improvements directly related to system performance.</p>
<p>Opportunities <a href="http://www.transportation.gov/INFRA">for applications are going to be open through Friday, March 19</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The big story: Facebook cuts off news-sharing in Australia</strong></p>
<p>In response to a proposed law forcing internet platforms to pay news publishers directly, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/facebook-restricts-users-in-australia-from-sharing-or-viewing-news-links-in-response-to-proposed-legislation/">Facebook announced today</a> that Australian users will not be able to share or view news links.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In its post, Facebook drew a direct contrast with the other big company targeted by the law, with managing director for Facebook Australia and New Zealand William Easton writing, &#8220;Google Search is inextricably intertwined with news and publishers do not voluntarily provide their content. On the other hand, publishers willingly choose to post news on Facebook, as it allows them to sell more subscriptions, grow their audiences and increase advertising revenue.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.artie.com">Artie</a>, a startup looking to rethink the distribution of mobile games, announced today that it has raised $10 million in funding.</p>
<p>There are some big names backing the company — its latest investors include Zynga founder Mark Pincus, Kevin Durant and Rich Kleiman&#8217;s Thirty Five Ventures, Scooter Braun&#8217;s Raised In Space, Shutterstock founder Jon Oringer, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, Susquehanna International Group, Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment + The Sixers Lab, Googler Manuel Bronstein and YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley.</p>
<p>This actually represents a pivot from <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/12/06/vr-veterans-found-artie-augmented-reality-avatar-company/">Artie&#8217;s original vision of creating augmented reality avatars</a>. CEO Ryan Horrigan said that he and his co-founder/CTO Armando Kirwin ended up building distribution technology that they felt solved &#8220;a much bigger problem.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The problem, in part, is game developers &#8220;looking for ways outside of Apple&#8217;s App Stores rules and restrictions.&#8221; (That&#8217;s certainly something Fortnite-maker<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/epic-games-takes-its-apple-app-store-fight-to-europe/"> Epic Games seems to be fighting for</a>.) So Artie&#8217;s platform allows users to play mobile games without installing an app, from the browser or wherever links can be shared online.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114445" style="width: 358px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114445" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2114445" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Beer_Pong_Party1.jpg?w=348" alt="Artie Beer Pong" width="348" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Beer_Pong_Party1.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Beer_Pong_Party1.jpg?resize=77,150 77w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Beer_Pong_Party1.jpg?resize=154,300 154w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Beer_Pong_Party1.jpg?resize=768,1499 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Beer_Pong_Party1.jpg?resize=348,680 348w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Beer_Pong_Party1.jpg?resize=787,1536 787w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Beer_Pong_Party1.jpg?resize=26,50 26w" sizes="(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114445" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Artie</p></div></p>
<p>Artie isn&#8217;t the only startup focused on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/playco-launch-funding/">the idea of app-less mobile gaming</a>, but Horrigan said that while other companies are limited by JavaScript and HTML5, Artie supports Unity, meaning it can build casual (rather than hyper-casual) games, and eventually games that might even go deeper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Similar to cloud games, we’re running Unity games on our cloud, but rather than rendering their graphics on the cloud and pushing the video to players, we&#8217;re not running graphics on the cloud,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re streaming assets and animations that are highly-optimized and rendered in real-time through the embedded web browser.&#8221;</p>

<p>In other words, the goal is to get frictionless distribution outside of app stores, while avoiding some of the issues facing cloud gaming, namely <a href="https://www.matthewball.vc/all/cloudmiles">significant infrastructure costs</a> and lag time.</p>
<p>The startup is developing and releasing games of its own, with an Alice in Wonderland game, a beer pong game and more on the schedule for later this year, then a massively multiplayer online game planned for 2022. But the company also plans to release an SDK allowing other developers to distribute through its platform as well.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/VphxhvWSiMc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Horrigan said Artie&#8217;s initial games will be free-to-play, monetized through in-game purchases. They&#8217;ll use cookies to remember where players were in the game, but players will also be able to create logins.</p>
<p>Artie is also developing games with a major music star and a superhero IP-owner, and he argued that by combining no-code/low-code authoring tools with Artie&#8217;s distribution platform, this could become a bigger trend.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to be working with the next generation of influencers to make games using these low-code or no-code solutions, then publish to their audiences directly on YouTube,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Imagine what a branded game would look like from your favorite hip hop star. We think that&#8217;s coming, and we think Artie is the platform to make that happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a collector of audio gear (mostly effects pedals, old rim-drive tape machines and 1980s keyboards I’ve modified), I wish I could say my podcasting setup featured equipment that is extremely expensive and hard to come by. I would love to brag about using, say, hand-wired boutique preamps and a rare Soviet condenser microphone I bought at a military auction in Kazakhstan. Nothing would please me more than to share photographs of a massive reel-to-reel tape machine on which I record my ad reads (for “warmth”) before mixing them down on my laptop.</p>
<p>Alas, my podcasting setup is extremely normal. I have a Scarlett two-channel interface I bought at a chain store. I have a Rode microphone because I couldn’t afford a Shure SM7B. I record into GarageBand, which is the spiral-bound notebook of audio interfaces. The only slightly unusual thing about my podcasting setup is that on the rare occasion when I edit an episode I do so in Ableton Live, which I originally bought years ago when I was obsessed with making mashups.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114401" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114401" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2114401" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/David-Rees-How-I-Podcast-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/David-Rees-How-I-Podcast-1.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/David-Rees-How-I-Podcast-1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/David-Rees-How-I-Podcast-1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/David-Rees-How-I-Podcast-1.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/David-Rees-How-I-Podcast-1.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/David-Rees-How-I-Podcast-1.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/David-Rees-How-I-Podcast-1.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/David-Rees-How-I-Podcast-1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114401" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> David Rees</p></div></p>
<p>The only analog affectation I can claim is a shameful one: My laptop is so old the USB ports seem to be going slack &#8212; I’m surprised they don’t have hair growing out of them like old men’s ears &#8212; so I have to fix the line from my Scarlett into place using electrical tape.</p>

(My co-host Jon Kimball made enough money on the 2020 election to buy a new car; I made enough to buy a new tremolo pedal.) The only time we’ve done field recordings was last spring, when Jon and I went on a nerd / comedy cruise in the Caribbean the week COVID hit. We recorded daily dispatches at sea using a Zoom H4N, then wandered around Santo Domingo until we found a university library whose Wi-Fi we could use to upload the files to our co-host and editor Starlee. My phone tells me I walked 24,000 steps that day.</p>

<p>Because my podcasting setup is so boring, I have spiced up the photos by including some of my other audio gear in the shots! When the world is ready for cassette-based podcasts saturated in analog delay, I will be more than happy to oblige!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has suspended the Trump 2020 campaign app from the Google Play Store for policy violations, the company confirmed, following <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/17/donald-trumps-official-app-has-been-suspended-from-the-google-play-store-no-longer-works/">a report from Android Police</a> which noted the app was unable to load any content and appeared to have been taken down. Both the Android version of the app and its iOS counterpart have been left online since the November 2020 elections, but hadn&#8217;t received recent updates &#8212; which likely contributed to the app&#8217;s stability issues.</p>
<p>The Play Store version hadn&#8217;t been updated since October 30, 2020, for example, says app store intelligence firm Sensor Tower.</p>
<p>According to Android Police&#8217;s report, the app was hanging and couldn&#8217;t load content, and it reported connectivity issues. We understand the issue was as they described &#8212; when users downloaded the app, it would either hang on the initial loading screen with a spinning &#8220;T&#8221; logo or it would immediately report a server error at startup. In either case, it would never load the app experience at all.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Recent user reviews on the Play Store noted these issues, saying things like &#8220;<em>will not open,&#8221; &#8220;the app doesn&#8217;t even work,&#8221; &#8220;absolutely terrible doesn&#8217;t even work,&#8221; &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t open keep saying check connections,&#8221;</em> and more. One user even asked the developer to respond to the numerous complaints, saying <em>&#8220;please reply to people commenting. It&#8217;s not loading.&#8221;</em> Another implied the issues were Google&#8217;s fault, noting <em>&#8220;worked great, until Google canceled it.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Google, though, did not cancel it. The Trump 2020 Android app has actually been experiencing problems for some time before Google took this action.</p>
<p>For example, a tweet from around a month ago described a similar set of issues:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Is the Trump2020 app down?<a href="https://twitter.com/TrumpWarRoom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TrumpWarRoom</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/DanScavino?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DanScavino</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/JennaEllisEsq?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JennaEllisEsq</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DonaldJTrumpJr</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/EricTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EricTrump</a> <a href="https://t.co/YGTJrZB66h">pic.twitter.com/YGTJrZB66h</a></p>
<p>&mdash; TexanForTrump. God Bless Trump (@BlueWaterPalms) <a href="https://twitter.com/BlueWaterPalms/status/1351137646207266823?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Google told TechCrunch the app has not been banned from the Play Store, only suspended for its non-functionality. It can be reinstated if the problems are addressed. The company also said it attempted to reach out to the app&#8217;s developer before taking down the app, but never received a response.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Trump 2020 campaign app recently stopped working and we reached out to the developer multiple times in an attempt to get them to address the issue,&#8221; a Google spokesperson said. &#8220;People expect that apps downloaded from Google Play provide a minimum level of functionality and our policy is to remove non-working apps from the store if they are not fixed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the issues on Android, we found the iOS version was still able to load upon first launch, and could send confirmation codes to a phone number at sign-up. But when you visited the app&#8217;s main screens, it also now presents an error message. This error doesn&#8217;t affect your ability to browse through the past content on iOS, however.</p>

<p>Sensor Tower tells us the Android version of the Trump 2020 app hadn&#8217;t seen any new installs since February 7, 2021. The firm also noted the Android app had around 840,000 installs compared with close to 1.5 million on iOS.</p>
<p>This is not the first time the Trump 2020 app&#8217;s issues have made headlines.</p>
<p>In the months leading up to last year&#8217;s presidential election in the U.S., a number of TikTok users decided to troll the app in its App Store user reviews. (For some reason, Gen Z users believe a lowly rated app will be automatically removed from the app stores. That&#8217;s not true.) But their efforts at the time were able to bring the app&#8217;s overall star rating down to just 1.2 stars, and eventually forced the Trump 2020 campaign <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/trumps-official-campaign-app-had-to-reset-its-rating-after-being-trolled-by-tiktokers/">to reset the app&#8217;s ratings</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="B2L8cYDJEj"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/trumps-official-campaign-app-had-to-reset-its-rating-after-being-trolled-by-tiktokers/">Trump&#8217;s official campaign app had to reset its rating after being trolled by TikTokers</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Trump&#8217;s official campaign app had to reset its rating after being trolled by TikTokers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/trumps-official-campaign-app-had-to-reset-its-rating-after-being-trolled-by-tiktokers/embed/#?secret=B2L8cYDJEj" data-secret="B2L8cYDJEj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Though the election is long over, users have still been leaving bad reviews on the app along with their 1-star ratings. Sometimes, the trolls even attempt a bit of humor in the process.</p>
<p>&#8220;App attempted a coup to overthrow my phone&#8217;s operating system,&#8221; said one Play Store reviewer. &#8220;I&#8217;ve suffered enough since 2016,&#8221; said another on iOS.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Is there anything specific to SPACs that makes them a better route for edtech companies than a traditional IPO or direct listing?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Special purpose acquisition vehicles regained popularity in 2020 as an alternative way to take startups public, and now they are eyeing edtech companies.</p>
<p>So far, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/spac-churchill-capital-to-merge-with-skillsoft-in-13-billion-deal-2020-10-13">Skillsoft</a> has gone public through Churchill Capital, and Nerdy, parent company of Varsity Tutors, did the same through a reverse merger with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/nerdy-varsity-tutors-spac/?tpcc=ECTW2020">TPG Pace Tech Opportunities</a>. On the investor side, Edify and Adit EdTech Acquisition are both separate, $200 million <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/education-spac-edify-acquisition-files-for-a-%24200-million-ipo-2020-12-28">SPACs for education companies. </a></p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			SPACs are not being used to prop up companies that can&#8217;t go public through traditional means.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But is there anything specific to SPACs that makes them a better route for edtech companies than a traditional IPO or direct listing? To explore the question, I reached out to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlescohn">Chuck Cohn</a>, CEO of Nerdy, which is currently in the process of being SPACed by TPG, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/susan-wolford-37b7915">Susan Wolford</a>, chairperson of Edify Acquisition, a $200 million SPAC for edtech companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/nerdy-varsity-tutors-spac/">Nerdy&#8217;s business is growing</a>, but the company doesn&#8217;t expect to be profitable until 2023 and wants to drive revenues up 31% and 43% from its 2020 and 2021 expectations, respectively. Cohn said the balance sheet looks the way it does because they are heavily investing in product and engineering, and focusing on being well-capitalized.</p>
<p>The SPAC, he said, is an opportunity to accelerate Nerdy’s core business: “It’s less about going into the public markets, and more about that this transaction allows us to take an offensive position and lean into the big opportunities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cohn said they pursued a SPAC because it is a faster route to going public. As vaccines roll out, growth in remote learning will slow, which could hurt growth expectations — especially ones as ambitious as Nerdy’s. For that reason, it&#8217;s clear why some edtech companies want to get out to the public markets as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Despite some naysayers, Cohn said SPACs are not being used to prop up companies that can&#8217;t go public through traditional means.</p>
<p>“I think that perception was fair a year ago,” he said. “But if you look at companies that have taken this route recently, including OpenDoor, they are very high quality. There’s a fundamental perception change.” He added that “SPACs have been reaching out over the years,” but the timing felt more fortuitous due to TPG’s interest and track record.</p>
<p>On the other side of the table, Wolford said she is currently searching for an edtech company to bring public on behalf of Edify, a $200 million SPAC she has raised. She noted that PIPE instruments, aka private investments in public entities, have helped de-risk SPACs for the general audience. These instruments have been around for decades, but Wolford said they recently became more mainstream to use in SPACs.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like corporate financial accounting, the power grid never draws headlines when things are going well.

<p>Power grids are going to be in the news more and more in the coming years as global climate change intensifies storm activity and grids come under increasingly harsh strain. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/severe-weather-blackouts-shows-the-grids-biggest-problem-is-infrastructure-not-renewables/">As my colleague Jon Shieber wrote yesterday</a>, “Whether it’s heavily regulated markets like California or a free market like Texas, current policy can’t stop the weather from wreaking havoc and putting people’s lives at risk.” The grid is at the center of one of the toughest challenges facing us this century.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What’s needed are better sensors and tech for identifying the source of outages — and also preventing them in the first place. With millions of power poles and hundreds of thousands of miles of transmission wires scattered across the United States, how can utilities reliably verify the quality of their systems? How can they do that in an efficient way to avoid rate increases on users?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gridware.io/#beta-program">Gridware</a>, which is in the current batch of Y Combinator, is one company taking a shot at this critical need. Its approach is to use a small, sensor-laden box that can be installed to a power pole with just four screws. Gridware’s package contains microphones and other sensors to sense the ambient environment around a power pole, and it uses on-board AI/ML processing to listen for anomalies and report them to the relevant managers as appropriate.</p>
<p>It’s like “a guard standing next to the pole, listening to it, watching over it,” Tim Barat, CEO and co-founder, said, likening the box to a Fitbit for a power pole. When a tree branch breaks and cuts through a line, there’s “no way to detect them unless you are right next to the fault.” With Gridware, it’s “not the right place at the right time but the right place <i>all</i> the time,” he said.</p>
<p>What makes the founding team compelling here is the backgrounds of some of the company’s founders. Barat worked as a power pole worker himself in the field, evaluating equipment and searching for problems. “Every time we go up a pole, we hit it with a hammer, which tells us whether there is termite damage, etc. [ … and] that is still how inspectors investigate a pole,” he noted.</p>
<p>Barat eventually migrated to University of California, Berkeley, where he was mentored by Prabal Dutta, an electrical engineering professor who also joined the company early on as a co-founder. Dutta’s worked has focused on “industrial cyber-physical systems,” and he continues to research industrial control systems through digital interfaces <a href="https://www.icyphy.org">via the iCyPhy center</a>.</p>

<p>Barat also met Abdulrahman Bin Omar, who had worked for a number of years in the energy sector, in a class that eventually had a one-week hiatus due to California wildfires. The two began working together in 2019, joining Berkeley’s startup incubator <a href="https://citrisfoundry.org">Citrus Foundry</a> in 2020. The trio eventually linked up with co-founders Hall Chen and Riley Lyman as well, and <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/2020-10-14%20Agenda_ADA.pdf">snagged a $150,000 state grant</a> from the California Energy Commission <a href="https://calseed.fund">via the CalSEED program</a>.</p>
<p>Today, the startup has seven employees, and it’s currently in talks with utility grids of all sizes about deploying its product. Grids can be <i>very</i> slow to adopt new technology with very long testing and sales cycles, but there might just be an opportunity for the company to accelerate those normal timelines given the extensive and visible power outages we have witnessed the past few years. We need to “transition our grid to face the challenges of the new century,” Barat said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today introduced a suite of updates for its <a href="https://edu.google.com/">online education tools</a> whose adoption and further development have been accelerated by the pandemic, including <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/classroom-roadmap/">Google Classroom</a>, <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/google-meet-safety-and-engagement/">Google Meet</a> and the next generation of G Suite for Education, <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/google-workspace-for-education/">now rebranded as Google Workspace</a> for Education. In total, Google is promising more than 50 new features across its education products, with a focus on meeting educators&#8217; and admins&#8217; needs, in particular, in addition to those of the students.</p>
<p>When Google first introduced Google Classroom, it didn&#8217;t set out to create a Learning Management System (LMS), the company says. But during the COVID-19 pandemic, Google found that many educators had begun to use Classroom as the &#8220;hub&#8221; for their online learning activities. Today, the service is used by over 150 million students, teachers and school admins, up from just 40 million last year.</p>
<p>As a result of the pandemic-prompted adoption and user feedback, Google is introducing a range of new features for Classroom this year, some of which will be made available sooner than others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To better cater to those who are using Classroom as the hub for online learning, a new marketplace of Classroom &#8220;add-ons&#8221; will allow teachers later this year to select their favorite edtech tools and content and assign them directly to students, without requiring extra log-ins. Admins will also be able to install these add-ons for other teachers in their domains.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TCKRxg5cYO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/google-to-roll-out-its-digital-learning-platform-to-23-million-students-and-teachers-in-indias-maharashtra-state/">Google to roll out its digital learning platform to 23 million students and teachers in India&#8217;s Maharashtra state</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google to roll out its digital learning platform to 23 million students and teachers in India&#8217;s Maharashtra state&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/google-to-roll-out-its-digital-learning-platform-to-23-million-students-and-teachers-in-indias-maharashtra-state/embed/#?secret=TCKRxg5cYO" data-secret="TCKRxg5cYO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Also later this year, admins will be able to populate classes in advance with Student Information System (SIS) roster syncing and, for select SIS customers, students&#8217; grades from Classroom will be able to be exported directly to the SIS. Additional logging, including Classroom audit logs (to see things like student removals or who archived a class), as well as Classroom activity logs (to check on adoption and engagement) will be available soon.</p>
<p>When students attend in-person school, teachers can easily notice when a student is falling behind. A new set of Classroom tools aims to do the same for virtual learning, as well. With the new student engagement tracking feature, teachers will be able to see relevant stats about how students are interacting with Classroom, like which students submitted assignments on a given day or commented on a post, for example.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114075" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114075" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114075" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/LwG_Student-Engagement-Tracking.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114075" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Other tools will tackle the realities of working from home, where internet connections aren&#8217;t always reliable, or &#8212; for some low-income students &#8212; not available at all. With an updated Classroom Android app, students will be able to start their work offline, review assignments, open Drive attachments and write in Google Docs without an internet connection. The work will sync when a connection is again available. And when students upload assignments by taking a photo, new tools will allow students to combine photos into a single document, crop and rotate images and adjust the lighting.</p>
<p>Classroom will also gain support for rich text formatting &#8212; like bold, italics, underline and adding bullets across web, iOS and Android.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114074" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114074" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114074" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/021-GDU-MET-UI-Rich-Text-Editing-in-Google-Classroom-AV-R2.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114074" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Originality reports, which help to detect plagiarism, will be available soon in 15 languages, including English, Spanish, Portuguese, Norwegian, Swedish, French, Italian, Indonesian, Japanese, Finnish, German, Korean, Danish, Malaysian and Hindi.</p>
<p>And Google&#8217;s own free, introductory computer science curriculum, CS First, is immediately available in Classroom.</p>
<p>Beyond Classroom itself, Google Meet is also being updated with the needs of educators in mind.</p>
<p>One must-have new feature, rolling out over the next few weeks, <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/02/mute-all-google-meet-participants-at-once.html">is a &#8220;mute all&#8221; button</a> to give control of the classroom back to teachers. In April, teachers will also be able to control when a student can unmute themselves, as well.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114077" style="width: 393px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114077" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2114077" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/LwG_Moderator-Controls-on-Mobile.gif?w=383" alt="" width="383" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114077" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Other moderation controls will roll out this year, too, including controls over who can join meetings, chat or share their screen from their iOS and Android devices. Policies over who can join video calls will be able to be set by admins in April, as well, enabling rules around student-to-student connections across districts, professional development opportunities for teachers, external speakers visiting a class and more. Students will also not be able to join Meets generated from Classroom until their teacher has arrived. Teachers, meanwhile, will be made meeting hosts so multiple teachers can share the load of managing classes.</p>

<p>Google Meet is adding engagement and inclusivity features for students, too. Students will be able to select emoji skin tones to represent them and react in class with emoji, which teachers will be able to control.</p>

<p>Finally, Google&#8217;s &#8220;G Suite for Education,&#8221; which includes Classroom, Meet, Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides and more, will be rebranded as Google Workspace for Education. The tools themselves, now used by 170 million students and educators globally, won&#8217;t change. But the set will be available in four editions instead of just two to better accommodate a wider variety of needs.</p>
<p>The free version will be rebranded Google Workspace for Education Fundamentals, and will remain largely the same. The paid version, meanwhile, will become available in three tiers: Google Workspace for Education Standard and Google Workspace for Education Plus, as well as the Teaching and Learning Upgrade, which can be added on to Fundamentals or Standard to provide video communication in Google Meet, and other Classroom tools, like originality reports.</p>
<p>Standard has everything in Fundamentals, in addition to enhanced security through Security Center, audit logs and advanced mobile management. Plus has everything in the three other versions, as well as advanced security and analytics, teaching and learning capabilities, and more.</p>
<p>Fundamentals and Plus are available today and the others will go live April 14, 2021. Those who already have G Suite for Enterprise for Education will be upgraded to Education Plus.</p>
<p>Related to these changes, the storage model will be updated to a new, pooled storage option that aims to better allocate storage resources across educational institutions. The new model offers schools and universities a baseline of 100 TB of pooled storage shared by all users, which goes into effect for current customers in July 2022, and will be effective for new customers in 2022. Google says less than 1% of institutions will be impacted by the updated model, whose baseline supports over 100 million documents or 8 million presentations or 400,000 hours of video, to give an idea of size.</p>

<p>The company plans several updates for its Google Workspace for Education product line in the weeks to come, including saved drafts in Google Forms (in Fundamentals) Google Meet meeting transcripts (in the Teaching and Learning Upgrade) and more.</p>
<p>Outside of software product updates, Google is launching over 40 new <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/learning-with-google-chromebook/">Chromebooks</a>, including a set of &#8220;Always Connected&#8221; branded devices that have an LTE connectivity option built in. Chrome&#8217;s screen reader, ChromeVox, has also been improved with new tutorials, the ability to search ChromeVox menus and voice switching that automatically changes the screen reader’s voice based on the language of the text.</p>
<p>Parents, who are now participating in their child&#8217;s online learning in a number of ways, will be able to add their child&#8217;s Google Workspace for Education account to their child&#8217;s personal account with Family Link &#8212; Google&#8217;s parental control software. That means kids can still log into their school apps and accounts, while parents ensure they stay focused on learning by restricting other apps and overall device usage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jeff Chen has a pithy pitch for his new startup <a href="https://www.gettaste.com">Taste</a>: &#8220;We made the Instagram of nice food.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, just as Instagram made it easy for regular smartphone users to look like talented photographers, Taste makes it easy for customers to prepare impressive meals at home.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because the real preparation is being done by fine-dining restaurants — Chen told me there are 16 Michelin-starred and Michelin-rated restaurants currently on the platform — whose food doesn&#8217;t translate easily to a delivery or takeout experience. Taste offers &#8220;dinner kits,&#8221; which Chen said are neither standard takeout (where everything has been fully prepared but doesn&#8217;t necessarily travel well) or a regular meal kit (where &#8220;everything is separate and raw&#8221;).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead, he suggested Taste&#8217;s dinner kits are &#8220;this in-between thing&#8221; where the food is mostly, but not entirely, prepared in advance, allowing customers to &#8220;heat and assemble much faster.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114295" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114295" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114295" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Taste screenshot" width="680" height="661" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg 1860w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg?resize=150,146 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg?resize=300,292 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg?resize=768,747 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg?resize=680,661 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg?resize=1536,1493 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-2-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114295" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Taste</p></div></p>
<p>For example, when I tried out Taste last week, my girlfriend and I received three-course meals from <a href="https://www.intersect-nyc.com">Intersect by Lexus</a> and its &#8220;restaurant in residence&#8221; The Grey. A couple of the (delicious) courses and sides had to be heated in the oven or the microwave for five, 10 or 20 minutes, but there was no real prep or cooking required — the real work was cleaning up afterward.</p>
<p>Even the packaging was impressive (if a little overwhelming), with a large, fancy box for each kit, and then individual packages for each course, plus a separate package for spices. There are optional wine pairings, and some restaurants will also provide plating instructions and a Spotify playlist for the meal.</p>
<p>Taste — which is part of the winter 2021 batch of startups at Y Combinator — is currently New York City-only, where it works with restaurants including Dirt Candy, Meadowsweet and the Musket Room. As you might expect, these kits cost more than your standard dinner delivery. Many of them are in the $60-to-$100 per person range, although there are also dinners below $40, as well as a la carte options.</p>
<p>Chen (who sold <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/24/joyride/">his last startup Joyride</a> to Google) said that he and his co-founder Daryl Sew have been excited to help New York City chefs reinvent their offerings for delivery and weather the pandemic.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114300" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114300" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114300" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-3-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Taste founders Daryl Sew, Jeff Chen" width="680" height="511" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-3-1.jpg 1278w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=768,577 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=680,511 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/unnamed-3-1.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114300" class="wp-caption-text">Taste founders Daryl Sew and Jeff Chen. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Taste</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We also do a very key thing, which is pre-ordering and batching for the restaurant,&#8221; he added. &#8220;When a restaurant works with Taste, all the orders come in two days before to the restaurant, and we pick it up at designated times, which helps tremendously with capacity lift.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while Taste might seem particularly appealing now, when indoor fine dining options are either illegal, unsafe or transformed by social distancing and mask-wearing, Chen anticipates healthy demand even after the pandemic. After all, he suggested that before COVID-19, there were many people — busy parents, for example, or people who work long hours — who felt like they couldn&#8217;t take advantage of these restaurants as often as they wanted, or at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is getting moved into the home,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Movies are getting moved into the home with Netflix, workouts are getting moved into the home with Peloton and Tonal, and now we’re going to move nice dining experiences into the home.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Australian Facebook users will be forced to go elsewhere to read news after the company announced Wednesday that they will be restricting users in the country from sharing or viewing news links on the platform. The drastic move follows the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/australia-now-has-a-template-for-forcing-facebook-and-google-to-pay-for-news/">debate on proposed legislation from the Australian government that seeks to push internet platforms</a> &#8212; with a particular focus on advertising giants Facebook and Google &#8212; to pay news publishers directly for access to share their content.</p>
<p>Pulling back entirely was a nuclear option for Facebook, which had previously floated the possibility. In a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/changes-to-sharing-and-viewing-news-on-facebook-in-australia/">blog post</a>, the company sought to minimize the material impact of the decision to Facebook&#8217;s bottom line, while emphasizing what the move will cost users in Australia and around the globe. The company disclosed that just 4% of the content in Australian users&#8217; feeds was news, though the platform did not break out other engagement metrics tied to news consumption.</p>
<p>In their post, Facebook sought to drive a distinction between how news content was shared on Facebook by users while content is algorithmically curated by Google inside their search product. &#8220;Google Search is inextricably intertwined with news and publishers do not voluntarily provide their content,&#8221; William Easton, Facebook&#8217;s managing director for the region, wrote. &#8220;On the other hand, publishers willingly choose to post news on Facebook, as it allows them to sell more subscriptions, grow their audiences and increase advertising revenue.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YwI0ihHGdB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/australia-now-has-a-template-for-forcing-facebook-and-google-to-pay-for-news/">Australia now has a template for forcing Facebook and Google to pay for news</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Australia now has a template for forcing Facebook and Google to pay for news&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/australia-now-has-a-template-for-forcing-facebook-and-google-to-pay-for-news/embed/#?secret=YwI0ihHGdB" data-secret="YwI0ihHGdB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Google has already begun working with publishers to drive lump sum payments so that they continue to surface news content in the country, striking a deal Wednesday with Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s News Corp, despite their own earlier threats to shut down in Australia. Facebook&#8217;s action has ramifications for global users outside Australia who will be unable to share links on the platform to news publications based in the country.</p>
<p>This legislation is an aggressive example of regional legislation having the potential to drive global change for how internet platforms continue to operate. It&#8217;s clear that plenty of other countries are watching this saga play out. Facebook taking a hard line approach while Google seeks to strike private deals to stay active showcases different approaches from very different platforms being forced to reckon with how they operate in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A security lapse by a Jamaican government contractor has exposed immigration records and COVID-19 test results for hundreds of thousands of travelers who visited the island over the past year.</p>
<p>The Jamaican government contracted Amber Group to build the <a href="https://jamcovid19.moh.gov.jm/">JamCOVID19 website</a> and app, which the government uses to publish daily coronavirus figures and allows residents to self-report their symptoms. The contractor also built the website to pre-approve travel applications to visit the island during the pandemic, a process that requires travelers to upload a negative COVID-19 test result before they board their flight if they come from high-risk countries, including the United States.</p>
<p>But a cloud storage server storing those uploaded documents was left unprotected and without a password, and was publicly spilling out files onto the open web.</p>
<p>Many of the victims whose information was found on the exposed server are Americans.</p>
<p>The data is now secure after TechCrunch contacted Amber Group&#8217;s chief executive Dushyant Savadia, who did not comment when reached prior to publication.</p>
<p>The storage server, hosted on Amazon Web Services, was set to public. It&#8217;s not known for how long the data was unprotected, but contained more than 70,000 negative COVID-19 lab results, over 425,000 immigration documents authorizing travel to the island — which included the traveler&#8217;s name, date of birth and passport numbers — and over 250,000 quarantine orders dating back to June 2020, when Jamaica reopened its borders to visitors after the pandemic&#8217;s first wave. The server also contained more than 440,000 images of travelers&#8217; signatures.</p>
<p>Two U.S. travelers whose lab results were among the exposed data told TechCrunch that they uploaded their COVID-19 results through <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210215095341/https://www.visitjamaica.com/travelauthorization/">the Visit Jamaica website</a> before their travel. Once lab results are processed, travelers receive a travel authorization that they must present before boarding their flight.</p>
<p>Both of these documents, as well as quarantine orders that require visitors to shelter in place and several passports, were on the exposed storage server.</p>
<p>Travelers who are staying outside Jamaica&#8217;s so-called &#8220;resilient corridor,&#8221; a zone that covers a large portion of the island&#8217;s population, are told to install the app built by Amber Group that tracks their location and is tracked by the Ministry of Health to ensure visitors stay within the corridor. The app also requires that travelers record short &#8220;check-in&#8221; videos with a daily code sent by the government, along with their name and any symptoms.</p>
<p>The server exposed more than 1.1 million of those daily updating check-in videos.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114271" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114271" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2114271" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Covid-19_airport_arrival_flyer-v7-1.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="933" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Covid-19_airport_arrival_flyer-v7-1.jpg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Covid-19_airport_arrival_flyer-v7-1.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Covid-19_airport_arrival_flyer-v7-1.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Covid-19_airport_arrival_flyer-v7-1.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Covid-19_airport_arrival_flyer-v7-1.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Covid-19_airport_arrival_flyer-v7-1.jpg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114271" class="wp-caption-text">An airport information flyer given to travelers arriving in Jamaica. Travelers may be required to install the JamCOVID19 app to allow the government to monitor their location and to require video check-ins. (Image: Jamaican government)</p></div></p>
<p>The server also contained dozens of daily timestamped spreadsheets named &#8220;PICA,&#8221; likely for the Jamaican passport, immigration and citizenship agency, but these were restricted by access permissions. But the permissions on the storage server were set so that anyone had full control of the files inside, such as allowing them to be downloaded or deleted altogether. (TechCrunch did neither, as doing so would be unlawful.)</p>
<p>Stephen Davidson, a spokesperson for the Jamaican Ministry of Health, did not comment when reached, or say if the government planned to inform travelers of the security lapse.</p>
<p>In a brief statement after we published, the Jamaican government <a href="https://jis.gov.jm/jamcovid-security-protocols-strengthened/">issued a statement</a> confirming the vulnerability.</p>
<p>&#8220;A thorough investigation was immediately initiated to determine if there were any breaches in travelers’ data security, if the vulnerability had been exploited, and if there was a breach of any laws. At present, there is no evidence to suggest that the security vulnerability had been exploited for malicious data extraction prior to it being rectified,&#8221; the statement read.</p>
<p>Savadia founded Amber Group in 2015 and soon launched its vehicle-tracking system, Amber Connect.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/business/20201030/amber-enters-four-more-markets-pandemic-tech">one report</a>, Amber&#8217;s Savadia said the company developed JamCOVID19 &#8220;within three days&#8221; and made it available to the Jamaican government in large part for free. The contractor is billing other countries, including Grenada and the British Virgin Islands, for similar implementations, and is said to be looking for other government customers outside the Caribbean.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you&#8217;re just starting out building your company, there&#8217;s obviously a lot that can go wrong. Especially if you&#8217;re a first-time founder (but even if you&#8217;re an experienced serial entrepreneur), it can be hard to spot the potential pitfalls that might lead you astray before you even really get rolling. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re thrilled to have Fuel Capital General Partner Leah Solivan joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=fuelcapitalpost">TechCrunch Early Stage — Operations and Fundraising</a> on April 1 and 2 for a discussion about how to avoid making some of the biggest mistakes early in your founding journey.</p>
<p>Solivan brings her keen insight as an early-stage investor who has invested in and helped many early-stage companies spanning consumer tech, marketplaces, hardware and retail &#8212; but also her eight years of experience leading TaskRabbit, the startup she founded and led to a successful exit when it was acquired by IKEA in 2017. Between her time as an operator building a successful business and raising more than $50 million in venture funding, and her nearly four years investing and helping other founders build companies with Fuel, Solivan has unparalleled perspective on how to avoid common company-building problems early on.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=fuelcapitalpost">TC Early Stage</a> this year, our two-day virtual event focused on entrepreneurs turning their startup dreams into reality, we&#8217;re focusing on both operations and fundraising, with a variety of top speakers ranging from investors, to accelerator managers, to subject-matter experts in key roles that startups need to invest in early on. The fully virtual event will include not only virtual panel discussions and interviews like our chat with Solivan, but also plenty of networking and opportunities for audience participation with our world-class speakers and guests.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Atlanta area is getting a new incubator for startups working with 5G technology courtesy of T-Mobile and Georgia Tech&#8217;s Advanced Technology Development Center (ATDC), <a href="https://innovate.gatech.edu/news/tmobile-georgia-tech-curiosity-lab-team-fuel-5g-innovation-drones-autonomous-vehicles-robotics/">the companies announced today</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an expansion of the T-Mobile Accelerator program and part of the big carrier&#8217;s efforts to boost 5G innovation.</p>
<p>Located in the Atlanta-adjacent exurb of Peachtree Corners&#8217; technology development park, which is already equipped with T-Mobile&#8217;s 5G services, <a href="https://atdc.org/application-for-the-5g-connected-future-incubator-at-curiosity-lab-at-peachtree-corners/">the incubator will help developers build and test 5G use cases</a> including autonomous vehicles, robotics, industrial drone applications, mixed reality training and entertainment, remote medical care and personal health, the company said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Startups working with the 5G Connected Future program will work directly with folks at T-Mobile&#8217;s accelerator, Georgia Tech and Curiosity Lab, an initiative in the Peachtree Corners campus.</p>
<p>“In addition to the normal startup concerns, entrepreneurs in the 5G space face a unique set of challenges such as regulatory issues at the state and local levels, network security, and integration testing,” said ATDC Director John Avery.</p>
<p>Peachtree Corners&#8217; setup may help folks navigate that rollout. As part of its involvement, ATDC will offer programing, recruit and evaluate startups, and hire staff to manage the vertical in Peachtree Corners, the organization said.</p>
<p>“This collaboration is a great opportunity for ATDC and Georgia Tech, the city of Peachtree Corners and Curiosity Lab, and T-Mobile, a Fortune 50 company, to create a unique collection to work with these companies, refine their ideas into scalable companies, and bring these solutions to market more quickly,” Avery said.</p>
<p>Such a partnership underscores “Georgia Tech’s commitment to enabling tomorrow’s technology leaders, which remains as strong as when ATDC was founded 41 years ago,” said Chaouki T. Abdallah, Georgia Tech’s executive vice president for research. “Innovation cannot take place in a vacuum, which is why entrepreneurs and startups require the knowledge and resources provided through partnerships such as ours.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Massachusetts-based Locus Robotics today announced a $150 million Series E. The round, <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">led by Tiger Global Management and Bond, </span>brings the firm’s total to around $250 to date, and values the robotics company at $1 billion. Locus is notable for a more modular and flexible solution for automating warehouses than many of its competitors (see: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/as-retail-robotics-heats-up-berkshire-grey-raises-263m/">Berkshire Grey</a>). The company essentially leases out robotic fleet for organizations looking to automate logistics.</p>
<p>“We can change the wings on the plane while it’s flying,” CEO Rick Faulk tells TechCrunch. Basically no one else can do that. Companies want flexible automation. They don’t want to bolt anything to the floor. If you’re a third-party logistics company and you have a two, three, four-year contract, the last thing you want to do is invest $25-$50 million to buy a massive solution, bolt it to the floor and be locked into all of this upfront expense.”</p>
<p>The company currently has some 4,000 robots deployed across 80 sites. Roughly 80% of its deployments are in the U.S., with the remaining 20% in Europe. Part of this massive funding round will go toward expanding international operations, including a bigger push into the EU, as well as the APAC region, where it presently doesn’t have much of a footprint.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company will also be investing in R&amp;D, sales and marketing and increasing its current headcount of 165 by 75 in the coming year.</p>
<p>The pandemic is clearly a driver in interest around this brand of automation, with more companies looking toward robotics for help.</p>
<p>“COVID has put a spike in the growth of online ordering, clearly, and that spike is probably a four to five year jump,” says Faulk. &#8220;If you look at the trend of e-commerce, it’s been on a steady upward tick. It was about 11% last year and COVID put a spike up to 16/17%. We think that genie’s out of the bottle, and it’s not going back any time soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding round also points to a company that seemingly has no desire to be acquired by a larger name, akin to Kiva Systems’ transformation into Amazon Robotics.</p>
<p>“We have no interest in being acquired,” the CEO says. “We think we can build the most and greatest value by operating independently. There are investors that want to invest in helping everyone that’s not named ‘Amazon’ compete.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’re only two weeks away from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/">TC Sessions: Justice 2021</a>, a virtual conference focused on making diversity, equity, inclusion and labor as integral to tech as data, software engineers, startups and venture capital.</p>
<p>Join your global community on March 3 for a day packed with presentations, panel discussions and fireside chats with the top social justice warriors, leaders and innovators in tech today. Just look at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#f26d091c-4740-46a5-bac6-55a457c322ef">this speaker lineup</a>. As always, we’ll have ample time for networking so you can connect and discover new people and new opportunities to change the world.</p>
<p>We believe accessibility and inclusion starts at home, which is why you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#tickets">get a TC Sessions: Justice pass</a> for $5. Here are just a few of the outstanding presentations on tap — be sure to read the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#1fa16903-b3ec-435b-ba68-d43e00bd8d70">TC Sessions: Justice 2021 agenda</a>. We have a few surprises and more speakers in store, so check back in the coming weeks to see what’s new.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Meeting of the Minds:</strong> Diversity and inclusion as an idea has been on the agenda of tech companies for years now. But the industry still lacks true inclusion, despite best efforts put forth by heads of diversity, equity and inclusion at these companies. We’ll seek to better understand what’s standing in the way of progress and what it’s going to take to achieve real change. Wade Davis (Netflix), Bo Young Lee (Uber).</p>
<p><strong>Identifying and Dismantling Tech&#8217;s Deep Systems of Bias:</strong> Nearly every popular technology or service has within it systems of bias or exclusion, ignored by the privileged but obvious to the groups affected. How should these systems be exposed and documented, and how can we set about eliminating them and preventing more from appearing in the future? Mutale Nkonde (AI for the People), Haben Girma (disability rights lawyer) and Safiya Umoja Noble (author of “Algorithms of Oppression”).</p>
<p><strong>Demystifying First-Check Fundraising with First-Check Investors:</strong> There are so many ways to finance your startup that don’t include Y combinator or a traditional fund. In this stacked panel, founders will hear how to leverage unconventional communities and resources to get the first dollars they need to execute. Brian Brackeen (Lightship Capital), Astrid Scholz (Zebras Unite), Sydney Thomas (Precursor Ventures).</p>
<p>You’ll also get to meet some of the diverse early-stage startup founders participating in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/include/">TechCrunch Include</a> program and watch them deliver their best pitch in a live feedback session.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/">TC Sessions: Justice 2021</a> takes place on March 3. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/#tickets">Buy your pass</a> and spend the day listening to and learning from the people leading the charge for meaningful change in tech.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.gravysolutions.io/">Gravy</a>, a startup helping subscription-based businesses recover failed payments, has raised $4.5 million in Series A funding for its specialized combination of technology and a human workspace that works to reacquire customers lost to what&#8217;s known as &#8220;involuntary churn.&#8221; That means the customer didn&#8217;t choose to end their subscription, but &#8212; for any one of hundreds of possible reasons &#8212; their credit card payment failed.</p>
<p>Typically, subscription-powered businesses attempt to correct this issue with technology &#8212; like sending automated emails, for example. Gravy, however, has developed a different solution that pairs its U.S.-based retention specialists with technology that alerts them to the failed payments. It then sells this whole system as a package to clients who use Gravy as an extension of their own workforce.</p>
<p>The new funding round &#8212; Gravy&#8217;s first institutional money &#8212; was led by Birmingham-based Arlington Family Partners, one of the few family offices in the southeast. It&#8217;s also one with a personal connection to Gravy co-founders, CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/caseygraham1/">Casey Graham</a> and Chief of Staff, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reneeweber1/">Renee Weber</a>, as it managed their earnings from a prior acquisition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Gravy, in fact, actually got its start at that earlier business, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-rocket-company/about/">The Rocket Company,</a> a coaching and resource provider for churches, which exited to a private equity group, <a href="https://www.ministrybrands.com/our-brands/">Ministry Brands</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We spent two years fixing [the problem of failed payments] in the last company and created a tech-enabled solution where we leveraged actual human beings to win back failed payments for subscriptions. And by doing that, we got a 5x offer higher than the initial offer because we fixed the failed payment problem,&#8221; Graham notes.</p>
<p>He first assumed other subscription businesses were doing the same, but later discovered that many were not. Instead, they tended to use automated means to address the problem, which would only recoup about 15% to 20% of the failed payments.</p>
<p>These tech-only solutions don&#8217;t work as well because customers often dismiss automated emails from companies, Graham says. However, customers do respond to personal outreach &#8212; but that&#8217;s something many new and fast-growing businesses can&#8217;t afford as they&#8217;re investing more heavily in growth and scale.</p>
<p>Gravy offers them a middle ground between automation and hiring in-house. Companies contract with Gravy <a href="https://www.gravysolutions.io/price">on a subscription basis</a> by paying a flat fee, tiered based upon transaction volume. This fee ranges from $997 on the low end to $8,000 on the high end. Gravy then integrates with the client&#8217;s own payment products and processor, their subscription manager and any other solutions they may use for managing subscriptions &#8212; like Stripe, Braintree, Recurly, Keap (Infusionsoft) and <a href="https://www.gravysolutions.io/what-gravy-does">others</a>. It even sets up a Gravy channel on the company&#8217;s Slack in order to better communicate with company staff.</p>
<p>The end result is that Gravy&#8217;s team feels like a part of the business itself, not some contract workforce.</p>
<p>Once established, Gravy&#8217;s team will use email and text, per the client&#8217;s preferences, to personally reach out to customers with failed payments to try to get their card information updated. Because it&#8217;s operating closely with the client, the specialists can also offer things like &#8220;stay bonuses&#8221; and other deals that could help bring back a customer who may not have otherwise bothered to return. During COVID, for example, Gravy also offered additional options, like the ability for the customer to skip several months along with other more personalized options to meet the customer&#8217;s specific needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we&#8217;re onboarding [a client], we create an empathetic script of three different responses, or opportunities for us to negotiate with the customer to win that customer back,&#8221; Graham explains. This works because of the human component &#8212; people know when they&#8217;re talking to a real person and not an automated script, he says.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114195" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114195" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114195" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Solutions-Interface.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="409" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Solutions-Interface.png 700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Solutions-Interface.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Solutions-Interface.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Solutions-Interface.png?resize=680,409 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Solutions-Interface.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114195" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gravy</p></div></p>
<p>Since its founding in 2017, Gravy has scaled to over 300 clients, whose businesses may be as small as $200,000-$250,000 in revenue up to $100 million in annual revenue from subscriptions. These clients either operate in the B2B space &#8212; like B2B content subscriptions or tech education and certification, for example &#8212; or in the B2C space. In particular, Gravy is leveraged by a number of &#8220;box&#8221; subscription services (which offer to ship a box of products to a customer&#8217;s home) and B2C education and online courses.</p>
<p>To date, Gravy has processed over 6 million failed payments and has won back $175 million in failed payment subscriptions. The company is now on a mission to return $1 billion in failed payments by 2023. Gravy is also expected to pass $1 million in MRR this year, Graham says.</p>
<p>Notably, Gravy&#8217;s retention specialists aren&#8217;t &#8220;gig workers&#8221; or contractors &#8212; they&#8217;re full-time employees with benefits. And they can be employed from anywhere, which Graham says is a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Though technically an Atlanta-area startup, Graham and Weber live 50 miles north of downtown Atlanta.</p>
<p>&#8220;I live on a farm, and we were told we were at a disadvantage because we weren&#8217;t in the middle of the Atlanta tech scene,&#8221; Graham says. &#8220;But the reality is, it became a huge advantage for us because our strategy has been to recruit the best people in small towns across the United States. Besides, he adds, &#8220;Slack is our headquarters.&#8221;</p>
<p>This strategy has allowed Gravy to also employ several military family members, who often have a hard time finding consistent work because they have to move regularly. That leads them to often take gig work instead of full-time jobs.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114196" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114196" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2114196" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Team.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Team.jpg 7776w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Team.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Team.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Team.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Team.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Team.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Team.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gravy-Team.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114196" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gravy</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;The gig economy &#8212; those companies are not committed to those people. They don&#8217;t care about them, or if they work or not. It&#8217;s a gig,&#8221; Graham says. &#8220;Gravy is committed to them on salaries, benefits … that&#8217;s something we&#8217;re super proud of.&#8221; He says Gravy&#8217;s salaries start at $55,000.</p>
<p>With the new funding, Gravy plans to expand its team of 83 to about 150 by year-end, expand its client acquisition efforts and further invest into its product. Longer term, he believes Gravy could also help businesses with other needs, including voluntary churn, for starters, and even customer service and customer success in the future.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution to the world’s climate change problems could be under our feet, as soil has the potential to store more than </span><a href="https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2018/02/21/can-soil-help-combat-climate-change/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">three times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the amount of carbon in the atmosphere But about </span><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2019.00008/full"><span style="font-weight: 400;">45% </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the Earth’s soil is used for agriculture, and most farmland has lost up to 30% of its carbon from unsustainable land management practices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To turn agricultural land into a thriving carbon sink, farmers need to be able to manage it by shifting to regenerative agriculture practices like reducing tillage, planting cover crops and increasing crop rotations and biodiversity. But you can’t manage something until you can measure it, and that’s where </span><a href="http://useyardstick.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yard Stick </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">comes in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Soil sequestration can be a really powerful carbon removal technology,” said Chris Tolles, CEO of Yard Stick. “But only if we’ve got really high-quality science and technology helping us measure it.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quantifying regenerative agriculture is a challenge, and measuring soil carbon is no exception. The traditional method, dry combustion, requires a lot of leg work. Scientists trudge across acres of land digging up soil samples and mail them thousands of miles to a lab where another scientist burns the soil to calculate the carbon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That is not scalable for obvious reasons,” Tolles said. “We need a measurement technology that can release that bottleneck.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yard Stick hopes to be that technology &#8212; a hand-held soil probe to measure carbon soil levels onsite. The Massachusetts-based startup was founded out of the </span><a href="https://soilhealthinstitute.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soil Health Institute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using a $3.25 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy’s </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/soil-health-institute-awarded-3-25-million-from-arpa-e-to-develop-soil-carbon-measurement-and-monitoring-system-301124040.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program. This funding exists to specifically help pro-social technology solutions come to market.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four soil experts &#8212; Dr. Christine Morgan, chief scientific officer of the Soil Health Institute; Kevin Meissner, a mechanical/electrical engineer who was previously the co-founder/CTO of carbon removal startup Charm Industrial; associate professor at the University of Nebraska, Yufeng Ge; and Alex McBratney from the University of Sydney &#8212; combined their research and expertise to create a probe that uses spectral analysis, resistance sensors, machine learning and agricultural statistics to measure and calculate the amount of carbon in an area of soil. Tolles is tasked with bringing the product out of the academic world and into the commercial market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The probe is attached to a hand-held drill. The small camera on its tip is tuned to capture the specific wavelengths reflected off of organic carbon using VisNIR spectrometry. Resistance sensors use the force needed to drill the probe into the ground to calculate the density of the soil. With those two inputs, plus a few complicated algorithms and statistical analyses, Yard Stick can calculate the amount of carbon in the ground without ever digging up a sample and mailing it to a lab to be burned.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114215" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114215" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2114215" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Yard-Stick-2.jpg" alt="Soil measurement tool by Yard stick lying on ground" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Yard-Stick-2.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Yard-Stick-2.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Yard-Stick-2.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Yard-Stick-2.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Yard-Stick-2.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Yard-Stick-2.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Yard-Stick-2.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Yard-Stick-2.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114215" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Yard Stick</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One, we can take samples way faster. Number two, the cost is dramatically lower,” Tolles said. “And what that means, three, you’ll get a more accurate measurement of your carbon stock because our technology is so much cheaper and easier, that you can dramatically increase your sampling density.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yard Stick is currently working with a few large food companies engaged in regenerative agriculture pilot programs with farms across the United States. Yard Stick doesn’t plan to sell directly to farms. Instead, it works with project developers like these companies. Yard Stick is using these connections to verify its probe is as reliable as the traditional gold standard of carbon soil measuring and to introduce its product and service to farmers. Yard Stick plans to sell a data measurement service, not the hardware itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“None of our customers want to own a spectrometer,” Tolles said. “They don’t know what to do with one even if we made it idiot simple.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yard Stick sends its people out to take the measurements and then provides reports to farmers and other stakeholders that put the data in context, charging per acre. At some point Tolles hopes the device will be simple enough that anyone with a bit of training can use the probe so the number of Yard Stick employees isn’t a rate-limiting factor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 2022, Yard Stick hopes to be measuring 200,000 acres using a few thousand probes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With more data and just as importantly more data sharing, we can begin to turn the ship around on climate change. But data is a sensitive business to be in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to acknowledge the limitations of late-stage capitalist worldviews, which don’t often incentivize sharing,” Tolles said. “There’s a real tragic risk here that the information is so valuable that everybody wants to keep it to themselves and the benefits of soil carbon marketplaces only accrue to the same giant industrial agricultural corporations that have had it for so long.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few other early-stage companies are also trying to bust open the market for soil carbon, including </span><a href="https://www.laserag.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LaserAg</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which works in laboratories instead of in the fields, and </span><a href="https://www.cloudagronomics.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CloudAgronomics</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> which uses satellites for remote measurement of soil health. But Yard Stick’s main competitor is every farm out there that isn’t measuring and managing their carbon stores, which, according to Tolles, is 99.9% of farms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our mission is to avoid catastrophic climate change,” Tolles said. “So I think we’re inclined to be very pro-competitor.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.blockchain.com">Blockchain.com</a> has announced that it has <a href="https://medium.com/blockchain/blockchain-com-raised-120m-strategic-growth-round-led-by-macro-investors-84488f4a0913">raised</a> a $120 million funding round. The company develops a popular cryptocurrency wallet as well as an exchange, an explorer and more.</p>
<p>Moore Strategic Ventures, Kyle Bass, Access Industries, Rovida Advisors, Lightspeed Venture Partners, GV, Lakestar, Eldridge and other unnamed investors participated in today’s funding round. Overall, the company has raised more than $190 million since its creation.</p>
<p>Originally named Blockchain.info, the company started off as a blockchain explorer. An explorer lets you enter the hash of any transaction that occurs on the bitcoin blockchain to get more information about the amount, fees, number of confirmations as well as the wallet addresses of the sender and the receiver. Over time, explorers started adding support for more blockchains and more types of data.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Blockchain.com then built an open-source bitcoin wallet — it now supports more cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. The company’s wallet is a noncustodial wallet, which means that you’re in control of your private keys. Other noncustodial wallets include <a href="https://wallet.coinbase.com">Coinbase Wallet</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/18/buzzy-ethereum-wallet-app-argent-comes-out-of-stealth/">Argent</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/16/zengo-wants-to-become-the-crypto-wallet-for-the-masses/">ZenGo</a>, etc.</p>
<p>Many crypto users choose to buy bitcoins on an exchange and leave them on the exchange account. In that case, you don’t control the wallet as the exchange takes care of keeping your crypto assets safe for you. Custodial wallets include <a href="https://www.coinbase.com">Coinbase.com</a>, <a href="https://www.binance.com/en">Binance</a>, <a href="https://www.kraken.com">Kraken</a>, etc.</p>
<p>There are some advantages and disadvantages with each solution. If an exchange gets hacked or somebody gets your login information through phishing, your assets aren’t safe on a custodial wallet.</p>
<p>If you lose your private key, you can’t access your noncustodial wallet. Blockchain.com and other noncustodial wallet providers have found ways to mitigate the risk of losing access to your wallet by backing up some information.</p>
<p>More recently, Blockchain.com has launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/30/blockchain-the-company-launches-an-exchange-the-pit/">its own exchange</a> so that wallet users can trade assets more easily. It now also offers services to <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/institutional">institutional investors</a> so that they can get started with cryptocurrencies. Services include order executions, custody, lending, OTC transactions, etc.</p>
<p>Blockchain.com has also shared some metrics. People have created 65 million wallets on the company’s website or using the mobile apps. Since 2012, 28% of bitcoin transactions have been sent or received by a Blockchain.com-managed wallet.</p>
