										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ribbit Capital, a venture firm best known for its fintech investments, has raised $1.15 billion in new capital in what appears to be a close of its seventh fund, according to a </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1851162/000185116222000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new fund, dubbed </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ribbit Capital VII LP, is believed to be the final close of the fund. The amount is significantly higher than the </span><a href="https://www.venturecapitaljournal.com/ribbit-capital-targets-750m-for-seventh-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$750 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the firm was said to be raising in March of 2021.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its 2012 inception, Ribbit Capital had previously raised about $1.3 billion in capital, according to </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ribbit-capital" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crunchbase</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to this fund, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ribbit’s managing partner </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/meyermalka/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meyer &#8220;Micky&#8221; Malka</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is listed as director of an entity called Bullfrog Capital LP. According to a 2020 filing associated with that Palo Alto-based venture capital firm, Bullfrog intended to raise $500 million from limited partners. A new filing indicates that the entity actually ended up raising $1.15 billion as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch reached out to Ribbit and Malka for comment but had not heard back at the time of writing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2021 was a busy year for Ribbit, which also made a number of investments in Latin America, even leading several deals in the region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, </span><a href="https://www.justos.com.br/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup that says it will be the first insurance company in Brazil to use data when determining rates, in October raised </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/24/brazilian-insurtech-justos-raises-35-8m-in-ribbit-capital-led-series-a/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $35.8 million Series A round of funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by Ribbit. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Putting solar panels on the roof is increasingly realistic for the average homeowner, but they tend to be specialized, aftermarket affairs or else whole-roof replacements. GAF Energy, a division of the roofing giant, claims <a href="https://www.gaf.energy/">its new solar shingles</a> are simple enough to install that no special equipment or knowledge is required, making home renewable energy that much accessible.</p>
<p>Solar shingles are not themselves new, but tend to be a bit more complicated of an installation than just riveting a panel to the roof with a few inches of space underneath. Instead, they replace the shingles themselves, acting as both roofing material and solar panel array.</p>
<p>Many of our readers will be familiar with Tesla&#8217;s foray into this space, the imaginatively named Solar Roof, which uses solar shingles but, like others, needs a special team and is basically a whole-roof replacement. If you only wanted to replace a damaged patch with 30 square feet of panels, Tesla isn&#8217;t an option, and other solar shingles might not be able to be installed by your local roofer.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252737" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>GAF Energy hopes to change that with its Timberline Solar, announced today at CES, which it says can be installed by any roofer with a nail gun. GAF Energy president Martin DeBono described the shingle as &#8220;the only product to integrate solar technology into existing roofing processes and materials to yield a full-fledged solar roof, enabling mainstream deployment of clean energy via traditional roofing channels.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252765" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/timberline-solar-2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252765" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2252765" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/timberline-solar-2.jpg" alt="Roofers install a solar shingle on a roof." width="1024" height="693" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/timberline-solar-2.jpg 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/timberline-solar-2.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/timberline-solar-2.jpg?resize=300,203 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/timberline-solar-2.jpg?resize=768,520 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/timberline-solar-2.jpg?resize=680,460 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/timberline-solar-2.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2252765" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> GAF Energy</p></div></p>
<p>You might wonder why, if you&#8217;re already going to the trouble of getting solar installed on your roof, you don&#8217;t just roll with it and get the specialist. It&#8217;s going to be expensive anyway, right? It&#8217;s true in a way, but the cost is coming down for every aspect of getting a solar roof, and every dollar shaved off makes it realistic for a few more customers (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/aurora-solar-aims-to-power-the-growing-solar-industry-with-a-250m-round-c/">as Aurora Solar&#8217;s COO Sam Adeyemo observed to me last year</a>). Not only that, but specialists tend to congregate in population centers, meaning folks in rural areas, where solar might actually be more practical, face higher costs and lower availability.</p>
<p>The company noted that its solar shingles install just like regular roof shingles, except for exposing the electrical contacts on the upward side so they can be easily accessed (don&#8217;t worry — the whole thing is as weatherproof as a regular roof too). You can even walk on them when it&#8217;s time to clean the gutters. The company is the first to receive UL&#8217;s new &#8220;building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) solar roofing certification,&#8221; UL 7103.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just another step from solar roofs being an expensive, complex option to a normal one available to anyone and maybe even one that will pay itself off in time.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Critical thinking and problem-solving are considered vital attributes for the cybersecurity professional — so it’s time our industry applied those capabilities to connect the dots between the skills shortage and lack of diversity.</p>
<p>There’s no question that recruiting talent in sufficient numbers right now is a growing challenge — but it’s one that I believe a more inclusive talent pipeline would help to alleviate.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.isc2.org/-/media/ISC2/Research/2021/ISC2-Cybersecurity-Workforce-Study-2021.ashx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cybersecurity Workforce Study 2021</a>, industry body (ISC)<sup>2</sup> found that 2.7 million information security jobs remain unfilled worldwide. While this number is down from 3.1 million in 2020, we’re a long way from where we need to be. In the face of increased digitization and a rising tide of attacks, the current cybersecurity workforce of 4.2 million people globally needs to grow 65% to keep up with the demand for its skills.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250680" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In other words, we’re going to need to draw from a wider talent pool to plug the gaps. But as researchers from Washington, D.C.-based think tank the Aspen Institute point out in their <a href="https://www.aspeninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Diversity-Equity-and-Inclusion-in-Cybersecurity_9.921.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Cybersecurity report</a>, diversity efforts to date “have not addressed the overwhelming white-ness and male-ness of the cybersecurity field.” Estimates suggest that only 4% of U.S. cybersecurity workers self-identify as Hispanic, 9% as Black and 24% as women, the report noted.</p>
<p>It’s clear that our industry faces serious future risks if it doesn’t find ways to recruit new talent to fill the growing number of vacancies. But more than that, its current lack of diversity poses <em>more</em> immediate risks because company systems aren’t homogeneous, and neither are potential assailants.</p>
<p>The authors of <a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecureservercdn.net%2F166.62.108.22%2F5kb.d9b.myftpupload.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2FICIT-Brief-The-Business-Value-of-a-Diverse-InfoSec-Team.pdf&amp;data=04%7C01%7CIndia.Heady%40revereteam.com%7C9dc790746cf84aace5c308d9b4f4d535%7Cb824bfb3918e43c2bb1cdcc1ba40a82b%7C0%7C0%7C637739788197382292%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&amp;sdata=JljMbk2dzxV%2FnqvJNljbpUsDmDH1MzVhfwv2GrEpi40%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Business Value of a Diverse Infosec Team</a> from the cybersecurity think tank Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology make this point forcefully: “Homogeneous experiences and perspectives yield less success compared to problem-solving done by teams with varied backgrounds.”</p>
<p>Proactive cybersecurity strategies, by contrast, aggregate a multitude of perspectives, which brings the benefit of innovation, problem-solving and consensus-building.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Shifting the narrative</h2>
<p>As the chief information security officer (CISO) at search-powered solutions company Elastic, I believe that individual information security leaders can do a great deal to shift the narrative, at least within their organizations. What this takes is a hefty dose of fresh thinking when it comes to recruitment.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity team I lead as an LGBTQIA+ female CISO includes people who represent the array of human nature when it comes to neurodiversity, sexual orientation, gender identity, race and age. The picture is just as varied when it comes to background, educational pathway and industry experience.</p>
<p>But let me be clear: Diversifying the cybersecurity talent pipeline is not just a numbers game for me. I’m not just focused on onboarding in sufficient numbers to run a fully staffed team. It’s also about improving the quality of that team and the work we perform.</p>
<p>Put simply, a more diverse cybersecurity team is a better cybersecurity team. In a multidisciplinary field like this, different perspectives are critical. When threats and tactics change around us daily, the diverse viewpoints on my team help counter complacency by bringing new thinking to situations. Our adversaries, after all, are continuously trying new tactics, finding new ways to bypass controls and identify vulnerabilities. My team’s different perspectives bring a more disruptive “hacker mindset” to our work in countering attacks.</p>
<p>Our industry’s overreliance on specialists with the “right” qualifications and educational backgrounds might actually be a weakness — a point of view reinforced for me by David Epstein’s 2019 book, “Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World.” Epstein argues that generalists with wide-ranging interests are more creative, more agile and able to make connections that their more specialized peers can’t see, especially in complex and unpredictable fields — a description that is a good fit for cybersecurity.</p>
<p>The value of diverse thinking within my current team is evident in the ongoing data protection certification process that we perform for customers. For this key compliance process, diversity is our strength, because our team can quickly get beyond “the way things have always been done” and find better, more efficient and — critically — safer ways to meet changing compliance objectives.</p>
<p>Another example where I’ve seen a clear-cut advantage of diverse thinking is from my team’s approach to supporting our fully distributed workforce. Being a distributed company by design, with almost 80% of our employees working remotely, demands that my team think differently when it comes to data privacy and protection. Our constant innovation in supporting secure remote working meant we were already prepared in this area when the pandemic hit, while cybersecurity teams at other companies were still struggling to make the leap.</p>
<h2>Taking action</h2>
<p>What matters most, of course, is transforming words into action. For me, it helps that I work for an organization that prioritizes inclusivity and acceptance for all employees in its <a href="https://www.elastic.co/about/our-source-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source Code</a>.</p>
<p>This gives managers and employees alike a clear set of cues as to who we are as an organization and who we aspire to be, telling employees: “<a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/culture-someone-like-me-mandy-andress-on-security-at-elastic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Just come as you are</a>.” By creating an environment that is inclusive for all employees, through a commitment to equal pay, emphasis on internal hiring and prioritizing skills over location, we can hire and retain the best talent wherever they reside.</p>
<p>This year, our company&#8217;s aspirational DEI goals include a 40% hiring rate target for women or non-binary individuals, with a 30% hiring rate target for technical roles &#8212; globally. And for underrepresented groups, our hiring rate target in the U.S. is 35%, with 27% for technical roles.</p>
<p>With that backing, I’ve personally taken positive steps to ensure that Elastic increases diversity in its cybersecurity talent pipeline. So here are my pointers for other information security leaders:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Broaden the scope of qualifications.</strong> Look beyond traditional schooling and minimum career experience to see skills, qualifications, experiences and capabilities gained from shorter programs, online certificates, other jobs and participation in cybersecurity communities that support core foundational understanding of systems and their vulnerabilities.<br />
Some of the most successful teams that I’ve built over the years have not only come from a variety of IT backgrounds, such as systems architecture, business analysis and project management but from outside of the IT discipline entirely. For example, I hired a former emergency medical technician who moved into healthcare fraud analysis before joining my team. Former lawyers have brought attention to detail. People with a marketing background have proved adept at tackling customer data privacy challenges with empathy, while those from the financial sector bring new thinking to compliance issues.<br />
But what they all have in common, and what has made them strong additions to my infosec teams, is their curiosity, a willingness to question, and excitement to learn and try new things. These transferable experiences are just as important, if not <em>more</em> important, than specific skills.</li>
<li><strong>Encourage underrepresented groups.</strong> Add language that explicitly states your interest in groups often left out of hiring pools, such as women, people of color and members of the LGBTQIA+ community. Job descriptions should make explicit that the company fosters a welcoming environment for everyone and encourages personal and professional development of its cybersecurity talent.<br />
For example, I have recruited for an intern program recently immigrated individuals who do not have the standard security qualifications. Most of these recruits quickly moved into full-time roles and outperformed cybersecurity veterans. I have also taken steps to work more closely with local community colleges on sourcing graduates and with recruitment specialists who focus on supplying more diverse candidates for cybersecurity roles, such as <a href="https://cybersn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CyberSN</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Make your hiring process accessible.</strong> Many would-be applicants are discouraged if the hiring process isn’t adapted for those with <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/culture-why-accessibility-matters-to-someone-like-me" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accessibility needs</a>. We’ve worked to ensure that everything from our recruiting site to our internal digital properties and tools follows international guidelines and translates to a positive environment for all candidates and employees.<br />
Anonymized hiring is an important part of this process. I regularly review resumes with the identifying information stripped to ensure that unconscious bias plays no part when we’re making judgments on job candidates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cybersecurity teams need people with diverse life experiences, education and skills, so our recruitment efforts need to reach a far wider audience. If they don’t, we risk overlooking talent and excluding viewpoints that could be instrumental in delivering on our mission as an industry. If we allow that to happen and continue instead to compete for the increasingly sparse talent that fits nicely with age-old biases, we’ll only have ourselves to blame.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to Daily Crunch for January 3, 2022! It’s a new year, but that doesn’t mean we’re going to reinvent the wheel. This newsletter is going to stick to its tried-and-true format, so expect few surprises and <em>lots</em> of news.</p>
<p>Before we start, a big thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/grg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greg</a> for taking over while I was off. Now, to work! —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252673" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/please-effect-a-golf-clap-as-apples-value-reaches-3-trillion/"><strong>Apple’s value touches the $3T mark:</strong></a><strong> </strong>It’s easy to forget just how big the biggest tech companies are. The numbers simply scale past our ability to understand them. U.S. tech behemoth Apple made that point in spades today by briefly becoming worth <em>three trillion USD</em>. It’s a little hard to sum up just how much money that is, but it’s enough money that if you distributed the sum to all current Americans it would <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3+trillion+divided+by+the+population+of+the+united+states" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work out to around $9,000</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/brazils-abstra-lands-accenture-as-a-customer-and-2-3m-to-help-teams-make-apps-with-its-no-code-tool/"><strong>Abstra raises $2.3M for no-code apps:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The boom in no- and low-code services in recent years is partly thanks to demand for traditional developers outstripping supply, and technology itself advancing to allow the method of development to, well, work. Brazil’s Abstra’s latest round further indicates that the no- and low-code phenomenon is a global affair.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/twitter-completes-sale-of-mopub-to-applovin-for-1-05-billion/"><strong>Twitter completes MoPub sale:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The October-announced sale of Twitter’s MoPub service to AppLovin, a deal worth $1.05 billion, is now complete. MoPub is a mobile advertising platform, but Twitter is not done with ads. The company intends to keep building its in-house ad tech now that the deal is done, TechCrunch reports.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>The new year is already paying drama dividends, with the latest coming from an investor and the former CEO of Twitter. You see, Chris Dixon doesn’t agree with Jack Dorsey’s criticisms of non-Bitcoin crypto companies. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/your-mom-owns-web-2-0/">You can imagine the fun that we are having with this</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/smarter-health-gets-5-15m-sgd-to-reduce-healthcare-costs-in-southeast-asia/">Smarter Health raises $3.8M for better healthcare data sharing:</a> </strong>If you have ever had to port your own data for your healthcare providers, you are aware of how much fun it is. None. That’s how much. Happily Smarter Health is working on the issue in Singapore, working to allow for a “smoother exchange of data between different parties in the healthcare system, improving patient care and reducing administrative costs.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/the-station-tusimple-loses-the-driver-nikola-settles-and-transpo-predictions-for-2022/"><strong>What’s ahead for wheels?</strong></a><strong> </strong>The TechCrunch transit desk has a great look back at 2021 and a forecast for 2022. If you care about e-scooters, autonomous driving or anything related, we have you covered.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/02/aimmo-grabs-12m-series-a-to-advance-data-labeling-technology/"><strong>AIMMO raises $12M Series A for data labeling:</strong></a> AI is neat but needs lots of data to function. And to get that data, sometimes you have to do lots of tagging. Startups are taking this problem on, including Scale AI. AIMMO, a South Korean startup, has a neat take on the work varietal and, now, a full bank account.</li>
</ul>
<p>And because you deserve a treat for making it through the first working day of the year: The “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/31/cheugiest-tech-moments-of-2021/">Cheugiest tech moments of 2021</a>” from three of TechCrunch’s best.</p>
<p>If you need even more diversion, TechCrunch also has stories today <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/reflect-orb-biofeedback-ball/">on zen balls</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/the-fish-is-driving-again/">driving fish</a>.</p>
<h2>When fundraising, New Zealand startup founders should play the &#8220;Kiwi card&#8221;</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2251260" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/31/when-fundraising-new-zealand-startup-founders-should-play-the-kiwi-card/"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2251260" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2251260 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-86070581.jpg" alt="Kiwi crossing sign and Ngauruhoe Volcano, Tongariro National Park, North Island, New Zealand" width="1024" height="682" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-86070581.jpg 1400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-86070581.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-86070581.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-86070581.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-86070581.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GettyImages-86070581.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2251260" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=creative&amp;photographer=Jami+Tarris" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jami Tarris <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a> / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>In the final article in a series about New Zealand, Rebecca Bellan <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/31/when-fundraising-new-zealand-startup-founders-should-play-the-kiwi-card/">spoke to four stakeholders</a> to learn more about how foreign investment and a fund of funds program are juicing up the nation&#8217;s burgeoning startup ecosystem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Peter Beck, CEO/CTO Rocket Lab</li>
<li>Cecilia Robinson, founder and co-CEO, Tend Health</li>
<li>Phoebe Harrop, principal, Blackbird Ventures</li>
<li>Robbie Paul, CEO, Icehouse Ventures</li>
</ul>
<p>“While starting on a rock at the bottom of the world comes with challenges, there are plenty of advantages, too,&#8221; said Paul, who advises native founders to &#8220;play the Kiwi card.&#8221;</p>
<p>Almost one of every five New Zealanders lives abroad, and that diaspora has helped the nation build a great deal of international goodwill. &#8220;It’s an easy conversation starter and chances are most interesting people offshore have some sort of affinity or connection to New Zealand,&#8221; Paul said.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/why-delivery-hero-is-acquiring-a-majority-stake-in-spanish-delivery-company-glovo/"><strong>Why is Delivery Hero buying more of Glovo?</strong></a><strong> </strong>The latter company previously said that it wanted to stay indie and go public. And yet it was recently announced that Delivery Hero would acquire a majority stake in the business. TechCrunch digs into what might have happened.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/seriously-its-time-to-get-rid-of-that-classic-blackberry-for-real-now/"><strong>BlackBerry’s network is done:</strong></a> You really, <em>really</em> have to get rid of your BlackBerry. Why? Because the company “will end access to legacy services” tomorrow, which means no “key features like data, phone calls, SMS and 911 access.” It is time. At long last. All seven of you who still use a BlackBerry.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s always a sticky business predicting what&#8217;s going to happen in tech, because who knows what&#8217;s going on behind the scenes or what&#8217;s coming next.</p>
<p>Would you have thought, for instance, that Salesforce would spend almost $28 billion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">to buy Slack</a> at the end of 2020? Or that in 2021, Jeff Bezos <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/jeff-bezos-will-no-longer-be-ceo-of-amazon-as-of-later-this-year/">would step back at Amazon</a> with a domino effect of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/what-andy-jassys-promotion-to-amazon-ceo-could-mean-for-aws/">Andy Jassy moving into his role</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/tableau-ceo-adam-selipsky-is-returning-to-aws-to-replace-andy-jassy-as-ceo/">Adam Selipsky coming back</a> after a stint at Tableau to take Jassy&#8217;s old job running AWS?</p>
<p>I sure didn&#8217;t see that coming, and I&#8217;m betting most people didn&#8217;t. The tech world moves so quickly, it&#8217;s often hard to keep up.</p>
<p>We weren&#8217;t using <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/the-irrational-exuberance-of-web3/">the terms metaverse and web3</a> (complete with lowercase spelling), and then quite suddenly in 2021, we were. If you told me that the blockchain was going to come back in a big way in 2021, or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/#:~:text=Facebook%20creator%20Mark%20Zuckerberg%20announced,our%20company%20is%20now%20Meta.">Facebook would change its name</a> to Meta, I would have laughed in your face. Yet, here we are.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s admit that there are things that we can&#8217;t possibly predict, but it seems it&#8217;s a part of my job to rear back and throw out some predictions. I would like to think that mine are based on my careful observation of the world I cover in the enterprise, rather than some random musings, but if I&#8217;m being honest, it&#8217;s probably a combination.</p>
<p>So with that in mind, and the usual caveats, here are my predictions for the coming year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speaking of web3, companies (and especially governments) will learn just how difficult it is to retrofit brittle legacy systems to accept digital currency. There will need to be some sort of reckoning to either modernize or let it go for the time being, most likely the latter. Updating systems is challenging and expensive, and it&#8217;s hard to see governments spending the money to do it to accommodate digital currency, which is still in its infancy. Pew recently reported that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/11/11/16-of-americans-say-they-have-ever-invested-in-traded-or-used-cryptocurrency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just 16% of Americans</a> have traded, invested or used crypto currencies.</li>
<li>While we&#8217;re at it, even though the hype is out of control, I&#8217;m betting that most companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/10/face-computers-slowly-find-their-place-in-business/">will continue to adopt AR/VR slowly</a> in the enterprise in 2022. Just as in the past before the term &#8220;metaverse&#8221; started trending, there will be some experimental dabbling in areas where it makes sense, but most people will realize they don&#8217;t want to do their work with VR hardware on their face all day. And, it&#8217;s also expensive to create content.</li>
<li>With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/bret-taylor-has-been-promoted-to-salesforce-co-ceo/">Bret Taylor getting promoted to co-CEO of Salesforce</a> this year, the next logical step is for him to take over as solo CEO, and let Marc Benioff follow Bezos into the chairman&#8217;s role, where he can concentrate more on his charity work. Benioff has been the face of the company for over 20 years, and he may want to finally step back from that grinding responsibility and enjoy his wealth.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s easy to forget now in the age of Apple and Android, but at one time, BlackBerry owned the business smartphone market. You could have your Motorolas and your Nokias and your Samsungs, but for business, BlackBerry was it. Stalwart. Secure. Functional.</p>
<p>As TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/seriously-its-time-to-get-rid-of-that-classic-blackberry-for-real-now/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">reported this morning</a>, BlackBerry is shutting down its remaining services, and users running BlackBerry devices with BlackBerry OS 7.1 and BlackBerry 10 &#8212; and you have to wonder just how many there were left &#8212; will no longer have access to data or even the once famous BlackBerry messaging service, among other things. It&#8217;s all getting shut off tomorrow.</p>
<p>As that fateful shutdown day approaches, it may be hard to understand just how ubiquitous the BlackBerry was before iPhone and Android came along, and just how precipitous its market share drop was. People loved their BlackBerrys with the combination of external keyboard and messaging service as a way to communicate with colleagues outside of the office. For better or worse, the BlackBerry ushered in the mobile era for many business people.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252581" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Comscore tracked mobile market share data back when BlackBerry reached the height of its power in 2010 as the top smartphone platform with 43%. It would be the high water mark for the company. (Note that these numbers measure the platform ubiquity and not units sold.)</p>
<table style="width: 100%;" border="" cellpadding="5">

<td>5.9%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>As you can see, BlackBerry phones went from top of the smartphone heap to single digits in the blink of an eye, losing large swaths of market share as it got completely disrupted by Apple and Android touchscreens. BlackBerry eventually reacted to these changes, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rimm-announces-new-blackberry-bold-and-torch-phones-2011-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">releasing the BlackBerry Torch in 2011</a>, but it was far too little and far too late. Plus in a classic case of disruption theory, the people who loved the external keyboard never really took to the BlackBerry touch screen.</p>
<p>One other move among many included teaming with Microsoft in 2011 to make Bing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-05-03-microsoft-rim-announce-collaboration-bing-to-power-blackberry.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the default search engine on BlackBerry</a> phone, which in retrospect feels like a bit of a desperation move, but at the time was viewed more positively that the company was trying things. Whatever they tried, though, it didn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>As the company&#8217;s fortunes plunged, they <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/the-man-who-answered-the-call-to-save-blackberry/2016/05/20/8799b86c-1b93-11e6-8c7b-6931e66333e7_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired John Chen as CEO</a> in 2013, who began the process of shifting the company from phones to security software.</p>
<p>Why security? Well, because BlackBerry always had a reputation as being rock-solid when it came to security, so it seemed like a reasonable pivot. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/28/blackberry-bows-out-of-making-its-own-hardware/">announced the change officially in 2016</a>. Today, the company focuses entirely on selling security software to enterprises and governments. It has a modest market cap of around $5 billion, but it&#8217;s still around.</p>

<blockquote><p>There are, of course, plenty of options out there — though OnwardMobility, which promised a 5G BlackBerry-branded device is currently still MIA, in spite of promising an announcement in 2021. There’s always the OSOM device, which sports its own Canadian pedigree. Though, again, that privacy-focused product won’t be announced until Mobile World Congress at the end of next month.</p></blockquote>
<p>But the beloved BlackBerry, once the constant companion of business people and politicians is going to be left to history, another device disrupted by the next big thing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Truly there is nothing new under the sun if, when one learns that a goldfish can drive, the immediate response is &#8220;again?&#8221; But while today&#8217;s icthyological innovation may bear superficial, scale-deep if you will, similarity to fish-driven vehicles of yesteryear, there is an important new aspect: in this case, the goldfish has actually <em>learned</em> to drive.</p>
<p>First, for those of you that weren&#8217;t paying attention in 2014, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbNmL6hSNKw&amp;t=23s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there was indeed a goldfish that drove around a little tank</a>, to the delight of the still-innocent world. Using a webcam mounted above the tank, an object detection algorithm tracked the position of the fish and moved the cart on which it was mounted in the direction the goldfish swam in. (I can&#8217;t believe I remembered this — I can&#8217;t remember my own address.)</p>
<p>Fun, right? But ultimately more of a piscine parlor trick than a serious scientific endeavor. After all, the fish was just swimming around its tank, oblivious to the world and mechanism that moved it about the room.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252631" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Now, however, researchers from Ben-Gurion University in Israel have taken it one step further. Using a remarkably similar mechanism, they also detect the position of a goldfish in a tank, and direct the &#8220;Fish Operated Vehicle (FOV)&#8221; in the direction of the sector it swims to.</p>
<p>But here is where the stories diverge. The researchers then set the goldfish to various tasks that required <em>actively navigating</em> its vehicle around the larger, non-aquatic world. For instance, the fish would start in the center of a room and be given a reward if it went to a red stripe on the side.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I am excited to share a new study led by Shachar Givon &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/MatanSamina?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MatanSamina</a> w/ Ohad Ben Shahar: Goldfish can learn to navigate a small robotic vehicle on land. We trained goldfish to drive a wheeled platform that reacts to the fish’s movement (<a href="https://t.co/ZR59Hu9sib">https://t.co/ZR59Hu9sib</a>). <a href="https://t.co/J5BkuGlZ34">pic.twitter.com/J5BkuGlZ34</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Ronen Segev (@ronen_segev) <a href="https://twitter.com/ronen_segev/status/1477889582398164994?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Despite the common wisdom that goldfish are particularly lacking in the brains department, they&#8217;re actually capable of learning and remembering fairly complex behaviors and situations. But there&#8217;s no reason to assume that the creature would be able to understand the more abstract concept of space represented by its tank moving through a larger world by some external means.</p>
<p>Yet as the researchers put it in the abstract to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432821005994" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their paper in Behavioural Brain Research</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[The fish] were able to operate the vehicle, explore the new environment, and reach the target regardless of the starting point, all while avoiding dead-ends and correcting location inaccuracies. These results demonstrate how a fish was able to transfer its space representation and navigation skills to a wholly different terrestrial environment.</p></blockquote>
<p>This suggests that the way even creatures on the order of goldfish get around is not some kind of hard-coded aquatic movement circuit but something more universal, perhaps one that evolved earlier and at a more basic level than we think. Just how abstract or universal is yet to be determined, but it&#8217;s an interesting result to be sure.</p>
<p>More importantly, however, it means there&#8217;s a pretty good chance that you&#8217;ll be able to get a mobile terrarium for your fish, iguana, skink, perhaps even your tarantula, allowing it the freedom of the house without actually letting it slither or scuttle everywhere. (Incidentally, if this idea appeals to you, you might enjoy the story <a href="http://www.sfsfss.com/stories/Blish,%20James%20-%20%5BNovelette%5D%20Surface%20Tension%20%5Bv1.0%5D.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Surface Tension,&#8221; by James Blish</a>.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s all good and well to be able to sit cross-legged on a mountain top and feel at one with the universe &#8212; but how do you know if you are doing it right or not? For beginner meditators who aren&#8217;t sure how they are &#8220;meant&#8221; to feel in their bodies there&#8217;s <a href="https://www.meetreflect.com/orb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reflect&#8217;s Orb product</a>, which was launched during this year&#8217;s virtual CES shenanigans. Entrapped in their home base of Israel, I spoke to the company from the bustling and &#8212; fittingly &#8212; far more laid back metropolis of Tel Aviv, rather than the one-armed-bandit-laden post-apocalyptic hellscape that is Las Vegas.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not targeting Zen Buddhist monks, or those who can sit cross-legged on top of the mountain and meditate for hours; they have their shit together,&#8221; jokes Shiri Perciger, CMO at Reflect. &#8220;They don&#8217;t need us &#8212; but we have had users try it who have never meditated before. We&#8217;ve also had expert yoga teachers and mindfulness coaches. Almost anyone who tried it finds value in our product.&#8221;</p>
<p>The value of Reflect&#8217;s Orb, the company says, is in the real-time biofeedback that&#8217;s shown on the device itself. As the company explains it, bio-feedback is the self-monitoring of your physiology in real time, using the company&#8217;s device. It enables you to gain insights into your internal processes and learn to regulate them. For example, if you use an Apple Watch, you may have noticed that the watch reminds you to breathe precisely at the moment you need it most. The &#8220;breathe&#8221; feature on the Apple Watch exemplifies the basic principles of biofeedback and highlights the importance of breath to improve wellness. The watch measures something (although, to my knowledge, Apple has never explicitly stated what triggers a &#8220;breathe&#8221; alert on your watch), and periodically reminds you to breathe for a bit. The goal is to bring you back to a place of peace. Orb takes biofeedback and makes the process more explicit.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252494" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Biofeedback can be used for many things, including measuring and reporting stress and anxiety. We measure what&#8217;s going on in your body, and we show it to you in real time. The goal is to make you aware of things that usually you&#8217;re unaware of &#8212; things that happen unconsciously in your body all the time,&#8221; explains Noga Sapir, CEO at Reflect. &#8220;We are measuring things like heart rate and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate_variability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heart rate variability (HRV)</a>, which is a very good predictor of stress. We also measure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodermal_activity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">electrodermal activity (EDA)</a>. Both change in response to stress, and the idea behind biofeedback is that we show you a dynamic, constant feed of what&#8217;s going on. From there, you can begin to influence it. First by being aware of it, and then by seeing what works in this feedback loop. We give you the tools to first be aware of what your body is going through, and then to influence it in a way that will calm you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The device itself is a soft, cloth-covered ball that you hold in two hands. It has six electrodes where your fingers rest, and a light ring that reports back in real time how calm you are. The idea is that by adjusting your seating position, feeling your body and adjusting your breathing patterns, you can see how your body reacts to the various calming techniques. The light ring indicates how relaxed you are.</p>

<p>The device itself is independent of your phone, and doesn&#8217;t need to be connected to anything. When you are connected to a network, the orb uploads your data to the cloud and makes it available to you via a mobile app, but you can also use it offline. Take it to a literal or proverbial mountain top and breathe. When the device reconnects it phones home so you can get detailed information about how your relaxation session went.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Reflect is entering a competitive and somewhat crowded market. The <a href="https://choosemuse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Muse headband</a> measures brain activity and gives feedback on sleep and meditation practices. <a href="https://zendomeditation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zendo Meditation</a> also connects to your head to measure how deeply you find peace. Another product in this space is the <a href="https://www.hellocore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Core meditation trainer</a>, which has a similar form factor &#8212; a ball with electrodes &#8212; that measures HRV and other biofeedback for meditation purposes. The company maintains that it has a unique enough selling point to carve out a healthy user base, and to take on its competitors head-on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Muse does something similar with neurofeedback, and Core rely on their meditation library, but don&#8217;t do live biofeedback. Both of these solutions need to be connected to an app,&#8221; explains Sapir, &#8220;We want the Reflect Orb to be an experience you can take anywhere with you wherever you go. We think the real-time biofeedback approach is better, in that it really allows you to build your awareness of the body and brings your focus. For me personally, it is very important that there <em>is</em> a mobile app, and that it gives you all the data you need, but when you use Reflect, you just use Reflect. There are meditation apps, and there is a lot of technology built into our phones, but it&#8217;s kind of paradoxical because phones are stressful for a lot of us. I just wanted to put the phone away and just focus on this tactile and visual experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Orb is priced at $229, but the company has the product available for preorder <a href="https://www.meetreflect.com/product/reflect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">priced at a discounted $199</a> for now. The team told me it is planning to start shipping in February this year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We lose sight of the fact that the tech giants are just that: huge. Their scale is a bit hard to parse, frankly, as their wealth is effectively uncountable.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple&#8217;s rapid valuation ascent of the last few years came to a head today as the Cupertino-based hardware-and-software company reached the $3 trillion market cap threshold, according to <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/">Google Finance</a> data.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some quibbling among different data providers, but the <a href="https://twitter.com/bdsams/status/1478076141030285313">consensus</a> is that Apple managed to reach a $3 trillion valuation during intraday trading, despite some pegging the company at a mere $2.99 trillion.</p>
<p>Notably, the gap between $3.00 trillion and $2.99 trillion is <em>$10 billion</em>, so it&#8217;s not like the difference is chump change. Regardless, Apple has set a new high-water mark for corporate value in our time. Mazel.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252610" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>So what?</h2>
<p>The fact that a single technology company &#8212; any single company, really &#8212; is worth $3 trillion may not astound you if you have become accustomed to financial headlines that deal with large numbers. But it is, in fact, a big deal.</p>
<p>Some context will help. Back <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/morning-report-hunt-3-trillion/">in May 2017</a>, I noted that &#8220;tech’s Big 5&#8221; were approaching &#8220;the $3 trillion market cap watermark&#8221; with a combined value of $2.97 trillion. They finally <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/techs-5-biggest-players-now-worth-3-trillion/">reached that dollar figure</a> later that year in July. The next year, we noted that the same basket of companies was <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/the-big-5-worth-4-trillion-heading-into-earnings/">now worth $4 trillion</a>, a material jump from their prior values.</p>
<p>You know what has happened since: The pandemic revalued tech companies, giving them far more value per dollar of revenue than before. The impact of COVID on tech companies was perhaps most pronounced among pure software companies, but the largest U.S. tech companies did just fine, as we can see today in Apple&#8217;s accomplishment of being worth $3 trillion <em>on its own</em>, the same value as Apple, Amazon, Meta (née Facebook), Microsoft and Alphabet <em>combined</em> a half-decade ago.</p>
<p>The $3 trillion figure is notable for another reason. It&#8217;s also what the then-current crop of unicorns was worth back in mid-2021, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/unicorn-startup-investors-2021-tiger-global/">per Crunchbase news math</a>. CB Insights <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies">says that they are worth $3.1 trillion now</a>. More simply, Apple is worth as much as every unicorn <em>combined</em>. That&#8217;s a lot!</p>
<p>We lose sight of the fact that the tech giants are just that: huge. Their scale is a bit hard to parse, frankly, as their wealth is effectively uncountable.</p>
<p>A lot of science-fiction discusses futures in which corporations are ascendant and able to act as nation-states either implicitly or explicitly. It always felt like a stretch in my imagination. But now with Apple hitting the $3 trillion mark on its own, perhaps the authors were really oracles after all.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Natasha Mascarenhas, Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim explain their perspectives on the startup models we can expect to see in 2022.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In retrospect, the rise of software as a service (SaaS) is obvious. But for years, the idea that software would not only be hosted by providers instead of purchased by customers, and rented, instead of owned outright, was far from anyone&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>SaaS has cemented its place in the epicenter of startup and Big Tech life, but it’s already being disrupted by the usage-based pricing movement. More startups are offering their services via a developer hook or API, and charging for customer usage over, say, a set number of seats for a predetermined period of time.</p>
<p>Not everyone is sold on the on-demand move, but the competition for the software business model of the future underscores the point that tech models never rule the roost forever. So, what’s the next thesis that we will look back on? It may be more complicated than &#8220;a crypto strategy,&#8221; but we have thoughts on what will become the de facto startup model and strategy.</p>
<p>To explore the concept, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natasha Mascarenhas</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Wilhelm</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anna Heim</a> took the time to write up their expectations for 2022’s startup theses. Naturally, our notes cover a bit more than just business models, but as the beating heart of every startup is its model, the money element comes into play in all of our perspectives.</p>
<h2>Alex: 2022 is when open source will become the de facto startup model</h2>
<p>I’ve spoken with lots of founders over the years, and while I do have a more business focus than an early-stage bent, I do get to chat with founders building the early blocks of their businesses on a regular basis.</p>
<p>What hit me this year, especially toward the latter half, was just how frequently I ran into bright folks building businesses that had an open source component.</p>
<p>We all know that open source isn’t new as a business concept. Red Hat was founded in the tech equivalent of the neolithic era and has done well throughout its life. But startups building companies atop open source code are taking up a greater portion of their industry than before, and I think I know why. Or at least I have a hunch.</p>
<p>It’s about control, basically.</p>
<p>Software was once something that you bought. Actually, if you go back far enough, you can find examples of early PC manufacturers offering full software suites with their hardware, but that model died off as the world realized that open platforms were the way forward. From there, software bumbled along as a thing that consumers and corporations could buy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Buy&#8221; is the key word here. Folks bought closed source code from companies, and then ran it on their own systems, either personal or mainframe. Then, the cloud came along, and hosted software took off. Here again, however, the code was still largely closed source. You didn’t get a copy of Slack’s code per se, but you could rent access to its service for your team.</p>
<p>As software transformed from a series of discrete sales to a stream of recurring payments, SaaS took off, and investors cheered it on. This brings us almost to the modern moment, but not quite. On-demand pricing began to supplant SaaS as the de facto sales model of the software world — as Anna notes below — with Twilio as its champion, just as Salesforce was once for the SaaS market.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[I promise that this is not all a tech elite rubber-noodle fight. The drama, instead, highlights an interesting issue that venture capital has with the web3 world.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;ve been gifted another episode of &#8220;Tech versus Tech: Crypto Edition&#8221; today.</p>
<p>The argument among the tech elite about just who owns what in the Web 2.0 and web3 worlds continued this weekend. And once again the dustup featured former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and a16z, the investing firm best known in recent years for its capital deployments into the blockchain domain.</p>
<p>Dorsey, after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-reportedly-stepping-down-from-twitter-ceo-role/">pulling the rip cord from his perch atop Twitter</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/square-is-changing-its-name-to-block/">rebranding his fintech firm Square</a> to the more crypto-friendly &#8220;Block,&#8221; has decided to talk more publicly about his views.</p>
<p>And views he has. The well-known tech exec is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/05/jack-dorsey-dials-in-on-his-dream-job-bitcoin-missionary/">a known Bitcoin fan</a>, which you might think would slot in nicely with a16z&#8217;s general crypto bullishness.</p>
<p>It does not.</p>
<h2>Jack, web3 and who owns what</h2>
<p>We dug into the early Dorsey-versus-a16z arguments <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/bitcoin-is-religion-web3-is-greed/">here</a> but will provide a summary for those of you who would prefer something brief.</p>
<p>Dorsey&#8217;s ideas surrounding Bitcoin are centered around his belief in decentralization as a good. Bitcoin is a reasonably decentralized system. Its founder is out of the picture, it is owned by no single entity and its community has managed to keep working on the project despite it lacking a traditional leader or external investment.</p>
<p>How does that contrast with web3, the blockchain projects that also trumpet the power and importance of decentralization? Dorsey thinks that web3 is, in fact, centralized due to ownership &#8212; control &#8212; accruing in the hands of external investors, a16z among them. This is because, unlike with Bitcoin, web3 companies are busy hoovering up venture capital at a rate that is frankly staggering, meaning that many decentralized projects are racking up large external investors in their central holding companies &#8212; centralization squared, I suppose.</p>
<p>Dorsey&#8217;s complaints about ownership, web3 and the role of external capital in funding so much of the crypto market came to a head in a series of tweets posted between December 20 and 22, with the well-known Twitter user taking potshots at venture capital in crypto more generally, and a16z in particular.</p>
<p>One example for flavor:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">You don’t own “web3.”</p>
<p>The VCs and their LPs do. It will never escape their incentives. It’s ultimately a centralized entity with a different label. </p>
<p>Know what you’re getting into…</p>
<p>&mdash; jack<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/26a1.png" alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@jack) <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473139010197508098?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 21, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Them&#8217;s fighting words.</p>
<p>So what happened most recently? Well, a16z denizen and prolific Twitter blocker Chris Dixon took a shot <em>back</em> at Dorsey&#8217;s argument yesterday with the following:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ahead of the official start of CES, Samsung today revealed its vision for its next generation of smart TVs that will include everything from cloud-based gaming services to video chat while watching TV to even NFTs. The company says its 2022 Smart TVs will ship with a new &#8220;Smart Hub&#8221; that will offer consumers the ability to switch between different types of entertainment, including media, gaming via its new Gaming Hub and &#8220;ambient&#8221; &#8212; the latter referring to the TV&#8217;s <a href="https://www.samsung.com/sg/support/tv-audio-video/what-is-ambient-mode-and-how-to-use-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ability</a> to display art, photos or other information on the TV when it&#8217;s not in use.</p>
<p>For gamers, the most notable addition to the new TVs will be its game streaming discovery platform, the Samsung Gaming Hub, powered by Tizen. This service will allow game streaming providers to bring their game libraries directly to the TV. Samsung today announced partnerships with Nvidia GeForce NOW, Google&#8217;s Stadia and Utomik, and says more partnerships will come further down the road.</p>
<p>From the hub, Samsung TV owners will be able to browse available titles, search and purchase games, and instantly play their favorites. Their game controllers will also be able to be paired with the new Gaming Hub, the company notes. Plus, users can easily access YouTube where they can follow favorite streamers to watch gaming content.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252504" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Select 2022 4K and 8K TVs and gaming monitors will <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-delivers-premium-hdr-gameplay-with-hdr10plus-gaming-standard-support-for-its-new-screens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also support</a> the new HDR10+ GAMING standard, offering an HDR gaming experience with low latency, variable refresh rate and over 120 Hz. This experience features automated HDR calibration that does away with the need for manual calibration of settings across input sources, like consoles, PCs and more, the company notes. Supported TVs include the Neo QLED lineup with the Q70 TV series and above, as well as Samsung gaming monitors.</p>
<p>Samsung&#8217;s new Gaming Hub will launch later in 2022 and will be available through the main navigation menu across the Gaming, Media and Lifestyle categories.</p>

<p>The addition of cloud gaming to smart TVs isn&#8217;t unique to Samsung. LG last year said it was <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/11/lg-to-bring-nvidia-geforce-now-cloud-gaming-to-webos-smart-tvs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bringing</a> GeForce NOW to its WebOS smart TVs, as well as <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/12/google-stadia-cloud-gaming-now-on-latest-lg-smart-tvs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Stadia</a>. Amazon&#8217;s Luna <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GPQ58KYZLQTAXEX7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">runs on its Fire TVs</a> and Google Stadia works on a range of <a href="https://support.google.com/stadia/answer/9578631#compatible_tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supported smart TVs</a>, including those from LG, Hisense, TCL, Philips and others. And of course, you can also access these services through streaming devices as an alternative.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Beyond gaming, the new line of Samsung&#8217;s 2022 Smart TVs will embrace other trends that grew in popularity over the past year or so, including co-watching TV and movies with friends and buying and selling NFTs.</p>
<p>During the early days of the pandemic, family and friends looked for different ways to connect and spend time together while under COVID-19 lockdowns and other restrictions. This led to a rise in co-watching services and features that let users stream entertainment at the same time as their loved ones. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/hulu-officially-launches-its-co-viewing-feature-watch-party/">Hulu</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/amazon-prime-video-introduces-watch-party-a-social-coviewing-experience-included-with-prime/">Amazon Prime Video</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/disney-plus-groupwatch/">Disney+</a>, among others, launched co-viewing features that let people stream a movie or show at the same time while in different locations. More recently, Apple launched SharePlay over FaceTime, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/disney-rolls-out-support-for-apples-shareplay-co-viewing-experience-over-facetime/">which also supports Disney+</a> and other streaming apps, like NBA, Paramount+, Showtime, Apple TV+ and TikTok, for example.</p>
<p>Samsung&#8217;s take on this trend is to instead offer its own, new &#8220;Watch Together&#8221; app that lets family and friends video chat while watching a TV show or movie on their TV.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252530" style="width: 3850px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252530" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2252530 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-SMARTHub_US_Apple_Finch2.png" alt="" width="3840" height="2160" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-SMARTHub_US_Apple_Finch2.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-SMARTHub_US_Apple_Finch2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-SMARTHub_US_Apple_Finch2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-SMARTHub_US_Apple_Finch2.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-SMARTHub_US_Apple_Finch2.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-SMARTHub_US_Apple_Finch2.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-SMARTHub_US_Apple_Finch2.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022-SMARTHub_US_Apple_Finch2.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2252530" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p>
<p>Another more odd addition to the Smart Hub is support for NFTs. The platform will offer an app that allows users to discover, purchase and trade their NFTs on Samsung&#8217;s MICRO LED, Neo QLED and The Frame TV models later this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;With demand for NFTs on the rise, the need for a solution to today&#8217;s fragmented viewing and purchasing landscape has never been greater,&#8221; the company<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22858698/samsung-2022-tvs-nft-support-announced-cryptocurrency" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> told The Verge,</a> when detailing what it calls the &#8220;world&#8217;s first TV screen-based NFT explorer and marketplace aggregator.&#8221; Users will be able to browse, preview, purchase as well as show off their NFT art on their TVs &#8212; the latter enhanced by a smart calibration feature that will automatically adjust the TV&#8217;s display settings to match the NFT&#8217;s creator&#8217;s recommendations. As users research NFTs, they&#8217;ll also be able to view the NFT&#8217;s history and the blockchain metadata.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-2252573 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/samsung-nft-platform-smart-tv.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Samsung couldn&#8217;t provide more information on the NFT app, when asked, including who its partners would be on this initiative or which TV models would support the feature. This makes it seem as if the news was announced before all the details were ironed out. (It&#8217;s also unclear how much demand there is among consumers for accessing NFTs from a TV screen, for that matter.)</p>
<p>In addition to the included services in the new Smart Hub, the 2022 Smart TVs will work with <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-unveils-its-2022-micro-led-neo-qled-and-lifestyle-tvs-with-next-generation-picture-quality-and-range-of-cutting-edge-personalization-options" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accessories</a> like an Auto Rotating Wall Mount and Stand, which allow users to rotate their screen to a vertical mode. This mode will support Samsung&#8217;s own lifestyle features like its Ambient Mode+ and Art Mode, as well as third-party apps like TikTok and YouTube.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mercedes-Benz revealed Monday the Vision EQXX, a concept vehicle that is meant to showcase what the automaker&#8217;s electric future will look like. The upshot? An eye-popping design coupled with advanced engineering that squeezes in power, efficiency and range into a compact and sporty package.</p>
<p>The EQXX is a halo car, which Mercedes said during a digital reveal ahead of the CES tech trade show went from idea to prototype in 18 months. The vehicle is meant be the foundation for its future electric vehicles. The aim wasn&#8217;t just to step up the exterior styling or add in a massive infotainment display — although that is indeed inside the EQXX.</p>
<p>Instead, the company used the EQXX as a proving ground of how far it can push design and engineering. The company focused on improving the energy density of its battery and boosting overall efficiency by reducing the weight of the vehicle using some lightweight materials including for the battery case and brake discs<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, an aerodynamic design that produces a drag coefficient of Cd 0.175, ultra low-rolling resistance tires and a new compact electric drivetrain. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252486" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The electric-only chassis features a lightweight F1 subframe and notably the vehicle is outfitted with a 900-volt electric architecture, which Mercedes said proved to be an extremely useful research tool for the development of the power electronics.</span></p>

<p>There are other added details too, including <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ultra-thin roof panels that feed the battery system for up to 15.5 miles of extra range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The end result is a vehicle that Mercedes says can travel 620 miles on a single charge and boasts 95% efficiency, which means 95% of the energy from the battery ends up at the wheels. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>To develop this futuristic and efficient EV, the company tapped its R&amp;D department as well as people from its Formula 1 and Formula E teams.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are proving that innovations from motorsport &#8212; where powertrains are already highly electrified &#8212; have immediate relevance for road car development,&#8221; said Markus Schäfer, Daimler AG board member and Mercedes-Benz AG&#8217;s CTO responsible for development and procurement.</p>
<p>Instead of just increasing the size of the battery, Mercedes-Benz and its HPP team developed a new battery pack with an energy density of close to 400 Wh/L.</p>
<p>The company said this benchmark figure is what made it possible to fit a battery pack with just under 100 kWh of usable energy into the compact dimensions of the EQXX.</p>
<p>&#8220;In effect, we fitted the energy of the EQS into the vehicle dimensions of a compact car,&#8221; according to Adam Allsopp, the advanced technology director from HPP, who was referring to the EQS electric vehicle that was introduced in 2021. &#8220;The battery has almost the same amount of energy but is half the size and 30% lighter. The battery management system and power electronics have been designed with an absolute focus on reducing losses. In achieving this efficiency milestone, we learnt a lot that will flow into future development programs.&#8221;</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 10">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The company was able to increase energy density<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in part from what Mercedes described as &#8220;significant progress&#8221; in the chemistry of the anodes, which has higher silicon content and advanced composition that allowed it to hold considerably more energy than commonly used anodes. </span></p>
</div>

<p>The exterior shows off a sloping front with a gloss-black grille with rose-gold highlights, plus a 2D star pattern on the front bumper. The headlights have two star-shaped elements with the larger one housing the low-beam and high-beam light arrays behind a center lens. Mercedes says this star arrangement and the 2D star pattern on the bumper offers a preview of front-end design detailing that will be featured in future models.</p>
<p>Moving to the back end offers a surprise: a retractable rear diffuser.</p>

<p>Inside the vehicle is a one-piece 47.5-inch LED display with 8K resolution. The infotainment screen will have responsive real-time graphics that will span the width of the vehicle, according to Mercedes. The automaker worked with NAVIS Automotive Systems to develop a 3D navigation system that users can zoom into and scroll around for this massive screen. And like the company&#8217;s newer models, the EQXX also featurea an advanced voice assistant and software that learns your behavior over time.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[How should we think about the importance of geographic spread — sprawl? — when it comes to on-demand companies?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Germany&#8217;s Delivery Hero is set to become Glovo&#8217;s majority shareholder following <a href="https://www.deliveryhero.com/newsroom/tech-champions-join-forces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a deal to acquire an additional 39.4% stake</a> of the Spanish delivery startup, of which it already held 44%.</p>
<p>We learned of the deal over the holidays, but you&#8217;ll be excused if you missed the news when it broke &#8212; the deal was <a href="https://ir.deliveryhero.com/websites/delivery/English/6150/news-detail.html?newsID=2182241" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on December 31 after 11 p.m. CET, much to the <a href="https://twitter.com/m_angelmendez/status/1477073850957504514" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annoyance</a> of Spanish reporters. &#8220;If they have no consideration for their delivery workers, [why would they have any] for the press?&#8221; El Confidencial&#8217;s Michael McLoughlin <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelMCsaez/status/1477047837116583942" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ironized</a> on Twitter.</p>

<p>But let&#8217;s not let inside baseball get in the way: The transaction is an interesting piece of news from a number of perspectives. This morning, we&#8217;ll dig into a number of them, including the current pace of on-demand startup consolidation, the power of geographic expansion in the two companies’ market and why Glovo didn’t go public as it once targeted.</p>

Let’s get into it!</p>
<h2>On-demand consolidation</h2>
<p>The key historical context for the Delivery Hero-Glovo deal is DoorDash’s recent agreement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/doordash-to-acquire-food-delivery-company-wolt/">to buy food delivery company Wolt for €7 billion</a>, or around $8.1 billion. Wolt is a Finnish company, but with a wide geographic footprint. At the time of the DoorDash deal, TechCrunch wrote that Wolt “has over 4,000 employees across 23 countries.”</p>
<p>Glovo is also active in a host of markets, a feat that it notably achieved at least in part thanks to acquisitions. The company bought brands from, of all companies, Delivery Hero in 2021, when the Spanish company <a href="https://tech.eu/brief/spains-glovo-goes-on-a-shopping-spree-snaps-up-three-of-berlin-based-delivery-heros-brands-foodpanda-donesi-and-pauza-for-e170-million-picks-up-slovenias-ehrana-for-des/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired brands from its new parent company for €170 million</a>. But that was not the end of Glovo’s 2021 deal spree.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The long, lonesome death of the classic BlackBerry brand <a href="https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/support/devices/end-of-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hits another milestone tomorrow</a>, as the company finally will end access to legacy services. Users still hanging onto devices running BlackBerry OS 7.1 and BlackBerry 10 will lose substantial functionality on Tuesday, January 4. The list includes &#8212; but is not limited to &#8212; key features like data, phone calls, SMS and 911 access. So, you know, the stuff you do with a phone.</p>
<p>As the company notes, this move is a long time coming. BlackBerry ditched its in-house hardware way back in 2016, farming out the brand to companies like TCL (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/03/blackberry-and-tcl-will-end-their-handset-partnership-in-august-2020/">called it quits in 2020)</a>. The company announced the January 4 shutdown all the way back in 2020, so, you can’t accuse BlackBerry of not offering significant transition time. The statement notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>As another milestone in the BlackBerry journey, we will be taking steps to decommission the legacy services for BlackBerry 7.1 OS and earlier, BlackBerry 10 software, BlackBerry PlayBook OS 2.1 and earlier versions, with an end of life or termination date of January 4, 2022. As of this date, devices running these legacy services and software through either carrier or Wi-Fi connections will no longer reliably function, including for data, phone calls, SMS and 9-1-1 functionality. We have chosen to extend our service until then as an expression of thanks to our loyal partners and customers.</p></blockquote><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252492" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>There are, of course, plenty of options out there &#8212; though<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/blackberrys-brand-switches-hands-again-set-to-return-as-a-5g-android-handset/"> OnwardMobility</a>, which promised a 5G BlackBerry-branded device, is currently still MIA, in spite of promising an announcement in 2021. There’s always the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/after-essentials-failure-osom-plans-a-new-privacy-first-handset/">OSOM device</a>, which sports its own Canadian pedigree. Though, again, that privacy-focused product won’t be announced until Mobile World Congress at the end of next month.</p>
<p>In the meantime, let’s have a moment to remember the days when the BlackBerry ruled the mobile roost, as the choice of world leaders, entertainment figures and normal folks, alike. In the world of hardware, however, nothing gold can stay &#8212; physical keyboards included. RIP BB classic. It&#8217;s been real.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter announced today it has completed the sale of its mobile ad platform, MoPub, to the mobile game maker and marketing software provider AppLovin for $1.05 billion in cash. The deal was first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/twitter-mopub-applovin-deal/">announced</a> in October 2021, following Twitter&#8217;s reveal of its plan to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitter-plans-to-double-revenue-by-2023-reach-315m-daily-users/">double its revenue</a> by 2023 to reach $7.5 billion or more. While MoPub had helped Twitter generate approximately $188 million in annual revenue in 2020, Twitter now sees more potential in developing other areas of its business amid its accelerated product development. Specifically, the company said it&#8217;s now redirecting its resources toward performance-based ads, SMB and commerce.</p>
<p>Today, Twitter reiterated its plans to further the development of its own owned and operated products.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the sale of MoPub completed, we continue to concentrate our efforts on enhancing ads across our platform. Our goal is to deliver faster growth in key areas and accelerate our product development,&#8221; said Bruce Falck, Twitter&#8217;s GM of Revenue Products, in <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/twitter-completes-sale-of-mopub-301452516.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a press release</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252473" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Previously, Twitter CFO Ned Segal had <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/twitter-enters-into-definitive-agreement-to-sell-mopub-to-applovin-for-1-05-billion-in-cash-301394571.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> how MoPub&#8217;s sale allowed Twitter to concentrate on the &#8220;massive potential for ads&#8221; on its website and mobile apps.</p>
<p>But the deal also represents an opportunity for Twitter to invest in new areas of its business that could allow it to expand its revenue model beyond advertising alone. The company, over the past year or so, has significantly accelerated the pace of product development with launches like its audio chat rooms called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">Twitter Spaces</a>, newsletters (via its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">Revue</a> acquisition), online <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/twitter-communities/">communities</a>, a misinformation debunking project <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/twitters-birdwatch-fights-misinformation-with-community-notes/">Birdwatch</a>, paid subscription service <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/twitter-blue-launches-in-the-u-s-and-new-zealand-with-expanded-feature-set/">Twitter Blue</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/twitter-accelerates-again-with-bitcoin-tips-nfts-recorded-spaces-creator-fund-and-more/">creator economy tools</a> and features like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/twitter-super-follows-monetization/">Super Follow</a> and tipping, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/twitter-accelerates-again-with-bitcoin-tips-nfts-recorded-spaces-creator-fund-and-more/">crypto</a>,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/twitter-launches-u-s-e-commerce-pilot-that-lets-users-shop-from-profiles/"> e-commerce</a> including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/walmart-will-be-the-first-retailer-to-test-twitters-new-livestream-shopping-platform/">live shopping</a>, and more. Combined, these products leave Twitter more opportunities to seek out revenue in new ways &#8212; like commissions on ticketed events or subscriptions, for example.</p>
<p>The sale of MoPub also came at a time when the mobile ad industry had been upset by changes implemented by Apple in its latest version of the iOS mobile operating system. With Apple&#8217;s new privacy-focused tools, more consumers can now opt out of being tracked by apps and advertisers, making a business like MoPub much less interesting for Twitter. AppLovin, however, <a href="https://www.applovin.com/blog/mopub-transaction-slated-to-close-next-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sees the opportunity</a> in leveraging MoPub&#8217;s demand- and supply-side tools into its larger in-app mediation platform, MAX, then migrate publishers and demand partners to the unified platform, further growing its business. The company <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220103005089/en/AppLovin-Closes-Acquisition-of-Twitter%E2%80%99s-MoPub-Business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says it expects</a> to process more than $15 billion of annualized advertiser spend by 2023.</p>
<p>At the <a href="https://investors.applovin.com/news/news-details/2021/AppLovin-to-Acquire-Twitters-MoPub-Business/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time of the deal,</a> MoPub&#8217;s software was used by 45,000 mobile apps to manage their monetization and reached 1.5 billion addressable users around the world, AppLovin said. Today, more than 150 DSPs, representing thousands of brands and agencies, now have direct access to the AppLovin Exchange, the company adds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Developers benefit from more features to help drive higher monetization opportunities and streamline workflows, leading to increased revenue for their businesses. We believe the power of this unified platform will be unparalleled in today’s market,&#8221; said Adam Foroughi, AppLovin’s co-founder and CEO, in a statement. &#8220;We are excited to execute on this strategic acquisition with our sights set on operating the largest and most robust in-app advertising platform that enhances the growth of the broader mobile app ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>The acquisition had been expected to close in early 2022.</p>
<p>Twitter today noted that the MoPub platform, including network mediation, Advanced Bidding and Marketplace, will be sunset on March 31, 2022. The MoPub Dashboard and Reporting will be available until April 8, 2022. Publishers will have a 90-day transition period from close to <a href="https://www.applovin.com/mopub-max-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">migrate</a> off the MoPub platform to AppLovin&#8217;s MAX platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abstra, which has developed a no-code tool for designers and programmers to build professional apps, has raised $2.3 million in a funding round led by SoftBank Latin America Fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bruno Vieira Costa founded Rio de Janeiro-based </span><a href="https://abstra.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abstra</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March of 2020. Costa graduated from college in 2018 and already has one startup sale under his belt. The serial entrepreneur, who says he’s been programming since he was seven years old, previously co-founded and served as CTO to an edtech startup, PaperX. That company </span><a href="https://www.startse.com/noticia/startups/edtech/descomplica-adquire-startup-focada-no-desenvolvimento-de-testes-e-simulados" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sold to the larger, venture-backed edtech </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Descomplica</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when Costa was 23 years old. Before college, he had also co-founded a game studio called Sinextra that he says “had some huge Brazilian customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His goal with Abstra is simple: to help people make apps without coding. It is, in particular, good for agencies who want to deliver faster results or for non-technical departments that need to iterate faster but depend on centralized engineering teams to implement everything, according to Costa. With Abstra,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> designers and junior programmers can build professional websites and apps “much faster than senior developers in bigger companies,” Costa said.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251985" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We allow easy-to-use customization without the UI limitations that no-code tools commonly have,” he added.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While no-code is supposed to already be easy, Costa believes that some </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">no-code tools struggle to serve designers because they need a lot of fine tuning while having no coding skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some are too technical while others are just assembling pre-built interfaces,” he said. “We are developing a mechanism that tackles both problems in that it is easy to use and flexible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abstra is focused on late-/growth-stage tech companies and enterprise IT consulting companies. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the startup is growing MRR (monthly recurring revenue) 45% on average and has landed 11 customers, including Accenture, Stone and Descomplica. The startup participated in Y Combinator’s spring 2021 batch before catching SoftBank’s eye. Iporanga, Alexia Ventures and some angels have also put money in the company.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the COVID-19 pandemic, every business has had “to go somewhat digital.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This exploded the demand for software production,” Costa told TechCrunch. “But there are just not enough developers available. So no-code was hugely beneficial with this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young startup got the opportunity to pitch Accenture, a consulting firm that had over $50 billion in revenue in 2021, because Costa had a friend in common with some people who worked there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I showed our results from previous clients and a product demo and they decided to run a pilot at  that same meeting,” Costa told TechCrunch. “They are now one of our most active users. As an enterprise consulting firm, using tools like ours makes them much more competitive.”</span></p>
<p>Alexia Ventures&#8217; Patrick Arippol told TechCrunch that his firm believes that the &#8220;no and low code opportunity set is in its early days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Abstra’s initial product showed much promise and potential at a global level, based on early customer feedback and on the product’s architecture and underlying premises,&#8221; he wrote via email.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use the new capital primarily toward beefing up its current nine-person staff, particularly across its engineering, marketing, sales and operations teams.</span></p>

<p>It&#8217;s the new year! Yes, welcome to 2022 from the Equity team. We hope that our holiday episodes kept you entertained, and warm. But it&#8217;s now back to work, so let&#8217;s get into the news:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252461" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>Global stocks are generally higher today, while cryptos are mostly flat. In the last week, major cryptocurrencies have lost value.</li>
<li>Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/02/twitter-bans-rep-marjorie-taylor-greenes-personal-account-over-covid-19-misinformation/">banned Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene</a> for &#8220;repeated violations of [its] COVID-19 misinformation policy.&#8221;</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Your usual host, Kirsten Korosec, is taking a much-deserved holiday out in nature, so I&#8217;ll be taking over this week to give you the news and wish you both a Happy New Year and a swift hangover recovery.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252278" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s officially 2022, but let&#8217;s take a quick look over the past year. To quickly sum up &#8212; everyone bought e-bikes; robotaxis and autonomous trucks are getting closer to commercialization; teleoperated sidewalk delivery robots are becoming a thing; the National Highway Traffic and Safety Association is keeping an eye on the likes of Tesla and Chevy; pretty much every OEM is investing serious cash into electrifying, and that includes battery joint ventures; and eVTOLs got a huge amount of investment.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dig a bit deeper into that last. My colleague Aria Alamalhodaei wrote a two-part series on the trends shaping the eVTOL space. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/top-evtol-trends-2021/">The first part looked back at 2021</a>, highlighting such trends as:</p>
<ul>
<li>SPACs have been taking off and helping fuel a stupid amount of money into the industry, with companies like <strong>Archer Aviation</strong>, <strong>Joby Aviation</strong>, <strong>Lilium</strong> and <strong>Vertical Aerospace </strong>all merging with blank check companies.</li>
<li>On-the-ground infrastructure, like vertiports and chargers, is turning into its own business unit, and companies like <strong>Archer</strong>, <strong>Hyundai </strong>and <strong>Volocopter</strong> are exploring ways to integrate air mobility into a city&#8217;s existing transport networks.</li>
<li>There have been increased orders for eVTOL aircraft, starting with <strong>United Airline&#8217;s</strong> $1 billion order with Archer.</li>
<li>Automakers &#8212; like Hyundai, <strong>Honda</strong> and <strong>Xpeng</strong> &#8212; are investing resources into building their own flying cars.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this movement is setting the stage for what&#8217;s to come in 2022. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/28/the-evtol-take-off-part-two-looking-ahead-to-2022/">Some of Aria&#8217;s predictions are</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>“The main story of 2022, it’s definitely going to be certification,” Sergio Cecutta, founder and partner at SMG Consulting, said. “It’s the year of put up or shut up.”</li>
<li>More automakers will start getting involved in the space. That much is clear from major investments from <strong>Toyota</strong> and <strong>Stellantis</strong> into <strong>Joby</strong> and a manufacturing deal with <strong>Archer</strong>, respectively.</li>
<li>More SPAC deals. Aria writes that it&#8217;s not a given, &#8220;but the high capital demands of aviation could mean more startups are still looking for a huge injection of cash via the public markets.&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<p>Since we&#8217;re making predictions, I&#8217;d be remiss if I didn&#8217;t share some thoughts about what <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/27/micromobility-in-2022-refined-mature-and-packed-full-of-tech/">2022 may hold for the world of micromobility</a>. I spoke to a few experts and came up with some interesting, and even wacky, responses.</p>
<p>Crystal ball says&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>More e-bikes will hit the shared micromobility space.</li>
<li>Fresh VC money is drying up and there aren&#8217;t likely to be more new entrants into the space. Those who have made it this far are likely here to stay, and they&#8217;re becoming more mature and more efficient.</li>
<li>That said, the ride-hail companies (aka <strong>Uber</strong> and <strong>Lyft</strong>) might be coming back to play, says <strong>Segway&#8217;s</strong> Tony Ho, based on orders and inquiries for vehicles he&#8217;s seeing come in.</li>
<li>All that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/advanced-rider-assistance-systems-tech-spawned-by-the-politics-of-micromobility/">scooter ADAS</a> we started to see last year? Yeah, it&#8217;s here to stay, and will only increase. But that&#8217;s not all! Buckle up for smarter vehicles that will not only affect the way you ride, but will also provide operators with more monetization opportunities. Data. Is. Everything. Operators will be looking for ways to sell sensor data.</li>
<li>Horace Dediu, industry analyst and co-host of the Micromobility Podcast, reckons there&#8217;ll be far more integration of micromobiilty options with transit planning apps like Google Maps.</li>
<li>He also said we can expect a marriage between micromobility and the metaverse. The f&amp;%!, you might be thinking. Wait for it. Imagine a smart helmet with an augmented reality-enabled visor, pointing out directions for you or enticing you into the nearest coffee shop with a floating coupon!</li>
<li>New, heavier, form factors. Personally, I wanna see a tiny vehicle with a roof, already! We don&#8217;t all love getting caught in the rain.</li>
<li>Better integration of micromobility offerings with public transit.</li>

<p><strong>Voi </strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/2250109/">just raised a $115 million Series D</a> in what it describes as an oversubscribed funding round that will help it expand into new markets. As scooter companies consolidate their power, such a big raise this late in the game is definitely significant.</p>
<p><strong>Wind Mobility</strong>, which has sold off Italian and Israeli operations in recent months, is now upgrading its e-scooter fleet in Nottingham and Derby in the U.K. with LINK e-scooters from <strong>Superpedestrian</strong>. Users will now need to download the LINK app to continue using Wind&#8217;s service&#8230; so is it really Wind&#8217;s service anymore?</p>
<p>Superpedestrian also launched 150 seated scooters in Baltimore to provide a safer and more comfortable transportation option to people with disabilities and older riders.</p>
<h2>Deal of the week</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What with the holidays, there haven&#8217;t been too many deals, but I did notice AI chip maker <strong>Kneron&#8217;s</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/ai-chip-kneron-25-million-funding/">$25 million raise</a>. The Chinese startup will use the funding to start making chips for autonomous driving applications. This move comes as the company possibly prepares to go public in the U.S. in the next few years, and with an increased number of AV companies aiming to scale over the same time frame, Kneron might be one to watch.</p>
<p>The other deal that caught my eye is South Africa&#8217;s <strong>Planet42</strong>, a car subscription company that buys used cars from dealerships and rents to customers, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/south-africas-planet42-gets-30m-for-its-car-subscription-service-mexico-expansion/">just raised $30 million in equity and debt.</a> The round is a bridge round, a precursor to a Series A, and it will help the company expand into the Mexican market.</p>
<p>Planet42 has an interesting business model that it calls &#8220;socially inclusive.&#8221; As a company that provides services in emerging markets, it helps people who perhaps have unstable incomes or unimpressive credit scores access vehicles that could potentially change their lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Organizing information from providers, insurers and patients not only takes a lot of time, but increases private healthcare costs. <a href="https://www.smarterhealth.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smarter Health</a>, a Singaporean-based startup, develops technology that allows smoother exchange of data between different parties in the healthcare system, improving patient care and reducing administrative costs. The company announced today it has raised a $5.15 million SGD (about $3.8 million USD) Series A led by East Ventures for product development and to expand in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Other investors included Orbit Malaysia, Citrine Capital, HMI Group and Emtek.</p>
<p>The company currently operates in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, and plans to enter into new countries with its new funding. The new round brings Smarter Health’s total raised to $8 million SGD.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252447" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Smarter Health’s platform isn’t meant to replace legacy software already in use by its clients. Instead, it seeks to work with them, and reduce manual processes. The startup’s AI-based tech enables secure data exchanges (with patient consent) between healthcare providers, insurers and patients. This enables it to offer a roster of services. For payors and insurers, this includes a patient concierge that recommends specialists, schedules appointments and creates demographic profiles of policy holders. It also automates claims assessments, updates insurers about cases and makes the bill and claims adjudication process faster.</p>
<p>The company has three main customer categories: doctors, hospitals and insurers and other corporate payors, like AIA, Allianz and Prudential, which make up the bulk of its business.</p>
<p>For healthcare organizations and providers, Smarter Health offers specialist recommendations and patient registration tools, a load-levelling solution that shortens waiting times and digitized hospital admissions and claim submissions.</p>
<p>In a statement, East Ventures co-founder and managing partner Willson Cuaca said, “The COVID-19 pandemic has forced insurers and healthcare providers to reflect and re-strategize on their operations, catalyzing digital transformation. Smarter Health is here to make healthcare accessible, affordable and accountable by providing an AI-powered interoperable platform.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
