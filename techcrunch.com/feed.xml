					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</em></a><em>, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</em></p>
<p>Happy Saturday everyone. Despite it being a short week I feel pretty run over from the sheer news volume that we’ve put up with in the last few days. So let’s pause, repine and talk about SPACs as a nice little treat.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>No, we’re not going through a SPAC investor presentation teardown today. Though we will dig into the <a href="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6010a862416e07401f64bc95/60b8b95610f77f32420593f8_2021.03.06%20Babylon%20Announcement%20Presentation.pdf">Babylon Health SPAC</a> on Monday. Instead, we’re discussing the SoFi and BarkBox blank-check deals.</p>
<p>Both began to trade this week after announcing their public debuts some time ago. And things went just fine? Here’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/01/sofi-shares-rise-after-debut-on-nasdaq.html">CNBC on SoFi’s first minutes</a> as a public company:</p>
<blockquote><p>SoFi, short for Social Finance, went public by merging with Social Capital Hedosophia Corp V, a blank-check company run by venture capital investor Chamath Palihapitiya. The stock closed up more than 12% to $22.65.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s not only a win for SoFi, but also for the somewhat-embattled Chamath Palihapitiya, whose SPAC bets have lost some luster in recent months; of course all SPAC-led debuts are speculative, but some retail traders appeared to index more on Palihapitiya’s reputation than fundamentals &#8212; what can you do!</p>
<p>BarkBox also did perfectly ok when it began to trade this week after its own SPAC combination was consummated, <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/barkbox-stock-ipo-price-51622660797">as Barrons reported</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>BARK stock (ticker: BARK) jumped about 7.5% on Wednesday, to trade at around $12 in the afternoon. That gives the company a market value of close to $2.4 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>BarkBox stock has since given up some of its gains, but managed to get public without falling below its initial SPAC price. That’s a win given how market conditions have shifted since its flotation was initially announced.</p>
<p>Two wins in a single week is good news for SPAC-land and the myriad players on the blank-check and startup sides of the marketplace. Naturally two solid results does not a trend make, but it seems clear that for companies with material revenues the SPAC-route is not as potholed as we might have expected.</p>
<h2>The crypto wager</h2>
<p>If you think SPACs are generally annoying, just wait until we fuse the blank-check boom with crypto. As we are about to do!</p>
<p>This week Circle, a crypto-focused company with a particular taste for stablecoins, <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/circle-raises-440-million-eyes-possible-spac">raised $440 million</a>. That was an ocean of capital for a company best known for the USDC stablecoin; it is also <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/106473/after-440-million-fundraise-circle-is-said-to-be-considering-a-spac-deal">reported to be considering a SPAC-led IPO</a>.</p>
<p>What is a stablecoin? It’s a cryptocurrency that is pegged to a fiat currency. In the case of USDC, as you surmised, the coin is pegged to the US dollar. Stablecoins are useful fiat comps inside the crypto world and have proven to be hugely popular.</p>
<p>Circle’s USDC has $22.8 billion worth of supply in circulation, it claims, and several billion in daily transactions, per CoinMarketCap data. That’s not bad! But what isn’t as clear to your humble servant is precisely how the firm generates huge revenues at super-attractive gross margins. Which is what we’d expect from a company that just locked down nearly a half-billion dollars (or USDC, we suppose) in private capital in a single go.</p>
<p>So, for once, bring on the SPAC. Because we want to see the damn numbers, and quickly, given our sheer curiosity.</p>
<h2>Growth?</h2>
<p>Wrapping, Ron and I got to dig into a number of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/once-a-buzzword-digital-transformation-is-reshaping-markets/">public companies’ earnings reports the other day</a>, essentially discovering that the vaunted digital transformation <em>acceleration</em> is actually coming true for some companies.</p>
<p>This week’s news continued the argument. Zoom’s earnings, for example, backed up our thesis. Its revenues <a href="https://investors.zoom.us/news-releases/news-release-details/zoom-reports-financial-results-first-quarter-fiscal-year-2022">were up 191%</a> in Q1 F2022 compared to Q1 F2021. That’s just bonkers good.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum are Dropbox and Box, which are under fresh pressure this week from external investors. The pair of former private-market darlings have run into a growth wall and are taking incoming fire due to it. Grow or die is more than just startup advice. It’s what software companies need to do if they want to stay in charge of their own destiny.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This week was a busy one. Facebook held its developer conference F8 which delivered a lot of app-related news across its platform. Now, WWDC is just days away. We also broke a few big app stories this week, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/tiktok-just-gave-itself-permission-to-collect-biometric-data-on-u-s-users-including-faceprints-and-voiceprints/">one about TikTok&#8217;s privacy policy</a> and its newly added permission to collect biometric data on U.S. users, including &#8220;faceprints and voiceprints.&#8221; Twitter added a subscription service, and Tinder tested group video chat.</p>
<p><strong>And in our downloads section, we have a treat for readers: a time-sensitive and exclusive invite code to get into one of the hottest new apps for sneakerheads: <a href="https://www.soleretriever.com/mobile-app">Sole Retriever.</a> </strong></p>

<p>WWDC&#8217;s big keynote<a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/"> is kicking off next week</a> on June 7 at 1 PM ET. The livestream page is <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/event-stream/index.html">here</a>. While we may see new MacBook Pros, what software developers will care about are the forthcoming details about Apple&#8217;s latest OS releases and other new technologies. As to what they may include? <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/technology?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a> that iOS 15 will introduce a way for users to set different notification preferences and automatic replies, based on their current status (driving, working, sleeping, etc.) and an updated Lock Screen where this menu of choices would be accessible. iMessage may be upgraded to be more social, to better compete with Messenger and WhatsApp. Meanwhile, iPadOS could be getting the App Library and an upgraded Home Screen with support for widgets. (And you can fill the screen with just widgets, if you choose.) Or who knows! Until it&#8217;s official, it&#8217;s all a maybe!</p>
<p>But one potentially interesting rumor to watch for would be a new privacy feature that would show users which apps were collecting data about them. This builds on Apple&#8217;s investments in App Tracking Transparency and could make it more difficult for shady SDKs to stay in business.</p>
<p>There will likely be some updates coming to other Apple&#8217;s own apps, Siri, watchOS and more. It&#8217;s going to be a packed week &#8212; stay tuned!</p>
<p><strong>Ahead of WWDC, Apple also updated its report (conducted on its behalf via the Analysis Group) on App Store commerce. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/apples-app-store-facilitated-643-billion-in-commerce-up-24-from-last-year/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">says the App Store facilitated $643 billion in billings and sales in 2020</a></strong>, up 24% from the $519 billion seen the year prior. It also noted that about 90% of the billings and sales facilitated by the App Store actually took place outside its walls, meaning Apple took no commission on those purchases. This is up from the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/as-antitrust-investigation-looms-apple-says-its-app-store-facilitated-519b-in-commerce-in-2019/">85% figure reported last year</a>. The full report delves into other trends related to the pandemic&#8217;s impact, small and large businesses, and more. Apple initially commissioned the report to demonstrate how little business on the App Store is actually subject to App Store fees, but now it&#8217;s updated the report a year later. It&#8217;s interesting how much understanding Apple has about its App Store, especially when Tim Cook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/tim-cook-plays-innocent-in-epic-v-apples-culminating-testimony/">claimed to know so little</a> about several crucial figures.</p>

<p><strong>Google will restrict third-party apps from customizing the native Android Sharesheet in Android 12.</strong> Currently, the UI of the Sharesheet can differ from app to app, but <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-blocks-third-party-apps-from-replacing-the-share-sheet/">XDA Developers reports</a> it will become more iOS-like, by offering a consistent menu across apps.</p>
<p><strong>Google is taking a cue from Apple by allowing users to opt out of personalization using the advertising ID in the Android Settings. Once users opt out, the advertising ID is disabled.</strong> The ID is a unique, user-resettable identifier provided by Google Play services. As part of a <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248/advertising-id">coming Google Play services update in late 2021</a>, the advertising identifier will be removed when the user opts out of tracking, and any attempt to access the identifier will only return a string of zeros. Google says ad and analytics service partners will receive notifications about a user&#8217;s preferences to help them with compliance.

The rollout had led to a lot of backlash as it revealed the messaging app would begin sharing more info with Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>As part of its F8-related announcements, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/facebook-doubles-down-on-business-tools-with-whatsapp-api-updates-login-connect-for-messenger-and-more/">WhatsApp said</a> it would <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/?lang=en">update</a> its Business API to make it quicker for business to get started with its service.</strong> WhatsApp will make it faster to set up a business account (5 minutes instead of weeks), and will allow businesses to respond faster to inbound messages, as well as send messages to users who opted in. The business tool for customer care will allow up to 10 pre-written messages, among other updates.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told popular news outlet/leaker <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/will-cathcart-and-mark-zuckerberg-confirm-to-wabetainfo-3-features-to-come-on-whatsapp/">WaBetaInfo</a> that WhatsApp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/zuckerberg-says-whatsapp-will-add-multi-device-support-introduce-view-once-disappearing-feature/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">will add multi-device support</a> for connecting up to four devices to one account.</strong> He also said WhatsApp will introduce a &#8220;view once&#8221; disappearing feature for photos and videos, and is working on an iPad app. The method of delivering this news is worth noting &#8212; WaBetaInfo is not a traditional news outlet, but more of an independent news portal of sorts. Zuckerberg has been taking Facebook news to non-traditional (and often far friendlier) channels as of late, including popping up in Clubhouse rooms and other independent outlets. Facebook clearly feels mainstream press has turned on it when they&#8230;<em>[checks notes]</em>&#8230;held Facebook accountable for its actions.</p>

<p><strong>Spotify rolled out a sort of mid-year version of Wrapped with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/spotify-rolls-out-new-personalized-experiences-and-playlists-including-a-mid-year-review-and-a-blended-mix-with-a-friend/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">the launch of the new personalized experience, Only You</a>.</strong> The feature offers insights about your music history in a sharable format, like your musical dinner party or audio birth chart, and other fun finds. Why now? Perhaps Spotify is heading off Apple Music news to come with a feature that reminds users it does personalization best?</p>
<p><strong>Spotify also added Blend</strong>, a way to create a playlist with any other Spotify user. The company offers a similar feature for users on its Family and Duo plans, but this new tool doesn&#8217;t require users to be in the same household.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.soleretriever.com/mobile-app">Sole Retriever</a> is a newly launched app that aims to be a sneakerhead&#8217;s dream.</strong></p>
<p>The app offers a one-stop shop for all things sneaker &#8212; including sneaker news, sneaker releases, sneaker raffles, a calendar of upcoming drops and more. The company says its goal is to democratize access to sneaker drops by making this info more accessible and convenient for consumers. Before its mobile launch, Sole Retriever had offered its service via the web only. Now it&#8217;s live on both <a href="https://www.soleretriever.com/mobile-app">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.soleretrieverapp.soleretriever">Android</a>.</p>
<p>Unique to the mobile experience is the ability to customize your alerts so you only hear about the raffles you want to know about &#8212; like those in the U.S., or only those that are in-store or online, for example. It also makes entering raffles easier with autofill features. Custom profiles that let you save the info for others who have agreed to let you enter their name and address to increase your chances of winning. And the app can save your logins for different retailers to make shopping easier.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Earlier today, TechCrunch&#8217;s Kirsten Korosec reported that the autonomous vehicle startup Aurora is close to finalizing a deal to merge with one of three blank-check companies that have been formed to date by renowned entrepreneurs Reid Hoffman and Mark Pincus and a third partner in these deals, Michael Thompson, who long managed special situation funds. [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier today, TechCrunch&#8217;s Kirsten Korosec reported that the autonomous vehicle startup Aurora is close to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/autonomous-vehicle-startup-aurora-in-final-talks-to-merge-with-reid-hoffmans-newest-spac/">finalizing a deal</a> to merge with one of three blank-check companies that have been formed to date by renowned entrepreneurs Reid Hoffman and Mark Pincus and a third partner in these deals, Michael Thompson, who long managed special situation funds.</p>
<p>The development is intriguing for a lot of reasons, including because Aurora’s founders are big wheels in their industry (no pun intended), and having already acquired the self-driving unit of Uber in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/aurora-sends-offers-to-majority-uber-atg-employees-but-not-the-rd-lab/">complicated arrangement</a>, Aurora could, as a publicly traded entity, snap up even more rivals, given it would have a more liquid currency than it does right now.</p>
<p>Possible merits of the deal aside, the deal is also interesting because of Hoffman&#8217;s involvement. His venture firm, Greylock, is an investor in Aurora and has been since co-leading its Series A round in 2018, at which point Hoffman joined the board as a director. Now Hoffman’s SPAC is looking to take Aurora public at what we can safely assume is a much, much higher valuation than where it was valued back then. In fact, Korosec reports that one of the sticking points in this new deal is how much the company could conceivably be worth, writing that talk involved a $20 billion valuation at one point and is now closer to $12 billion, with the deal expected to be announced as early as next week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This isn’t the first time a SPAC sponsor has pursued an existing investment as a target. In just one similar case, famed VC Chamath Palihapitiya was an<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/clover-health/company_financials/investors"> investor</a> in insurance company Clover through his firm Social Capital and as industry watchers will know, one of his blank-check companies merged with Clover <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-clover-health-m-a-social-capital/clover-health-to-go-public-via-3-7-billion-deal-with-social-capital-idUSKBN26R1XB">last year</a>.</p>
<p>A representative for Palihapitiya declined to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-23/former-cypress-ceo-tj-rodgers-shows-up-on-two-sides-of-spac-deal">disclose to Bloomberg</a> whether or not he sold the stake prior to the SPAC deal, but legally, it doesn’t matter anyway. All a SPAC sponsor need do right now is write a lengthy disclosure when raising a SPAC that ultimately says, ‘Hey, I might use the capital I’m raising for this blank-check company to buy another company where I already have a financial interest, and here&#8217;s how that&#8217;s going to work.&#8217;</p>
<p>The question is whether such rules around potential conflicts &#8212; or lack of rules &#8212; will continue to exist indefinitely. The SEC is clearly taking a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/accounting-reporting-warrants-issued-spacs">closer look</a> right now at SPACs, and while it offered guidance specifically around conflicts of interest <a href="https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/disclosure-special-purpose-acquisition-companies">last December</a>, saying that they make the agency a little nervous and could sponsors please disclose as much as possible to everyone involved in a deal, there’s a new administration in Washington and a new agency head in SEC Chief Gary Gensler, and it wouldn’t be surprising to see more being done on this front than we’ve witnessed to date.</p>
<p>There perhaps should be. SPACs already have a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6eb655a2-21f5-4313-b287-964a63dd88b3">lousy reputation</a> because investors lose money on the majority of them, and notwithstanding the esteem of individuals like Hoffman, these obvious conflicts of interest &#8212; let&#8217;s face it &#8212; generally smell bad.</p>
<p>Yes, there’s a strong argument that a SPAC sponsor who has been long involved with a target company knows better the value of that company than anyone else. That inside knowledge cuts both ways, though. The target <em>could</em> be an amazing company that just needs a way to go public more quickly than might be possible with a traditional IPO. Let&#8217;s assume for now that Aurora falls into this camp. But the target could also need to bailed out by SPAC sponsors who have a vested interest in the company and know its prospects may dim otherwise.</p>
<p>Do most retail investors know the difference between the two? It&#8217;s doubtful, and in this go-go market, they seem bound to get hurt if regulators continue to turn a blind eye to the practice. That&#8217;s leaving many industry observers to wonder of the SEC: what&#8217;s it waiting for?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cruise, the autonomous vehicle subsidiary of GM that also has backing from SoftBank Vision Fund, Microsoft and Honda, has secured a permit that will allow the company to shuttle passengers in its test vehicles without a human safety operator behind the wheel.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Published/G000/M387/K064/387064893.PDF">permit</a>, issued by the California Public Utilities Commission as part of its driverless pilot program, is one of several regulatory requirements autonomous vehicle companies must meet before they can deploy commercially. This permit is important — and Cruise is the first to land this particular one — but it does not allow the company to charge passengers for any rides in test AVs.</p>
<p>&#8220;In order to launch a commercial service for passengers here in the state of California, you need both the California DMV and the California PUC to issue deployment permits. Today we are honored to have been the first to receive a driverless autonomous service permit to test transporting passengers from the California PUC,&#8221; Prashanthi Raman, Cruise&#8217;s director of Government Affairs said in an emailed statement to TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are two regulatory bodies, the CPUC and the California Department of Motor Vehicles, that dictate the testing and eventual deployment of autonomous vehicles. The California DMV regulates testing of autonomous vehicles with and without safety operators. About 55 companies have permits to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver. Driverless testing permits, in which a human operator is not behind the wheel, have become the new milestone and a required step for companies that want to launch a commercial robotaxi or delivery service in the state. AutoX, Baidu, Cruise, Nuro, Pony.ai, Waymo, WeRide and Zoox have driverless permits with the DMV.</p>
<p>The final step with the DMV, which only Nuro has achieved, is a deployment permit. This permit allows Nuro to deploy at a commercial scale. Nuro&#8217;s vehicles can&#8217;t hold passengers, just cargo, which allows the company to bypass the CPUC permitting process.</p>
<p>Over at the CPUC, there are &#8220;drivered&#8221; and &#8220;driverless&#8221; permits, which allow companies to give rides in their autonomous vehicles. Aurora, AutoX, Cruise, Deeproute.ai, Pony, Voyage (which was acquired by Cruise) Waymo and Zoox all have &#8220;drivered&#8221; permits. Cruise is the first to snag the driverless permit.</p>
<p>Any company that wants to eventually shuttle and charge passengers for rides in their robotaxis have to secure all of these permits from the DMV and CPUC.</p>
<p>&#8220;Issuance of this first driverless permit for the CPUC&#8217;s Autonomous Vehicle Passenger Service Pilot Programs is a significant milestone. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to transform our transportation system and communities by solving individual mobility needs, improving roadway safety, and moving goods throughout the state sustainably and efficiently,&#8221; Commissioner Genevieve Shiroma said in statement. &#8220;The effective deployment of autonomous vehicles can also transform vehicle manufacturing, maintenance, and service business models to create new jobs and industries for the California workforce.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last year, the CPUC<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> approved two new programs to allow permitted companies to provide and charge for shared rides in autonomous vehicles as long as they can navigate the lengthy regulatory process. The decision came after months of lobbying by the AV industry pushing the </span>CPUC to consider a rule change that would allow for operators to charge a fare and offer shared rides in driverless vehicles.</p>
<p>The CPUC said Cruise, along with any other company that eventually participates in the pilot, must submit quarterly reports about the operation of their vehicles providing driverless AV passenger service. Companies must also submit a passenger safety plan that outlines their plans for protecting passenger safety for driverless operations.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for June 4, 2021. What a week, yeah? That was four super-packed days. But don’t think that the pace of news is about to slow down. It’s not. Next week is Apple’s big WWDC developer event, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/what-to-expect-from-wwdc-2021/">which we previewed here</a>. And TechCrunch’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">next event focused on mobility is just around the corner</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s to catching up on sleep this weekend. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2><strong>The TechCrunch Top 3</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/facebook-will-reconsider-trumps-ban-in-two-years/"><strong>Facebook can’t quit Trump</strong></a><strong>:</strong> News broke today that Facebook will reconsider its ban of former American president and wannabe autocrat Donald Trump in two years’ time. The decision fits inside of Facebook’s larger struggle to decide the rules for its hugely popular social platforms.</li>
<li><strong>The IPO wave continues:</strong> Venture-backed startups are filing to go public at a rapid clip. Today it was Xometry (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/xometry-is-taking-its-excess-manufacturing-capacity-business-public/">our first look here</a>) and SentinelOne (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/cybersecurity-sentinelone-ipo/">more here</a>). Expect to see more filings as a busy Q3 pipeline forms.</li>
<li><strong>Governments v. Tech:</strong> The world’s governments continue to push tech companies around. Sometimes for reasons that make some sense, as with the U.S. government’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/white-house-expands-investment-ban-on-chinese-tech-and-telecom-companies/">refreshed</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/white-house-expands-investment-ban-on-chinese-tech-and-telecom-companies/"> crack</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/white-house-expands-investment-ban-on-chinese-tech-and-telecom-companies/">down</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/white-house-expands-investment-ban-on-chinese-tech-and-telecom-companies/"> on certain Chinese tech companies</a>. And sometimes for reasons that do not, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-operations-says-platform-undermines-its-corporate-existence/">like Nigeria trying to ban Twitter late this week</a>. Regardless of your politics, expect more from this space every week until the end of time.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Startups and VC</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/flink-the-german-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-240m-after-launching-just-6-months-ago/">Flink raises quick $240M</a>:</strong> After operating in the market for just half a year, German grocery delivery startup Flink has raised a quarter billion dollars. Flink is German for quick, which relates to both its delivery timeline and its venture capital cadence.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/softbank-invests-150m-in-gmb-a-mexico-city-based-investment-platform/"><strong>GBM raises “up to” $150M from SoftBank</strong></a><strong>:</strong> When is a startup not a startup? When it’s 35 years old. That’s the case with Mexican company Grupo Bursátil Mexicano, or GBM. But as TechCrunch reports, the company is seeing hypergrowth, expanding from “having 38,000 investment accounts in January 2020 to more than 650,000 by year’s end.” It is not over the 1,000,000 account mark. Not bad.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/as-buy-now-pay-later-startups-keep-raising-capital-a-dive-into-klarna-afterpay-and-affirms-earnings/"><strong>The BNPL market is growing quickly, still expensive</strong></a><strong>:</strong> A TechCrunch analysis of recent buy-now-pay-later companies that are big enough to report earnings indicates that the popular startup market is still growing quickly, but that few if any companies working on the consumer sales model are actually making money. Yet.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/rebranded-toyota-ventures-invests-300-million-in-emerging-tech-and-carbon-neutrality/"><strong>Toyota commits $300M to startups</strong></a><strong>:</strong> Toyota’s AI-focused venture capital fund is AI-branded no more, and TechCrunch reports that the corporate VC group is “commemorating its new identity by investing an additional $300 million in emerging technologies and carbon neutrality.” That’s a lot of bread to help save the world.</li>
<li><strong>Auto SPAC:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/autonomous-vehicle-startup-aurora-in-final-talks-to-merge-with-reid-hoffmans-newest-spac/">TechCrunch broke the news</a> that “autonomous vehicle startup Aurora is close to finalizing a deal to merge with Reinvent Technology Partners Y, the newest special purpose acquisition company launched by LinkedIn co-founder and investor Reid Hoffman.”</li>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Today’s Big Tech news is essentially a huge slug of Facebook. So, if you are irked by spending more time than you have to considering Zuckerberg’s empire, feel free to move on to the Community section of today’s missive!</p>
<p>Facebook land was more today than just the news <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/facebook-will-reconsider-trumps-ban-in-two-years/">regarding former U.S. President Donald Trump</a>. Big Blue also got busy buying a gaming company and getting hit with antitrust probes in the U.K. and EU.</p>
<p>On the gaming front, Facebook announced today that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/facebook-buys-studio-behind-roblox-like-crayta-gaming-platform/">it is buying Crayta</a>, which TechCrunch described as a ”a Roblox-like game creation platform.” Roblox, of course, recently went public via a direct listing after seeing its fortunes rise during the COVID-19 pandemic. TechCrunch also wrote that Facebook has been buying one-off VR startups as well. So, there’s something of a larger gaming push afoot at the company, perhaps. If there is any rule to Facebook’s actions, it’s that if it sees any other company doing a thing and making money, it has to copy it.</p>
<p>To close out Big Tech for the week, Facebook is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/facebooks-use-of-ad-data-triggers-antitrust-probes-in-uk-and-eu/">under new scrutiny by both the U.K. and the EU</a>, this time for its use of data from advertising customers and the folks who use its single-sign-on tool. TechCrunch reported that the investigations are “looking at whether it uses this data as an unfair lever against competitors in markets such as classified ads.”</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>Thanks for joining us yesterday for <a href="https://twitter.com/EthanChoi7/status/1400555790021300227">our chat about the future of e-commerce</a>. It’s nice to be able to dive deeper into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/5-predictions-for-the-future-of-e-commerce/">the things we write</a>. Twitter Spaces was fun to use, but sadly <a href="https://twitter.com/BrandonMChu">our friend Brandon Chu from Shopify</a> wasn’t able to join from his Android device (yay beta apps!). Just means we’ll have to do it again.</p>
<p>Speaking of doing Twitter Spaces again, we’re going to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/what-to-expect-from-wwdc-2021/">pregaming WWDC</a> on Monday, led by our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/brian-heater/">hardware editor, Brian Heater</a>. We’ll start bright and early at 8:30 a.m. PDT/11:30 a.m. EDT, so bring all of your thoughts and questions then.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite the complications of meeting new people in the midst of a global pandemic, dating apps have shown <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tinder-bumble-and-hinge-show-surge-in-americans-looking-for-love-online-11613246400">a recent spike</a> in both downloads and usage. Now, as COVID-19 vaccines become more widely available, it&#8217;s likely that this trend will continue.</p>
<p>In other words, Tinder is anticipating a &#8220;<a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-06-04-Tinder-Gives-Members-More-Control-With-New-Feature-Allowing-You-to-Block-Your-Ex">post-pandemic uncuffing season</a>,&#8221; and they&#8217;re rolling out a new feature to prepare. Now, users can upload their phone contacts to select certain people that they&#8217;d rather not see on the app, whether that&#8217;s an ex, a co-worker or a family member. According to a survey commissioned by Tinder, 40% of people have found an ex-partner on the app, 24% have encountered a family member and one in 10 have even encountered their professor.</p>
<p>Sure, it would be pretty awkward to see your ex out on the dating market again. But the new feature is more interesting for the user safety aspect. For example, if someone has previously encountered a stalker or otherwise abusive figure &#8212; whether on the app or off &#8212; they now have a tool to directly block them on Tinder.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, instead of creating a simple form where you could enter the phone number or email address of the abuser, Tinder is asking for permission to access the user&#8217;s entire contacts list. Ostensibly, this is for ease of use &#8212; Tinder even claims it only keeps on hand the contact information for those you&#8217;ve blocked, and not your entire address book &#8212; but users may still be wary. For years, social apps have used address book uploads as a big data grab from users, with little benefit beyond friend-finding functionality. More recently, this trend has reemerged with new apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/poparazzi-hypes-itself-to-the-top-of-the-app-store/">Poparazzi</a> and Clubhouse. The latter thankfully<a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22332182/clubhouse-privacy-contacts-invites-update"> stopped</a> the practice in March after user outcry.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1FOkTcBkSf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/poparazzi-hypes-itself-to-the-top-of-the-app-store/">Poparazzi hypes itself to the top of the App Store</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Poparazzi hypes itself to the top of the App Store&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/poparazzi-hypes-itself-to-the-top-of-the-app-store/embed/#?secret=1FOkTcBkSf" data-secret="1FOkTcBkSf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“We’re rolling out Block Contacts as an additional resource empowering members with peace of mind by helping create a worry-free space for them to spark new connections,&#8221; said Bernadette Morgan, Group Product Manager, Trust &amp; Safety at Tinder, in a <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-06-04-Tinder-Gives-Members-More-Control-With-New-Feature-Allowing-You-to-Block-Your-Ex">statement</a>.</p>
<p>Tinder tested the Block Contacts feature in India, Korea and Japan, reporting that members who used the feature blocked about a dozen people on average.</p>
<p>To use the feature, go to Settings under your profile icon, select &#8220;Block Contacts,&#8221; then grant the app permission. To block individuals, you can&#8217;t rely on whether or not they were blocked on your phone. You&#8217;ll need to select each person you want to block under the &#8220;Contacts&#8221; tab then tap &#8220;Block Contacts.&#8221;</p>
<p>This user interface makes it easier to block abusers and exes, but it&#8217;s also designed for people who want to block a large number of people &#8212; like everyone in their family or close friend group. That makes the feature a big perk for those using Tinder&#8217;s app to cheat, too.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Tinder is strict about requiring a valid phone number to register, though it&#8217;s not impossible for people to circumvent the system by registering with a Google Voice number, for example. So, regardless of which safety features Tinder rolls out, proceed wisely.</span></p>

		Dan Schoenbaum is a two-time CEO and a two-time COO in cybersecurity. Today, he is a managing partner at <a href="http://www.hightide-advisors.com/">High Tide Advisors</a>, a boutique consulting firm helping companies achieve greater success through go-to-market strategies and execution.

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The average corporate security organization spends $18 million annually but is largely ineffective at preventing breaches, IP theft and data loss. Why? The fragmented approach we’re currently using in the security operations center (SOC) does not work.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick refresher on security operations and how we got where we are today: A decade ago, we protected our applications and websites by monitoring event logs — digital records of every activity that occurred in our cyber environment, ranging from logins to emails to configuration changes. Logs were audited, flags were raised, suspicious activities were investigated, and data was stored for compliance purposes.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The security-driven data stored in a data lake can be in its native format, structured or unstructured, and therefore dimensional, dynamic and heterogeneous, which gives data lakes their distinction and advantage over data warehouses.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As malicious actors and adversaries became more active, and their tactics, techniques and procedures (or TTP’s, in security parlance) grew more sophisticated, simple logging evolved into an approach called “security information and event management” (SIEM), which involves using software to provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware. SIEM software uses rule-driven correlation and analytics to turn raw event data into potentially valuable intelligence.</p>
<p>Although it was no magic bullet (it’s challenging to implement and make everything work properly), the ability to find the so-called “needle in the haystack” and identify attacks in progress was a huge step forward.</p>
<p>Today, SIEMs still exist, and the market is largely led by Splunk and IBM QRadar. Of course, the technology has advanced significantly because new use cases emerge constantly. Many companies have finally moved into cloud-native deployments and are leveraging machine learning and sophisticated behavioral analytics. However, new enterprise SIEM deployments are fewer, costs are greater, and — most importantly — the overall needs of the CISO and the hard-working team in the SOC have changed.</p>
<h2>New security demands are asking too much of SIEM</h2>
<p><strong>First, data has exploded</strong> <strong>and SIEM is too narrowly focused.</strong> The mere collection of security events is no longer sufficient because the aperture on this dataset is too narrow. While there is likely a massive amount of event data to capture and process from your events, you are missing out on vast amounts of additional information such as OSINT (open-source intelligence information), consumable external-threat feeds, and valuable information such as malware and IP reputation databases, as well as reports from dark web activity. There are endless sources of intelligence, far too many for the dated architecture of a SIEM.</p>
<p><strong>Additionally, data exploded alongside costs. </strong>Data explosion + hardware + license costs = spiraling total cost of ownership. With so much infrastructure, both physical and virtual, the amount of information being captured has exploded. Machine-generated data has grown at 50x, while the average security budget grows 14% year on year.</p>
<p>The cost to store all of this information makes the SIEM cost-prohibitive. The average cost of a SIEM has skyrocketed to close to<a href="https://foresite.com/true-cost-siem-security-information-event-management/"> $1 million annually</a>, which is only for license and hardware costs. The economics force teams in the SOC to capture and/or retain less information in an attempt to keep costs in check. This causes the effectiveness of the SIEM to become even further reduced. I recently spoke with a SOC team who wanted to query large datasets searching for evidence of fraud, but doing so in Splunk was cost-prohibitive and a slow, arduous process, leading the team to explore alternatives.</p>
<p>The shortcomings of the SIEM approach today are dangerous and terrifying. <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190730005215/en/Ponemon-Study-53-Percent-of-IT-Security-Leaders-Don%E2%80%99t-Know-if-Cybersecurity-Tools-are-Working-Despite-an-Average-of-18.4-Million-Annual-Spend"> A recent survey by the Ponemon Institute</a> surveyed almost 600 IT security leaders and found that, despite spending an average of $18.4 million annually and using an average of 47 products, a whopping 53% of IT security leaders “did not know if their products were even working.” It’s clearly time for change.</p>

<p>Debt is a tool, and like any other — be it a hammer or handsaw — it’s extremely valuable when used skillfully but can cause a lot of pain when mismanaged. This is a story about how it can go right.</p>
<p>Mario Ciabarra, the founder and CEO of Quantum Metric, breaks down how his company was on a &#8220;tremendous growth curve&#8221; — and then the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>&#8220;As the weeks following the initial shelter-in-place orders ticked by, the rush toward digital grew exponentially, and opportunities to secure new customers started piling up,&#8221; Ciabarra writes. &#8220;A solution to our money problems, perhaps? Not so fast — it was a classic case of needing to spend in order to make.&#8221;</p>
<p>If companies want to preserve equity, debt can be an advantageous choice. Here&#8217;s how Quantum Metric did it.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People have been working to optimize customer experiences (CX) since we began selling things to each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A famous San Francisco bakery has an exhaust fan at street level; each morning, its neighbors awake to the scent of orange-cinnamon morning buns wafting down the block. Similarly, savvy hairstylists know to greet returning customers by asking if they want a repeat or something new.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Online, CX may encompass anything from recommending the right shoes to AI that knows when to send a frustrated traveler an upgrade for a delayed flight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In light of Qualtrics&#8217; spinout and IPO and Sprinklr&#8217;s recent S-1, Rebecca Liu-Doyle, principal at Insight Partners, describes four key attributes shared by &#8220;companies that have upped their CX game.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>What is a microblogging service doing buying a social podcasting company and a newsletter tool while also building a live broadcasting sub-app? Is there even a strategy at all?</p>
<p>Yes. Twitter is trying to revitalize itself by adding more contexts for discourse to its repertoire. The result, if everything goes right, will be an influence superapp that hasn’t existed anywhere before. The alternative is nothing less than the destruction of Twitter into a link-forwarding service.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about how Twitter is trying to eat the public conversation.</p>

<p>Part 4 of Expensify&#8217;s EC-1 digs into the company&#8217;s engineering and technology, with <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca">Anna Heim</a> noting that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/">group of P2P pirates/hackers</a> set out to build an expense management app by sticking to their gut and making their own rules.</p>
<p>They asked questions few considered, like: Why have lots of employees when you can find a way to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/expensify-ec1-culture/">get work done and reach impressive profitability with a few</a>? Why work from an office in San Francisco when the internet lets you work from anywhere, even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/expensify-ec1-expansion/">a sailboat in the Caribbean?</a></p>
<p>It makes sense in a way: If you’re a pirate, to hell with the rules, right?</p>
<p>With that in mind, one could assume Expensify decided to ask itself: Why not build our own totally custom tech stack?</p>
<p>Indeed, Expensify has made several tech decisions that were met with disbelief, but its belief in its own choices has paid off over the years, and the company is <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210503005265/en">ready to IPO</a> any day now.</p>
<p>How much of a tech advantage Expensify enjoys owing to such choices is an open question, but one thing is clear: These choices are key to understanding Expensify and its roadmap. Let’s take a look.</p>

<p>The news this week that e-commerce marketplace Etsy will buy Depop, a startup that provides a secondhand e-commerce marketplace, for more than $1.6 billion may not have made a large impact on the acquiring company’s share price thus far, but it provides a fascinating look into what brands may be willing to pay for access to the Gen Z market.</p>
<p>Etsy is buying Gen Z love. Think about it — Gen Z is probably not the first demographic that comes to mind when you consider Etsy, so you can see why the deal may pencil out in the larger company’s mind.</p>
<p>But it isn’t cheap. The lesson from the Etsy-Depop deal appears to be that large e-commerce players are willing to splash out for youth-approved marketplaces. That’s good news for yet-private companies that are popular with the budding generation.</p>

<p>Confluent became the latest company to announce its intent to take the IPO route, officially filing its S-1 paperwork this week.</p>
<p>The company, which has raised over $455 million since it launched in 2014, was most recently valued at just over $4.5 billion when it raised $250 million last April.</p>
<p>What does Confluent do? It built a streaming data platform on top of the open-source Apache Kafka project. In addition to its open-source roots, Confluent has a free tier of its commercial cloud offering to complement its paid products, helping generate top-of-funnel inflows that it converts to sales.</p>
<p>What we can see in Confluent is nearly an old-school, high-burn SaaS business. It has taken on oodles of capital and used it in an increasingly expensive sales model.</p>

<p>Would you like to work with private equity and venture capital funds?</p>
<p>There are relatively few jobs directly inside private equity and venture capital funds, and those jobs are highly competitive.</p>
<p>However, there are many other ways you can work and earn money within the industry — as a consultant, an interim executive, a board member, a deal executive partnering to buy a company, an executive in residence or as an entrepreneur in residence.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the different ways you can work with the investment community.</p>

<p>There is a growing group of entrepreneurs who are betting that hormonal health is the key wedge into the digital health boom.</p>
<p>Hormones are fluctuating, ever-evolving, and diverse — but these founders say they’re also key to solving many health conditions that disproportionately impact women, from diabetes to infertility to mental health challenges.</p>
<p>Many believe it’s that complexity that underscores the opportunity. Hormonal health sits at the center of conversations around personalized medicine and women’s health: By 2025, women’s health could be a $50 billion industry, and by 2026, digital health more broadly is estimated to hit $221 billion.</p>
<p>Still, as funding for women’s health startups drops and stigma continues to impact where venture dollars go, it’s unclear whether the sector will remain in its infancy or hit a true inflection point.</p>

<p>Two years ago, founders of calendar assistant platform Reclaim were looking for a &#8220;mango&#8221; seed round — a boodle of cash large enough to help them transition from the prototype phase to staffing up for a public launch.</p>
<p>Although the team received offers, co-founder Henry Shapiro says the few that materialized were poor options, partially because Reclaim was still pre-product.</p>
<p>&#8220;So one summer morning, my co-founder and I sat down in his garage — where we’d been prototyping, pitching and iterating for the past year — and realized that as hard as it was, we would have to walk away entirely and do a full reset on our fundraising strategy,&#8221; he writes.</p>
<p>Shapiro shares what he learned from embracing failure and offers three conclusions &#8220;every founder should consider before they decide to go out and pitch investors.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although software as a service has been thriving as a sector for years, it has gone into overdrive in the past year as businesses responded to the pandemic by speeding up the migration of important functions to the cloud, ActiveCampaign founder and CEO Jason VandeBoom writes in a guest column.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve all seen the news of SaaS startups raising large funding rounds, with deal sizes and valuations steadily climbing. But as tech industry watchers know only too well, large funding rounds and valuations are not foolproof indicators of sustainable growth and longevity.&#8221;</p>
<p>VandeBoom notes that to scale sustainably, SaaS startups need to &#8220;stand apart from the herd at every phase of development. Failure to do so means a poor outcome for founders and investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As a founder who pivoted from on-premise to SaaS back in 2016, I have focused on scaling my company (most recently crossing 145,000 customers) and in the process, learned quite a bit about making a mark,&#8221; VandeBoom writes. &#8220;Here is some advice on differentiation at the various stages in the life of a SaaS startup.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Autonomous vehicle startup Aurora is close to finalizing a deal to merge with Reinvent Technology Partners Y, the newest special purpose acquisition company launched by LinkedIn co-founder and investor Reid Hoffman, Zynga founder Mark Pincus and managing partner Michael Thompson, according to several sources familiar with the talks.</p>
<p>One of the sticking points is the targeted valuation, which had been as high as $20 billion. It is now closer to $12 billion and the deal is expected to be announced as early as next week, said multiple sources who have asked not to be identified because they&#8217;re not authorized to discuss the deal. Aurora declined to comment. Reinvent also declined to comment.</p>
<p>The Hoffman, Pincus, Thompson trio, who are bullish on a concept that they call &#8220;venture capital at scale,&#8221; have formed three SPACs, or blank-check companies. Two of those SPACs have announced mergers with private companies. Reinvent Technology Partners announced a deal in February to merge with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/joby-aviation-takes-flight-into-the-public-markets-via-a-spac-merger/">electric vertical take off and landing company Joby Aviation</a>, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange later this year. Reinvent Technology Partners Z merged with <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210304005356/en/Hippo-to-Go-Public-in-Merger-w[%E2%80%A6]ners-Z-Company-is-Transforming-the-Home-Insurance-Industry">home insurance startup Hippo</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Their latest SPAC, known as Reinvent Technology Partners Y,  priced its initial public offering of 85 million units at $10 per unit to raise $850 million. The SPAC issued an additional 12.7 million shares to cover over allotments with total gross proceeds of $977 million, according to regulatory filings. The units are listed on the Nasdaq exchange and trade under the ticker symbol &#8220;RTPYU.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aurora already has a relationship with Hoffman. In February 2018, Aurora raised $90 million from Greylock Partners and Index Ventures. Hoffman, who is a partner at Greylock, and Index Ventures&#8217; Mike Volpi became board members of Aurora as part of the Series A round. The following year, Aurora raised more than $530 million in a Series B round led by Sequoia Capital and included Amazon and T. Rowe Price Associates. Lightspeed Venture Partners, Geodesic, Shell Ventures and Reinvent Capital also participated in the round, as well as previous investors Greylock and Index Ventures.</p>
<p>While Hoffman and Reinvent showing up on two sides of a SPAC deal would be unusual, it is not unprecedented. For instance, a blank-check company formed by T.J. Rodgers announced in February a merger with Enovix, a battery technology company that he has been a director of since 2012 and is its largest shareholder, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-23/former-cypress-ceo-tj-rodgers-shows-up-on-two-sides-of-spac-deal?sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported at the time</a>. In this case, Hoffman is a board member, but not its largest shareholder.</p>
<p>Aurora, which was founded in 2017 by Sterling Anderson, Drew Bagnell and Chris Urmson, has had a high-flying year. In December, the company reached an agreement with Uber to buy the ride-hailing firm&#8217;s self-driving unit in a complex deal that valued the combined company at $10 billion.</p>
<p>Aurora did not pay cash for Uber ATG, a company that was valued at $7.25 billion following a $1 billion investment in 2019 from Toyota, DENSO and SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund. Instead, Uber handed over its equity in ATG and invested $400 million into Aurora. The deal gave Uber a 26% stake in the combined company, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. (As a refresher, Uber held an 86.2% stake (on a fully diluted basis) in Uber ATG, according to filings with the SEC. Uber ATG&#8217;s investors held a combined stake of 13.8% in the company.)</p>
<p>Since the acquisition, Aurora has spent the past several months integrating Uber ATG employees and now has a workforce of about 1,600 people. Aurora more recently said it reached an agreement with Volvo to jointly develop autonomous semi-trucks for North America. That partnership, which is expected to last several years and is through Volvo&#8217;s Autonomous Solutions unit, will focus on developing and deploying trucks built to operate autonomously on highways between hubs for Volvo customers.</p>
<p>In March, Aurora <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1852011/000185201121000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">disclosed in a regulatory filing</a>, that it has sold $54.9 million in an equity offering that kicked off in March 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Xometry, a Maryland-based service that connects companies with manufacturers with excess production capacity around the world, filed <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001657573/000119312521181945/d120843ds1.htm">an S-1 form</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announcing its intent to become a public company.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Growth aside, it’s clear that Xometry is no modern software business, at least from a revenue-quality profile.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As the global supply chain tightened during the pandemic in 2020, a company that helped find excess manufacturing capacity was likely in high demand. CEO and co-founder Randy Altschuler described his company to TechCrunch this way last September upon the announcement of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/xometry-raises-75m-series-e-to-expand-custom-manufacturing-marketplace/">a $75 million Series E investment</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve created a marketplace using artificial intelligence to power it, and provide an e-commerce experience for buyers of custom manufacturing and for suppliers to deliver that manufacturing,&#8221; Altschuler said at the time. Xometry raised nearly $200 million while private, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/xometry/company_financials">per Crunchbase data</a>.</p>
<p>With Xometry, companies looking to build custom parts now have the ability to do so in a digital way. Rather than working the phones or starting an email chain, they can go into the Xometery marketplace, define parameters for their project and find a qualified manufacturer who can handle the job at the best price.</p>
<p>As of last September, the company had built relationships with 5,000 manufacturers around the world and had 30,000 customers using the platform.</p>
<p>At the time of that funding round, perhaps it wasn&#8217;t a coincidence that the company&#8217;s lead investor was T. Rowe Price. When an institutional investor is involved in a late-stage round, it&#8217;s usually a sign that the company is ready to start thinking about an IPO. Altschuler said it was definitely something the company was considering and had brought on a CFO, too, another sign that a company is ready to take that next step.</p>
<p>So what do Xometry&#8217;s financials look like as it heads to the public markets? We took a look at the S-1 to find out.</p>
<h2>The numbers</h2>
<p>Xometry makes money in two ways. The first comes from one part of its marketplace, with the company generating “substantially all of [its] revenue” from charging &#8220;buyers on its platform.” The other way that Xometry engenders top line is seller-related services, including financial work. The company notes that seller-generated revenues were just 5% of its 2020 total, though it does expect that figure to rise.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Ransomware attacks on the JBS beef plant, and the Colonial Pipeline before it, have sparked a now familiar set of reactions. There are promises of retaliation against the groups responsible, the prospect of company executives being brought in front of Congress in the coming months, and even a proposed executive order on cybersecurity that could take months to fully implement.</p>
<p>But once again, amid this flurry of activity, we must ask or answer a fundamental question about the state of our cybersecurity defense: Why does this keep happening?</p>
<p>I have a theory on why. In software development, there is a concept called &#8220;technical debt.&#8221; It describes the costs companies pay when they choose to build software the easy (or fast) way instead of the right way, cobbling together temporary solutions to satisfy a short-term need. Over time, as teams struggle to maintain a patchwork of poorly architectured applications, tech debt accrues in the form of lost productivity or poor customer experience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Complexity is the enemy of security. Some companies are forced to put together as many as 50 different security solutions from up to 10 different vendors to protect their sprawling technology estates.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Our nation’s cybersecurity defenses are laboring under the burden of a similar debt. Only the scale is far greater, the stakes are higher and the interest is compounding. The true cost of this &#8220;cybersecurity debt&#8221; is difficult to quantify. Though we still do not know the exact cause of either attack, we do know beef prices will be significantly impacted and gas prices jumped 8 cents on news of the Colonial Pipeline attack, costing consumers and businesses billions. The damage done to public trust is incalculable.</p>
<p>How did we get here? The public and private sectors are spending more than $4 trillion a year in the digital arms race that is our modern economy. The goal of these investments is speed and innovation. But in pursuit of these ambitions, organizations of all sizes have assembled complex, uncoordinated systems — running thousands of applications across multiple private and public clouds, drawing on data from hundreds of locations and devices.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;GasBuddy tops the App Store for the first time due to Colonial Pipeline attack&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/gasbuddy-tops-the-app-store-for-the-first-time-due-to-colonial-pipeline-attack/embed/#?secret=qPjMiT7oVr" data-secret="qPjMiT7oVr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Complexity is the enemy of security. Some companies are forced to put together as many as 50 different security solutions from up to 10 different vendors to protect their sprawling technology estates — acting as a systems integrator of sorts. Every node in these fantastically complicated networks is like a door or window that might be inadvertently left open. Each represents a potential point of failure and an exponential increase in cybersecurity debt.</p>
<p>We have an unprecedented opportunity and responsibility to update the architectural foundations of our digital infrastructure and pay off our cybersecurity debt. To accomplish this, two critical steps must be taken.</p>
<p>First, we must embrace open standards across all critical digital infrastructure, especially the infrastructure used by private contractors to service the government. Until recently, it was thought that the only way to standardize security protocols across a complex digital estate was to rebuild it from the ground up in the cloud. But this is akin to replacing the foundations of a home while still living in it. You simply cannot lift-and-shift massive, mission-critical workloads from private data centers to the cloud.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wvKzuOuFop"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/enterprise-security-attackers-are-one-password-away-from-your-worst-day/">Enterprise security attackers are one password away from your worst day</a></p></blockquote>

<p>There is another way: Open, hybrid cloud architectures can connect and standardize security across any kind of infrastructure, from private data centers to public clouds, to the edges of the network. This unifies the security workflow and increases the visibility of threats across the entire network (including the third- and fourth-party networks where data flows) and orchestrates the response. It essentially eliminates weak links without having to move data or applications — a design point that should be embraced across the public and private sectors.</p>
<p>The second step is to close the remaining loopholes in the data security supply chain. President Biden’s executive order requires federal agencies to encrypt data that is being stored or transmitted. We have an opportunity to take that a step further and also address data that is in use. As more organizations outsource the storage and processing of their data to cloud providers, expecting real-time data analytics in return, this represents an area of vulnerability.</p>
<p>Many believe this vulnerability is simply the price we pay for outsourcing digital infrastructure to another company. But this is not true. Cloud providers can, and do, protect their customers’ data with the same ferocity as they protect their own. They do not need access to the data they store on their servers. Ever.</p>
<p>To ensure this requires confidential computing, which encrypts data at rest, in transit and in process. Confidential computing makes it technically impossible for anyone without the encryption key to access the data, not even your cloud provider. At IBM, for example, our customers run workloads in the IBM Cloud with full privacy and control. They are the only ones that hold the key. We could not access their data even if compelled by a court order or ransom request. It is simply not an option.</p>
<p>Paying down the principal on any kind of debt can be daunting, as anyone with a mortgage or student loan can attest. But this is not a low-interest loan. As the JBS and Colonial Pipeline attacks clearly demonstrate, the cost of not addressing our cybersecurity debt spans far beyond monetary damages. Our food and fuel supplies are at risk, and entire economies can be disrupted.</p>
<p>I believe that with the right measures — strong public and private collaboration — we have an opportunity to construct a future that brings forward the combined power of security and technological advancement built on trust.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook has been making plenty of one-off virtual reality studio acquisitions lately, but today the company announced that they&#8217;re buying something with wider ambitions &#8212; a Roblox-like game creation platform.</p>
<p>Facebook shared that they&#8217;re buying Unit 2 Games, which builds a platform called <a href="https://www.crayta.com/">Crayta.</a> Like some other platforms out there, it builds on top of the Unreal Engine and gives users a more simple creation interface teamed with discovery and community features. Crayta has cornered its own niche pushing monetization paths like Battle Pass seasons, giving the platform a more Fortnite-like vibe as well.</p>
<p>Unit 2 has been around for just over three years, and Crayta launched just last July. Its audience has likely been limited by the studio&#8217;s deal to exclusively launch on Google&#8217;s cloud-streaming platform Stadia, though it&#8217;s also available on the Epic Games Store as of March.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The title feels designed for the lightweight nature of cloud-gaming platforms, with users able to share access to games just by linking other users, and Facebook seems keen to use Crayta to push forward their own efforts in the gaming sphere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crayta has maximized current cloud-streaming technology to make game creation more accessible and easy to use. We plan to integrate Crayta’s creation toolset into Facebook Gaming’s cloud platform to instantly deliver new experiences on Facebook,&#8221; Facebook Gaming VP Vivek Sharma wrote in an announcement post.</p>
<p>The entire team will be coming on as part of the acquisition, though financial terms of the deal weren&#8217;t shared.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The clock is ticking on former President Donald Trump&#8217;s ban from Facebook, formerly indefinite and now for a period of two years, the maximum penalty under a newly revealed set of rules for suspending public figures. But when the time comes, the company will reevaluate the ban and make a decision then whether to end or extend it, rendering it indefinitely definite.</p>
<p>The ban of Trump in January was controversial in different ways to different groups, but the issue on which Facebook&#8217;s Oversight Board stuck as it chewed over the decision was that there was nothing in the company&#8217;s rules that supported an indefinite ban. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/facebook-trump-ban-oversight-board/">Either remove him permanently, they said, or else put a definite limit to the suspension</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook has chosen&#8230; neither, really. The two-year limit on the ban (backdated to January) is largely decorative, since the option to extend it is entirely Facebook&#8217;s prerogative, as VP of public affairs Nick Clegg writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the end of this period, we will look to experts to assess whether the risk to public safety has receded. We will evaluate external factors, including instances of violence, restrictions on peaceful assembly and other markers of civil unrest. If we determine that there is still a serious risk to public safety, we will extend the restriction for a set period of time and continue to re-evaluate until that risk has receded.</p>
<p>When the suspension is eventually lifted, there will be a strict set of rapidly escalating sanctions that will be triggered if Mr. Trump commits further violations in future, up to and including permanent removal of his pages and accounts.</p></blockquote>
<p>It <em>sort of</em> fulfills the recommendation of the Oversight Board, but truthfully Trump&#8217;s position is no less precarious than before. A ban that can be rescinded or extended whenever the company chooses is certainly &#8220;indefinite.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RNBIhRHLwZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/facebooks-hand-picked-oversight-panel-upholds-trump-ban-for-now/">Facebook&#8217;s hand-picked &#8216;oversight&#8217; panel upholds Trump ban &#8212; for now</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook&#8217;s hand-picked &#8216;oversight&#8217; panel upholds Trump ban &#8212; for now&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/facebooks-hand-picked-oversight-panel-upholds-trump-ban-for-now/embed/#?secret=RNBIhRHLwZ" data-secret="RNBIhRHLwZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/DaveLeeFT/status/1400880616032276480">statement</a>, Trump called the ruling &#8220;an insult.&#8221;</p>
<p>That said, the Facebook decision here does reach beyond the Trump situation. Essentially the Oversight Board suggested they need a rule that defines how they act in situations like Trump&#8217;s, so they&#8217;ve created a standard&#8230; of sorts.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2161579" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Heightened-Policy-Final.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2161579" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2161579 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Heightened-Policy-Final.png?w=680" alt="Diagram showing different lengths of bans for worse violations by public figures." width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Heightened-Policy-Final.png 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Heightened-Policy-Final.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Heightened-Policy-Final.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Heightened-Policy-Final.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Heightened-Policy-Final.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Heightened-Policy-Final.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Heightened-Policy-Final.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Heightened-Policy-Final.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2161579" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Facebook</p></div></p>
<p>This highly specific &#8220;enforcement protocol&#8221; is sort of like a visual representation of Facebook saying &#8220;we take this very seriously.&#8221; While it gives the impression of some kind of sentencing guidelines by which public figures will systematically be given an appropriate ban length, every aspect of the process is arbitrarily decided by Facebook.</p>
<p>What circumstances justify the use of these &#8220;heightened penalties&#8221;? What kind of violations qualify for bans? How is the severity decided? Who picks the duration of the ban? When that duration expires, can it simply be extended if &#8220;there is still a serious risk to public safety&#8221;? What are the &#8220;rapidly escalating sanctions&#8221; these public figures will face post-suspension? Are there time limits on making decisions? Will they be deliberated publicly?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that we must assume Facebook will be inconsistent or self-deal or make bad decisions on any of these questions and the many more that come to mind, exactly (though that is a real risk), but that this neither adds nor exposes any machinery of the Facebook moderation process during moments of crisis when we most need to see it working.</p>
<p>Despite the new official-looking punishment gradient and re-re-reiterated promise to be transparent, everything involved in what Facebook proposes seems just as obscure and arbitrary as the decision that led to Trump&#8217;s ban.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that any penalty we apply — or choose not to apply — will be controversial,&#8221; writes Clegg. True, but while some people will be happy with some decisions and others angry, all are united in their desire to have the processes that lead to said penalties elucidated and adhered to. Today&#8217;s policy changes do not appear to accomplish that, regarding Trump or anyone else.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Through its Ministry of Information and Culture today, the Nigerian government announced its decision to suspend the operations of social media platform Twitter in the country.</p>
<p>The statement, made by Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, and signed off by his media aide Segun Adeyemi, could see telecoms in the country prevent Nigerians from using Twitter.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the statement issued by the ministry:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>The Federal Government has suspended indefinitely the operations of the microblogging and social networking service Twitter in Nigeria. The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, announced the suspension in a statement issued in Abuja on Friday, citing the presistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria&#8217;s corporate existence.</p>
<p>The Minister said the Federal Government has also directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately commence the process of licensing all OTT and social media operations in Nigeria.</p></blockquote>
<p>Today&#8217;s announcement is a culmination of events that have happened this past week. Yesterday, Twitter <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-57336571">deleted tweets and videos</a> of President Muhammadu Buhari making threats of punishment to a sect called IPOB in the South-Eastern part of the country after he blamed them for attacks on government buildings. He then referenced Nigeria&#8217;s civil war events in the 1960s, which seemed to offend many Nigerians.</p>
<p>Buhari, who was the country&#8217;s Head of State in the 1980s and served in the army against secessionists, said young Nigerians in the country&#8217;s southeastern part were too young to remember the horrible events that occurred during the war. According to him, the activities of the present-day secessionists are likely headed toward war; hence, it was proactive to stop them beforehand with force.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Twitter chose to delete the tweet after violating its abusive behaviour policy and several calls by Nigerians to take it down. Twitter also suspended the president&#8217;s account, leaving it in a &#8220;read-only mode&#8221; for 12 hours.</p>
<p>Following its decision, Mr Mohammed <a href="https://twitter.com/channelstv/status/1400112861549051905?s=08">called out</a> the social media giant by saying its decision was biased and said the president had a right to express his thoughts on events that affect the country. He also raised suspicion about the platform&#8217;s intention in the country. &#8220;Twitter may have its own rules; it&#8217;s not the universal rule. If Mr President anywhere in the world feels very bad and concerned about a situation, he is free to express such views&#8230; The mission of Twitter in Nigeria is very, very suspect,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In a retaliation act, Nigeria has proceeded to suspend the platform&#8217;s operations in the country. While Twitter doesn&#8217;t have any offices in the country, this announcement can still play out. And although there hasn&#8217;t been any social media ban yet, Nigeria&#8217;s current administration is no stranger to making ploys to restrict access to the internet, certain websites or social media. It was one of the tactics used during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_SARS">the EndSARS protests</a> that rocked the country in October 2020. Given past events in other African countries where the internet has been restricted or banned in one form or another, this is an obvious ploy by the Nigerian government to double down on these tactics and use telecoms operators to repress free speech.</p>
<p>In an email to TechCrunch, Twitter, which recently opened its first African office in Ghana, said, &#8220;the announcement made by the Nigerian Government that they have suspended Twitter&#8217;s operations in Nigeria is deeply concerning. We&#8217;re investigating and will provide updates when we know more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Subsequently, the microblogging platform via its public policy account tweeted:</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are deeply concerned by the blocking of Twitter in Nigeria. Access to the free and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OpenInternet?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#OpenInternet</a> is an essential human right in modern society.</p>
<p>We will work to restore access for all those in Nigeria who rely on Twitter to communicate and connect with the world. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KeepitOn?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#KeepitOn</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Public Policy (@Policy) <a href="https://twitter.com/Policy/status/1401151115022979076?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Back in April, Twitter opted for Ghana to be its African headquarters when many thought the social media company would&#8217;ve chosen Nigeria. It cited the former&#8217;s support of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet as reasons for its choice, which was a smart move judging by today&#8217;s event.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Tesla sales have risen, interest in the company has exploded, prompting investment and interest in the automotive industry, as well as the startup world.</p>
<p>TezLab, a free app that&#8217;s like a Fitbit for a Tesla vehicle, is just one example of the numerous startups that have sprung up in the past few years as electric vehicles have started to make the tiniest of dents in global sales. Now, as Ford, GM, Volvo, Hyundai along with newcomers Rivian, Fisker and others launch electric vehicles into the marketplace, more startups are sure to follow.</p>
<p>Ben Schippers, the co-founder and CEO of TezLab, is one of two early-stage founders who will join us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=tezlab&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=tezlab&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> to talk about their startups and the opportunities cropping up in this emerging age of EVs. The six-person team behind TezLab was born out of HappyFunCorp, a software engineering shop that builds apps for mobile, web, wearables and Internet of Things devices for clients that include Amazon, Facebook and Twitter, as well as an array of startups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>HFC’s engineers, including Schippers, who also co-founded HFC, were attracted to Tesla  because of its techcentric approach and one important detail: the Tesla API endpoints are accessible to outsiders. The Tesla API is technically private. But it exists, allowing the Tesla&#8217;s app to communicate with the cars to do things like read battery charge status and lock doors. When reverse-engineered, it’s possible for a third-party app to communicate directly with the API.</p>
<p>Schippers&#8217; experience extends beyond scaling up TezLab. Schippers consults and works with companies focused on technology and human interaction, with a sub-focus in EV.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=tezlab&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=tezlab&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The list of speakers at our 2021 event</a> is growing by the day and includes Motional&#8217;s president and CEO Karl Iagnemma and Aurora co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson, who will discuss the past, present and future of AVs. On the electric front is Mate Rimac, the founder of Rimac Automobili, who will talk about scaling his startup from a one-man enterprise in a garage to more than 1,000 people and contracts with major automakers.</p>
<p>We also recently announced a panel dedicated to China&#8217;s robotaxi industry, featuring three female leaders from Chinese AV startups: AutoX&#8217;s COO Jewel Li; Huan Sun, general manager of Momenta Europe with Momenta; and WeRide&#8217;s VP of Finance, Jennifer Li.</p>
<p>Other guests include GM&#8217;s VP of Global Innovation Pam Fletcher, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, Joby Aviation founder and CEO JoeBen Bevirt, investor and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman (whose special purpose acquisition company just merged with Joby), investors Clara Brenner of Urban Innovation Fund, Quin Garcia of Autotech Ventures and Rachel Holt of Construct Capital, and Zoox co-founder and CTO Jesse Levinson.</p>
<p>And we may even have one more surprise — a classic TechCrunch stealth company reveal to close the show.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t wait to book your tickets to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021/?utm_medium=editorialpost&amp;utm_campaign=mobility2021&amp;utm_content=tezlab&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=tezlab&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: Mobility</a> as prices go up at our virtual door.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitch announced today that it will release major updates to its Emotes this month to celebrate its 10th anniversary. These new features will include Animated Emotes, Follower Emotes and a Library for Emotes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the origin of the livestreaming platform for gamers, Emotes &#8212; Twitch’s version of emojis &#8212; have been a key component of </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/14/17335670/twitch-emotes-meaning-list-kappa-monkas-omegalul-pepe-trihard"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitch culture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They’re micro memes, and images like Kappa, TriHard and PogChamp have come to carry meaning in the greater gaming world, even off the Twitch platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Emotes are a language that transcends countries,&#8221; said Ivan Santana, senior director of Community Product at Twitch. &#8220;Anywhere you are in the world, they mean the same thing for us.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Amazon-owned platform regularly adds new global Emotes, which can be used on any streamer’s channel. Individual creators can make custom Emotes for their own community, which paying subscribers can use across the platform. But the ability to add animated gifs as Emotes is something that the community has been asking for since Santana can remember. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve been at Twitch for four years, and it’s something people have been asking for since before I joined,” Santana told TechCrunch. “It’s certainly been a very, very long time.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Streamers who lack animation skills need not worry. While the more tech-savvy among us can upload custom gifs, Twitch will provide six templates for streamers to choose from, which can animate their existing Emotes. These animations include Shake, Rave, Roll, Spin, Slide In and Slide Out. Viewers who are sensitive to animations will be able to turn off the feature in their Chat Settings. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2161236" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2161236" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2161236" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/twitch-emote.gif?w=310" alt="" width="310" height="235" /><p id="caption-attachment-2161236" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitch</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitch is also beta testing Follower Emotes, which will be available to select Partners and Affiliates. This feature creates a fun, free incentive for viewers to hit the follow button on a channel they might be checking out for the first time. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When viewers follow a channel, they&#8217;ll be notified when the creator is streaming, which can lead to an eventual subscription. Twitch takes 50% of streamers&#8217; subscription money, creating a valuable revenue stream for the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Q1 of 2021, Twitch viewership hit an all-time high, <a href="https://blog.streamlabs.com/streamlabs-stream-hatchet-q1-2021-live-streaming-industry-report-eaba2143f492">growing 16.5%</a> since the previous quarter. Twitch viewers watched 6.34 billion hours of content in Q1, making up 72.3% of the market share. That&#8217;s double the total hours watched on Twitch in Q1 of 2020. Facebook Gaming and YouTube Gaming earned 12.1% and 15.6% of viewership in the sector, respectively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For a long time, creators have been asking for better ways to attract and welcome new viewers into their channel,” said Santana. “The idea is generally to create a lot of excitement around that community, and more feelings ultimately of community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creators with beta access will be able to upload up to five Emotes for their followers, but unlike Subscriber Emotes, followers won’t be able to use these across other channels. There’s no guarantee that Follower Emotes will be here to stay &#8212; Santana says it’s a feature Twitch is “experimenting” with &#8212; but if all goes well, the feature will roll out more widely later in the year.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitch UX teardown: The Anchor Effect and de-risking decisions&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/07/twitch-ux-teardown-the-anchor-effect-and-de-risking-decisions/embed/#?secret=VuUPSX5h1o" data-secret="VuUPSX5h1o" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the Library function will make it easier for creators to swap Emotes in and out of subscription tiers without having to delete and reupload them each time. This builds upon </span><a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/01/26/new-easy-emote-management-all-your-emotes-one-page/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an upgrade that launched in January</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which centralized channel-specific icons into an Emotes tab on the Creator Dashboard. As usual, new Emotes have to be approved by Twitch before they’re put into use. The Library will roll out soon to all Partners and Affiliates, staggered over a few months to account for an expected increase in volume of new Emotes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As Twitch has scaled, we now have millions of communities across many different cultures across the world,&#8221; Santana said. &#8220;We can hand over more of the controls of our Emote language to our community, and let them sort of evolve in a way that we never could imagine that ultimately serves them in their unique ways.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitch teased that there’s more in the works to celebrate the platform’s 10th anniversary, including an official 10-Year celebration. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">All things considered, Apple put together a pretty slick all-virtual WWDC last year. Where other companies like Microsoft and Google have opted for a more live (or live-style) experience, the company was parading its execs through a series of smooth drone shots and slick transitions. And with the first year under its belt, it will be fun to see how the company outdoes itself.</p>
<p>As far as news goes, the WWDC keynote kickoff is always packed &#8212; and this year is no different. In fact, there’s a good chance that we could see even more. In addition to the standard developer-focused updates to iOS/iPadOS, watchOS, macOS, tvOS and the like, we could well see some new hardware dropping at the event.</p>
<p>As ever, we’ll be breaking the news live, and this time out, we’re bringing back the liveblog. So, you know, lots of different ways to follow along live. The event kicks off at 10AM PT/1PM ET on Monday, June 7.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Speaking of, you can also check out the YouTube livestream here:</p>

<p>As usual, iOS is the tentpole attraction here &#8212; if nothing else, because Apple sells more iPhones than anything else. That was certainly the case last year, when the company’s latest 5G devices provided much needed relief in an otherwise flagging mobile market.</p>
<p>At least right off the bat, iOS 15 doesn’t look like as radical an update as the latest version of Android. But a lot can happen between today and Monday morning. The top line issue (at least for now) seems to be <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/apple-plans-notifications-ipad-home-screen-upgrades-for-ios-15?sref=gni836kR">updates to notifications</a>. According to reports, the new version of the mobile operating system will offer customizable notifications based on status &#8212; meaning things like sleeping, working and driving.</p>
<p>The operating system is also believed to be getting a whole slew of new accessibility features.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141177" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141177" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2141177" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-ipad-pro-2021-overview.jpg" alt="Apple 2021 iPad Pro overview" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-ipad-pro-2021-overview.jpg 1904w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-ipad-pro-2021-overview.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-ipad-pro-2021-overview.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-ipad-pro-2021-overview.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-ipad-pro-2021-overview.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-ipad-pro-2021-overview.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-ipad-pro-2021-overview.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141177" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Perhaps even bigger news is a long-awaited update to iPadOS 15. The dated software was a sticking point in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/review-apples-2021-ipad-pro-is-great-again-but/">our latest iPad Pro review</a>, and it seems the company is finally making some key strides to further distance its tablet operating system from the mobile one. For most intents and purposes, the current execution is effectively a scaled-up version of iOS for the tablet.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Not a ton of details yet, but the home screen is reportedly set to get some major updates, including widgets. One imagines the company will be pushing to make better use of all that added real estate. It should also be getting some of the new iOS updates, including those new notifications and a big overhaul for iMessage.</p>

<p>After the big overhaul that was Big Sur, we’re expecting smaller waves from macOS 12. The big news here may be hardware. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/apple-plans-notifications-ipad-home-screen-upgrades-for-ios-15">Rumors surround</a> an update to Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip. The M1X (as it’s currently being called) could well arrive alongside brand new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, which would finally put a little sunlight between the high and low end of Apple’s laptop line.</p>

<p>Also, watchOS seems due for a big update, even if information is pretty scant so far. New health features are always a sure bet &#8212; especially now that Apple is competing with the newly combined Google and Fitbit (not to mention that recently announced assist from Samsung).</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s<a href="https://twitter.com/jlacort/status/1400007637090111494?s=20"> homeOS,</a> the most intriguing mystery of the bunch. Job listings have pointed to the mysterious operating system &#8212; that could have just been a typo (later changed to &#8220;HomePod&#8221; in the listing).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141067" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141067" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2141067" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg 1894w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141067" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>This being a rumor roundup, we&#8217;ll point the compelling possibility that it might be something larger &#8212; perhaps a more unifying home operating system designed to work with existing and forthcoming Apple home products. Perhaps something that integrates a bit more closely with tvOS. A longstanding rumor centers around a new Apple TV device, but so far we&#8217;ve not seen a lot of confirmation on that front.</p>
<p>Other rumors involve a new Mac Mini (though we just saw a refresh late last year). Rumors around <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/beats-studio-buds/">Beats Studio Buds </a>are enticing as well. After all, when LeBron is seen <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/26/lebron-james-beats-studio-buds/">sporting your unannounced hardware</a>, people are going to talk. Traditionally, however, Apple has opted to let the Beats team do its own announcements, saving these big events for its own self-branded audio products like AirPods.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M8szlSa-8o">There’s no crying in baseball</a>, and there are certainly no shortcuts in building a successful startup. But, thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?promo=5reasonspost">TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing and Fundraising</a> on July 8-9, you don’t have to reinvent the freakin’ wheel.</p>
<p>This two-day bootcamp offers early-stage founders (pre-seed through Series A) access to the startup ecosystem’s leading experts and top investors. They’ll host a series of interactive Q&amp;A sessions focused on essential topics, like pitch development, fundraising, brand building, growth marketing and more. Take <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?promo=5reasonspost#eb734612-27f1-4c57-96ec-246fab3228a8">a peek at the agenda</a>.</p>
<p>Here are just some of the many reasons to carve time out of your hectic schedule and attend this all-virtual event.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>1. Because your contemporaries say so</h2>
<p>&#8220;Early Stage 2020 was a great opportunity to hear seasoned startup founders talking about their experiences and how they dealt with many of the same challenges I faced then and am going through now. It’s like a mini masterclass in entrepreneurship.&#8221; — Ashley Barrington, founder, MarketPearl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sequoia Capital’s session, &#8216;Start with Your Customer,&#8217; looked at the benefits of storytelling and creating customer personas. I took the idea to my team and we’ve implemented storytelling to help onboard new customers. That one session alone has transformed my business.&#8221; — Chloe Leaaetoa, founder, Socicraft.</p>
<h2>2. Connect with community and opportunity</h2>
<p>Founding a startup can be a frustrating and sometimes lonely affair. It helps to bounce ideas off other early founders who know exactly what you’re going through. You never know where those communal connections might lead, and a fat <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolodex">Rolodex</a> is always good for business.</p>
<p>Make ad hoc connections in our virtual platform’s chat feature. Want a more strategic tool? CrunchMatch, our AI-powered networking platform, simplifies finding and scheduling 1:1 meetings with the people who align with your business goals.</p>
<h2>3. Bust out the breakout sessions</h2>
<p>You&#8217;ll learn a ton about growing your business at interactive Q&amp;A sessions like these:</p>
<p><strong>Iterating More Effectively with Feedback:</strong> A great product alone is not enough. To be successful, early-stage companies need to optimize all phases of the customer journey. This session will include tactics, best practices and case studies on how to use customer feedback to understand customer needs, craft more compelling messaging and improve all phases of the customer experience.</p>
<p><strong><span class="schedule-item__title">Growth Hacking, Product Fit and Pricing: </span></strong><span class="schedule-item__description">Superhuman’s Rahul Vohra shares strategies for early-stage founders on topics like hacking your way to product-market fit, driving user sign-ups without breaking the bank on paid ads and identifying your product’s price point.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="schedule-item__title">How to Determine Your Earned Media Strategy: </span></strong><span class="schedule-item__description">Learn how to build an effective earned media strategy for your startup, building on Rebecca Reeve Henderson&#8217;s deep expertise developing effective communications programs for some of the top business software companies in the world. Earned media, aka the kind of exposure you get from a TechCrunch article, is a key element of any startup’s marketing strategy, but it’s also one of the trickiest things to get right. Rebecca has worked with companies ranging from Slack, to Shopify, to Zapier, to Canva and many more, helping craft effective earned media strategies in one of the most difficult areas of all: B2B SaaS.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#eb734612-27f1-4c57-96ec-246fab3228a8">And even more&#8230;.</a></p>
<h2>4. Pitch at TC Early Stage</h2>
<p>Day two is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/applications-for-the-tc-early-stage-pitch-off-july-are-open/">all about the pitch-off</a>. Ten early-stage startups will take the virtual stage and deliver their best five-minute pitch to a global audience of investors, TC editors, press and event attendees. A five-minute Q&amp;A with the judges follows that pitch. Want a shot? Get moving because you need to <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/N4qcpnuC">apply here</a> by June 7!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For all that&#8217;s said about fundraising and working alongside investors, rarely do we get to see founders and their investors in candid conversation with one another. Extra Crunch Live is changing that. On the weekly live show, we sit down with founders and the VCs who funded them to talk about how they came together on the deal, what stood out about the other party that led to their commitment and how they operate today. We also (usually) take a walk through their early pitch decks to get a feel for how success starts.</p>
<p>On an upcoming episode of <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-emergence-capital-and-retail-zipline?ref=928ff1c911ab">Extra Crunch Live</a>, we&#8217;ll sit down with Emergence&#8217;s Lotti Siniscalco and Retail Zipline&#8217;s Melissa Wong to discuss all that and more. The event goes down on Wednesday, June 23 at 3 p.m. ET/noon PT. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-emergence-capital-and-retail-zipline?ref=928ff1c911ab">You can register to attend right here.</a></p>
<p>Siniscalco is a principal at Emergence Capital, investing in early-stage enterprise software companies. She currently serves on the board of directors at Whistic and High Alpha. Prior to Emergence, she was an investor in financial services and technology at Advent International, a PE firm, and led diligence for Ribbit Capital (also fintech focused) before that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In other words, she&#8217;s an expert in fintech and can bring a wealth of wisdom to our conversation around fundraising and startup growth.</p>
<p>Melissa Wong, on the other hand, has spent 10 years in retail communications at Old Navy. It was here that she realized a problem that Zipline Retail, a retail communication and store execution platform, could solve and set out on her own venture.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live also features the ECL Pitch-off, where startups in the audience can virtually &#8220;raise their hand&#8221; to pitch their startup live on our stream. Our expert guests will give their feedback on each pitch. If you want to throw your hat in the ring, you have to show up.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is accessible to everyone, but only Extra Crunch members can access the content on demand. We do these every week, so there are scores of episodes across a wide variety of startup sectors in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">ECL Library</a>. It&#8217;s but one of many reasons to become an Extra Crunch member. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/">Join here.</a></p>
