										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Elizabeth Holmes&#8217; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/elizabeth-holmes-verdict-guilty-theranos-fraud/">fraud trial</a> has been the talk of the town (both in Silicon Valley and, you know, on Twitter). The four-month trial was so popular that the journalists who covered it had to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/28/reader-center/holmes-trial-coverage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wake up at 3 A.M.</a> to make sure they could get a seat in the courtroom and do their jobs. Too many curious onlookers and fans of John Carreyrou&#8217;s tell-all &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/16/in-bad-blood-a-pedestrian-tale-of-heuristics-and-lies/">Bad Blood</a>&#8221; wanted to witness tech history for themselves.</p>
<p>One of those curious onlookers was <a href="https://daniellebaskin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Danielle Baskin</a>, a San Francisco-based artist who often pokes fun at tech culture through elaborate pranks (like <a href="https://bluecheckhomes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue Check Homes</a>) that sometimes turn into actual companies (like <a href="https://brandedfruit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Branded Fruit</a>). She arrived at the courthouse in San Jose with a suitcase in tow, selling bootleg Holmes merch: blonde wigs, red lipstick, black turtlenecks and blood energy drinks.</p>

<p>&mdash; Danielle Baskin (@djbaskin) <a href="https://twitter.com/djbaskin/status/1463213116943060997?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>It was a joke, mocking the absurdity of the fact that someone on trial for fraud has &#8220;stans&#8221; who call themselves &#8220;<a href="https://www.insider.com/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-court-fans-holmies-girl-boss-fraud-2021-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Holmies</a>.&#8221; But as Baskin watched Holmes&#8217; third day of testimony, she shared a key insight about how Theranos got so out of control.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming out of the Holmes trial, I think one of my biggest pieces of advice to startup founders is to have friends,&#8221; Baskin <a href="https://twitter.com/djbaskin/status/1463653213911932929" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> after court adjourned. &#8220;You need people in your life you enjoy hanging out with that say things like &#8216;lol what are you talking about&#8217; or &#8216;that&#8217;s a bad idea&#8217; when you say weird shit.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Smoke and mirrors</h2>
<p>In his opening statement of the case, federal prosecutor Robert Leach described how Holmes constructed a company with a $10 billion valuation based on technology that was dangerously faulty, at best. He said that one of Holmes&#8217; techniques was to rely on &#8220;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/09/08/elizabeth-holmes-was-well-aware-of-theranos-problems-but-went-to-great-lengths-to-deceive-investors-prosecution-says/?sh=6509b3aa294d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">false and misleading</a>&#8221; media coverage of Theranos to secure funding from investors. Holmes was on the cover of Fortune, Forbes and Inc. Magazine, and she was celebrated as one of TIME&#8217;s 100 Most Influential People in 2015, lauded as a &#8220;tech visionary.&#8221; It made sense that people believed her vision when so many powerful people and institutions said she was the next Steve Jobs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When I was introduced to Elizabeth by [former Secretary of State] George Shultz, her plan sounded like an undergraduate’s dream. I told her she had only two prospects: total failure or vast success. There would be no middle ground,&#8221; Henry Kissinger <a href="https://time.com/collection-post/3822734/elizabeth-holmes-2015-time-100/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> in the TIME 100 blurb about Holmes. &#8220;Elizabeth accepted only one option: making a difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kissinger went on to call Holmes a &#8220;formidable advocate&#8221; who was &#8220;on the verge of achieving her vision.&#8221; But already, a level of uncertainty bubbled around Theranos. &#8220;Others will judge the technical aspects of Theranos, but the social implications are vast,&#8221; Kissinger wrote in the final line of the blurb.</p>
<p>Holmes was surrounded by hype &#8212; investors like George Shultz treated her like another grandchild. So when his grandson Tyler Shultz, who worked at Theranos, told him that he suspected Holmes was lying about the efficacy of Theranos&#8217; technology, the senior Shultz didn&#8217;t believe him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Elizabeth is a very, very charismatic person,&#8221; Tyler Shultz said to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/tyler-shultz-reacts-to-elizabeth-holmes-verdict/#x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBS News</a> this week. &#8220;When she speaks to you, she makes you feel like you are the most important person in her world in that moment. She almost has this reality distortion field around her that people can just get sucked into.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Isolation and abuse</h2>
<p>Tyler Shultz became the first whistleblower for Theranos, but at great personal and financial cost &#8212; in his audio-memoir &#8220;Thicker than Water,&#8221; he discussed being threatened by high-profile lawyers like David Boies and being followed by <a href="https://twitter.com/johncarreyrou/status/1435410977915170818?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">private investigators</a>. But Shultz told a brief, yet poignant anecdote in his memoir about attending family dinners with his grandfather, who always invited Holmes and even hosted her thirtieth birthday party.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a weird situation where my parents kept telling [Holmes] to invite her parents, and they just kind of assumed that she did, and then my grandparents were talking to Elizabeth&#8217;s parents on the phone, and Elizabeth&#8217;s parents were completely unaware she was having a thirtieth birthday party, so it didn&#8217;t seem she was very close with her parents at all,&#8221; Shultz recalled. Throughout the trial, Holmes was usually seen clutching her mom&#8217;s hand &#8212; but per Shultz&#8217;s memory, they weren&#8217;t all that close at the time of her crimes.</p>
<p>Shultz goes on to describe the attendees of her birthday party: He says that he and Holmes&#8217; brother were the only people under 30, and the next youngest person was Theranos COO Sunny Balwani, who was almost 50 &#8212; he met Holmes when she was 18 and he was 37. They dated in secret for more than 10 years, unbeknownst to most Theranos employees and investors. Holmes moved in with Balwani in 2005, soon after she dropped out of Stanford.</p>
<p>&#8220;He impacted everything about who I was and I don’t fully understand that,&#8221; Holmes testified.</p>
<p>Holmes tearfully explained in court that Balwani sexually and emotionally abused her throughout their relationship. She said that he controlled what she ate, when she slept and how she behaved.</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me that I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing in business, that my convictions were wrong, that he was astonished by my mediocrity, and that if I followed my instincts I was going to fail,&#8221; Holmes said on the stand.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Elizabeth Holmes&#39;s daily schedule</p>
<p>Circa 2005–2009 <a href="https://t.co/hhWUBHhpbe">pic.twitter.com/hhWUBHhpbe</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Internal Tech Emails (@TechEmails) <a href="https://twitter.com/TechEmails/status/1465802215927558154?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Her defense submitted as evidence two documents that showed how Holmes was being controlled by Balwani: one was a schedule of her <a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%207731/Trial%20Exh.%207731%20Notes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">daily routine</a>, while another set <a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%207734/Trial%20Exh.%207734%20Notes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">instructions</a> for how she behaved. These guidelines would help her &#8220;become a new Elizabeth,&#8221; Holmes said Balwani told her. One &#8220;non-negotiable&#8221; in her instructions declared that she would never meet with anyone &#8212; especially direct reports &#8212; for longer than five minutes unless she had written down a clear agenda for the meeting. According to the documents, her lifestyle was monastic: waking up at 4 A.M., praying, mediating, exercising, only eating certain foods and never doing anything for recreation.</p>
<p>Holmes&#8217; schedule became a bit of a meme, with some journalists even <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/interactive/2021/elizabeth-holmes-schedule-tried-myself/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trying out her schedule</a> for clicks &#8212; but the reality is much darker than that. It may be difficult to take Holmes&#8217; account of abuse seriously, since she&#8217;s famously a liar and was just convicted of criminal fraud &#8212; but these documents, if legitimate, show a woman whose every action was being controlled by an older partner and business associate.</p>
<p>“He said I needed to spend all of my time on the business, and that I should only be spending time with people who could help the business to be successful, that I needed to be working seven days a week, and I needed to be only doing things that could contribute to making the company successful,&#8221; Holmes testified.</p>
<p>In this context, Shultz&#8217;s account of Holmes thirtieth birthday party makes more sense. She was so committed to building Theranos that she didn&#8217;t seem to have any friends or hobbies, nor did she communicate enough with her parents to invite them to her birthday party.</p>
<p class="p1">“Sunny would get very upset if I was with my family, because he said it was a distraction to the business,&#8221; Holmes said in trial. Her defense referenced a <a href="https://files.cand.uscourts.gov/files/18-CR-258%20USA%20v.%20Holmes/Trial%20Exh.%205387F/Trial%20Exh.%205387F%20Text%20Messages.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">text</a> from Balwani from Thanksgiving weekend in 2013, which said: &#8220;When ur family is here, I feel lonely bcz u spend a total of 10 seconds with me a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe if Holmes had friends to confide in, someone would have told her that she was going too far by stretching the truth with investors, or that it wasn&#8217;t a good idea to deliver unreliable blood test results to patients, even if her boyfriend-slash-COO said to do so. But by design, there was no one for the single-minded entrepreneur to talk to.</p>
<h2>Founders need community</h2>
<p>This is not to exonerate Holmes of her crimes. It can be true that she was abused by a controlling, manipulative, older partner, yet it can simultaneously be true that she committed fraud. Plus, even though she was not convicted of defrauding patients, her lies caused significant distress to Theranos customers who were given alarmingly false blood test results.</p>
<p>We talk a lot about what the tech industry learned from Theranos, but we gloss over something so simple: Startup founders need to have a life outside of their job.</p>
<p>We valorize founders like Elizabeth Holmes who are so dedicated to their vision that they will make huge sacrifices, abandoning their social lives to build their companies. But this isolating form of hustle culture doesn&#8217;t usually breed success &#8212; it breeds burnout at best, and millions of dollars of criminal fraud at worst.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a startup founder, you&#8217;re probably not the next Elizabeth Holmes. But if you just do normal things like, I don&#8217;t know, see a gosh darn movie with some friends (COVID permitting), maybe you&#8217;ll spare yourself from making some short-sighted mistakes.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Mergers and acquisitions are notoriously tricky to navigate from a leadership and culture perspective. They require a thoughtful approach to working with a new CEO and joining teams as one workforce — a journey familiar to us and recently acquired Auth0.</p>
<p>Okta and Auth0 have their share of differences — we’re enterprise-focused, to start, while Auth0 is more developer-first — but shaping the future of identity has always been a shared goal. Since the acquisition closed earlier this year, the CEO of Auth0, Eugenio Pace, and I have come a long way in uncovering the best ways to embrace our differences, unite our teams and learn the ins and outs of each other’s leadership styles.</p>
<p>Our journey so far offers lessons for other CEOs navigating partnerships with a new co-CEO or other C-suite leaders post-acquisition. Here are my top takeaways from working together during the past year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254698" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Do the prep work upfront</h2>
<p>It’s worthwhile to put pen to paper on your company’s vision ahead of an acquisition — it helps you solidify your goals in writing that you can then easily share. Before our acquisition, I wrote a long paper mapping out my five-year vision for Okta. While articulating Okta’s vision is a big part of my role as CEO, I had never laid it out in this type of written format (which turned out longer than I intended — 15 pages!).</p>
<p>The exercise allowed me to reflect on Okta’s growth over the past 12-plus years and what’s to come.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Our employees probably think we sound like broken records on these integration priorities, but aligning on values has helped promote clarity and consistency across our teams during a time of change.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>Eugenio found it helpful in understanding my viewpoint as we started the process of learning how we’d best collaborate and bring our two companies together. He’d actually drafted a similar document outlining his view of success if we were to join forces. These vision documents have helped us align our goals and illustrate how we intend to scale and capitalize on our massive market opportunity.</p>
<h2>Identify common ground in how you lead</h2>
<p>With any new C-suite hire or partner, it helps to build a relationship by finding common ground and shared values. Eugenio and I knew we both placed equal importance on implementing the same “north star” guidelines for the integration: sustainable growth, putting our customers first, continued innovation, protection of our brands and empowerment of our teams.</p>
<p>Our employees probably think we sound like broken records on these integration priorities, but aligning on values has helped promote clarity and consistency across our teams during a time of change.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Along with our mirrored core culture values, Eugenio and I share similarities in our leadership styles and personalities that complement each other. We’re introverts, and we even have the same Myers-Briggs score (INTP), translating into a natural leadership chemistry. We both take accountable, dependable leadership seriously and understand each other’s work styles. Eugenio has a deep product and technology background, so we’re able to get really technical when discussing and making decisions about the future of our joint companies. Our shared background also enables us to effectively share and receive feedback with each other.</p>
<p>Ultimately, understanding your new partner’s unique style and how you’re similar (and different) can help you work together more efficiently, make faster decisions and build quick momentum.</p>
<h2>Tap the strengths of both teams</h2>
<p>Acquisitions signal that a significant threshold of success has been crossed for companies on either side of the deal. To acquire or be acquired, companies must be doing <em>something</em> right and it’s essential to identify the strengths within both organizations that have reaped such rewards. Combining the elements of each team that fosters an overall synergy while also protecting the unique areas is key when joining forces.</p>
<p>For example, Auth0’s collaborative culture has already helped Okta reignite its startup spirit. It’s no easy task maintaining the same scrappy energy from the early days when we were pursuing our first 10 customers (we’re now over 14,000), but Auth0 has introduced a new perspective on innovation while still allowing room to retain our respective brands and individual strengths. Auth0 is a brand beloved by developers, and its remote-first nature has also helped us navigate a dynamic work environment this year. Leveraging the strengths of the acquired company helps push your growth forward in new areas.</p>
<h2>When in doubt, over-communicate</h2>
<p>In the early stages of an acquisition, success depends on intentional and frequent communication with your new partner and team. Keep meetings and check-ins frequent, both with new leaders and with your broader employee base.</p>
<p>This year, we’ve regularly held full company and integrated all-hands meetings, and we’ve made these meetings intentional and transparent. We format the agendas around decisions we’ve made, things that won’t change and what’s undecided as a way to keep employees in the know while staying honest about what we’re still figuring out. In any acquisition, discussions on office spaces, merged benefits and team integration timelines will inevitably arise, and giving employees an open line to ask questions and share concerns goes a long way in creating clarity and building trust.</p>
<p>Acquisitions can test your team’s strength and threaten existing close-knit cultures, so it takes purposeful communication to keep everyone on the same page and working toward the same goal.</p>
<p>It’s worth the energy spent to make the partnership successful; Eugenio and I have worked together for less than a year, and we’ve already benefited greatly from each other’s perspectives and background as we move forward in this next chapter.</p>

Parr looks ahead at what&#8217;s coming down the pike, including web3 and NFTs, and gives his advice on how your startup should proceed.</p>
<p>Should online sellers start planning now to start stocking NFTs? Parr noted that Shopify is testing a pilot program for Shopify Plus customers that helps them sell non-fungible tokens via its platform, but he still suggests a wait-and-see approach:</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless you’re deep in web3-land or have a large enough budget for brand experimentation, you should probably wait until the technology becomes more mature or only dip your toe in the water to start,&#8221; writes Parr. &#8220;A great NFT launch requires a lot more work than making a JPEG and putting it on the blockchain.&#8221;</p>

<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Anish Khadiya, <a href="https://www.itilite.com/">itilite</a><br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>&#8220;Ridhi and team 91Ninjas bring in good domain knowledge, high-quality thinking, and focused execution. We chose them for their expertise, disciplined approach, and excellent work ethics. Thanks to team 91NInjas, our inbound marketing engine has picked up good momentum. After coming onboard, they rapidly kick-started work on multiple fronts. In particular, we witnessed good traction on the social media and content front. We saw a good surge in organic traffic on blogs and our search appearance on domain-specific keywords has improved a lot.&#8221;</p>

<strong>Recommended by: </strong>Udit Dhawan, Dropshop Network Private Limited, https://www.brandsofbharat.in/ <strong>(</strong><strong>UDIT provided this link which goes to a different site than the company he works for, not sure if we should include both?)</strong><br />
<strong>Testimonial: </strong>&#8220;I came across some social posts done by 91Ninjas for other startups and was impressed by their work. They had a very different approach to social and it appealed to me. They are a team of good thinkers and know how to tell brand stories and engage users. They hear you out, understand the business goal and then work backward to craft a custom strategy that can help you achieve your goals. Their logical approach, seamless execution, and getting work done attitude makes them stand out from others. For startups, they are a good choice given the way they work (just like your internal team) and the value they bring in.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for January 7, 2021! It’s Friday and the snow is falling like the dickens in my neck of the woods. But it was no snow day in the tech world. Not at <em>all</em>. In fact, one venture firm raised 10 figures of capital today. Can you guess who?</p>
<p>Before we jump in, today’s TechCrunch staff highlight is <a href="https://twitter.com/gracedenhall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grace Mendenhall</a>, a member of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Equity team</a> who is also a documentary film editor. And she’s frankly just the best. Now, the news! —<a href="http://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255222" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/andreessen-horowitz-raises-9b-in-new-capital-for-venture-growth-bio-funds/"><strong>a16z reloads with $9B in new capital:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The venture capital money arms race continued this week with news that Andreessen Horowitz has put together $9 billion to invest in venture deals, growth deals and biotech more specifically. As TechCrunch notes, the resulting dollar figure is a boost on the group’s last trio of similar funds. There is, it appears, an infinite capital appetite in today’s startup market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/roblox-transition-china-luobulesi-tencent/"><strong>Roblox pulls Chinese app:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Five months after launching with Tencent in China, Roblox’s LuoBuLeSi was taken down. What happened? It may be that Roblox has some work to do on the data side of its service, something that it hinted at in a statement. Regardless, the move is yet another example of how hard it is for non-Chinese companies to build and sell digital products in the country.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/india-hits-google-with-antitrust-investigation-over-alleged-abuse-in-news-aggregation/"><strong>India to investigate Google:</strong></a> In the wake of industry complaints from news groups, India’s Competition Commission “said Friday that Google dominates certain online services and its initial view is that Google has broken the local antitrust laws,” TechCrunch reports. Given how big and lucrative the Indian market is, this is not good news for Mountain View.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we jump into all the startup news of the day, TechCrunch has a little treat for you. We got veteran venture capitalist Matt Murphy on the phone as 2021 came to a close <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/how-todays-startup-market-isnt-like-1999-and-what-you-need-to-raise-a-hot-series-a/">to chat about prior tech booms, prior tech busts and what he sees as the strengths and weaknesses</a> of today’s venture game. It’s a great weekend read.</p>
<p>And now, the news:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/pendulum-raises-5-9m-to-help-organizations-track-harmful-narratives/"><strong>Pendulum raises $5.9M for narrative tracking:</strong></a> This is a fun one, as the company’s target market is utterly new to me. Per our reporting, Pendulum “helps companies, governments and other organizations track harmful narratives on social media platforms and elsewhere on the web.” I guess you and I currently do this by reading lots of tweets, but seeing a company build software for it makes good sense.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/peter-reinhardt-leaves-twilio-to-run-his-carbon-mitigation-startup/"><strong>Peter Reinhardt leaves Twilio:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Remember when Twilio bought Segment for $3.2 billion? It also bought Segment’s CEO, Peter Reinhardt, as part of the deal. Now, however, the exec is leaving to “be full-time CEO at Charm Industrial, a carbon mitigation startup he co-founded in 2018,” Ron Miller reports. I can’t quite connect <em>charm</em> and <em>carbon</em>, but we’ll keep an eye out for what the startup does next.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/avataar-raises-45-million-to-improve-consumer-shopping-experience-with-life-sized-3d-product-evaluation/"><strong>Avataar raises $45M for “life-sized 3D product evaluation&#8221;:</strong></a> No, this is not &#8220;Avatar,&#8221; like the movie. It’s Avataar, a U.S.- and India-based startup that helps consumers “visualize products in real-life size and feel in their living room” using their phones. Given that we all want to buy more stuff online, but it’s not always easy to picture a new footstool in situ, I like what the company is up to. Unsurprisingly, Avataar is working with e-commerce brands in categories like furniture.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/nigerian-ethical-credit-recovery-fintech-bfree-secures-1-7m-expands-to-asia-europe-south-america-and-across-africa/"><strong>Bfree wants to update the irksome business of credit collections:</strong></a> If you have ever gotten a call from a person who thinks that you owe them or someone that they represent money, you may have harkened back to how much more fun it was to get a root canal. Bfree, a “Nigerian credit management fintech,” as TechCrunch puts it, is working to build something that it considers to be more ethical debt collection. The company just raised $1.7 million and is busy recruiting in 16 markets, we report.</li>
<li><strong>From the CES Beat: </strong>TechCrunch’s coverage of the great consumer electronics confab continued today, with posts up on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/startups-at-ces-showed-that-age-tech-can-help-everyone/">the promises of elder tech</a> and, well, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/at-ces-2022-metaverses-metaversed-the-metaverse/">all things metaverse, good and bad</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need <em>even more </em>startup news and notes and analysis this weekend, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/can-you-build-centralized-islands-in-a-decentralized-ocean/">the Equity team has you covered</a>.</p>

<p>This is a fantastic time to launch a startup, but if you&#8217;re trying to grow one — well, winter is coming.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve already noted the impacts of new data regulations and consumers&#8217; growing desire for more privacy, but here&#8217;s another log to toss on the bad news fire: As a percentage of company revenue, marketing budgets plummeted from 11% in 2020 to 6.4% last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the lowest proportion allocated to marketing in the history of Gartner’s Annual CMO Spend Survey,&#8221; the research company reported.</p>
<p>Rebecca Lynn, co-founder and general partner at Canvas Ventures, has had dozens of conversations with early-stage founders in recent months.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/after-talking-to-marketing-leaders-for-a-year-heres-my-advice-for-ceos/">In a TechCrunch+ guest post,</a> she covers the &#8220;downward pressure on the efficiency of marketing dollars&#8221; and shares several strategies that are producing results — as well as some &#8220;crazy&#8221; ideas &#8220;that seemed ridiculous at the time.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/apple-fitness-introduces-new-collections-feature-and-time-to-run-series/">Apple keeps working on its fitness product:</a> </strong>TechCrunch has news up today regarding Apple’s fitness product, the somewhat lamely named Fitness+. What’s new? Collections, which we write are ”curated series of workouts and meditations” that are targeted at a particular goal. Also new is what’s called “Time to Run,” an “audio running experience,” as we put it. Why doesn’t Apple just buy Peloton? I don’t know.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/twitter-spaces-continues-testing-podcast-like-features/"><strong>When does a Twitter Space become a podcast?</strong></a><strong> </strong>We’re going to find out. Twitter is working on recording its live-audio product, called Spaces. And the social network is saying that it will include replay analytics. Which is super cool? Twitter’s product team is seemingly bringing its really solid 2021 product cadence into the new year.</li>
<li>And finally, from CES, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/smarter-powerful-electric-scooters-bikes-ces-2022/"><strong>roundup of electric mobility two-wheelers</strong></a> for everyone out there who lives in a city that hasn’t given up its soul to provide more parking for lazy folks.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Long gone are the days when CES actually stood for “Consumer Electronics Show” &#8212; the CTA has seen to that in its various small print. I recommend you check out our recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/30/the-best-tech-of-ces-2012/">best of CES 2012</a> story for a look back on the days when things like smartphones took center stage at the event. Mobile World Congress has taken some of the wind out of CES’s sails, along with an increased push for companies to debut flagships at their own events.</p>
<p>This year we got, what, Samsung budget-flagship and a preview of the latest OnePlus device from a parallel event? Certainly things weren’t helped along by the fact that LG and HTC &#8212; which were both involved in the show in some form &#8212; are either mostly or entirely out of the smartphone game. And Huawei, which had a major presence at the show a few years back, won’t be participating in CES any time soon.</p>
<p>Much of that vacuum has been filled by transportation. Over the past decade, CES has transformed into a major automotive show, as carmakers look to prove to the world that they’re on the bleeding edge of tech, from autonomy to in-car systems to sending robots to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/at-ces-2022-metaverses-metaversed-the-metaverse/">Martian metaverse</a>. Certainly the show kept <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/07/ces-2022-best-weirdest-car-tech/">Kirsten and Rebecca very busy this week</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255297" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces/">CES</a> continues to be a major event on the consumer hardware side of things, as well, even if there aren’t as many phones as there once were. It’s still a major showcase for PCs, connected health, smart home gadgets, accessories and even robotics. It’s also a fascinating look into how the industry is evolving. Take fitness &#8212; the sheer volume of wearables has reduced, though companies are experimenting with newer form factors like rings. Meanwhile, there’s been a surge in companies looking to take on the likes of Peloton and Mirror.</p>

<p>At what was a pretty subdued showing for wearables, Garmin managed to grab some headlines with its hybrid Sport smartwatch. Hybrid smartwatches have been an admittedly mixed bag over the years, but Garmin has proven to be a surprisingly strong brand in the wearables category. And the <a href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/newsroom/press-release/ces/stylish-vivomove-sport-hybrid-smartwatch-by-garmin-is-a-timeless-blend-of-fashion-and-function/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vivomove Sport</a> is a pretty great looking watch, with a clean design that will appeal to those put off by flashier smartwatches.</p>
<p>Trackers had a bit of moment, in the wake of the popularity of products like Tile and Apple AirTags. This year the former got another PC partner, in Lenovo, as the <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/thinkpad-x1s-strengthen-uncompromised-premium-laptop-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ThinkPad X1</a> got Tile tracking support, allowing users to find their lost laptop for up to 14 days, even when powered down. Targus, meanwhile, built Apple’s Find My support directly into<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/targus-named-as-ces-2022-innovation-awards-honoree-for-new-sustainable-backpack-equipped-with-find-my-technology-301421704.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> its latest backpack</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>But Chipolo gets the nod here with the introduction of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/chipolo-takes-on-tile-with-a-new-lost-wallet-tracker-that-works-with-apples-find-my/">CARD</a>. The device, which also supports Find My, is slightly larger than a credit card and designed to live in a wallet, so you get an alert whenever you leave the product behind. I currently own one AirTag, which I use for my keys. As someone who has misplaced his wallet more than once in my adult life, I’d say this is a fairly compelling use case that would make me consider shelling out for another.</p>

<p>Devin dropped the AXE11000 Tri-Band Wi-Fi 6E Router at the end of his whole <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/look-upon-my-ces-2022-work-from-home-setup-and-despair/">what my work from home set up would look like if I was independently wealthy roundup</a> (paraphrasing here). This thing is pretty wild &#8212; especially as far as the world of routers go. The system features motorized antenna that adjust to get a stronger signal. No word on price there, but you’re likely going to pay for that luxury on top of TP-Link’s already high base price. But can you really put a price tag on faster Wi-Fi?</p>

<p>Shout-out to what’s likely to be a far more reasonably price remote accessory. If nothing else, Anker knows how to keep costs down; $220 will get you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/anker-debuts-a-2k-webcam-with-built-in-lighting-speakers-and-more-for-220/">the Video Bar,</a> which is a kind of all-in-one webcam solution. You get a 2K camera with AI-based picture framing, coupled with a built-in lightbar and speakers. It’s not going to replace more advanced studio setups (or, for that matter, the Opal), but it’s a solid plug and play solution for those looking to up their home video game on the (relatively) cheap.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, I wrote a lot of words about CES’s evolution as a robotics show. One of the biggest sticking points there is the general lack of viable home robotics, beyond the Roomba and an army of fellow robotic vacuums. I was happy to get a better look at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/labrador-set-to-deliver-a-robotic-helping-hand-to-homes-in-2023/">Labrador’s system this week</a>, however, because it addresses a very real need &#8212; specifically those with limited mobility looking to remain independent. The system is effectively a mobile helping hand for the home.</p>

<p>It’s not CES without fun new form factors, and the <a href="https://press.asus.com/PressReleases/p/ASUS-Presents-Incredible-Unfolds-at-CES-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asus Zenbook 17 Fold OLED</a> takes the cake by a mile this year, adopting the foldable phone form factor into a full laptop. What’s most stunning about the thing is that the company actually plans to release the thing. I suspect I’m not alone in assuming this thing was just a concept the first time I saw a render, but Asus is planning to release the system in Q2 of this year. So we’ll see soon enough how close the commercial product looks to these shots.</p>

<p>Samsung skipped its usual sensory bombardment this year. There weren’t any robots, just bespoke washing machines and budget phones, but it did manage to sneak in a fun projector, of all things. Despite their relatively limited appeal, companies keep trying to make projectors happen, and at the very least, <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-launches-the-freestyle-a-portable-screen-for-entertainment-wherever-you-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one</a> is small, well-built and looks good. It’s also $900, which means it&#8217;s likely destined to stay in its niche.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It has somehow, inexplicably, impossibly been almost 10 years since the original Oculus Rift hit Kickstarter.</p>
<p>A decade of development later, VR headsets have gotten better and better — but it&#8217;s safe to say, at this point, that VR&#8217;s adoption will be … gradual. If we&#8217;re all destined to end up with headsets (be they VR, AR or some mix of the two) strapped to our faces, it&#8217;ll be less about one-big-thing* and more the result of a thousand tiny steps. A Beat Saber here; a Supernatural there. Incrementally better/lighter/faster headsets. Maybe folks get used to using headsets for training purposes at work. Maybe everyone suddenly agrees on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/at-ces-2022-metaverses-metaversed-the-metaverse/">what a metaverse is</a>.</p>
<p>This bit-by-bit advancement held true this year at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces/">CES</a>. There was plenty of VR/AR news, none of it earth shattering — but each another step in the progression.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255273" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><em>(* the one potential meteor strike, of course, being if Apple does what it loves to do and swoops in late, drops its version and turns the category on its head.

<p>Let&#8217;s recap the biggest VR/AR bits from the show.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve known for a while now that Sony has been working on a next-gen headset for the PlayStation 5, following up on the PS VR headset it released in 2016. But beyond a kind of light &#8220;We&#8217;re working on it!&#8221; announcement back in early 2021 and some details about the controllers a few months later, they hadn&#8217;t shared many specifics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>They&#8217;re still keeping some cards close, but they shared a few more details on what&#8217;s now officially known <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/sony-psvr2-ps5-first-details-ces/">as the PS VR2</a>. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;ll have a resolution of 2000&#215;2040 per eye.</li>
<li>It&#8217;ll have a wider field of view than the first-gen headset, at 110 degrees versus 96.</li>
<li>It&#8217;ll have a refresh rate of 90/120 Hz.</li>
<li>It&#8217;ll be able to track the motion of your eyes, potentially allowing you to do stuff like highlight interface elements just by looking at them.</li>
<li>It&#8217;ll support foveated rendering, which is a fancy way of saying it can use processing power more efficiently by prioritizing the rendering of whatever&#8217;s in the center of your vision.</li>
<li>They&#8217;re building new controllers for it (pictured below) with finger detection and the PS5&#8217;s mind-bending adaptive triggers.</li>

<p>What&#8217;ll the headset look like? Unknown! When will it actually ship? TBD! But with the PS VR being one of the few headsets to even kind of rival the <s>Oculus</s> Meta Quest in terms of ease of use, it&#8217;s nice to see Sony continuing to build here.</p>
<h2>HTC Vive wrist tracker</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2255294" style="width: 681px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255294" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2255294 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/HTC-Vive.jpg" alt="" width="671" height="377" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/HTC-Vive.jpg 671w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/HTC-Vive.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/HTC-Vive.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/HTC-Vive.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 671px) 100vw, 671px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255294" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> HTC Vive</p></div></p>
<p>What&#8217;s the best way to handle input in VR? Most of the popular headsets have settled on some sort of controller in each hand. What if you just make your <em>hand</em> the controller, instead?</p>
<p>Hand tracking isn&#8217;t a brand new idea, of course. Companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/once-poised-to-kill-the-mouse-and-keyboard-leap-motion-plays-its-final-hand/">have come and gone</a> with hand tracking as their primary focus.</p>
<p>But HTC&#8217;s approach here is a bit different. Instead of relying entirely on cameras, they&#8217;re hoping you&#8217;ll strap sensor-packed bands to each wrist to help the system track what the cameras can&#8217;t see — like when one hand is obscuring the other, or you&#8217;ve got your arm back behind you for a golf swing. The company also demonstrated the sensors working while attached to other objects, like ping pong paddles and a NERF gun.</p>
<p>The company says the sensors should start shipping later this year for $129. One catch? For now, at least, it&#8217;ll only work with HTC&#8217;s Vive Focus 3 headset.</p>
<h2>Shiftall MeganeX</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2255293" style="width: 1052px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255293" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2255293 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/meganex.jpg" alt="" width="1042" height="633" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/meganex.jpg 1042w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/meganex.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/meganex.jpg?resize=300,182 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/meganex.jpg?resize=768,467 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/meganex.jpg?resize=680,413 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/meganex.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1042px) 100vw, 1042px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255293" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Shiftall</p></div></p>
<p>VR headsets have gotten a whole lot sleeker over the years, but they&#8217;re still pretty beefy. How much smaller can they really get, though?</p>
<p>Panasonic subsidiary Shiftall has been working on an &#8220;ultra-lightweight, ultra-high-resolution&#8221; headset called the Meganex. With speakers built into the frames and a 1.3&#8243; (2560&#215;2560) display for each eye, they end up looking more like a massive pair of steampunk sunglasses than a headset. While designed to be lightweight and foldable, don&#8217;t expect to move around <em>too</em> much in these ones — you&#8217;ll need to attach them to computer via USB-C to do the heavy graphical lifting.</p>
<p>Shiftall says these should ship this year for &#8220;less than $900.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Microsoft partners with Qualcomm for AR chips</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2255291" style="width: 1219px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255291" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2255291 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qualcomm.jpg" alt="" width="1209" height="500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qualcomm.jpg 1209w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qualcomm.jpg?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qualcomm.jpg?resize=300,124 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qualcomm.jpg?resize=768,318 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qualcomm.jpg?resize=680,281 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qualcomm.jpg?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1209px) 100vw, 1209px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255291" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Qualcomm</p></div></p>
<p>Microsoft already uses Qualcomm chips for their HoloLens headsets, but the companies made things a bit more official this week. At Qualcomm&#8217;s keynote it was announced that the two will work together to develop chips built specifically for use in AR headsets, with said chips supporting each of their augmented reality development platforms (Microsoft Mesh and Snapdragon Spaces.)</p>
<h2>Nvidia Omniverse</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2253077" style="width: 1839px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253077" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2253077 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg" alt="" width="1829" height="1030" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg 1829w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-04-082129.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1829px) 100vw, 1829px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2253077" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nvida</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not flashy hardware, but it&#8217;s potentially important on the software side of things: Nvidia this week opened up Omniverse, its collection of tools for helping 3D content creators work together in real time.</p>
<p>Writes Frederic Lardinois in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/nvidia-expands-its-omniverse/">his post on the news</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Omniverse</a> is Nvidia’s platform for allowing creators, designers and engineers to collaboratively build virtual worlds. It’s the company’s platform that brings together design tools and assets from first- and third-party applications into a single hardware and software ecosystem. Until now, Omniverse and the various Nvidia tools that support it were in beta, but at CES today, the company took off the beta label and made Omniverse generally available to creators.</p></blockquote>
<h2>TCL&#8217;s AR Glasses</h2>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k5m-1PfFA9c?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>This one seems mostly like a concept for now, so … well, don&#8217;t fall in love just yet. But TV/phone/air conditioner maker TCL is dabbling in the AR glasses space, pitching something akin to Google Glass in a package that looks much more like a standard pair of specs. &#8220;Holographic optical waveguide technology&#8221; pushes visuals onto the lens and into your field of view, and their concept video above promises touch-based controls built into the frames.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Baseball is like a laboratory for advanced statistical analysis, and businesses could learn a lot from watching how the sport deals with expanding datasets.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In December 2014 I wrote a post titled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/28/finding-the-elusive-big-wisdom-in-big-data/">Finding the elusive big wisdom in big data</a>. We have made big advances since then in storing, processing and generally handling large volumes of data in a digital context, but humans still have trouble when it comes to reliably finding relevant nuggets that can improve business outcomes. I&#8217;m revisiting the idea to see how far we&#8217;ve come and how far we still have to go.</p>
<p>Baseball is one of the best examples of how data can impact a business. The book and movie <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393324815" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Moneyball&#8221;</a> showed how Oakland Athletics&#8217; GM Billy Beane changed the sport by introducing advanced statistical analysis instead of simply relying on reports from human scouts. Today, baseball is ruled by analysts as much as experienced baseball professionals — but could there be too much data?</p>
<p>Alex Spier writing in the Boston Globe&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/12/25/sports/examining-how-teams-treated-luxury-tax-threshold-baseballs-recently-expired-collective-bargaining-agreement/">Sunday Baseball Notes column</a> recently pointed out that Boston Red Sox Manager Alex Cora will have 11 coaches on staff this year for 26 players. Compare that with Terry Francona in 2011, who had six for 25, and you can see the number has nearly doubled.</p>
<p>Spier attributes this in part to the growing amount of data that teams are collecting, which requires more people to observe, interpret, and implement a plan to leverage. As Spier wrote, &#8220;The result? Several teams now feature three hitting coaches, and staffs keep growing in an effort to distill the mountains of information into a digestible form for the 26 players on a roster.&#8221;</p>

					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Baseball is like a laboratory for advanced statistical analysis, and businesses could learn a lot from watching how the sport deals with expanding datasets.</p>
<p>Companies shovel data into data lakes, tinker with machine learning models, and use this information to make decisions, but they still face fundamental decisions every day that involve their ever-growing mountain of information. Sure, machines and software can help sort it out — indeed, they are getting better at it — but anyone who has dealt with poorly targeted advertising or email marketing knows there&#8217;s much work to be done.</p>

<p>Deepak Jeevankumer, managing director at Dell Technologies Capital, says the difference in play now compared to 2014 is that companies now are focused on getting insights to the people who need it faster. &#8220;Big Data has become less relevant than &#8216;fast data.&#8217; E-commerce shoppers, streaming media consumers, gamers, stock/crypto traders and enterprise marketeers are demanding fast insights and fast knowledge,&#8221; Jeevankumer told me.</p>
<p>He believes data needs to be analyzed at its source while streaming, and in real-time after a query is created, and that startups that create solutions that allow companies (and baseball teams) to do this will be more successful in the long run.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">IBM could be looking to sell the Watson Health division for a mere $1 billion, according to <a href="https://www.axios.com/ibm-tries-to-sell-watson-health-again-82f691a4-ab81-4b2b-a5bb-13a7556c8ef1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an Axios report</a>. The question is why is IBM running away from the healthcare vertical just as it seems to be heating up, and for such a low price?</p>
<p>Just last month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/oracle-snags-cerner-in-28b-mega-deal-to-make-a-big-move-into-healthcare/">Oracle spent $28 billion</a> to buy digital health records company Cerner. Last spring, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">Microsoft spent close to $20 billion</a> to buy Nuance, which is used heavily in the medical industry, boasting 10,000 healthcare customers. That&#8217;s huge money, suggesting that enterprise companies are looking to embrace <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/oracle-joins-microsoft-in-spending-big-to-dominate-healthcare-vertical/">the healthcare vertical</a> and willing to spend big bucks to do it.</p>
<p>IBM <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2909534/ibm-launches-watson-health-global-analytics-cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched Watson Health in April 2015</a> to much fanfare. It was supposed to take Watson, IBM&#8217;s artificial intelligence platform, and put it to work on healthcare problems. The argument went something like this. Even the best doctor can&#8217;t read all of the literature out there, but a computer can do it quickly, and could come up with suggested courses of action to augment the doctor&#8217;s expertise and produce better outcomes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255245" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It then did what IBM does when it focuses on something. It opened <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/10/ibm-watson-health-unit-begins-to-take-shape/">up a fancy headquarters</a> in Cambridge in September that year. It also began announcing partnerships. It checked all the boxes, partnering with the likes of CVS, Apple and Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p>
<p>Then it started buying companies. The first acquisitions were medical data companies, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2015/04/13/ibm-acquires-health-tech-startups-explorys-and-phytel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phytel and Explorys</a>. That was part of a pattern. Next came <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/06/ibm-buying-merge-healthcare-for-1b-to-bring-medical-image-analysis-to-watson-health/">$1 billion for Merge Healthcare</a>, a company that would provide medical imaging data. Later it would make its most expensive purchase, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/18/ibm-acquiring-truven-health-analytics-for-2-6-billion-and-adding-it-to-watson-health/">Truven Health Analytics for $2.6 billion</a>. In total it spent $4 billion, according to reports, which seems kind of modest now compared to what Oracle and Microsoft just spent, but it was a lot of money in 2015 and 2016 when it was gearing up.</p>
<p>All of this was about taking a data-centric approach to feed Watson Health&#8217;s machine learning models. For whatever reason, it didn&#8217;t really work as planned, but it was a big part of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/01/ginni-rometty-leaves-complex-legacy-as-she-steps-away-as-ibm-ceo/"> former CEO Ginni Rometty&#8217;s</a> plan to modernize the company by focusing on areas like cloud and AI.</p>
<p>Rometti was optimistic when she spoke to the <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/07/dont-try-to-protect-the-past" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard Business Review in 2017</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our moon shot is bringing world-class health care to every corner of the world. Some of that is already happening. Watson is being trained by the best cancer centers in the world and then being rolled out across hundreds of hospitals in China and India. Some of those areas have just one oncologist for maybe 1,600 patients. People in those regions have had no chance of getting world-class health care. Now they can, with Watson as an oncology adviser assisting doctors with decision making. And this is just the start.</p></blockquote>
<p>But Rometti <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/30/arvind-krishna-will-replace-ginni-rometty-as-ibm-ceo-in-april/">left in 2019</a>, and her replacement, Arvind Krishna, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/">has different priorities</a>. He <a href="https://www.axios.com/ibm-tries-to-sell-watson-health-again-82f691a4-ab81-4b2b-a5bb-13a7556c8ef1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told Axios</a> that broad healthcare vision might have been too optimistic. That could explain why IBM is looking to get out, Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research tells me.</p>
<p>&#8220;IBM is really focussing on its hybrid cloud strategy. In the process it is trying to get rid of all assets that divert attention and capital, as well as carrying the risk of reputational damage. Watson Health certainly qualifies for all three, so it comes as no surprise that IBM may divest the unit,&#8221; Mueller said.</p>
<p>While IBM will likely continue to pursue healthcare business in other ways across the company, even if it ends up dumping Watson Health, it would have to be considered a failed strategy after pouring so much money into it and getting so little back. Of course, it still qualifies as a rumor, even if it wouldn&#8217;t be a huge surprise to see it come to pass.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The US International Trade Commission has <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/system/files/secretary/fed_reg_notices/337/337_1191_notice01062022sgl.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">agreed</a> with Sonos&#8217; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-07-sonos-sues-google.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">claims</a> that Google had infringed on its speaker and cast patents. It issued its initial decision back in August, and this finalizes its ruling, which prohibits Google from importing products found to have violated Sonos&#8217; intellectual properties. Since Google manufactures its products in China, that means it won&#8217;t be able to gets them shipped to the US when the import ban takes effect in 60 days.</p>
<p>Sonos sued Google in 2020 over five patents, which include one that details a technology allowing wireless speakers to sync with one another. As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/technology/google-sonos-patents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><em>The New York Times</em></a> notes, the products affected include Google&#8217;s Home smart speakers, Pixel phones and computers, as well as Chromecast devices. While Google is facing an import ban, a spokesperson said that the tech giant doesn&#8217;t expect the ruling to interrupt its ability to import and sell devices.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we disagree with today&#8217;s decision, we appreciate that the International Trade Commission has approved our modified designs,&#8221; the spokesperson told <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/google-violated-sonos-patents" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><em>Protocol</em></a>. &#8220;We will seek further review and continue to defend ourselves against Sonos&#8217; frivolous claims about our partnership and intellectual property.&#8221; The commission didn&#8217;t challenge those alternative designs in its final decision, which means Google can implement them.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255254" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In fact, the Nest team has recently <a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Upcoming-Speaker-Group-changes/ba-p/77811" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">announced</a> some changes to speaker groups, which it says is &#8220;due to a recent legal ruling.&#8221; The most notable change is that, going forward, users will no longer be able to adjust the volume of all speakers in a group all at once. They&#8217;d have to adjust each speaker individually instead.</p>
<p>In a statement, Sonos Chief Legal Officer Eddie Lazarus admitted that there&#8217;s a possibility that &#8220;Google will be able to degrade or eliminate product features in a way that circumvents the importation ban that the ITC has imposed.&#8221; However, he said the tech giant&#8217;s products will still &#8220;infringe many dozens of Sonos patents&#8221; — that is, unless Google pays Sonos royalties for its technologies.</p>
<p>His whole statement reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We appreciate that the ITC has definitively validated the five Sonos patents at issue in this case and ruled unequivocally that Google infringes all five. That is an across the board win that is surpassingly rare in patent cases and underscores the strength of Sonos’s extensive patent portfolio and the hollowness of Google’s denials of copying. These Sonos patents cover Sonos&#8217; groundbreaking invention of extremely popular home audio features, including the set up for controlling home audio systems, the synchronization of multiple speakers, the independent volume control of different speakers, and the stereo pairing of speakers.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>There is a possibility that Google will be able to degrade or eliminate product features in a way that circumvents the importation ban that the ITC has imposed. But while Google may sacrifice consumer experience in an attempt to circumvent this importation ban, its products will still infringe many dozens of Sonos patents, its wrongdoing will persist, and the damages owed Sonos will continue to accrue. Alternatively, Google can —as other companies have already done — pay a fair royalty for the technologies it has misappropriated.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meta, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">formerly Facebook</a>, is tinkering around with how it tells users about their privacy options. The company has switched up where this information lives and how it&#8217;s explained a number of times over the years and now appears to be centralizing some privacy FAQs and controls in one place across its family of apps.</p>
<p>The new privacy center, called <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2022/01/introducing-privacy-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Center</a>, is a test available to some U.S.-based Facebook desktop users for now but will roll out to &#8220;more people and apps in the coming months.&#8221; If you&#8217;re in the limited test, you can find the new privacy information center in the Privacy section of the Settings menu. As it stands, privacy settings are divided among Facebook&#8217;s Privacy Shortcuts and Privacy Checkup menus, which are far from ideal but still an improvement over how the platform used to handle these controls.</p>
<p>The new privacy center will break things down into five categories: Security, Sharing, Collection, Use and Ads. Meta is still pushing the idea of &#8220;privacy education&#8221; with the changes, a kind of shorthand way of saying that if you don&#8217;t go to the trouble of sorting through all of this stuff then it&#8217;s on you when the company puts your personal data to good use.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255244" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Facebook has historically offered users byzantine, difficult to navigate privacy controls, often with the most important settings buried in menus. That&#8217;s improved some, but regardless of what it says these days, Meta still has a vested interest in keeping its users sharing as much data as possible. That position is made abundantly clear by the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/27/apple-privacy-changes-anti-competitive-facebook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conspicuous objections to Apple&#8217;s iOS ad tracking changes</a>, which limited the ability of apps to follow user behavior — a clear win for consumer privacy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not realistic to assume that most people would systemically trudge through this information, but it&#8217;s probably worth knowing where it all lives, just in case.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Another virtual year at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces-2022/">CES 2022</a> is in the bag for TechCrunch, and even though we attended the event remotely, one thing in the vehicle space was made abundantly clear: Your car is about so much more than mobility. In fact, if you think a vehicle is about getting you from point A to point B, think again, peasant!</p>
<p>Your car — at least in the eyes of automakers and tech companies — is a third space, a place where you can work or lounge or watch TV. It’s a device, connecting you with the other devices that run your life. It’s an assistant, anticipating your needs by creepily watching you and collecting data on your every movement.</p>
<p>The big themes this year focused on services and experiences that drivers and passengers can have inside vehicles, the advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving features that handle some of the drudgery of driving so you can have those experiences, and the compute power needed to deliver it all.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254886" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Of course, there was other vehicle tech that popped up: Who can forget BMW’s color-changing car? NFTs even made an appearance. Here’s the in-vehicle tech that stood out to us.</p>
<h2>Compute power for the win</h2>
<p>We heard a lot about digital cockpits that transform the front cab into a world of digital content, entertainment and services. Many companies threw around the term “co-pilot” and depending on how that company defined it, the co-pilot could include voice assistants or even actual driver-assistance systems that can control certain functions of the vehicles. And there were deep insinuations that one should never, if one can help it, stop watching TV or streaming video — especially not when in a moving vehicle.</p>
<p>All of that requires processing power and at 2022 CES the automotive chip game was on.</p>
<h3>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Digital Chassis</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2252834" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252834" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2252834" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png" alt="Qualcomm's Snapdragon Digital Chassis render showing advanced connected infotainment system in vehicle" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Snapdragon-Digital-Chassis-Render-03.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2252834" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Qualcomm Technologies</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Qualcomm doubled down on its commitment to powering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/qualcomm-ces-auto-snapdragon-digital-chassis/">automotive in-vehicle tech</a> at CES 2022 by bringing on new OEM clients. The tech giant’s Snapdragon Digital Chassis offers automakers a platter of cloud-connected “platforms” consisting of systems on a chip (SoC) and software that can be adopted in full or à la carte.</p>
<p>The chassis includes: the Snapdragon Ride Platform for ADAS and automated driving, the Auto Connectivity Platform for LTE, 5G connected services, cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X), Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and precise positioning, and the next generation of the Snapdragon Cockpit, a digital cockpit and infotainment system.</p>
<p>Volvo and Honda announced plans to integrate the digital cockpit into upcoming electric vehicles, and Renault, which has already committed to bringing the cockpit into future cars, expanded the partnership to include everything the chassis has to offer. General Motors will also be relying on Snapdragon to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/gm-taps-qualcomm-to-power-new-hands-free-driver-assistance-starting-with-cadillac/">power its next-gen ADAS</a>.</p>
<h3>Nvidia’s Drive Orin SoC</h3>
<p>While Volvo’s infotainment is being powered by Qualcomm’s SoC, its new automated driving (AD) features will be powered by Nvidia’s. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/tusimple-integrates-nvidias-newest-auto-grade-chip-to-scale-autonomous-trucking/">Autonomous trucking startup TuSimple also said at CES 2022</a> that it would use Drive Orin to power and scale its self-driving tech.</p>
<p>Nvidia’s chip is a central computer for intelligent vehicles that’s made specifically for autonomous applications. It delivers 254 trillion operations per seconds and provides the sort of auto-grade compute power needed to handle self-driving functions.</p>
<p>JiDU Auto, Baidu&#8217;s electric vehicle company, also announced it will use the Nvidia Drive Orin SoC. This next-generation vehicle with Level 4 autonomous driving capability will make its debut at the Beijing Auto Show in April, followed by mass production and delivery by 2023.</p>
<p>Other companies using Drive Orin include Polestar, IM Motors, Li Auto, NIO, R Auto and Xpeng.</p>
<h3>Intel-Mobileye</h3>
<p>Intel subsidiary Mobileye announced plans to bring a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/intels-mobileye-autonomous-driving-chip-for-consumer-vehicles/">new supercomputer</a> to market designed to give passenger cars, trucks and SUVs autonomous driving powers.</p>
<p>The company introduced at the 2022 CES tech trade show a new system on chip called EyeQ Ultra that is purpose-built for autonomous driving. The company said the first silicon for the EyeQ Ultra SoC, which is capable of 176 trillion operations per second (TOPS), is expected at the end of 2023 with full automotive grade production in 2025.</p>
<p>The company also introduced at CES its next-generation EyeQ SoC for advanced driver-assistance systems called EyeQ6L and EyeQ6H.</p>
<h2>Connected everything</h2>
<p>What do you get when you combine the internet with insane processing power in a vehicle? A sci-fi world of incredible, and some might say unnecessary, tech that lets car owners sync their digital and physical worlds.</p>
<p>Want to program your car to order you a pizza as you leave the office so it’s hot and ready when you get home? It can be done. Feel like hearing the stats on your battery’s power and vehicle range? Speak and it shall be delivered. Want to put your feet up and watch the latest episode of “The Wheel of Time”? There’s tech for that, too.</p>
<p>The in-vehicle tech displayed at CES drilled home the idea of the car as a connected device that is meant to make your life easier, smoother and more entertaining.</p>
<h3>Google</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2253607" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253607" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2253607" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-05-at-6.25.18-pm.png" alt="Google Home device voice assist to heat up volvo car" width="1024" height="584" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-05-at-6.25.18-pm.png 2644w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-05-at-6.25.18-pm.png?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-05-at-6.25.18-pm.png?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-05-at-6.25.18-pm.png?resize=768,438 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-05-at-6.25.18-pm.png?resize=680,388 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-05-at-6.25.18-pm.png?resize=1536,876 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-05-at-6.25.18-pm.png?resize=2048,1168 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2022-01-05-at-6.25.18-pm.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2253607" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Volvo Cars</p></div></p>
<p>Many cars today run their infotainment systems off of Android’s auto operating system, making it easier to access your phone and compatible apps on your phone from your car. This year, Google took it a few steps further.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/google-home-youtube-integrate-with-volvo-cars/">Volvo and Google announced an integration with the Google Home ecosystem</a>, which would allow Volvo car owners to issue voice commands to Google Assistant-enabled devices. They can tell the assistant to do things like turn the car on and off, heat it up or cool it down and provide car info like battery life. Volvo also shared plans to enable YouTube app downloads, thanks to both Google integrations with Volvo vehicles and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon cockpit.</p>
<p>Google also added features to its digital car key with BMW, which enables users to lock, unlock and start certain BMW cars with select Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy phones. Now, the car will automatically unlock itself when the device gets close enough, and users can share their digital car key with friends or family.</p>
<h3>Amazon</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2253780" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253780" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2253780" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1_ArAPbCYor2lNl_StFr9pXA-1.png" alt="Amazon fire tv wheel of time" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1_ArAPbCYor2lNl_StFr9pXA-1.png 1400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1_ArAPbCYor2lNl_StFr9pXA-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1_ArAPbCYor2lNl_StFr9pXA-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1_ArAPbCYor2lNl_StFr9pXA-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1_ArAPbCYor2lNl_StFr9pXA-1.png?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1_ArAPbCYor2lNl_StFr9pXA-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2253780" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>In previous years at CES, Amazon showed up in a number of vehicles via its virtual assistant Alexa. This year, the power of Alexa is combining with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/amazon-fire-tv-is-coming-to-more-cars-in-2022/">Amazon’s Fire TV streaming platform</a>, which is working its way into more cars.</p>
<p>Last year, global automaker Stellantis integrated the Fire TV into its vehicles, and at CES 2022, we’re seeing the in-car entertainment systems of certain Jeep, Chrysler, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/bmw-wants-to-turn-your-car-into-a-rolling-cinema/">BMW</a> and Ford vehicles get an upgrade, as well.</p>
<p>Fire TV for cars will do more than offer a TV streaming platform. It’ll sync with Alexa so drivers and passengers can simply speak a command and <em>poof!</em>, “Olaf Presents” is playing in the backseat and your children are blessedly quiet. Users can also ask Alexa to show their Ring doorbell video on the Fire TV using voice commands.</p>
<p>Stellantis is getting even cozier with Amazon. At CES 2022, Stellantis <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/stellantis-draft/">announced a wide-ranging collaboration</a> that will touch nearly every aspect of its business. Amazon&#8217;s technology will be used to help Stellantis develop vehicles, build connected in-vehicle experiences and train the next generation of automotive software engineers.</p>
<p>As part of this multiyear deal, Stellantis has selected Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its preferred cloud provider for vehicle platforms. Stellantis, which recently launched a software academy for existing and new employees, is also working with AWS to create a curriculum that will cover software, data and cloud technology.</p>
<h3>Cerence</h3>
<p>Software company Cerence unveiled its Cerence Co-Pilot, an in-car assistant that uses continuous learning to anticipate the needs of drivers and proactively initiate actions. The co-pilot is integrated with the car’s sensors and data to understand the environment inside the vehicle and around it, analyzing things like voice, gaze, gesture and touch to understand user preferences and perform actions on the driver’s behalf.</p>
<p>Cerence’s co-pilot can do things like control smart home and IoT devices, authorize payments for in-car purchases and remind drivers about car maintenance needs, even scheduling a trip to the shop for them.</p>
<p>While the company didn’t share which automakers are signed onto integrate the co-pilot, a video demonstrating the tech showed such brands as Volvo, BMW, Audi and Mercedes, some of which have worked with Cerence in the past.</p>
<h3>Blackberry</h3>
<p>Blackberry announced a partnership with Pateo, an internet-of-vehicles service and product provider in China, that will see Blackberry Ivy, the company’s intelligent vehicle data platform co-developed with Amazon Web Services, integrated into Pateo’s digital cockpit solution. The two companies are to work with an unnamed Chinese automaker to pilot the cockpit on its electric model lineup.</p>
<p>The software company most renowned for its mobile phones didn’t share much about what that cockpit would look like, but it should encompass such features as intelligent voice, entertainment, vehicle health monitoring, secure payment and cloud technology. Blackberry and Pateo will also incorporate Electra Vehicles’s EVE-Ai 360 Adaptive Controls that provides prediction of battery state of charge, state of health and project vehicle range.</p>
<h2>ADAS/AD</h2>
<p>In past years, autonomous driving took center stage. This year, the focus was more on advanced driver-assistance systems and promises to bring restricted automated driving features to passenger vehicles. Due to the advancements in vehicle sensors, compute power and software, automakers are working to automate certain aspects of the car, like parking or highway driving.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean some companies pursuing so-called Level 4 autonomous driving didn’t show up at CES; they just weren’t the ones yelling the loudest this year.</p>
<h3>GM’s Ultra Cruise</h3>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, GM’s new Ultra Cruise hands-free ADAS system will be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon SoC. GM introduced the Ultra Cruise system in 2021, but this was the first time we heard more details about the compute and some of the capabilities.</p>
<p>The system is an upgrade from the automaker’s Super Cruise ADAS first introduced in 2017, and it’s expected to be able to handle 95% of all driving scenarios.</p>
<p>Ultra Cruise, which is coming to the new electric Cadillac Celestiq in 2023, will rely on sensors like cameras, radar and lidar (not just lidar map data) to feed data to GM’s software that will then output decisions.</p>
<h3>Volvo’s Ride Pilot</h3>

<p>Volvo shared plans to work with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/volvo-partners-with-luminar-and-zenseact-to-bring-autonomous-driving-feature-to-new-e-suv/">lidar company Luminar</a> and AD software company Zenseact to introduce Ride Pilot as an add-on subscription to an electric SUV that will be revealed later this year. Ride Pilot is an “unsupervised” AD feature, meaning it can drive itself fully while drivers are on certain highways, giving them the ability to go completely hands and eyes free so they can enjoy other activities, like the YouTube watching we mentioned earlier.</p>
<h3>JiDU</h3>
<p>Chinese internet giant Baidu’s EV startup JiDU came to CES 2022 with news that it would power its first production EV model, which is expected to begin deliveries in 2023, on Nvidia’s Drive Orin SoC (as mentioned above). The company said it would have Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities, all of which would be revealed in April at the Beijing Auto Show.</p>
<p>JiDu is just a year old and recently demonstrated intelligent assisted driving in both urban and high-speed areas in its SIMUCar.</p>
<h3>Cadillac</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2254175" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254175" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2254175" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38.cf_.jpg" alt="Cadillac autonomous lounge concept innerspace" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38.cf_.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38.cf_.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38.cf_.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38.cf_.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38.cf_.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38.cf_.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38.cf_.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254175" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cadillac</p></div></p>
<p>While not entirely focused on autonomous driving capabilities or ADAS features, it’s worth noting how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/cadillacs-new-self-driving-concept-is-a-luxury-loveseat-on-wheels/">Cadillac envisions the inside of its future autonomous vehicles</a>. Its InnerSpace concept shows your standard spaceship-looking two-seater car from the outside, while inside it still looks like a spaceship. But like a sexy spaceship.</p>
<p>Rather than separate driver and passenger seats, there’s a plush and sleek loveseat that appears to constantly be in recline mode, which checks out given the built-in ottoman and compartment for slippers and a blanket. A mere couple of feet in front of the passengers’ heads is a wide, curved screen. No steering wheels or pedals are featured.</p>
<h3>Indy Autonomous Challenge</h3>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/racer1.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone wp-image-2255223 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/racer1.gif" alt="" width="800" height="422" /></a></p>
<p>Last October, teams from around the world converged on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to demonstrate autonomous racing.</p>
<p>The teams gathered again, this time at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway on January 7 with the Autonomous Challenge @ CES. IAC university teams developed the software that runs the autonomous racecar, the Dallara AV-21.</p>
<p>Leading up to the event, the organization published a few videos, including this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVF_JVhOrU4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one that was filmed at night</a>.</p>
<h3>Gentex</h3>
<p>Gentex, which supplies automotive and aerospace sectors, showed off the results of two acquisitions in 2021: Israel-based Guardian Optical Technologies and Vaposens.</p>
<p>The company showed a lot, but its ultra-sensitive driver monitoring system that is designed to be used to support driver-assistance systems got our attention. Guardian Optical Technologies developed an infrared-sensitive, high-resolution camera combining machine vision, depth perception and micro-vibration detection. What this means is its proprietary sensor configuration can monitor the entire vehicle cabin and all its objects and occupants, assessing their behavior, gestures and activities.</p>
<h2>NFTs, color changing cars and other fun stuff</h2>
<h3>Vinfast</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2255174" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/S9.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255174" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2255174 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/S9.jpg" alt="Vinfast CES 2022 electric vehicles" width="1600" height="1066" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/S9.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/S9.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/S9.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/S9.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/S9.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/S9.jpg?resize=1536,1023 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/S9.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2255174" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vinfast</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to revealing three new EVs at CES this year, Vietnamese EV company Vinfast announced the formation of its early-bird reservation site. The first to preorder will receive a “VinFirst” certificate on the blockchain platform in NFT form, which the company says is a completely transparent way to prove ownership of an order number.</p>
<p>The term &#8220;digital twin&#8221; popped up a few times in the automotive sector at CES 2022, including an announcement from Cerence and Vinfast. The gist is this: Cerence has cloud-based software that allows Vinfast (or any other company intrigued by the product) to create a virtual representation of its entire car, including software, mechanics, electrics and physical behavior, along with driver data and environmental data.</p>
<h3>Indi EV</h3>
<p>Indi EV, a California-based EV startup, came out with a prototype of its Indi One at CES, which the company says is “the world’s first social media-oriented car.” What that seems to mean is a car that has an integrated computer for gaming, a complete Windows workstation that can handle Zoom calls and even record events that can later be shared on social media and software that lets riders capture trip content and video to be uploaded to the cloud.</p>
<p>If all that wasn’t enough, the Indi One is meant to enable a type of mobile blockchain, wherein each vehicle can act as a node for a blockchain. Exactly why that’s significant is unclear, but You Do You, Indi EV. Customers can start preordering by the end of Q1, and the car is expected to go for around $45,000.</p>
<h3>BMW</h3>
<p>BMW <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/bmw-shows-off-a-color-changing-car/">unwrapped its color-changing car at CES, the BMW iX Flow</a>. Right now, the e-paper wrapping the vehicle can only change between black and white, but more colors are expected in the future that will enable users to give their car a more personalized look to match their mood.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253428" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bmw_flow.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253428" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2253428 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bmw_flow.gif" alt="BMW color changing car CES 2022 " width="800" height="364" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2253428" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BMW</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-family: aktiv-grotesk, sans-serif; letter-spacing: -0.02em; font-size: 1rem;">Nextbase</span>Dash cam tech company Nextbase unveiled its smart and connected dash cam, the Nextbase iQ. It gives drivers a lot of the same safety and security features they would get in their home-monitoring systems, like real-time alerts and access to incident video even while they’re away from their car. Users can also get real-time access to the dash cam from anywhere at anytime through the iQ app.</p>
<h3>Mercedes-Benz</h3>
<p>Finally, Mercedes revealed the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/03/mercedes-benzs-vision-for-the-future-is-an-ultra-efficient-luxury-620-mile-range-ev/">Vision EQXX</a>, a concept vehicle that is meant to showcase what the automaker&#8217;s electric future will look like. This eye-popping sport EV wasn&#8217;t just about aerodynamics and a sleek design. The company squeezed in power, efficiency and range into the compact and sporty package.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2252520" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-067.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252520" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2252520 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-067.jpg" alt="Mercedes-Benz VISION EQXX CES" width="2000" height="1250" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-067.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-067.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-067.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-067.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-067.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-067.jpg?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2021-12-21_Image_22C0001-067.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2252520" class="wp-caption-text">Mercedes-Benz reveals the VISION EQXX interior. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mercedes-Benz</p></div></p>
<p>Some of the neat tech in the EQXX worth noting is the one-piece 47.5-inch LED display with 8K resolution. The infotainment screen has responsive real-time graphics that will span the width of the vehicle, according to Mercedes.</p>
<p>The automaker worked with NAVIS Automotive Systems to develop a 3D navigation system that users can zoom into and scroll around for this massive screen. And like the company&#8217;s newer models, the EQXX also featured an advanced voice assistant and software that learns your behavior over time.</p>
<h2>Lidar companies try to make a concrete value prop</h2>
<p>In the lidar world, Luminar&#8217;s eyebrow-raising stunt comparing Tesla&#8217;s ADAS system to its own (to the peril of several child-size dummies) was affecting, and its inclusion in Volvo vehicles and Mobileye systems is a coup. But it&#8217;s still an expensive and complex system, a major investment with uncertain (if potentially significant) benefits.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Manufacturers are struggling to produce something that creates a useful outcome for a vehicle at a reasonable price. Costs haven&#8217;t come down as much as they&#8217;d like, and there&#8217;s still confusion over who does what in a perception stack.</p>
<p>Blickfeld is attempting to take over as much as possible, for instance, with on-device movement detection, object classification and so on, which could make their devices easier to drop in — or possibly make them partially redundant with an already intelligent in-car computer vision system.</p>
<p>Arbe is focusing more narrowly on what it calls &#8220;free space mapping,&#8221; where it doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s a bush or a raccoon or what — the question is, is it safe to drive on? A quick, dedicated sensor for identifying driveable surfaces in the vicinity could be a useful feature and one that contributes to the autonomous vehicle collective intelligence.</p>
<p>Innoviz is improving on the traditional spinning puck lidar type, which has proven to be useful in many circumstances. A cheaper, better version may find success where trailblazer Velodyne has over the years.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/30/voyant-raises-15m-to-scale-production-of-its-tiny-inexpensive-lidar-tech/">Voyant Photonics</a> is leaving the whole automotive market to deeper pockets, focusing on producing its tiny, inexpensive lidar unit for robotics and industrial applications, where certifications and liabilities aren&#8217;t quite so intense.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no doubt lidar has a future in autonomous vehicles and other equipment, but what form it will take and how much people will pay for it — that&#8217;s still very much up in the air, something that no doubt makes everyone in the sector a little nervous.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Launching a business is hard enough, but scaling it to a successful and lucrative exit is even more difficult. Securing early-stage venture financing is usually the best way to accelerate and sustain growth, but with various funding options available, how do you figure out the best course of action? What is the best alternative to VC, and at what point in your company’s growth do other funding sources make sense?</p>
<p>Choosing the right financing partner can be tedious, as they need to align with your mission, values and objectives. Otherwise, you get stuck in a relationship that doesn’t align with your goals and may lead you ending up with lower ownership than expected.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a rundown of how alternative financing came to be, how it can benefit high-growth SaaS startups and how to know if it’s right for you.</p>
<h2>The evolution of alternative financing</h2>
<p>There is a dearth of non-dilutive financing options for growth-stage, recurring-revenue businesses. We’ve found that traditional sources of debt capital (such as banks) simply prefer to provide debt to asset-heavy businesses where collateral can be secured.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Every dollar sitting dormant in a savings account or any traditional short-term/liquid debt instrument is vulnerable to a real loss in value as inflation skyrockets.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>When it comes to SaaS or asset-light business models, there simply isn’t an asset base to collateralize, which makes traditional debt providers uncomfortable. Moreover, while subscription or recurring revenue business models aren’t technically new, they have been undersupported. SaaS companies can often only look to traditional banks for financing after achieving profitability and/or receiving institutional venture capital backing.</p>
<p>This rules-based approach is pragmatic, but results in a massive gap in the market for early-stage companies that have achieved product-market fit and serious revenue traction. If they don’t fit the &#8220;checklist,&#8221; they simply get thrown into the backlog until all the boxes can be checked off, regardless of the underlying traction.</p>
<h2>Revenue financing</h2>
<p>Revenue financing allows founders to have more control over their decisions without compromising board seats. SaaS companies can especially benefit from this model, as it advances future revenue from customers who are already signed up.</p>
<p>Revenue financing enables companies on a healthy growth trajectory to instantly access future cash flows from their customers’ monthly payments. Another benefit is that the borrowers’ credit limits can adjust according to their monthly expected growth, and they can draw funds when they need them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The conservative social media platform Parler has raised $20 million in funding, according to an <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001902750/000190275022000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC filing</a> that was signed and submitted on January 6, the anniversary of last year&#8217;s domestic attack on the Capitol. The app, which <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/parler-expands-business-into-decentralized-technology-301448129.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claims to have</a> 16 million-plus registered users, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/parler-expands-business-into-decentralized-technology-301448129.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">describes</a> its mission as one focusing on protecting &#8220;against the authoritarian powers of Big Tech, Big Government, and cancel culture.&#8221; The app also claims to be <a href="https://parler.com/documents/guidelines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nonpartisan</a>, but anti-hate organizations and researchers including the <a href="https://www.adl.org/blog/parler-where-the-mainstream-mingles-with-the-extreme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anti-Defamation League</a> and the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2021/01/08/far-right-insurrectionists-organized-capitol-siege-parler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Southern Poverty Law Center</a> have observed Parler’s influence in the far-right information ecosystem, from its role in the Capitol insurrection to propagating <a href="https://news.ku.edu/2021/06/01/study-parler-provided-echo-chamber-vaccine-misinformation-conspiracy-theories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-vaccine misinformation</a>.</p>
<p>Parler hasn&#8217;t responded to a request for comment about who its new investors are, but the filing states there are 10 non-accredited investors in the offering. Its previous angel round &#8212; an undisclosed amount &#8212; came from major Republican political <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/15/media/rebekah-mercer-parler/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">donor Rebekah Mercer</a>. Mercer is listed as both an executive officer and director on the filing. Seth Dillon, CEO of conservative satire site the Babylon Bee, is also listed as a director.</p>
<p>The filing was first spotted by <a href="https://www.axios.com/social-media-app-parler-raises-20-million-7c8ca6e6-63ba-4149-a08d-5fbf59be87b0.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axios</a>, which also has not yet received a comment from Parler.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255061" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Parler came to prominence last year around the time of the January 6 insurrection, after social media companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">Facebook</a> banned former President Donald Trump from their platforms. These bans &#8212; enforced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/23/twitter-hides-trump-tweet-behind-notice-for-potentially-dissuading-people-from-voting/">after</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/17/coronavirus-protests-trump-liberate-minnesota-tweets-facebook-twitter/">repeated</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/trump-flu-covid-misinformation-facebook-and-twitter/">warnings</a> &#8212; were over concerns that Trump was using his following to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/why-twitter-banned-president-trump/">disrupt</a> the peaceful transition of presidential power.</p>
<p>Inspired by Trump&#8217;s de-platforming from mainstream social platforms, many of his supporters flocked to Parler, which had <a href="https://parler.com/documents/guidelines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less stringent</a> community guidelines. Parler <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/parler-jumps-to-no-1-on-app-store-after-facebook-and-twitter-bans/">rose to No. 1</a> on the App Store days after the attack on the U.S. Capitol but had found itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/">removed</a> from Google Play on January 8, 2021. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/amazon-web-services-gives-parler-24-hour-notice-that-it-will-suspend-services-to-the-company/">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/apple-suspend-parler-from-app-store/">Apple</a> soon removed Parler from their platforms as well, over terms of service violations. The companies said the app had been used by Trump supporters and other far-right users<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/01/06/trump-riot-twitter-parler-proud-boys-boogaloos-antifa-qanon/6570794002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> to call for violence </a>and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/trump-rioters-planned-online?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organize their plans</a> to storm the Capitol.</p>
<p>&#8220;Parler has not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of these threats to people’s safety. We have suspended Parler from the App Store until they resolve these issues,&#8221; Apple told TechCrunch at the time of the ban.</p>
<p>Parler&#8217;s then-CEO John Matze posted on his Parler account that it wouldn&#8217;t cooperate with the App Store&#8217;s demands for the company to submit a content moderation improvement plan. But on January 29, he was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-parler-ceo/parler-ceo-john-matze-says-he-was-fired-by-board-idUSKBN2A33B0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fired</a> by Parler&#8217;s board, controlled by Mercer. By April, the app was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-parler-ceo/parler-ceo-john-matze-says-he-was-fired-by-board-idUSKBN2A33B0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in the App Store</a> under new leadership from CEO George Farmer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Farmer explained in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/opinion/sway-kara-swisher-george-farmer.html?showTranscript=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent interview with The New York Times</a> that when Parler was removed from the App Store before his tenure, the app didn&#8217;t have any AI moderation, and its mechanism for human moderation &#8212; a jury system &#8212; was in its early stages, too.</p>
<p>Farmer said that under his leadership, Parler has implemented AI content moderation, which it didn&#8217;t have at the time of its removal from the app store. This additional infusion of $20 million could help the app continue building out this filtering technology, which Parler uses in tandem with human moderation. Parler&#8217;s community guidelines also now state that the app will &#8220;not knowingly allow itself to be used as a tool for crime, civil torts, or other unlawful acts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parler&#8217;s mobile app has been downloaded about 11.3 million times globally since its debut, according to data from Sensor Tower. From Parler&#8217;s May 2021 return to the App Store until now, the app has been downloaded just 141,000 times, the firm noted. If Parler&#8217;s stated figure of 16 million+ registered users is accurate, that would mean the majority access Parler via its native mobile app.</p>
<p>Parler may soon have new competition in<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/trump-launches-his-own-social-media-platform-truth-social/"> TRUTH Social</a>, Trump&#8217;s own social network that&#8217;s expected to launch on February 21, President&#8217;s Day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Data privacy is top of mind for online sellers, and for good reason: Regulators in China, Europe and North America are taking an interest, and iOS 14.5 allowed many consumers to disable data tracking, with negative consequences for companies that relied on Facebook&#8217;s granular ad targeting.</p>
<p>Bearing those factors and others in mind, Ben Parr, president and co-founder of e-commerce marketing platform Octane.ai, shared <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/4-trends-that-will-define-e-commerce-in-2022/">his e-commerce predictions for 2022</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personalization and zero-party data become critical.</li>
<li>E-commerce embraces web3 and NFTs, but what will that look like?</li>
<li>Live shopping goes mainstream.</li>
<li>Slow but gradual improvement to the supply chain.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p>If you manage an e-commerce startup&#8217;s brand, this is a helpful overview; Parr even weighs in on whether startups need to begin putting NFTs on their virtual shelves this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m also eager to see brands utilize tokens for loyalty and rewards, a topic I’ve heard people discuss but not yet embrace.&#8221;</p>
<p>My prediction: We&#8217;ll be running many articles in 2022 with tactics for zero-party data collection. Google temporarily postponed its plan to deprecate third-party cookies until the latter half of 2023, which means the ad tech landscape is going to undergo tectonic shifts.</p>
<p>We have more expert-written posts with 2022 predictions in the pipeline, so stay tuned!</p>

<p>NFT marketplace OpenSea’s valuation has skyrocketed, but at $13.3 billion, its revenue multiple isn&#8217;t very high when compared with other software companies, writes Alex Wilhelm in The Exchange.</p>
<p>&#8220;It appears that the new OpenSea valuation is cheap compared to recent fundamentals, but a little expensive when we consider how much its market booms and busts.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is a fantastic time to launch a startup, but if you&#8217;re trying to grow one — well, winter is coming.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve already noted the impacts of new data regulations and consumers&#8217; growing desire for more privacy, but here&#8217;s another log to toss on the bad news fire: As a percentage of company revenue, marketing budgets plummeted from 11% in 2020 to 6.4% last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the lowest proportion allocated to marketing in the history of Gartner’s Annual CMO Spend Survey,&#8221; the research company reported.</p>

<p>As a startup with relatively good financial performance, consumer financial service startup Dave could have bided its time for an initial public offering. Instead, it chose the SPAC route.</p>
<p>While the decision brought benefits, the fact that a cohort of less-than-stellar SPAC listings debuted at the same time brought some troubles as well, said CEO and co-founder Jason Wilk.</p>
<p>“If I could have done it all over again, I guess it would have been the same price discovery and guaranteed capital without the name SPAC associated with it, just because it’s been unfair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Our latest guest column with predictions for the coming year doesn’t just prognosticate: Growth expert Jonathan Martinez shares several tactics early-stage companies can use to capitalize on these trends.</p>
<p>Among other topics, Martinez shared methods for incrementally testing ads, his ideas about video ads and influencer marketing, and a few thoughts about Facebook and iOS 14 privacy changes.</p>
<p>“I believe we’ll start seeing heavy investments by Facebook and other social media platforms to keep users on their platforms, where they will still have access to first-party data,” writes Martinez.</p>

<p>Digital advertising has changed a lot in the past year, and it’s bound to change further when Google blocks third-party cookies from Chrome next year.</p>
<p>For publishers, it means advertising dollars should be spent wisely on strategies that maximize ad monetization without relying on old methods, writes James Avery, founder and CEO of Kevel.</p>
<p>In a deep dive of the changing ad world, Avery explains how publishers will have to prioritize first-party data to gather user insights, the importance of walled garden ad solutions, and why unified IDs are unsustainable in the long term.</p>

<p>Public software stocks have lost a fair bit of value so far this year, but startup valuations continue to climb higher, seemingly unaffected by the markets’ declining opinion, writes Alex Wilhelm.</p>
<p>“Startups had best hope that private investors are right to index heavily on nascent growth rates over other traditional private-market metrics.</p>
<p>If not, everyone is going to be left holding some part of the bag when later rounds don’t consummate at higher prices.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Much of Chinese society has come to depend on so-called super apps like WeChat to do multiple tasks, from making a medical appointment to hailing a taxi to getting a loan, all on one platform.</p>
<p>But such one-stop shops have not taken off in the United States. Now, the time may finally be ripe &#8212; and the best contenders for super apps come from the fintech world, especially those platforms dedicated to cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency is quickly growing in popularity amid sky-high equity prices, record-low interest rates and fear of inflation on the horizon, and they could, perhaps, gain more legitimacy if the U.S. government decides to fully regulate them, a topic<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/08/business/house-financial-services-crypto.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Congress is currently exploring</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254631" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Dedicated crypto platforms like Coinbase or even Paypal, Venmo and Stripe, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/payments-giant-stripe-says-its-re-entering-the-crypto-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which recently</a> added abilities to use crypto for payments, could evolve into the U.S. versions of super apps, assuming crypto issuers can work with regulators to find a middle ground between protecting the consumer and creating new financial and investment opportunities. If consumers see crypto as secure and legitimate — and easy to use — it could become the base of super apps.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The bottom line is that people are thinking about finance not just when they go to the bank — if they even have access to a bank — but when they shop, vacation or pay for a medical visit.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>Expanding these crypto and payment apps to integrate with other apps and services would make many diverse tasks more convenient. The bottom line is that people are thinking about finance not just when they go to the bank — if they even have access to a bank — but when they shop, vacation or pay for a medical visit, and such apps would help deliver the financial services they need in a personalized manner.</p>
<p>Integrating crypto payments into other tasks would also go a long way in democratizing the world of finance and money, giving underserved communities and those with no credit histories who struggle to open credit cards or get loans more access to financial services.</p>
<h2>The rise of the super app</h2>
<p>WeChat started out as a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55929418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">messaging app in China</a> in 2011, but by 2013 it also functioned as a <a href="https://www.cgap.org/research/publication/china-digital-payments-revolution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">payment platform</a> and soon offered many other services, like shopping, food delivery and taxi-hailing.</p>
<p>Now it offers more than a million different services, mainly through mini apps that businesses develop to work within WeChat. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55929418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AliPay</a>, which also has more than a billion users, is similar. These two apps have been credited over the last decade with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/technology/alipay-china.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">converting China from a cash-only economy</a> to one heavily reliant on digital payments, skipping over the intermediary phase of debit and credit cards.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The concept has also become popular in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/southeast-asias-battle-of-the-40-billion-superapps-11621332418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indonesia</a> and elsewhere in the region. The fact that they involve financial services, including payment options, is key, and the common thread that runs through many of the super apps’ services.</p>
<p>But while app use has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">exploded</a> in the United States and Europe; Big Tech players like Apple, Facebook and Google have added payment services; and several payment apps like Venmo and Square have become more popular, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/07/16/what-is-a-super-app-and-why-havent-they-gone-global.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">super apps have not yet emerged</a>.</p>
<p>This is partly because of data privacy regulations; privacy laws in the United States, and especially in Europe, limit data shared between apps, making it harder to create an ecosystem where mini apps can automatically integrate into super apps like Alipay.</p>
<p>It also stems from the U.S. having had a well-developed internet ecosystem, with popular social media sites, like Facebook, and payment sites, like PayPal, existing before the rise of smartphones, which resulted in each of these platforms launching separate apps, rather than one app offering multiple services. Compare that with China, where <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/why-chinas-super-apps-will-never-succeed-in-the-us-64c686c8c5d6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much of the internet was mobile-first,</a> arising only after the advent of smartphones. The U.S. market has long been used to separate platforms for separate tasks.</p>
<p>But many analysts point to apps and tech companies adding more services — like TikTok adding shopping, Snapchat integrating mini apps for games or Apple entering the payment space — and say that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22738395/social-media-super-app-facebook-wechat-shopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">super apps will eventually emerge</a> in the U.S., or at least bigger apps that can do more things. Adding more services to any one app, and finding a way to keep users on it, is also a way around privacy regulations that prevent one app from knowing what its users do on another app.</p>
<p>Apps are clearly on track to get bigger and more comprehensive, even though it is unlikely the U.S. would end up with only one or two dominant ones, as seen in Asian markets.</p>
<h2>The rise of DeFi</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, cryptocurrency developed alongside payment apps and super apps over the last decade. What started out as one product, Bitcoin, has developed into an <a href="https://qz.com/2065446/everything-you-need-to-know-about-decentralized-finance-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entire peer-to-peer financial system, known as DeFi,</a> with several currencies, including Ethereum and Dogecoin, allowing users to invest, trade, spend and lend out money.</p>
<p>But despite its surge in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/13percent-of-americans-traded-crypto-in-the-past-year-survey-finds.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popularity</a>, especially during the economic uncertainty posed by the COVID pandemic, and more<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/08/visa-launches-crypto-consulting-services.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> traditional financial institutions starting to offer some crypto-related services</a>, it remains <a href="https://www.ft.com/crypto" target="_blank" rel="noopener">outside the mainstream financial system and sector,</a> with many experts saying it poses high risks. Crypto issuers have also long resisted regulation, as that would go against their goal of having a decentralized financial product.</p>
<p>But now things are starting to change, with some crypto platforms expressing interest in following regulation.</p>
<p>For example, Coinbase <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/20/coinbase-drops-plans-to-launch-interest-product-as-regulatory-tension-around-stablecoins-runs-high.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped a plan to offer an interest-earning product, which would have allowed users to earn interest on coins loaned out to others,</a> after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission failed to offer guidance on it and threatened to sue Coinbase if it released it. In fact, <a href="https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/crypto-regulation-talks-heat-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto issuers are realizing that some regulation would give their product more legitimacy</a> and allow more people to use it for more purposes. This comes as new crypto products hit the market recently, including stable coins, which track the value of traditional currencies.</p>
<p>Regulation of crypto, an idea that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-chief-gary-gensler-braces-for-clash-with-crypto-traders-11628164980" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC Chairman Gary Gensler</a> has said he supports, along with some in Congress and some in the crypto industry, could indeed be on the horizon.</p>
<h2>Using cryptocurrency to fuel the first U.S. super app</h2>
<p>If crypto issuers work with government officials to set up regulation that protects consumers without limiting innovation, crypto is a good bet for what finally spurs American super apps.</p>
<p>Think about what could happen if Coinbase were to work with the SEC and align on smart regulation that would validate Coinbase as a viable and certified financial intermediary that users could rely on for crypto, embracing both its new financial products with potentially attractive yields in addition to its ability to use for everyday spending. Regulation would likely stabilize the currencies, turning them into something practical to shop with, rather than just hold for potential value. Such regulations would also eliminate some of the steps that add friction to current user experiences when it comes to using crypto in everyday life, like <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/the-brutal-truth-about-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long transaction times, high transaction fees</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/bitcoin-btc-flaws-set-stage-for-alternative-professor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large fluctuations in its value.</a></p>
<p>A regulatory framework would unlock massive demand for crypto, and there would suddenly be many businesses — from restaurants to retail – that would want a way to process crypto payments, spurring them to integrate into existing crypto payment apps and causing those to evolve into super apps. More people would also make deposits in crypto on these apps, rather than using traditional currencies in their banks. This would disrupt the entire economy and financial ecosystem.</p>
<p>Banks have always produced products they think the public <em>wants</em> while the world of crypto and DeFi are clearly providing products and services that people <em>need, </em>and millions are already using them, despite their uncertain regulatory and legal status.</p>
<p>Just as ubiquitous and integrated digital payments quickly emerged in China to fill a need — a cash alternative in a market underserved by credit cards — crypto-based super apps would fulfill the needs of consumers and businesses looking for a secure and efficient way to use crypto instead of, or in addition to, traditional payment methods.</p>
<p>If crypto remains an unregulated gray zone, and its platforms remain isolated from the rest of economic and daily life, rather than evolve into super apps, the United States will miss the opportunity to build a new and innovative mobile- and digital-first financial ecosystem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India’s antitrust watchdog has ordered an investigation into Google following complaints from news publishers who allege that the search giant is “abusing” its dominance in news aggregation to impose unfair conditions on the outlets.</p>
<p>The Competition Commission of India said Friday that Google dominates certain online services and its initial view is that Google has broken the local antitrust laws and pointed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/google-france-antitrust-news-litigation-settlement-offer/">new rules</a> in France and Australia, where the firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/australia-now-has-a-template-for-forcing-facebook-and-google-to-pay-for-news/">has been asked</a> to enter into “fair/good faith negotiation” with news publishers for paid licensing of content to address the “bargaining power imbalance between the two and the resultant imposition of unfair conditions by Google.”</p>
<p>“The allegations of the informant, when seen in this vertically integrated ecosystem operated by Google, makes it prima facie appear that news publishers have no choice but to accept the terms and conditions imposed by Google. Google appears to operate as a gateway between various news publishers on the one hand and news readers on the other. Another alternative for the news publisher is to forgo the traffic generated by Google for them, which would be unfavourable to their revenue generation,” the CCI said in its 21-page order.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255191" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The probe follows a complaint from Digital News Publishers Association, which consists of the digital arms of some of India’s biggest media firms. The association said their members get more than half of their traffic from online search engines, a category Google clearly commands, and the market-leading position has allowed Google to force the publishers into several unfavorable terms.</p>
<p>In a wide-ranging complaint, the association said Google displaying snippets of news items limits the number of visitors to news outlets and impacts the ad revenue “while Google continue[s] to earn ad revenue on its result page&#8221; as well as enriches &#8220;its search algorithm resulting from the volume of search queries.”</p>
<p>“It has also been averred that the terms of the agreements entered between the members of the Informant [news publishers] and the OPs [Google and its subsidiaries] for sharing the advertisement revenues are unilaterally and arbitrarily dictated by the OPs, and the members of the Informant have no other option but to accept the terms, as they are, with no bargaining power whatsoever,” the watchdog said.</p>
<p>“The only alternate to the AMP system is for publishers to subscribe with Google, which benefits Google, to the detriment of the publishers,” the watchdog said. The association accused that Google is forcing them to use its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/07/google-am-baidu-sogou/">AMP format</a>, which has implications on their revenue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A Google spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a well-functioning democracy, the critical role played by news media cannot be undermined, and it needs to be ensured that digital gatekeeper firms do not abuse their dominant position to harm the competitive process of determining a fair distribution of revenue amongst all stakeholders,&#8221; the watchdog added.</p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s investigation is the latest of a series of probes the Indian competition watchdog has ordered in recent weeks. Late last year, the CCI ordered an investigation into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/31/india-antitrust-watchdog-orders-investigation-into-apples-business-practices/">how Apple runs its App Store</a>, becoming the most recent country to take aim at the American technology giant.</p>

<p>In 1992, Ward Cunningham coined the metaphor &#8220;technical debt&#8221; to highlight how businesses weigh their short-term gains against the long-term viability of a software product. Business dynamics have evolved a lot since then, but the metaphor still works.</p>
<p>Favoring a short-term plan to get a faster go-to-market option is not always bad, provided the business has a backup plan to deliver well-designed code that would simplify future iterations and innovations.</p>
<p>But for startups, reworking is difficult as deadlines and resource crunch prevent developers from producing clean and perfect code. Startups prioritize short-term plans and focus more on adding functionalities to achieve milestones, sign up marquee customers or raise funding. This roadmap shuffling and disregard for the long-term view trigger tech debt.</p>
<p>I have worked closely with more than 25 startups and learned a lot from their journey from early-stage to growth stage. I have realized that avoiding tech debts becomes easier with some ground rules.</p>
<p>Here are four rules that startups should follow to avoid tech debt:</p>
<h2>Don’t let specific implementations continue for over three months</h2>
<p>Startups often try to customize their product to meet their marquee customers’ demands. Sometimes this leads to two products — a generalized version and a customer-specific one, and converging them becomes difficult over time.</p>
<p>To stay on track, companies start cutting corners, which destabilizes the product. I have seen engineering teams work on customization for a whole year and then lose 20 months in merging and stabilizing the core product.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The foundation of any software product is directly responsible for better scaling and maintainability.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	Startups generally work with an 18-24 month runway before they raise the next level of funding. If they rework to generalize features, they could lose a costly quarter to stabilization.</p>
<h3>What to do:</h3>
<p>When teams work on custom features for more than the specified timeline, merging them back with the core product becomes complex. It is better to acknowledge that products cannot be customer-specific at the very beginning. Startups should consider the platform and think about future maintainability upfront.</p>

		Arthur Woods is the co-founder of <a href="https://www.mathison.io/">Mathison</a>, a venture-backed technology platform equipping employers with everything they need to manage their diversity hiring efforts. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">We find ourselves amid the largest talent shortage in history after a year in which countless organizations voiced their commitments to diversity. Yet few have made much progress &#8212; and 76% of <a href="https://joshbersin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/202102-DEI-Report_Final_V2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organizations</a> have still not set diversity goals for 2022.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, we’ve been <a href="http://hiringfordiversity.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studying the hiring practices</a> of hundreds of employers and written about the <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/09/the-great-resignation-doesnt-have-to-threaten-your-dei-efforts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impact of the Great Resignation on DEI</a>. We’ve found a consistent pattern across the board: Employers are anchoring the focus to lagging indicators around diversity that won’t influence any change.</p>
<h2>What are the missing metrics for DEI?</h2>
<p>Traditionally, organizations have focused their DEI efforts — including goals and measurements — on increasing diversity and a sense of belonging on their teams.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250811" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The challenge? These two metrics are centered completely around end outcomes without accounting for the actual activities necessary to achieve them. Most organizations are missing a theory of change for their diversity efforts to account for what actions need to happen to move the needle in a meaningful way. This depends on answering two new questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Are our systems equitable?</strong> This is the extent to which our processes are fair, consistent and accessible for everyone, directly impacting whether people advance.</li>
<li><strong>Are our people aware, engaged and accountable for DEI? </strong>This is the collective awareness, engagement and accountability for DEI across our teams.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Putting these new metrics into practice</h2>
<p>It is clear that the challenges are daunting and creating roadblocks to change, but for those who want to be part of the 24% setting diversity goals this year, here are three key areas that can help transform the landscape for DEI in 2022:</p>
<h3>Measure the current state of diversity to learn where to focus your goals</h3>
<p>Organizations often set unrealistic DEI goals — either too ambitious or not challenging enough. Before you create your DEI goals, you’ll have to figure out where you have gaps and what you should prioritize.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assess your existing organizational policies and practices to determine where you have gaps or potential for bias by walking through the candidate and employee journey. Solutions like our <a href="https://www.mathison.io/platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equal Hiring Index</a> can help you gain a complete picture in these areas.</li>
<li>Examine the current diversity representation of your existing team and the extent to which your team is included and engaged in DEI efforts through an anonymous survey.</li>
<li>Use the combined insights above to determine up to five areas where you have the most opportunity to improve.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ensure your DEI goals holistically account for diversity, equity and inclusion</h3>
<p>Since employers typically only center their DEI goals around increasing representation, ensure your goals are holistic to also account for your people, processes and representation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li>Identify your greatest gaps and opportunities in improving the equity and accessibility in your hiring and talent process.</li>
<li>Identify the critical path in your team’s involvement in this effort, starting with awareness and followed by being equipped, engaged and accountable.</li>
<li>Identify where you have the greatest opportunity to increase representation: You may choose to address this goal with a framework or process-based goal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bring your team on board from the beginning</h3>
<p>In the spirit of the true inclusion of your team in these goals, you will want to ensure they are part of building them from the start. This is how you’ll create excitement and accountability around reaching these goals. Here are some ways to bring your team on board in the process.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create shared ownership by including your team in goal-setting meetings and conversations, whether through direct involvement or through working groups.</li>
<li>Listen to your team’s vision for DEI and be sure to engage your existing employee resource groups or diversity councils, if you have them, and learn where their passions lie.</li>
<li>Create a system to track and report DEI progress.</li>
<li>Make reports and goals available to employees and stakeholders.</li>
<li>Make goals and data available to everyone internally and, if possible, share externally.</li>
<li>Distribute DEI accountability across the whole organization.</li>
<li>Reward your team for hitting DEI milestones.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A call to action for 2022</h2>
<p>As the saying goes, we can’t manage what we can’t measure. As we step back to consider our diversity efforts, it’s clear that measuring outcomes alone doesn’t ensure we make progress on them. Instead, we need to focus on the actual activities necessary to drive the change we want to see &#8212; the equity of our systems and inclusion of our people.</p>
<p>With the new year beginning, this is the perfect time to have a conversation with our teams on the new goals we can set. Let’s make 2022 not only a year when we measure diversity outcomes — let’s actually advance them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though we didn’t make it to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces-2022/">CES 2022</a> in person this year, we certainly heard about the “eMobility Experience,” a test track for demo rides of all the e-scooters, e-bikes and whatever other micromobility vehicles came to play in Las Vegas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of products were shown, many of which weren’t actually new, like Bird’s new consumer suite of vehicles (the Bird Bike, Bird Flex and Birdie), Zoomo’s utility electric-assist bikes, Euphree’s City Robin step-through e-bike and Arevo and Superstrata’s 3D-printed carbon fiber e-bikes. There were a handful of interesting companies showing off new versions of their electric scooters, bikes, motorcycles and connected tech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main theme throughout this year is smart, connected vehicles. These little EVs are being built with more powerful onboard computers that are synced up to apps that can help riders do things like find their vehicle, track fitness goals and control bike functions like locks and lights. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254889" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s a roundup of new bikes, scooters and some connected tech that came to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces-2022/">CES 2022</a>.</p>
<h2>Segway</h2>

<p><b>Segway</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the electric micromobility manufacturer that not only sells personal vehicles but also supplies a number of the world’s shared operators with vehicles, came to CES with a new kick scooter line, the P-Series, and a new moped-type e-scooter, the E11a. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The P60 and P100S scooters have wider footboards and handles, automobile-grade all-season tires, and front- and rear-spring suspension. They’ve also got turn signaling, a tail light and multiple ways to lock and unlock the vehicle. The E110a has room for two, plenty of storage space and lots of smart features, according to the company. Segway didn’t share more info on what exactly those smart features were, but if it’s anything like its last generation, it’ll have a battery management system and the ability to connect to smartphones and thus the Segway-Ninebot app.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The Swedish maker of lightweight electric motorbikes brought its &#8220;CAKE :work series&#8221; to the U.S. for the first time. This series of professional motorbikes have been shown before, just not in the states. The bigger <strong>Cake</strong> news during CES involved updates to its Ridecake connectivity app, including features to allow professional fleet managers to monitor and manage their vehicles.</p>
<p>The new connectivity features are available to all riders with a data service-enabled Cake Connect module on their vehicles; this includes all current and upcoming models, as well as a majority of the existing Cake bikes. The update to the app will add customized ride modes, real-time riding information, ride history and anti-theft security.</p>
<p>Professionals using Cake&#8217;s cloud-based management system will get real-time data, including live location of their fleet with position of all bikes, mileage, range and battery status for all bikes, and access to diagnostic data. Over the air, the system will also allow for firmware updates, access to anti-theft functionality and setting custom ride modes.</p>
<h2>Delfast</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2254893" style="width: 1544px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254893" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2254893 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1534-1024.jpg" alt="Delfast electric scooters, bikes at CES 2022" width="1534" height="1024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1534-1024.jpg 1534w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1534-1024.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1534-1024.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1534-1024.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1534-1024.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1534-1024.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1534px) 100vw, 1534px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254893" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Delfast</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">American-Ukrainian startup </span><b>Delfast</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> rolled out an upgraded model of its electric Top 3.0 bike, which the company claims can go up to 200 miles on a single charge. The smart bike has an onboard computer that can be set to receive software updates and immobilize the vehicle for theft-protection. It also can sync with Delfast’s new mobile app to provide on-demand analytics, lock and unlock the bike, arm and disarm the bike alarm, track total mileage, odometer and speedometer metrics, monitor the bike power and estimate range, locate the bike, control lighting and other smart features.</span></p>
<h2>Niu</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2255027" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/niu-bqi-c1-bike-ces.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255027" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2255027 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/niu-bqi-c1-bike-ces.jpg" alt="niu bqi-c1 electric scooters, bikes at CES 2022" width="2000" height="1148" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/niu-bqi-c1-bike-ces.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/niu-bqi-c1-bike-ces.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/niu-bqi-c1-bike-ces.jpg?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/niu-bqi-c1-bike-ces.jpg?resize=768,441 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/niu-bqi-c1-bike-ces.jpg?resize=680,390 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/niu-bqi-c1-bike-ces.jpg?resize=1536,882 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/niu-bqi-c1-bike-ces.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2255027" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screenshot/Niu</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chinese e-scooter company </span><b>Niu</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> showed up this year with its new <a href="https://www.niu.com/en/ces2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BQi-C1 e-bike</a>, a vehicle the company has already teased but finally shared pricing and tech specs at CES. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The step-through bike is powered by a 500W continuous and 750W Bafang hub motor in the rear and can reach top speeds of 28 miles per hour in the U.S. Stricter e-bike regulations in Europe mean that those versions will have just a 250W motor and a top speed of 15.5 miles per hour. The U.S. version will have both a throttle and a pedal assist, while the European version just has pedal assist. The BQi will also be app-connected and feature many smart security features. It’ll be priced at $1,499 in the U.S., which is a pretty good deal for such a powerful e-bike. </span></p>
<h2>Okai</h2>
<p>[gallery ids="2254901,2254896,2254899,2254897,2254898,2254900"]</p>
<p><b>Okai</b>, <span style="font-weight: 400;">another Chinese manufacturer that supplies vehicles to many big-name shared operators, came to CES with five products, but only one of three can be ridden. Let’s start there. The EB20 e-bike is made from professional-grade mountain bike components with a lightweight carbon fiber frame. It’s a 12-speed bike with a 750W motor, swappable Samsung batteries and a large 2.8-inch LED touchscreen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okai also launched its ES600 sharing e-scooter to address the needs of the growing scooter-share industry. It features a swappable battery system with built-in handles on each battery, optimized weight distribution, a low center of gravity and a hydraulic suspension system. It also has side and front light indicators, LED headlights and taillights and side-mounted reflectors. The ES800 is an off-road performance scooter with a serious 1800W motor, 12-inch off-road tires, a 35% incline climb rate and dual shock absorbers. The weight of this heavy-duty vehicle is 30% heavier than most e-scooters to provide more stability. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, onto the products you can’t ride. Okai unveiled its SH10 smart helmet, made with antibacterial materials, to make for a safer and more hygienic commute. These are likely also geared toward the shared audience that are increasingly being required by cities to include helmets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The helmet is integrated with Bluetooth to connect to the Okai app, from which riders can customize and configure front and rear LED displays to improve visibility. A smart integrated speaker also allows riders to listen to music without affecting aural awareness on the road.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, Okai came to Vegas with its SP10 Smart Backpack that features an ultraviolet light disinfection chamber, a fingerprint sensor for secure access, integrated device charging and a customizable RGB strip that can be synced with the vehicle status. </span></p>
<h2>Bosch</h2>
<p><b>Bosch </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">showed up with its connected smart e-bike system, which isn’t exactly new, but it was awarded honoree status at the CES Innovation Awards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system consists of the eBike Flow app that acts as a key, a control unit, display, rechargeable battery and drive unit. Like others at CES, the connected bike can be updated over-the-air, record personal ride info and fitness data, customize riding modes and display information like battery charge status and next service appointment on the home screen. </span></p>
<h2>Moonbikes</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2255031" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/moonbikes.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255031" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2255031" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/moonbikes.jpg" alt="moonbikes electric scooters, bikes at CES 2022" width="700" height="468" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/moonbikes.jpg 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/moonbikes.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/moonbikes.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/moonbikes.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2255031" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Moonbikes</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, just to keep things interesting, there was <strong>Moonbikes</strong>. Now, again,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/the-station-a-tesla-nhtsa-fight-brews-catching-up-with-kodiak-and-how-la-is-prepping-for-air-taxis/"> the company’s electric snow vehicle is not exactly new</a>, but CES was really the first time people really got to check it out in person. It’s a single-track snowmobile that has a 3 kW (4hp) electric motor and reaches a 26 mile-per-hour top speed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At only 182 pounds, it’s much lighter than your traditional snowmobile, which might make it easier to maneuver and play around on. It’s designed with a snow track on the rear and a single ski in front, and its battery can go about 12 miles in sport mode or 22 miles in eco mode. A full charge would take about five hours. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple Fitness+ is <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/01/apple-fitness-plus-introduces-collections-and-time-to-run-starting-january-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introducing</a> a new &#8220;Collections&#8221; feature along with a new &#8220;Time to Run&#8221; series starting on January 10th. Collections are a curated series of workouts and meditations from the Fitness+ library organized to help users reach a goal. The feature draws on nearly 2,000 workouts to give users a new way to get motivated as they begin their next workout. Apple says Collections will give users a suggested plan to help them make specific training choices.</p>
<p>The six Collections that will be available at launch include &#8220;30-Day Core Challenge,&#8221; &#8220;Improve Your Posture with Pilates,&#8221; &#8220;Perfect Your Yoga Balance Poses,&#8221; &#8220;Run Your First 5K,&#8221; &#8220;Strengthen Your Back, Strech Your Hips&#8221; and &#8220;Wind Down for a Better Bedtime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s new &#8220;Time to Run&#8221; series is an extension of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/apples-new-fitness-feature-brings-celebrity-guided-walks-to-your-wrist/">&#8220;Time to Walk&#8221; feature</a> that launched last year. The company describes the new series as an audio running experience designed to help users train to become more consistent and better runners. Each episode in the series is focused on a popular running route and includes coaching tips led by a Fitness+ trainer. The episodes feature playlists designed to match each run&#8217;s intensity, location and coaching. Each episode also includes photos taken by the Fitness+ trainer depicting the route.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255025" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Time to Run is launching with three episodes: London, coached by Cory Wharton-Malcolm; Brooklyn, coached by Emily Fayette; and Miami Beach, coached by Sam Sanchez. A new episode of the series will be released each week on Mondays. Apple notes that for Apple Watch customers who use a wheelchair, Time to Run becomes Time to Run or Push and gives users the option to begin an &#8220;Outdoor Push Running Pace&#8221; workout.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2255039" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2255039" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2255039" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apple_fitness-plus-winter-update_TTR_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apple_fitness-plus-winter-update_TTR_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg 1960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apple_fitness-plus-winter-update_TTR_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apple_fitness-plus-winter-update_TTR_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apple_fitness-plus-winter-update_TTR_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apple_fitness-plus-winter-update_TTR_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apple_fitness-plus-winter-update_TTR_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Apple_fitness-plus-winter-update_TTR_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2255039" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>“At the beginning of a new year, we know many people are looking for new ways to go after their goals,&#8221; said Jay Blahnik, Apple’s vice president of fitness technologies, in a statement. &#8220;With these new additions, Fitness+ makes it easy to get motivated and stay active anywhere, with the most complete library of high-quality and diverse content to train your mind and body, no matter where you are on your fitness journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to Collections and Time to Run launching on January 10th, Apple is introducing the third season of Time to Walk, its series that aims to encourage users to get active by walking more often. New guests will be added each week in the third season. The guests include Hasan Minhaj, Chelsea Handler, Bernice A. King and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fitness+ is also adding additional content to its Artist Spotlight series, which dedicates an entire workout playlist to one artist, with new workouts featuring music from Ed Sheeran, Pharrell Williams, Shakira and the Beatles. The workout types include cycling, dance, HIIT, strength, treadmill and yoga.</p>
<p>Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/apple-fitness-launches-on-december-14/">launched</a> Fitness+ on December 14, 2020, and has since worked to compete with other subscription fitness offerings, including Peloton. Fitness+ is available as a <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-fitness-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">standalone subscription</a> for $9.99 per month, or as a part of the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple One Premier</a> plan for $29.95 per month, which gives users access to Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+ and iCloud+ with 2TB of storage.</p>
