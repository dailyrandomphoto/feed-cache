					<description><![CDATA[I am surprised that more VCs aren't investing in Africa. It smells like investing arbitrage. The pandemic has ripped the Band-Aid off investing via Zoom, making Africa is precisely as close to your in-house office as Europe, North America, Latin America or anywhere else.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The global venture capital ecosystem is inequitable. In the United States&#8217; mature venture capital market, an entrepreneur&#8217;s race, gender and age help determine who has access to capital.</p>
<p>But there are other limiting factors: geography, for example. While it has been encouraging in recent years to cover what has felt like a boom in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/meet-belvo-a-yc-backed-startup-building-a-financial-api-for-latin-america/">Latin American</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/uk-challenger-bank-starling-raises-376m-now-valued-at-1-9b/">European fintechs</a>, or a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/as-startups-accelerate-in-record-q3-europe-and-asia-rack-up-huge-vc-results/">general rise in VC activity</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/27/indian-startups-raised-9-3-billion-in-2020/">in a host of Asian countries</a>, the landscape remains imbalanced.</p>
<p>The pragmatist in you is already forming complaints. Yes, the world is not uniformly developed. Yes, venture capital-startup hubs can take decades to reach maturity. And, yes, progress is being made in some regions.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But as the world grows more connected, the tech gap between nations isn&#8217;t narrowing fast enough. And yet, given rising populations of people ready to jump into a more digital future, investment in some less-mature startup markets is lower than you&#8217;d think. (Less investment into less-mature startup markets is not a tautology; you can get to ecosystem maturity faster with easier capital access because it allows for quicker startup formation cycles.)</p>

<p>Using his figures, African startups are on pace to raise $2.5 billion in 2021 if current trends hold, a healthy increase from the 2020 figure. <a href="https://twitter.com/ClaytonACollins/">Clayton Collins</a>, a media exec, <a href="https://twitter.com/ClaytonACollins/status/1371533295469617160">pointed out an interesting contrast</a>: Stripe raised more yesterday than Barry had reported for the entire African continent this year.</p>
<p>Put another way: A single U.S.-Irish company outraised an entire continent&#8217;s year-to-date venture capital sum in one day.</p>
<p>Taking numbers from Twitter is never the best way to be informed, however. So this morning, let&#8217;s do a little digging. I&#8217;ve pulled Crunchbase and PitchBook data to peek at what they say about African startup investment thus far in 2021. And we also have our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/rising-african-venture-investment-powers-fintech-cleantech-bets-in-2020/">prior look into the 2020 African startup ecosystem</a> to point to. (For more on African startups in general, we also chatted with the CEO of public African e-commerce player Jumia <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/jumia-co-ceo-jeremy-hodara-talks-african-e-commerce-and-his-companys-path-to-profitability/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Ready to get into some startup numbers after weeks of nonstop IPO coverage? I am. Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<h2>The African startup market</h2>
<p>Barry&#8217;s number of $500 million felt directional when we were discussing it, as all round numbers are. So let&#8217;s poke at it a bit.</p>
<p><a href="https://pitchbook.com/">PitchBook data</a> of African investments thus far in 2021 includes 72 deals worth $750.6 million, though if we drill down to just companies with African headquarters, the number dips. Crunchbase lists <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/2309337181cf74544345a98dc7de2adf">$746.1 million</a> in total equity funding for African companies so far in 2021, but if we filter out private equity along with all non-equity investments, the number falls to around <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/search/funding_rounds/f5bf2f62ade1017e73808f837938242a">$136.2 million</a>.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roblox, the gaming company that went public <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/10/investing/roblox-stock-direct-listing/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this month with a strong debut</a>, changed the game (so to speak) for the role that creative input can play in making a game more loved, more engaging, and even more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/gamefam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enterprising</a>. Today, a startup that is taking a version of that model &#8212; focused on in-game apps and modifications &#8212; is announcing some funding and the launch of a new toolkit to double down on that opportunity.</p>
<p>Today, a startup called <a href="https://www.overwolf.com/pages/homepage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overwolf</a>, which has built a popular platform for gaming fans to build modifications (mods) and additional tools for all kinds of PC games, is announcing $52.5 million in growth funding and the launch of a new content creation SDK &#8212; underscoring its growth and more specifically the demand in the market to bring more user-generated content variations into the gaming universe.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s platform has some 30,000 creators, 90,000 mods and add-ons, and 18 million monthly users across thousands of games, including Fortnite, World of Warcraft and Minecraft. In the last year, which has seen a surge of gaming activity as more people stay home throughout the pandemic, Overwolf&#8217;s revenue has grown by 300%, it said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We want to be what YouTube is for YouTubers,&#8221; said Uri Marchand, the CEO and co-founder of Tel Aviv-based Overwolf, in an interview with TechCrunch. &#8220;Just as YouTube is a one-stop shop for video, we want to be a one-stop shop for creating apps and mods.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Series C is being co-led by Insight Partners and Griffin Gaming Partners, a VC that specialists in gaming content. Other investors in the round include Ubisoft, Warner Music Group, Meg Whitman, and Gen.G Co-Founder, Kevin Chou. Valuation is not being disclosed.</p>
<p>Importantly, alongside the funding, Overwolf is introducing a new service called CurseForge Core, an SDK that can be integrated directly into a game itself to make it easier for gaming enthusiasts and developers to build user-generated content for it. CurseForge Core is essentially the next iteration of CurseForge, the mods platform that Overwolf <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/in-game-app-development-platform-overwolf-acquires-curseforge-assets-from-twitch-to-get-into-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired from Amazon&#8217;s Twitch last year</a> for an undisclosed sum.</p>
<p>The buyer and acquirer here continue to have a close relationship, even as Overwolf also looks to work more closely with others like Discord, which says something about what makes up the bigger ecosystem of communication and activity among gamers outside of the core experience of a game itself.</p>
<p>Prior to launching this SDK, Overwolf already had built out a large community of users &#8212; both on its own steam and by way of its acquisition of CurseForge. While that is entirely focused on PC games at the moment, the plan will be to expand its reach to other platforms, including Macs, console games and mobile gaming, in the next year.</p>
<p>The gap in the market that Overwolf has identified and built for is the demand from avid gamers for more tools to improve their experience of the game, sometimes very specific ones that might not be core to everyone&#8217;s experience but definitely wanted by enough people to merit their creation.</p>
<p>These can be, for example, maps to navigate your way around a game, or dashboards or leaderboards to keep better track of various statistics of characters and other players, tools to modify characters, or apps to communicate with other players when you&#8217;re inside a game. Marchand points out that he first got into this world as a mod maker himself, years ago creating a Skype app for World of Warcraft years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;We pivoted from making mods to making a platform for others to make mods and additions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When you think about all the aspects that need to be addressed &#8212; they include telemetry, the interactive UI, analytics, installers &#8212; they can be very complicated. So we provided platform essentials to help developers figure it all out.&#8221;</p>
<p>While games developers might have a very specific vision of how they would like their games to look at play, as Marchand described it to me, it&#8217;s also a big part of PC gaming culture to be able to play around with those experiences to make them unique to each player. But handling the work of third-party ecosystems is not typically in their core competencies.</p>
<p>&#8220;The scale and diversity of that content makes it impossible for a game maker to capture and do it all,&#8221; said Marchand. &#8220;History has proven that while game makers would like to encourage UGC they can’t and that is why we exist.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even if building an SDK that sits inside games themselves is a logical next step, it also represents a kind of increased trust between Overwolf and games publishers.</p>
<p>“Overwolf is developing the holy grail of frameworks for UGC for both publishers and in-game creators. Enabling all major publishers like us, to allow the creation of mods in a safe, secure, authorized, and profitable manner; is a game changer for all creators and IP holders,” said Oscar Navarro, Head of Corporate Development for Ubisoft, in a statement.</p>
<p>Indeed, the tradeoff for games publishers are more tools that will potentially keep users further engaged. The SDK will cover tools such as cross-platform modding, to let players discover and install mods in-game, across all platforms and storefronts; an analytics dashboard to have better visibility on how well various mods are performing; moderation tools to better vet what third-party content gets submitted; and monetization tools to bring in more creators. As with other platforms that incentivize creators, these include an Author Rewards Program, fund investments, developer contests, and hackathons.</p>

<p>“We&#8217;ve been following UGC in gaming for many years and believe Overwolf has established itself as a leader in this category,” said Teddie Wardi, MD at Insight Partners, in a statement. “AAA game studios will want to allow creators to build and express themselves, and Overwolf is positioned as the platform to make this possible by ensuring that creators are recognized for their contributions, and easily integrating creations into games. Overwolf has proved themselves to be strong champions of the creator community and we look forward to helping them scale up in 2021.”</p>
<p>Financial incentives will continue to stand out for these creators, who today make most of their money not from paid mods and apps, but from in-mod or in-app advertising, a network that is run by Overwolf itself. Marchand said that the most successful developers can bring in revenues of $100,000 each month.</p>
<p>While Marchand likens Overwolf aims to YouTube, investors see a parallel in Unity, another key toolkit for the games developer community.</p>
<p>“Similar to how developers use Unity to build a game, we see Overwolf as the framework for everything UGC related to games. Overwolf allows for one of the only means of monetization for the thousands of creators, in turn, this translates to increased engagement for the publishers and more content for gamers.  Services like Overwolf set the stage for the industry to see a new generation of user-generated content and we are excited to invest in the leading company moving this space forward,” commented Nick Tuosto, Co-Founder of Griffin Gaming Partners and Managing Director at LionTree, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is <a href="https://www.blog.google/technology/families/make-tech-work">making changes</a> to its parental control system, Family Link, that aims to better reflect parents&#8217; changing views on children&#8217;s screen time. In the pre-pandemic world, parents were more likely to see screen time as something in need of restriction &#8212; they&#8217;d rather their kids get offline or go outside to play with friends, perhaps. But the challenges of a locked-down world and the push towards virtual learning have impacted parents&#8217; views. Google says today&#8217;s parents are more concerned about <em>how</em> kids are spending time on their devices, not <em>how much</em> time is being spent.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a concession to a world where devices have become a savior of sorts to families who&#8217;ve stayed at home to avoid Covid &#8212; where they&#8217;ve been restricted from seeing extended family and friends, and where schools are closed and playdates and parties were cancelled. Parents came to realize that screen time in and of itself isn&#8217;t necessarily something to be avoided; they just wanted more control over how it&#8217;s used.</p>
<p>With the Family Link update, parents can now choose to make remote learning apps &#8220;always allowed,&#8221; so they don&#8217;t count toward overall screen time daily limits. This could include not only those apps that are used to attend school or communicate with teachers, but others that have popped up to help kids learn and be entertained, like the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/wide-open-school-organizes-free-educational-resources-to-help-parents-and-teachers-homeschool/">supplemental</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/06/national-geographic-launches-a-homeschool-hub-for-parents-and-teachers-natgeohome/">resources</a> the school suggests &#8212; or the apps parents allow during break times from virtual class.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Parents will also now have access to more detailed daily, weekly and monthly activity reports that provide both an overview of how the child is spending their time in apps, as well as how screen time usage has changed over a week or month, and what portion of time was spent in the &#8220;always allowed&#8221; apps. This gives parents a better idea of what screen time was used for education versus play.</p>
<p>On Android, Family Link users will also be able to browse through a selection of teacher-recommended apps from the Google Play catalog for kids under 13 in the U.S. And parents can also now set screen time limits directly from the child&#8217;s device on Android.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125648" style="width: 428px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125648" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2125648" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-10.22.28-AM.jpg?w=418" alt="" width="418" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-10.22.28-AM.jpg 780w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-10.22.28-AM.jpg?resize=92,150 92w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-10.22.28-AM.jpg?resize=184,300 184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-10.22.28-AM.jpg?resize=768,1250 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-10.22.28-AM.jpg?resize=418,680 418w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-16-at-10.22.28-AM.jpg?resize=31,50 31w" sizes="(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2125648" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Though these updates will remain useful in a post-pandemic world where parents hold a more nuanced view of screen time, it&#8217;s unfortunate that Google waited until so late in the pandemic to roll these changes out. As more people in the U.S. are being vaccinated, restrictions are lifting &#8212; including the re-opening of schools in many places. That means parents&#8217; stress over kids&#8217; increased screen time usage will soon become a moot point. The devices will be replaced with in-person learning, and screen time may become villainized yet again.</p>
<p>Related to today&#8217;s news, Google has launched a new website for families whose kids are beginning to use technology at <a href="http://families.google/?utm_source=google_keyword&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=families_hub_launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://families.google?utm_source%3Dgoogle_keyword%26utm_medium%3DBlog%26utm_campaign%3Dfamilies_hub_launch&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615931805982000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGR2Ob30dbH_1roYRzaLjbh0dKmbA">families.google</a>. The company also launched a new content series with meditation app Headspace that will help families with kids practice mindfulness together. Again, that&#8217;s a resource that was desperately needed in 2020 during the pandemic&#8217;s heights, more so than it is today as the world begins reopening.</p>
<p>Still, the pandemic has forced families to think more about screen time and what sort of on-device experiences they want their children to have. As a result of this increased scrutiny, social apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/">TikTok</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/instagram-adds-new-teen-safety-tools-as-competition-with-tiktok-heats-up/">Instagram</a> &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/instagram-adds-new-teen-safety-tools-as-competition-with-tiktok-heats-up/">the latter just today</a>, in fact &#8212; have rolled out more family-friendly safety features, aimed at encouraging parents to see their apps in a better light, rather than being the first to go when screen time gets locked down. It has also encouraged new hybrid learning and education startups to launch, hoping to build out a new category of edutainment apps that can avoid screen time lockdowns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A security breach at cryptocurrency platform Roll allowed a hacker to obtain the private key to its hot wallet and steal its contents — worth about $5.7 million.</p>
<p>In a statement, the company <a href="https://tryroll.com/security-incident/">said</a> it was investigating the breach, which happened early Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;As of this writing, it seems like a compromise of the private keys [sic] of our hot wallet and not a bug in the Roll smart contracts or any token contracts,&#8221; the statement said. Roll said the attacker had already sold the tokens for Ethereum.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no further user action suggested at this stage. We are temporarily disabling withdraw from the Roll wallet of all social money until we have migrated our hot wallet,&#8221; the statement added.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear how the attacker broke in and obtained the private key — akin to the password for Roll&#8217;s hot wallet. Hot wallets are designed to be connected to the internet to send and receive cryptocurrency, but typically only store a fraction of a cryptocurrency owner&#8217;s total reserves, given the inherent security risk of an internet-connected wallet. A cold wallet, or storage device that isn&#8217;t connected to the internet, is typically used for holding the bulk of an owner&#8217;s cryptocurrency for longer-term periods.</p>
<p>Roll allows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/why-terry-crews-is-launching-a-social-currency/">creators to mint and distribute</a> their own Ethereum-based cryptocurrency, known as social tokens, under which the creators can decide how the currency is spent. There are hundreds of different kinds of social currency on the platform, including $WHALE, $RARE, and $PICA tokens — which plummeted in value in the aftermath of the breach.</p>
<p>The creator of the $WHALE token said <a href="https://twitter.com/WhaleShark_Pro/status/1371032207838437376">in a tweet</a> more than 2% of its tokens were stolen in the Roll breach, but that the hack was &#8220;minimally detrimental&#8221; to the project.</p>
<p>Others weren&#8217;t so lucky. One person said <a href="https://twitter.com/HacquardMaxime/status/1371246050611200003">they had &#8220;lost everything,&#8221;</a> while others criticized Roll&#8217;s new $500,000 fund to help affected creators for not going far enough.</p>
<p>Roll said it will hire a third-party to audit its security infrastructure to prevent another breach. &#8220;We will also run a forensic analysis to figure out how the key was compromised,&#8221; the statement said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jennifer Dulski has held her fair share of leadership positions, from being president and COO of Change.org to serving as head of product for Google&#8217;s shopping and product ads to leading the team responsible for Facebook Groups.</p>
<p>But she&#8217;s identified a problem that most people managers will all too clearly understand: training and tools to be a great manager are at a shortage.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why she founded <a href="https://risingteam.com/">Rising Team</a>, which is today announcing the raise of a $3 million seed round led by Female Founders Fund, with participation from Peterson Ventures, Burst Capital, Xoogler Ventures, 500 Startups, Roble Ventures, Supernode Ventures and several angels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Dulski explained that there are some tools for managers, like surveys from Gallup and Glint, and there are training options, like executive coaches. But there aren&#8217;t many options out there that combine the two.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was lucky enough to have the benefit of getting executive coaches or being sent to training, and those felt like being taught how to fish,&#8221; said Dulski. &#8220;But then it was like being dropped off at the lake with no fishing pole or bait, because I had learned all these things about how to be a good leader but I had no tools to implement what I had learned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rising Team is a platform that combines tools and training to help managers motivate, organize and ultimately effectively lead their team.</p>
<p>The first layer of the platform is the tools suite, which includes proprietary assessments and 1:1 templates. Most employee surveys focus so heavily on the actual job, with questions like &#8220;I&#8217;m able to do my best work.&#8221; With Rising Team, the assessments are geared toward who team members are personally, with a look at how they want to be appreciated or what they believe their talents and skills are.</p>
<p>This helps managers understand how to pair team members together, what tasks they should be assigned to, and truly grasp what motivates each individual that works for them. Alongside these assessment tools, Rising Team also offers training in the form of videos, articles, and audio resources. In the future, the company plans to build out AI-based custom training tips that are powered by data from the assessments.</p>
<p>Rising Team is also building out a community that lets managers communicate with one another.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the startup is taking a bottom-up approach when it comes to revenue, pricing the product in a way that will allow individual managers to personally purchase the software, and hopefully spread the word to the rest of their team. But the door is open for organizations to get the full employee base on the product as well.</p>
<p>For now, Rising Team is in a free beta, so pricing has not yet been announced.</p>
<p>The team is currently made up of 8 people, 60 percent of whom are female and 50 percent of whom are BIPOC.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really, really important to me and to our team as a whole that we build a diverse team from the start,&#8221; said Dulski. &#8220;I believe in that so firmly and all the data is really clear that more diverse teams are more successful.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A growing number of companies are revolutionizing the way farm and forestland is acquired, developed and commercialized across the United States.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jim Jackson developed timber and farmland in Eastern Washington, protected from coastal rains by the peaks of the Cascade mountains, building out a clutch of apple farms and other properties on the state&#8217;s sunny side for 40 years.</p>
<p>Traditionally, he raised money to expand operations for his farms through his existing network, which meant asking previous investors to pool together and come up with the cash.</p>
<p>But more recently, Jackson turned to a fundraising platform that operates entirely online. Like hundreds of other farmers, he&#8217;s using a service called <a href="https://www.acretrader.com/">AcreTrader</a> to raise money for agricultural development projects. AcreTrader is one of a growing number of companies revolutionizing the way farm and forestland are acquired, developed and commercialized across the United States.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s lots of farmland in the U.S. Bill Gates, Microsoft founder and the world&#8217;s third-richest man, is the nation&#8217;s largest owner of farmland, holding <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bill-gates-is-now-the-largest-farmland-owner-in-america-11610818582">roughly 242,000 acres</a>. That number seems high until you compare it with the <a href="https://www.agriculture.com/news/business/number-of-us-farms-down-3-percent-in-five-years">897.4 million acres</a> of land that are currently arable and used for farming in the U.S.</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/features/state-forest">823 million acres</a> of forests dot the United States, the majority of which are privately owned.</p>
<p>Taken together, that&#8217;s a massive amount of real estate with economic potential that&#8217;s traditionally been accessible only to the ultra-wealthy to acquire and finance for development. Now, startups like AcreTrader and others including <a href="https://tillable.com/">Tillable</a>, ($8.3 million) <a href="https://farmtogether.com/">FarmTogether</a> ($3.7 million), and <a href="https://www.harvestreturns.com/">Harvest Returns</a> are bringing marketplace models to the farming world &#8212; potentially bringing hundreds of thousands of investable acres to financiers looking to diversify.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, TikTok made an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/">update to its privacy settings</a> and defaults to further lock down the app for its teenage users. This morning, Instagram followed suit with teen-focused privacy updates of its own. But the Facebook-owned social app didn&#8217;t choose to add more privacy to teen accounts by default, as TikTok did &#8212; it largely made it more difficult for adults to interact with the app&#8217;s teen users.</p>
<p>The company said it&#8217;s rolling out new safety features that would restrict adult users from being able to contact teens who didn&#8217;t already follow them. The exception to this rule would still allow the teen to interact with adult family members and other trusted adults on the platform, like family friends. In the case that an adult tried to DM a teen who didn&#8217;t follow them, they&#8217;d receive a notification informing them this wasn&#8217;t possible.</p>
<p>And if the teen has already connected with an adult and is DM&#8217;ing with them, they&#8217;ll be notified if that adult is exhibiting suspicious behavior &#8212; like sending a large amount of friend requests or messages to users under 18. This tool will also then allow the teen to end the conversation, block, report or restrict the adult from further contact.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2125612" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125612" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2125612" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safety-Notices.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="653" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safety-Notices.png 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safety-Notices.png?resize=150,144 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safety-Notices.png?resize=300,288 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safety-Notices.png?resize=768,737 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safety-Notices.png?resize=680,653 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safety-Notices.png?resize=1536,1475 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safety-Notices.png?resize=2048,1966 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safety-Notices.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safety-Notices.png?resize=50,48 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2125612" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, Instagram said it will make it more difficult for adults to find and follow teens in other places within the Instagram app, including Explore, Reels, and more. This will include restricting adults from seeing teen accounts in the &#8220;Suggested Users&#8221; section of the app, as well as hiding their comments on public posts.</p>
<p>The company also noted it&#8217;s developing new A.I. and machine learning-based technology that would make it possible to find teens lying about their age on the app. This could result in these features being applied, even if the teen in question had lied about their birth date when signing up for the app, but the technology isn&#8217;t fully live yet.</p>
<p>Other additions rolling out as part of today&#8217;s updates include new safety resources for parents in the app&#8217;s Parents Guide and educational material for teens that will better explain what it means to have a public account on the app, and encourage them to choose private options.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125611" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125611" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2125611" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Adult-Minor-Restrictions-in-DM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Adult-Minor-Restrictions-in-DM.png 3240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Adult-Minor-Restrictions-in-DM.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Adult-Minor-Restrictions-in-DM.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Adult-Minor-Restrictions-in-DM.png?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Adult-Minor-Restrictions-in-DM.png?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Adult-Minor-Restrictions-in-DM.png?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Adult-Minor-Restrictions-in-DM.png?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Adult-Minor-Restrictions-in-DM.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2125611" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>The launch timing here is notable, as TikTok has recently focused on making its platform safer for teens &#8212; not only with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/">changes</a> to its default settings, but also with the addition of parental controls last year. The company last year took the unusual step of bundling a parental control mechanism directly into its app that lets a parent link to a child&#8217;s TikTok account to control their profile&#8217;s privacy, what they&#8217;re allowed to do on the app, and even which feed they can view. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/tiktok-expands-parental-controls-to-include-search-commenting-and-account-privacy/">has continued to expand</a> these <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/tiktok-to-launch-parental-controls-globally-disable-direct-messaging-for-users-under-16/">controls</a> following their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/19/tiktok-introduces-parental-controls-with-new-family-safety-mode-feature-launching-first-in-u-k/">launch</a>, indicating that it considers these core features. By making privacy and parental controls a key part of the experience, the app is more likely to be blessed by parents who would otherwise restrict their teens&#8217; social media access &#8212; and that helps TikTok grow its user base and teens&#8217; time spent in the app, sometimes at Instagram&#8217;s expense.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Talk about surprise comebacks. This morning Google announced the arrival of the next-gen Nest Hub. In spite of rebranding from Google Home Hub back in 2019, the smart screen hasn’t seen many changes since its 2018 introduction. Today’s arrival doesn’t represent a huge upgrade from its predecessor, but it does support a familiar &#8212; and largely forgotten &#8212; face.</p>
<p>We haven’t heard a peep from Project Soli since the technology was introduced with the Pixel in late-2019. The miniature, motion-sensing radar tech was positioned to be a major selling point, finally arriving on a device some four years after being announced. Applications were relatively few and far between &#8212; including gesture detection and a weird, one-off Pokémon app.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="N6oAO78Jhp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/21/google-pixel-4-review-more-camera-greatness/">Pixel 4 review: Google ups its camera game</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pixel 4 review: Google ups its camera game&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/21/google-pixel-4-review-more-camera-greatness/embed/#?secret=N6oAO78Jhp" data-secret="N6oAO78Jhp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And then it just sort of went away. The Pixel 5 arrived the following year, without a trace of Motion Sense. Abandoning features certainly isn’t unheard of in consumer electronics, but it seemed odd for something in which Google had clearly invested time and resources.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125360" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125360" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2125360" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Soli_Sleep-Sensing-GIF.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="531" /><p id="caption-attachment-2125360" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Soli’s reemergence in the new Nest Hub is certainly unexpected, but may ultimately make more sense than any of its attempted mobile applications. The primary use here is sleep tracking, the biggest update between the new Nest Hub and the original. As for why Soli, the answer goes deeper than the fact that Google was looking for a new home for its existing tech (though that no doubt also played a role).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="aZv8YNYhcK"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/22/google-home-hub-review/">Google Home Hub review</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google Home Hub review&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/22/google-home-hub-review/embed/#?secret=aZv8YNYhcK" data-secret="aZv8YNYhcK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Like the first-gen product, there’s no camera on the new Nest Hub. Google’s decision to keep the tech off the device is a breath of fresh air in a world where the new Amazon Echo uses figure tracking to actually follow you around the room. As before, you can always opt for the Nest Hub Max if that feature’s important to you. But the company rightfully noted that the first-gen model was often deployed at bedsides.</p>
<p>That means:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sticking a camera on the connected device raises some major privacy concerns.</li>
<li>
<p>It’s an ideal spot for doing some sleep tracking.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Which leads us to:</p>
<ol>
<li>How do you do sleep tracking without a camera?</li>
</ol>
<p>The easy answer is a wearable device. Google now has a much stronger foothold in that world now that its Fitbit acquisition has cleared. But that deal is going to take some time to fully take root. And besides, as someone who has tested a lot of wearables in my day, I can definitely say that, no matter how comfortable, I sleep better without one on my wrist. Certainly the irony of being kept awake by a sleep tracker has not escaped me.</p>
<p>Quick refresher on Soli tech, per Google:</p>
<blockquote><p>Soli consists of a millimeter-wave frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar transceiver that emits an ultra-low power radio wave and measures the reflected signal from the scene of interest. The frequency spectrum of the reflected signal contains an aggregate representation of the distance and velocity of objects within the scene. This signal can be processed to isolate a specified range of interest, such as a user’s sleeping area, and to detect and characterize a wide range of motions within this region, ranging from large body movements to sub-centimeter respiration.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_2125361" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125361" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2125361" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Nest-Hub_Lifestyle_Nightstand-Sunrise-Alarm.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Nest-Hub_Lifestyle_Nightstand-Sunrise-Alarm.jpg 1100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Nest-Hub_Lifestyle_Nightstand-Sunrise-Alarm.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Nest-Hub_Lifestyle_Nightstand-Sunrise-Alarm.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Nest-Hub_Lifestyle_Nightstand-Sunrise-Alarm.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Nest-Hub_Lifestyle_Nightstand-Sunrise-Alarm.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Nest-Hub_Lifestyle_Nightstand-Sunrise-Alarm.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2125361" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>So, basically, you’re trading camera-based sensing for mini-bedside radar. It’s a weird thing to wrap your brain around, certainly. The biggest thing here is that the motion-tracking data is not collecting any images, just data based on movement.</p>
<p>The Sleep Sensing system was trained on more than 100,000 hours of sleep data, according to the company, with TensorFlow being used to analyze data. Among other things. It’s able to eliminate external movement like ceiling fans, after the initial calibration process is completed. In addition to tracking, the system leverages other sleep-centric features that were rolled out to the last Nest Hub via software update, including Sunrise Alarm and the ability to snooze your wake-up call with a gesture.</p>
<p>There are other software updates on-board as well, including a new smart home interface. On the whole, however, there really aren’t too many improvements beyond sleep tracking &#8212; which is actually okay, since the original remains one of the better smart screens on the market. The speaker got a little bit of love, with added bass, but even that is largely the same. The screen size remains the same at 7-inches, while the overall device footprint is a bit larger to accommodate the slight speaker improvement. The body is made from 54% post-consumer plastic.</p>
<p>At $99, the price is certainly right. Google shaved off $49 from the original Hub. It’s up for pre-order starting today and will be available for sale on the 30<sup>th</sup>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.appfire.com/?utm_source=businesswire.com&amp;utm_medium=pressrelease&amp;utm_campaign=ta+announcement"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appfire</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Boston-based provider of software development apps,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced Tuesday</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that it has received a $100 million investment from growth private equity firm</span><a href="http://www.ta.com/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">TA Associates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2005, Appfire was bootstrapped until it got $49 million from Silversmith Capital Partners last May. Since that time, Appfire has acquired six companies in the Atlassian “ecosystem,” including Botron, Beecom, Innovalog, Navarambh, Artemis and Bolo</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Boston-based company has been profitable for over a decade, according to Randall Ward, co-founder and CEO of Appfire. And while Ward declined to reveal valuation or hard revenue numbers, he did say that Appfire has seen its ARR more than double over the past year.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since last June alone, the company says it has experienced:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 103% year over year increase in ARR.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 258% YOY increase in enterprise subscription revenue (data center only). </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 182% YOY increase in all subscription revenue (data center and cloud).  </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why the need for institutional capital? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the latest funding, Appfire intends to extend its buying spree of complementary apps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appfire has been acquiring businesses every six to eight weeks, and it plans to continue scooping them up at that pace, according to Ward.</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also looking to let shareholders cash in on their options.</p>
<p>Fun fact: Atlassian itself was bootstrapped for nearly a decade. The Australian enterprise software company was profitable from its inception in 2001 before taking its <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/atlassian-secondary-market--f1532625">first round of external capital</a>, a $60 million financing led by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/accel-partners">Accel</a>, in July 2010. The financing was primarily secondary.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A pandemic and recession won&#8217;t stop Atlassian&#8217;s SaaS push&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/19/a-pandemic-and-recession-wont-stop-atlassians-saas-push/embed/#?secret=kFEOpuqmtr" data-secret="kFEOpuqmtr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some context</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appfire was initially a professional services company before transitioning into products in 2013. The company says it has “developed domain expertise in creating, launching and distributing apps” through the Atlassian marketplace. Today, the company has 85 products on that marketplace and more than 110,000 active installations globally spanning workflow automation, business intelligence, publishing and administrative tools. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, the company’s Bob Swift, Feed Three and Wittified brand apps aim to help companies like Google, Amazon and Starbucks streamline product development through improved collaboration, security, reporting and automation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We started this business 15 years ago with the goal of building software applications for customers,” Ward told TechCrunch. “At that time, there were no marketplaces, so iTunes marketplace didn&#8217;t exist, Google Play didn&#8217;t exist, but yet we were seeing that applications were getting smaller in size, Mozilla was putting out plugins. My co-founder and I were sitting on the floor of a warehouse in Maynard, Massachusetts and we conceived of this company called Appfire, and boy did we pick the right name.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pair then stumbled upon a project by which a friend of a friend was looking for them to integrate two pieces of software with software from Atlassian.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was brand new to us &#8212; we had never heard of it &#8212; a software called JIRA and another piece of software called Confluence,” Ward recalls. “About three months later we launched a project and then got introduced to the co-founders of Atlassian.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2017, Appfire decided it wanted to focus full time on becoming “the biggest app platform and aggregator.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So we decided to wind down all the other little special side projects for Atlassian delivering services to customers, and really put all of our eggs in this marketplace basket,” Ward recalls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was at that point the company began looking for external capital. With this last raise, though, Ward says Appfire was not necessarily looking for more cash.</span></p>
<p>When approached by TA, Appfire asked if it could create more employee equity programs so the company could be an employee-led business. It also asked if it could take 1% of its equity and contribute to the Pledge 1% initiative.</p>
<p>&#8220;They said yes,&#8221; Ward said. &#8220;So that led us to this latest funding.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Appfire is also moving into business intelligence and data analytics apps for Tableau and Microsoft Power BI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned above, some of its latest funding will go back to existing shareholders, Ward said. The remainder will go into continuing to grow the business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have a lot of organic and inorganic growth opportunities,” he added. “&#8230;That obviously takes some momentum.”</span></p>
<p>Michael Libert, a principal of TA Associates, said his firm had been tracking Appfire’s progress for &#8220;quite some time.&#8221; The company&#8217;s apps, he said, do not require complex training, allowing customers to improve productivity &#8220;at a low cost,&#8221; leading to further customer adoption and enabling &#8220;a solid land-and-expand strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We found the company’s high-quality business model, impressive organic growth and recent significant acquisitive activity particularly attractive,&#8221; Libert told TechCrunch.<u></u></p>

<p>&#8220;We believe data teams are at the epicenter of digital transformation and that to drive impact, they need to be able to unlock the value of data. They need access to relevant, continuous and explainable insights and predictions that are reliable and up-to-date,&#8221; said Noogata co-founder and CEO Assaf Egozi. &#8220;Noogata unlocks the value of data by providing contextual, business-focused blocks that integrate seamlessly into enterprise data environments to generate actionable insights, predictions and recommendations. This empowers users to go far beyond traditional business intelligence by leveraging AI in their self-serve analytics as well as in their data solutions.&#8221;</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve obviously seen a plethora of startups in this space lately. The proliferation of data &#8212; and the advent of data warehousing &#8212; means that most businesses now have the fuel to create machine learning-based predictions. What&#8217;s often lacking, though, is the talent. There&#8217;s still a shortage of data scientists and developers who can build these models from scratch, so it&#8217;s no surprise that we&#8217;re seeing more startups that are creating no-code/low-code services in this space. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/abacus-ai-raises-another-22m-and-launches-new-ai-modules/">well-funded</a> <a href="https://abacus.ai/forecast">Abacus.ai</a>, for example, targets about the same market as Noogata.</p>

<p>&#8220;Noogata is perfectly positioned to address the significant market need for a best-in-class, no-code data analytics platform to drive decision-making,&#8221; writes Team8 managing partner Yuval Shachar. &#8220;The innovative platform replaces the need for internal build, which is complex and costly, or the use of out-of-the-box vendor solutions which are limited. The company’s ability to unlock the value of data through AI is a game-changer.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hundreds of thousands of teenagers and young adults get on flights each year from India to a foreign land to pursue higher education. Upon landing, they face a myriad of challenges: They don’t have a local credit history, so they can’t avail a range of financial services including a loan or a credit card &#8212; at least not without paying a premium for it.</p>
<p>For banks and other financial institutions, there is an increased risk when they engage with foreigners, so they charge more. An Indian student studying in the U.S., for instance, borrows money at an interest rate over 13%, compared to their local peers who can secure the same amount of credit, if not more, at less than half of that interest rate.</p>
<p><a href="https://leapfinance.com">Leap</a>, a two-year-old startup with headquarters in San Francisco and Bangalore, is attempting to solve this problem and many others. The startup grants loans to students at fair interest rate by evaluating the data they generated &#8212; alternative and derived &#8212; in India itself.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/leap-finance-indian-students-loans/">last time we wrote about Leap</a>, the startup has evolved to address several other problems students face, explained Arnav Kumar, co-founder of Leap, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Kumar said Leap today is helping students with guidance on admission, visa, as well as test preparation. Leap has also developed a social network of sorts where over half a million students are talking to one another and use the platform’s other services to get admission in a college abroad.</p>
<p>About ten years ago, when I was looking to join an engineering college, I reached out to several individuals who were already studying in the colleges I had shortlisted. Turns out, over a million students in India do the exact same thing each year when they are about to begin their college life. (If I may complete the loop, I did graduate and have a bachelor’s degree in CSE somewhere in the house.)</p>
<p>Kumar, who previously served an Associate VP at venture firm Elevation Capital, said Leap’s community today is replicating the offline-behavior. Some students, to be sure, reach out to others on LinkedIn, or Facebook. But by just focusing on one problem, Leap is attempting to become the community for students who are looking to pursue higher education. (Its pages are indexed on Google search for better visibility.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1953630" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1953630" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1953630 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/leap_finance.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="648" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/leap_finance.jpg 3989w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/leap_finance.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/leap_finance.jpg?resize=300,190 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/leap_finance.jpg?resize=768,486 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/leap_finance.jpg?resize=680,430 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/leap_finance.jpg?resize=1536,972 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/leap_finance.jpg?resize=2048,1296 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/leap_finance.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1953630" class="wp-caption-text">Leap Finance founders pose for a picture</p></div></p>
<p>There is a massive opportunity for startups to better solve these problems.</p>
<p>“India is the second-largest market globally for overseas enrolment, and in just a decade higher education enrolments are up by 8 million. This presents a huge opportunity in an otherwise fragmented landscape. Leap is addressing this huge opportunity through its end-to-end tech platform and a community-first approach,&#8221; said Amit Anand, Founding Partner of Jungle Ventures, in a statement.</p>
<p>Vaibhav Singh, the other co-founder of Leap, said in an interview that students from India take admission in over 5,000 schools and universities abroad each year to study tens of thousands of courses.</p>
<p>“So the choice spectrum is really, really wide and you need experts who can help you make the right choice. This is the most important decision you or your family will make,” he said.</p>
<p>Investors have spotted an opportunity in this space, too &#8212; and are backing Leap. The startup said on Tuesday that it has raised $17 million in its Series B round. The new financing round was led by Singapore-based Jungle Ventures, along with Sequoia Capital India and Owl Ventures. The startup has to-date raised $22.5 million.</p>
<p>The global pandemic prevented many Indian students from traveling abroad. This year, more than 700,000 students are estimated to leave India to pursue higher education. Leap co-founders said they are working to serve 150,000 of such students this year.</p>
<p>Leap said it plans to deploy the fresh capital to expand its tech team and reach more geographies. The startup currently helps students join colleges in several countries including the U.S., Canada, UK, and Australia. Singh said Leap is also looking to hire some tech and business talent.</p>
<p>“2020 was a tough year for international education with Covid related travel restrictions. We are impressed by the resilience of the Leap team during the last year, where not only have they served hundreds of students with their financing solutions but have also expanded with Leap Scholar providing counselling to thousands of Indian students looking to study abroad. This vertically integrated strategy has materially strengthened the moats for Leap,&#8221; said Ashish Agrawal, Principal at Sequoia India, which wrote its first check to Leap before the startup had a product.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cloudpaper.co/">Cloud Paper</a>, the startup whose bamboo toilet paper (and celebrity and billionaire backers including Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Marc Benioff, Dara Khosrowshahi, and Mark Cuban) made a splash last year, is getting into the paper towel racket.</p>
<p>Starting today, the company<a href="https://cloudpaper.co/products/bamboo-paper-towels"> is taking pre-orders</a> for its 12 pack boxes of sustainably sourced bamboo paper towels, which will retail for $34.99.</p>
<p>The Seattle-based company was founded by two ex-Uber employees, Ryan Fritsch and Austin Watkins, who went on to take roles at the logistics startup Convoy, before launching Cloud Paper. Their toilet paper (and now paper towel company) is one of several businesses trying to get consumers to make the switch to bamboo-based consumer products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The company&#8217;s founders are on a mission to make the paper industry more sustainable, according to co-founder Ryan Fritsch, and they&#8217;re looking to do it one roll at a time.</p>
<p>While other companies look at bamboo as a replacement for cotton or plastics, the Cloud Paper co-founder said this company is squarely focused on toilet paper and paper towels because those products make up most of the crap that&#8217;s most wasteful in the paper industry.</p>
<p>The company has already ordered 1 million rolls of toilet paper for production and shipped hundreds of thousands of toilet paper, but the rationale for adoption has shifted, the company said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It definitely had its moment when the COVID shutdowns happened,&#8221; said Fritsch. &#8220;But [consumption] shifted from a TP panic to &#8216;There&#8217;s an easy and convenient, sustainable, option out there.&#8217; It&#8217;s less of an all-out craze,&#8221; Fritsch said.</p>
<p>No less august a body than the National Resources Defense Council <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/resources/issue-tissue-how-americans-are-flushing-forests-down-toilet">has come out swinging</a> against how much waste is sacrificed to the commode.</p>
<p>For instance, the logging industry in Canada degrades <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/cutting-it-close-logging-canadas-boreal-report.pdf">over a million acres</a> of its climate-critical forest, in part to feed U.S. demand for toilet paper, according to the NRDC. Demand from the U.S. has grown so substantially that, in recent years, Canada has ranked third globally in its rate of intact forest loss—behind only Russia and Brazil—mostly due to logging, the NRDC said.</p>
<p>Ninety percent of that is clearcutting, which exacerbates climate change. By the most conservative estimates,<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8220;logging in the boreal releases </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/pandoras-box-clearcutting-boreal-carbon-dioxide-emissions-ip.pdf">26 million metric tons </a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">of carbon through driving emissions from the forest’s carbon-rich soils and eroding the forest’s ability to absorb carbon,&#8221; the NRDC wrote in 2020 report. &#8220;Toilet paper’s impact is even more severe because, since it is so short-lived, it quickly releases its remaining carbon into the atmosphere. That is why, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://c.environmentalpaper.org/pdf/SCS-EPN-PC-Methods.pdf">according to the Environmental Paper Network</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, toilet paper made from trees has three times the climate impact as toilet paper created using recycled materials.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>That&#8217;s why wiping out forested paper can be a real boon in the climate fight.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The lion’s share of usage is number one is toilet paper and number two is paper towels, after that the size of the market really really shrinks. We’re going to be continuing on the paper space,&#8221; said Fritsch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s next act will be working with businesses like restaurants, hotels, and even stadiums and arenas to make the swithc. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We launched the company as a B2B company. We were working with WeWork and restaurants and the market &#8212; if you look at where our paper products were being used,&#8221; Fritsch said. &#8220;So another big focus will be building products for our commercial customers where there&#8217;s higher capacity.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Malicious hacking has become a pernicious and dogged fact of life for more organizations, and it&#8217;s a threat that has seemingly grown more complicated and sophisticated over time. One one effective approach to tackling that has been collaboration: not just applying an array of services to address the issue, but creating environments to help those building cybersecurity to work better together. Today one of the startups building tools to do just that is announcing a round of funding, underscoring the opportunity and its own growth within that.</p>
<p>Cyware, a New York startup that has created a platform for organizations to build and operate virtual &#8220;cyber fusion centers&#8221; &#8212;<br />
spaces for people to share threat intelligence, run end-to-end security automation, and orchestrate and execute 360-degree threat responses &#8212; has picked up $30 million in funding, a Series B that it will use to continue growing its business.</p>
<p>The funding is being co-led by Advent International and Ten Eleven Ventures. Advent made some waves in the cybersecurity industry last year when it partnered with Crosspoint to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/06/forescout-to-be-acquired-by-a-pair-of-private-equity-firms-for-1-9b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquire Forescout for $1.9 billion</a>. Ten Eleven, meanwhile, is a VC that specializes in cybersecurity startups. Prelude Fund (the venture practice at Mercato Partners), Emerald Development Managers, Great Road Holdings and cloud security firm Zscaler &#8212; a mix of financial and strategic investors &#8212; also participated. Before this, the startup had raised around $13 million, and it is not disclosing its valuation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The story of the last year in the world of business has been about how everything has gone online: people and their companies have been working remotely; consumers are browsing, buying and entertaining themselves over the internet and with apps. Digital is where all the traffic is.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly that has also played out in the world of cybersecurity: the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/actzero-emerges-from-stealth-with-40m-for-a-suite-of-cybersecurity-solutions-aimed-at-smbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">threat landscape has grown</a>, and so cybersecurity responses have grown with them. Cyware said that in the last year it saw 120% year-over-year growth in annual recurring revenue &#8212; although it doesn&#8217;t disclose actual revenue figures. Its customers are a mix of large enterprises, but also those who both collaborate with others to manage cyber security, such as information sharing communities (ISACs), as well as organizations that manage cybersecurity on behalf of a number of others, such as managed security service providers and computer emergency response teams.</p>
<p>Although many might have a stereotype of a malicious hacker in their heads who sits alone in a darkened room with a determined look in his/her eye, the reality is more likely to be a collaboration between a number of people, providing tips, technology, threads that are developed and so on. Cyware, in its focus on providing a platform for collaboration and creating operations centers, seems to take the same approach in what it has built, a platform to make collaborating easier and part of the solution.</p>
<p>It does so through security orchestration, automation and response (known as SOAR), used by teams to collaborate better and make more informed threat scoring, and to respond better to threat alerts. Indeed, a key part of the challenge for a lot of security services is that they cross multiple parts of organizations, including IT, compliance, trust and safety, and indeed security itself. One aim of Cyware is to create a platform for these all to meet and exchange information that could be helpful to others in one place.</p>
<p>“Over the past decade, security operations teams have had difficulty with trying to sift through copious amounts of threat data and lacked the humans’ role as part of their security orchestration strategies,” said Anuj Goel, Ph.D., cofounder and CEO of Cyware, in a statement. “Our goal with our Virtual Cyber Fusion platform is to help our customers unite their security teams to efficiently respond to high-priority threats by connecting the dots in their environments, and the momentum we’re experiencing is proof that we are executing on that mission. This Series B financing will help us continue to overdeliver for customers, expand our team, improve our platform and truly revolutionize how security operations and threat intelligence teams work together.”</p>
<p>Goel, who cofounded the company with CTO Akshat Jain, cut his teeth in a big security team, as head of global cyber strategy for Citi. He is also an advisor for the Centre for Strategic Cyberspace in London and has worked with other organizations on collaborative approaches to the problem and consequences of malicious hacking.</p>
<p>Investors will have not just been looking at the company&#8217;s growth, but also the list of customers &#8212; themselves also leaders in cyber &#8212; that are trusting Cyware.</p>
<p>“In our increasingly connected environment, companies of all sizes are demanding new and innovative cybersecurity solutions,” said Eric Noeth, Principal, Advent International, in a statement. “Cyware’s early traction among leading enterprises and major ISACs reflects its unique ability to bring together all key security functions to seamlessly anticipate, contextualize and remediate threats. We look forward to drawing on our experience in this sector to help the talented Cyware team make its Virtual Cyber Fusion platform the gold standard technology for enterprises around the world.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://resilience.care">Resilience</a>, a new startup that wants to help cancer treatment institutes as well as cancer patients at every step of the treatment journey. It’s an ambitious project founded by two well-known French entrepreneurs. They want to leverage their tech skills for this new healthcare startup.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, there are two co-CEOs —&nbsp;Céline Lazorthes and Jonathan Benhamou. Nicolas Helleringer and Matthieu Pozza are the two remaining co-founders acting as CTO and CPO respectively. Lazorthes previously co-founded <a href="https://www.leetchi.com">Leetchi</a>, the leading money pot company in France. She also started <a href="https://www.mangopay.com">MangoPay</a>, a marketplace payment solution, as a spinout company. Crédit Mutuel Arkéa acquired both companies.</p>
<p>Benhamou co-founded PeopleDoc, a cloud-based HR service. In 2018, his company was acquired by Ultimate Software. Following the acquisition, he served as an executive in the publicly quoted company. Shortly after, private equity firm Hellman &amp; Friedman Capital Partners acquired Ultimate Software.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last year, they both spent a lot of time working together on a nonprofit called <a href="https://www.protegetonsoignant.com">ProtegeTonSoignant</a>. Along with 140 people, they raised €7.4 million ($8.8 million) in donations to buy personal protective equipment and deliver it to hospitals in need. It was a fundraising and logistics challenge.</p>
<p>After spending a lot of time talking with healthcare professionals, they decided to “dedicate at least the next ten years to those who save lives,” Lazorthes said.</p>
<p>It seems like an ambitious bet, and they’re aware of that. “We don’t know anything about healthcare just like we didn’t know anything about HR and finance. We’re entering a market that is highly regulated,” Benhamou told me.</p>
<p>That’s why they chose to focus on one area in particular — cancer care. While research institutes have made some tremendous progress over the past few years, it has become increasingly more complicated to treat cancer. For instance, Benhamou says he expects to see 300 new treatments over the next three years. Treatment is slowly evolving from broad spectrum treatments to targeted treatments.</p>
<p>Cancer treatment facilities face three issues. First, “a human brain can’t assimilate all this data,” Benhamou said. Second, as life expectancy increases, there are more cancer cases every year. A tumor board is going to spend a minute and a half or two minutes on a specific case to make a therapeutic decision.</p>
<p>Third, as a result of the first two problems, patients are left on their own. For instance, they suffer from side effects because there’s no dosage adjustment in their treatment.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125579" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125579" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Resilience-Team.jpg" alt="" width="1024" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2125579" /><p id="caption-attachment-2125579" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Resilience</p></div></p>
<p>Starting from there, Resilience wants to become a full-stack software solution for cancer treatment for both the medical team and patients. When it comes to practitioners, Resilience will be a software-as-a-service solution that can augment therapeutic decisions. The company will categorize scientific literature, use machine learning to find some similarities with past cases and surface clinical trials based on various criteria.</p>
<p>When it comes to patients, there will be a web and mobile app to access content and information about their cancer. In particular, Resilience could help you understand side effects and treat them.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to prove that the app can improve the quality of life of the patients,” Lazorthes said. Resilience also wants to leverage its app to ask questions and collect data to improve treatments.</p>
<p>The startup is already putting together a data science team. It will use natural language processing to parse scientific literature. It will also work with a medical team to double-check everything.</p>
<p>When it comes to finding similarities between patients, the company is signing partnerships with various hospitals to get data from past cases.</p>
<p>Resilience has raised a $6 million funding round (€5 million) led by <a href="https://singular.vc">Singular</a>, the VC firm founded by former Alven partners Raffi Kamber and Jérémy Uzan. Tech business angels Nathalie Balla (La Redoute), Xavier Niel (Free), Jean-Charles Samuelian (Alan), Roxanne Varza (Station F) and more are also participating.</p>
<p>There are also some healthcare investors in today’s funding round, such as Charles Ferté (AstraZeneca), Philippe Dabi (Bioclinic) and Thomas Clozel (Owkin).</p>
<p>Resilience is a mission-driven company — the company is partnering with a scientific board and a patient board. Gustave Roussy, one of the leading cancer research institutes in the world, is also acting as a co-founder in Resilience.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of stakeholders, but it’s the right thing to do when you’re building a healthcare company. Resilience now has the right system of checks and balance to iterate on its product and roll out a product that has a chance of actually improving cancer treatment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Montreal-headquartered Inovia Capital has raised $450 million for Growth Fund II, the firm&#8217;s second growth-stage investment fund. The close of this funding comes just a little over two years after the announcement of its first in February 2019, a $400 million pool of investment capital that marked Inovia&#8217;s first foray beyond the early stage deals [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Montreal-headquartered <a href="https://www.inovia.vc">Inovia Capital</a> has raised $450 million for Growth Fund II, the firm&#8217;s second growth-stage investment fund. The close of this funding comes just a little over two years after the announcement of its first in February 2019, a $400 million pool of investment capital that marked Inovia&#8217;s first foray beyond the early stage deals it originally focused on.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Inovia now has investments across every stage of a company&#8217;s development — including retaining stakes in some of its portfolio companies that have had successful exits to the public markets, like Lightspeed, the point-of-sale and commerce company that went public in a nearly $400 million public offering on both the NYSE and the TSX last year.</p>
<p>As with Growth Fund I, the goal of Growth Fund II is to invest in companies with a focus primarily on Canadian startups, but also looking to targets in the U.S. and EU, where Inovia also maintains offices. The firms&#8217; partners, including Chris Arsenault, Dennis Kavelman, and former Google CFO Patrick Pichette, have focused on building out a team of experienced operators to help their portfolio companies, and invest specifically in areas of particular need for startups outside the Valley, like sourcing high-demand, senior talent with high-profile tech industry experience.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Inovia&#8217;s original Growth Fund was based on an assumption that the firm could leverage its relationships and its experience to deliver value to its portfolio companies not just when they&#8217;re starting out, but across their growth cycles. Arsenault explained in an interview that Fund I was kind of a proof point that that this assumption was correct, which then paid big dividends when the firm went out to raise Fund II last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;We basically built the team around Dennis, Patrick and myself,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We really followed through on our key assumptions over why it made sense for Inovia to use its platform to actually build a growth stage fund that would benefit not only from insights into the portfolio, but also all of the relationships and the platform that we built over the last decade.&#8221;</p>
<p>What needed proving, Arsenault said, was that Inovia could stand toe-to-toe with the growth-focused firms that had acted as follow-on investors for its early stage deals over the years. That was no easy task, when you consider that Inovia provided deal flow to some of the most respected venture firms in technology, including Bessemer, KKR, TA Ventures and Sequoia.</p>
<p>Inovia hired a lot of operators with experience at high-growth companies, and focused on being able to shepherd its investments through challenges like building a real board, and engineering a cap table to properly manage and prepare secondary sales. With a plan to invest in between 10 to 12 companies with the $400 million in Fund I, Inovia began making deals – the first was with Lightspeed, and then they got into Forward (tech-enabled primary health care), Hopper and Snaptravel (two travel industry startups) and more.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125518" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inovia_GrowthPartners.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125518" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2125518" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inovia_GrowthPartners.png" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inovia_GrowthPartners.png 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inovia_GrowthPartners.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inovia_GrowthPartners.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inovia_GrowthPartners.png?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inovia_GrowthPartners.png?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inovia_GrowthPartners.png?resize=1536,768 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Inovia_GrowthPartners.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2125518" class="wp-caption-text">Inovia Capital growth partners Chris Arsenault, Dennis Kavelman and Patrick Pichette (left to right)</p></div></p>
<p>Most of the companies that Inovia picked with Fund I (it did 10 deals in total) ended up having a very strong 2020 – including, surprisingly, all the travel-focused startups. Based on the strength of their performance, Arsenault and his partners decided to accelerate their timetable for raising Fund II, and found LPs more than willing. They ended up capping the fund at $450 million (with a target of between 10 to 12 investments, as with Fund I) given what Arsenault says felt like the right size for managing across the investment and operating team, despite available demand to likely raise quite a bit more.</p>
<p>Arsenault noted that most of the LPs contributing to this fund also had capital in the first, though some new investors have also signed on. And while Inovia&#8217;s focus is not strictly Canadian, he added that the firm&#8217;s success, along with the makeup of its investment partners and portfolio (two-thirds of the companies it has backed are Canadian) tells a story of a changing investment landscape north of the border.</p>
<p>&#8220;The majority of our LPs are Canadian, and I take it to heart that it&#8217;s important to create patterns of success, so that people can look towards models and either replicate or adapt to their own situation,&#8221; Arsenault said. &#8220;I think that we need more success stories that people can look at and say, &#8216;I can do the same thing, or I can do better.&#8217; And the fact that our LPs came back with us, and when you look at, you know, what Georgian [Partners] is doing, and what Novacap is doing, and what OMERS Growth – this is nothing like the VC ecosystem and industry that I was in 10 years ago, right? We&#8217;re definitely on another level now in Canada.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that there are examples at every stage of company-building, citing the new <a href="https://www.backboneangels.com">Backbone Angels collective</a> led by a number of post and current Shopify employees including Arati Sharma, Atless Clark, Lynsey Thornton and Alexandra Clark. Arsenault also pointed to Lightspeed&#8217;s decision to list first on the TSX before the NYSE as a sign of newfound tech industry maturity in the Canadian context.</p>
<p>Finally, Arsenault credits an unusual &#8216;X&#8217; factor in how Inovia has been able to put together this second fund and manage deep involvement in its very active portfolio companies over the last year: the mostly remote conditions brought on by the necessities of the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would have been impossible to do what we did within the portfolio, with the portfolio, fundraising a new fund, generating our best year, in terms of exits last year, we had the New York Stock Exchange IPO for Lightspeed, we had a dozen transactions of acquisitions where our portfolio companies are doing the acquiring,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how we would have done what we&#8217;ve done, had we been traveling and had a normal life.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ikigai.money/">Ikigai</a>, a London fintech founded by former McKinsey partners, thinks there&#8217;s room in the crowded challenger market for a new premium offering that combines digital banking with wealth management.</p>
<p>Targeting future and present high-net-worth individuals, Ikigai is iOS-only for now and consists of a current account and savings account, with adjacent wealth management features, all combined in a single app and card. The thesis, says the founding team, is that currently there is very little on the market that provides a modern digital-first banking experience and the kind of premium banking services typically offered by legacy banks to their more affluent customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our typical client is young &#8212; usually in their late twenties or thirties,&#8221; explains Ikigai co-founder Edgar de Picciotto. &#8220;They’re entering their prime spending and earning years, and are looking to secure their financial future. Although they’re not high-net-worths yet, they have aspirations and goals &#8212; and they want to do more with their money&#8221;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="IR5d9pywRy"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/01/interest-ing/">Monzo launches interest-earning savings accounts</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Monzo launches interest-earning savings accounts&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/01/interest-ing/embed/#?secret=IR5d9pywRy" data-secret="IR5d9pywRy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Rather than a freemium model, Ikigai charges a flat subscription fee from the get-go, and new users gain access to a relationship manager, which differentiates it from most digital-first banking. Features include an &#8220;everyday&#8221; spending account, and a saving section of the app, dubbed &#8220;nest”. The latter is separate from the spending account, including having its own account number, but can be easily topped up from the everyday account.</p>
<p>So far, quite me-too, you might conclude. However, where some more differentiation arguably comes into play is that Ikigai also offers &#8220;fully managed, globally diversified investment portfolios&#8221; under the wealth section of the app. Portfolios are built and managed by Ikigai in collaboration with asset manager BlackRock, and take into account both risk appetite and the nature of what users want to achieve.</p>
<p>&#8220;We say it a lot but Ikigai was very much born from personal frustration,&#8221; says de Picciotto. &#8220;Everything on the market seemed to be slow, impersonal, full of attempts to sell lending and debt products. It felt like either the tech was there or the humanity, never both. That was the first thing we knew we wanted to solve&#8221;.</p>
<p>“Banking can also be way too time-consuming, investing even more so,&#8221; adds Maurizio Kaiser, Ikigai&#8217;s other co-founder. &#8220;There is so much for people to do when they have to do it themselves. It can basically become a second job if you’re constantly looking at different stocks and shares working out if the value is under this or over that. No one really has time for that &#8212; I certainly didn’t&#8221;.</p>

<p>Once the pair dug deeper, as management consultants are wont to do, they say they also discovered &#8220;interesting behavioural trends,&#8221; particularly when it comes to young and affluent people.</p>
<p>&#8220;This group are entering their prime earning and spending years, and they expect so much more from their banks than previous generations,&#8221; says de Picciotto. &#8220;Not only do they expect faster, fairer and better experiences, they have specific expectations and demands that current financial providers just don’t meet. This includes things like approaching personal finance as an act of self-care, like lifestyle banking over lifestage banking, and aligning their money with their goals and sense of purpose&#8221;.</p>
<p>Notably, unlike many of the first wave of challenger banks that made a virtue out of claims to be building their own core banking technology, Ikigai is primarily partnering with technology providers, including Railsbank and WealthKernel.</p>
<p>“Going with banking-as-a-service providers actually makes it easier to execute on our vision,&#8221; claims de Picciotto. &#8220;It allows us to focus on what we are good at and really matters to our customers: the user experience&#8221;.</p>

<p>On banking competitors, Ikigai&#8217;s founders argue that existing incumbents and challengers both have &#8220;significant&#8221; failings.</p>
<p>Incumbents are too dependent on branches or telephone services, and are premised on cross-selling and up-selling services, particularly lending products, in order to make money on loss-making current accounts.</p>
<p>Challengers, on the other hand, are &#8220;faster and more accessible&#8221;. However, in a bid to keep their cost-base low, they are increasingly automating their chat support and, in some cases, hiding live chat features.</p>
<p>&#8220;Delivering a high-quality service is obviously at odds with their aim of offering banking for free,&#8221; concludes Kaiser.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://sumup.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SumUp</a>, a London-based startup that helps businesses power revenues through card payments &#8212; by way of physical readers, online payments, invoices and other services &#8212; is itself powering up in a big way.</p>
<p>Today it announced financing totalling €750 million (around $895 million at today&#8217;s rates), money that it will be using to continue expanding its business &#8212; specifically, for acquisitions; to launch in new markets in Europe, Latin America and Asia; and to build out the suite of services that it provides to businesses. The company is already active in 33 countries (most recently Chile, Colombia, and Romania) and has some 3 million businesses as customers.</p>
<p>The funding is coming from Goldman Sachs, Temasek, Bain Capital Credit, Crestline, and funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management. SumUp confirmed that the financing is coming in the form of debt, not equity, so there is no formal valuation of the company to disclose. To date, it&#8217;s one of the biggest financings, debt or otherwise, for any startup (that is, any privately-backed tech company) in the region.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Notably, Goldman Sachs and Bain Capital led a $371 million round of debt for the company in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-16/goldman-bain-back-371-million-loan-to-u-k-fintech-startup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019</a>.</p>
<p>Marc-Alexander Christ, one of SumUp&#8217;s co-founders (the company does not seem to use formal titles like &#8220;CEO&#8221;), said that the company opted for debt over equity because it could.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have very stable cash flow, which allows us to take on take on debt,&#8221; he said in an interview. Debt is often a route taken by bigger, scaled up companies, especially those generating a lot of cash. No dilution also means the cost of capital is lower, too.</p>
<p>The company got its start back in 2012 as one of a wave of so-called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/08/23/make-way-for-another-european-square-sumup-launches-with-20m-in-backing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Square &#8220;clones&#8221;</a> &#8212; companies being founded in, but mostly outside of, the U.S. and basing their service around small card payment dongles that attached to phones or tablets. Targeting businesses that were either not yet accepting card payments because they were too expensive or complicated, or were using costly traditional alternatives from banks, they quickly picked up steam and represented a new wave of tech-enabled fintech services catering to small- and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p>As with Square, iZettle (eventually acquired by PayPal) and many others in the space, over time SumUp diversified into a range of other card- and payment-related services for their customers, including building online shops and taking payments over the web and via apps, invoicing, gift cards and wider point-of-sale solutions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also emerged as something of a consolidator in the space: in 2016 SumUp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/27/sumup-and-payleven-merge-as-european-square-clones-consolidate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired one of its bigger competitors</a>, the Rocket Internet-backed Payleven, which helped expand its footprint to a wider set of markets.</p>
<p>Over the years, SumUp has picked up a number of other startups to expand the services that it offers, as well as its markets. Most recently these deals included acquisitions of the business-focused mobile banking platform Paysolut in Lithuania, as well as Goodtill and Tiller to expand into point-of-sale for bigger venues.</p>
<p>That M&amp;A also speaks to how SumUp is approaching its product expansion strategy.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s business model is predicated primarily on taking a cut of transactions made on its platform, and so for now, its strategy is about more services for businesses and scaling up that rate of transactions, not a move into more financial services for consumers.</p>
<p>That is in contrast to companies like Square, which has picked up more than 7 million consumer customers to date by way of Square Cash; and iZettle, which never directly launched services for consumers but was acquired by one of the biggest consumer-facing digital wallet companies, PayPal. It&#8217;s an interesting example of how startups might begin looking like clones of each other, but ultimately they find their own niches and adapt to those. (That&#8217;s not to say that there are not dozens of other competitors to SumUp, including Square and iZettle.)</p>
<p>Nor is SumUp interested in cryptocurrency, another area where the other two have been active.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Square has had one of the easier onboarding experiences when it comes to making Bitcoin investments,&#8221; Christ said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s mainly a customer acquisition tool. They make some money on Bitcoin but not a lot. So I don’t think we will get to that space super soon because it doesn’t represent value for customers. It engages users logging in just to check their accounts but not doing anything else.&#8221;</p>
<p>That focus has not just helped the company steadily grow at a time when more transactions are moving online and away from cash &#8212; two trends giving a major fillip by the Covid-19 pandemic, which forced stores to close in many countries, made people more reluctant to shop in person, and got everyone using cash less to contain community transmission &#8212; but it also helped it attract this funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re proud to be backing SumUp once again and we recognize the truly impressive strides made by the company over the past couple of years. We have huge admiration for what SumUp is doing for small businesses across the world in helping them to keep trading and flourishing in some of the most trying economic circumstances imaginable,&#8221; said Tom Maughan of Bain Capital Credit in a statement. &#8220;The doubling down of our investment in SumUp in this round is both a demonstration of our confidence in the company today and its strong future.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is nearly impossible for businesses in some African countries to receive money from PayPal. While the payments giant has not given reasons why this is so, speculation hints at factors like insufficient regulation and poor banking security in said countries. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That might be a thing of the past for some businesses as African payments company <a href="https://flutterwave.com/">Flutterwave</a> today is announcing a collaboration with PayPal to allow PayPal customers globally to pay African merchants through its &#8216;Pay with PayPal&#8217; feature</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Via this partnership, African businesses can connect with the more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/218493/paypals-total-active-registered-accounts-from-2010/">377 million PayPal accounts globally</a> and overcome the challenges presented by the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">highly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fragmented and complex payment and banking infrastructure on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gbagboola">Olugbenga &#8216;GB&#8217; Agboola</a>, this will happen via a <a href="https://flutterwave.com/ng/blog/pay-with-paypal-on-flutterwave">Flutterwave integration with PayPal</a> so merchants can add PayPal as a payment option when receiving money outside the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The service, which is already available for merchants with registered business accounts on Flutterwave, will be operational across 50 African countries and worldwide, the company claims</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flutterwave hopes to roll out this service to individual merchants on the platform as well</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In a nutshell, we&#8217;re bringing more than 300 million PayPal users to African businesses so they can accept payments across the continent,&#8221; he said to TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our mission at the company has always been to simplify payments for endless possibilities, and from when we started, it has always been about global payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So despite having the largest payment infrastructure in Africa, we want to have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">arguably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all the important payments systems in the world on our platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2125528 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-138.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="367" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-138.png 1063w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-138.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-138.png?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-138.png?resize=768,414 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-138.png?resize=680,367 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Screenshot-138.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>A PayPal spokesperson confirmed the Flutterwave collaboration with TechCrunch.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the company&#8217;s <a href="https://tech.africa/paypal-expands-to-more-african-countries/">expansion to Africa</a>, it has maintained a one-sided relationship with most countries on the continent, allowing them only to send money</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And according to its website, only 12 African countries can send and receive money on the platform, but to varying degrees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They include Algeria, Botswana, Egypt, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Morocco, Mozambique, Senegal, Seychelles and South Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users in countries who are not afforded the luxury to do so have to rely on using </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the PayPal account of a friend or family, based in countries where payments can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be received. Next</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they request the funds via bank transfer, leading to more incurred costs or use other cross-border money platforms like WorldRemit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a pain point for these businesses, particularly in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">PayPal <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2014/06/17/paypal-extends-payment-services-to-nigeria-9-other-countries/?sh=2c7a198f649b">finally arrived</a> Africa&#8217;s most populous country in 2014 and a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> year later, it became the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2015/03/12/nigeria-becomes-paypals-2nd-largest-market-in-africa/?sh=671a1cc765e9">second-biggest market</a> on the continent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">espite its fast adoption rate and large fintech appetite, merchants cannot still receive payments from other countries on the platform with various sources alluding </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">PayPal&#8217;s decision to the country&#8217;s history with internet fraud</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraud or not, Nigeria&#8217;s e-commerce and that of the continent at large continues to grow at a breathtaking pace. In 2017, Africa generated $16.5 billion in revenue, and by 2022, it is expected to reach $29 billion. With numbers like this, it isn&#8217;t hard to see why PayPal wants to get in on the action, albeit not completely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hence, the partnership with Flutterwave. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, via its APIs, offer payment services to individuals and businesses across the continent. Since launching in 2019, the African payments company has partnered<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/16/flutterwave-and-visa-launch-african-consumer-payment-service-getbarter/"> with Visa</a> to launch Barter;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/29/flutterwave-and-alipay-partner-on-payments-between-africa-and-china/#:~:text=San%20Francisco%20and%20Lagos%2Dbased,payments%20between%20Africa%20and%20China.&amp;text=%E2%80%9CThere's%20a%20lot%20of%20trade,to%20accept%20Chinese%20customer%20payments.%E2%80%9D"> Alipay to offer digital payments</a> between Africa and China; and<a href="https://www.worldpay.com/global-selector"> Worldpay FIS</a> for payments in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this one with PayPal is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">arguably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its biggest collaboration yet. Now, African businesses have more access to sell to global customers using PayPal to receive and send payments online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a way, Flutterwave absorbs most of the risk PayPal thinks it will incur if it makes its platform more open to merchants in these countries. But at the same time, it solidifies Flutterwave&#8217;s position in the eyes of multinationals looking to enter the African market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like when its partnership with Worldpay FIS coincided with its Series B funding, this announcement is also coming on the back of a raise</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, the payments company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">closed a $170 million Series C</a> led by Avenir Growth Capital and Tiger Global, becoming a billion-dollar company in the process</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In hindsight, the mammoth raise suggests that there are a couple of projects in the company&#8217;s pipeline</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Going by this partnership, we can expect the majority of them to be</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> global plays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, these questions remain top of mind &#8212; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens when PayPal </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">automatically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows businesses from these neglected African countries to start receiving payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? Will both services continue to coexist if that happens? We&#8217;ve reached out to PayPal for comment.</span></p>
<p>However that plays out, this is a step forward in the right direction for Flutterwave, which has shown time and time again the length it is willing to go for its 290,000 merchants and the ongoing quest to become a global payments company.</p>
<p>&#8220;By working with PayPal, we can further strengthen our commitment to our customers and service users as we will be enabling them to transact and expand their business operations to reach new markets. PayPal&#8217;s global reach is unrivalled, and collaborating with them allows our customers to explore new markets where PayPal is embedded,&#8221; the CEO said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the bigger startups in Europe operating a trading platform for cryptocurrency has closed a big round of funding on the heels of very rapid growth and plans to open its platform to a wider stream of assets.</p>
<p><a href="http://bitpanda.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitpanda</a>, a &#8220;neobroker&#8221; that wants to make it easier for ordinary people to invest not just in bitcoin and other digital assets, but also gold, and any established stock that takes their interest, has picked up $170 million, a Series B that catapults the company&#8217;s valuation to $1.2 billion. Bitpanda is based in Vienna, Austria and says that this equity round makes it the country&#8217;s first &#8220;unicorn&#8221; &#8212; the first startup to pass the $1 billion valuation mark.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are shifting to become a pan-investment platform, not just a crypto broker,&#8221; said Eric Demuth, the CEO of Bitpanda who co-founded it with Paul Klanschek and Christian Trummer. Bitpanda&#8217;s focus up to now has been primarily on building a platform to target investors in Europe, a largely untapped market, as it happens. &#8220;In the EU, we probably have less than 10% of the population owning stocks. Our growth goes hand in hand with that.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to Austria, Bitpanda is live in France, Spain, Turkey, Italy and Poland with plans to expand to more markets this year, building hubs in Madrid, Barcelona, London, Paris and Berlin. New investment options to back ETFs and &#8220;fractional&#8221; trades, which will let people invest small amounts of money in whichever stocks they would like to back, are due to be added in April, the company says.</p>
<p>That said, the vast majority of activity on the platform right now is related to cryptocurrency, and within that Bitcoin trading far outweighs any other digital currency.</p>
<p>The round is being led by Valar Ventures &#8212; the fund backed by Peter Thiel &#8212; with participation also from unnamed partners from DST Global (Yuri Milner&#8217;s fund). Both have been building name for themselves as significant backers of crypto startups. Valar is also an investor in Robinhood &#8212; which, like Bitpanda, has positioned itself as a platform to help a wider funnel of people engage and profit from trading &#8212; and most recently, earlier this month the pair co-invested in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/blockfi-lands-a-350m-series-d-at-3b-valuation-for-its-fast-growing-crypto-lending-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$350 million round for BlockFi</a>, which provides financial services like loans to crypto traders.</p>
<p>While DST is a new investor in Bitpanda, Valar also led a round for Bitpanda just six months ago &#8212; a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/crypto-exchange-bitpanda-closes-52m-series-a-from-valar-ventures-backed-by-peter-thiel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$52 million Series A</a>. Since then, Demuth and Klanschek say that the company has seen growth skyrocket (not unlike the price of bitcoin itself).</p>
<p>KPIs like revenue and customer numbers &#8220;have been roughly 10x,&#8221; Klanschek said, with the platform adding some 700,000 users between then and now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very soon we will cross the €100 million revenue mark for the first few months of this year&#8221; said Klanschek. Annualized it will work out to around €300-400 million, he added. While the bulk of its trading is for individuals, it&#8217;s not only focused on single investors. In September, on the company&#8217;s trading volume for its &#8220;Pro&#8221; tier for companies, daily trading on the platform was <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitpanda-series-a-peter-thiel-valar-ventures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2 million</a>. Now, it is <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/bitpanda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over $25 million</a>.</p>
<p>Bitpanda&#8217;s growth and enthusiasm taps into a much bigger trend in the world of trading. One of the byproducts of the Covid-19 pandemic has been consumers becoming more engaged in their own personal finance.</p>
<p>With interest rates down, professional futures less certain for some, a plethora of apps out there to do more with your money, a whole new set of investing classes thanks to cryptocurrency, and (last but not least) the juggernaut that is social media to help concepts go viral, people are dabbling in a wider range of activities, some having never done more than simply keep their money in a bank account before, and shuffling off a bit of money to their 401k&#8217;s or other pension funds.</p>
<p>Bitpanda made a decision last year to start to get more aggressive in its own fundraising to ride that wave.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are profitable, and we have been for four years, but in September we changed strategy and wanted to become ‘the’ investment platform for all of Europe,&#8221; Demuth said. &#8220;We needed more partners and more capital to get more top talent and this is why we did the Series A last year. Then over the past two months, we talked to our investors and said what do you think, it seems like there is some momentum. They said ‘we are in.&#8221; No roadshow needed, we will help you. We will call our contacts and they&#8217;ll join, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>There has been a huge wave of hype around crypto, although in the wider sense it&#8217;s still primarily an adopter phenomenon, far from being a mainstream investment, with most people having no idea how it works. Ironically, this is not that dissimilar to much of the stock market for most people although the difference these days is that apps like Robinhood, Square Cash and Bitpanda are making it easier to engage with crypto and other trading by lowering the barrier to entry, both in terms of actually putting money into the system, and also by making it possible to get engaged with only a small amount of money.</p>
<p>Whether cryptocurrency bears out in the longer term, it&#8217;s likely that the democratization will stay and become a part of the bigger process of how people manage their own money, if not by gambling all-in, then at least by creating a little diversification for themselves.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t excuse the ridiculous hype merchants on social media that potentially exploit these new traders, nor the fact that there is still a very long way to go in regulators getting better oversight of how these new exchanges work, but it does point to an interesting future and more opportunities longer term for organizations and individuals to do more with their money and their assets (NFTs being an example on the other side, of how to build assets and value for investing in the first place).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;In today’s financial world everything is connected,&#8221; said Klanschek. &#8220;We saw huge growth on Bitpanda after the Covid stock crash in March 2020.&#8221; Crypto dropped then too, with &#8220;interest high but price very low.&#8221; Yet with saving accounts and other traditional, low-key ways for people to growth their money yielding nothing, &#8220;it eventually led to huge interest in financial markets, with crypto being established as its own financial asset, its own category.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>While there are a number of platforms emerging for people to engage of that, the pace of adoption for Bitpanda in Europe is what attracted investors here.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we joined the board last September, we have continued to be impressed with the work that Eric, Paul and the team are doing. One of the positive changes caused by the pandemic was an increased interest in personal finance, and Bitpanda’s broad offer and commitment to demystifying investing for a new breed of retail investors means it is perfectly positioned to take advantage of the trend,&#8221; said James Fitzgerald, Founding Partner of Valar Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;With over 700,000 new users in just 6 months, we know that people want access to the platform, and we’re excited to bring Bitpanda to every investor in Europe.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chinese users of the instant messenger Signal knew that the good times wouldn&#8217;t last long. The app, which is used for encrypted conversations, is unavailable in mainland China as of the morning of March 16, a test by TechCrunch shows. The website of the app has been banned in mainland China since March 15, according to censorship tracking website Greatfire.org.</p>
<p>Signal could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>The encrypted chat app was one of the few Western social networks that remained accessible in China without the use of a virtual private network. The likes of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have long been blocked. In some way, a ban is a badge of honor, signifying a foreign app has reached a substantial user base in China that catches the attention of local authorities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Signal is still available for download on Apple&#8217;s China App Store as of March 16, an indication that Apple hasn&#8217;t received a government order to remove the app, which is gradually gaining ground among China&#8217;s tech-savvy, privacy-conscious users. The app has 4.9 out of 5 from 37,000 ratings on the Chinese App Store.</p>
<p>Android stores in China are operated by a slew of third-party Chinese tech firms, which tend to comply strictly with local censors and don&#8217;t list Signal. Google Play is unavailable in the country.</p>
<p>The iOS version of Signal has been installed close to 510,000 times to date in China and recently crossed 100 million downloads across Apple&#8217;s App Store and Google Play combined globally, app analytics firm Sensor Tower told TechCrunch on March 16.</p>
<p>Signal and rival Telegram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/telegram-and-signal-china/">have seen a surge in downloads</a> after WhatsApp&#8217;s updated privacy policy sparked panic among users in January. While the impact is limited in China, where Tencent&#8217;s WeChat commands a formidable share in social networking with 1.1 billion monthly users, both Signal and Telegram have seen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/telegram-and-signal-china/">small user upticks in China</a>.</p>
<p>As of January, Telegram had amassed about 2.7 million installs on China’s App Store, compared to 458,000 downloads for Signal and 9.5 million times for WhatsApp. Like Signal, both Telegram and WhatsApp are still present on the China App Store, though access appears to require virtual private networks.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s elaborate Great Firewall has made many internet users experts on censorship circumvention. App bans are often layered as the Clubhouse case shows.</p>
<p>While the drop-in audio app wasn&#8217;t found on the Chinese App Store, users discovered ways to install it in foreign App Stores and used it freely without censorship-fighting tools until the app&#8217;s API was blocked. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/clubhouse-is-now-blocked-in-china-after-a-brief-uncensored-period/">Even after that</a>, China-based users realized they could listen once they entered a chat room through a VPN, as Clubhouse&#8217;s audio technology provider Agora remains accessible in China.</p>
<p>Foreign apps and websites are occasionally cut off in China and brought back, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/23/microsoft-confirms-bing-is-down-in-china/">as with Microsoft&#8217;s search engine Bing</a>. It&#8217;s unclear whether the Signal ban is permanent, but given the app&#8217;s growth, this could mark the end of its short life in China.</p>
