										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rent the Runway is more than 10 years old now and has raised upwards of $500 million, recently filing to IPO at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/working-to-understand-rent-the-runways-ipo-valuation/">a valuation north of $1 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Jenny Fleiss is a co-founder at Rent the Runway and sits on the board of several notable companies, including Shutterfly, Party City and, of course, Rent the Runway. She&#8217;s also a partner at Volition Capital alongside Larry Cheng.</p>
<p>On an upcoming episode of TechCrunch Live, Fleiss and Cheng will sit down to discuss the early days of Rent the Runway — how the company successfully fundraised, grew and navigated its way to unicorn status. They&#8217;ll also talk through the current early-stage fundraising landscape, which is nearly unrecognizable from the environment Fleiss fundraised in a decade ago. This episode takes place Wednesday, November 10, at 12 p.m. PT / 3 p.m. ET. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-live-with-volition-capital?ref=14cba39fb3ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Register for free here!</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228419" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TechCrunch Live is all about helping founders build better venture-backed businesses. We do this by sitting down with founders and the investors who finance them to hear how they chose one another, how they tackled challenges and how successful founders quickly grow their businesses.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am a founder of a startup on an E-2 visa. I am in the process of raising funds, which will eventually reduce my ownership of the company and prevent me from meeting the E-2 requirements. What can I consider next that would also allow my spouse to continue working?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Fintech Founder</strong></p>
<p>Dear Fintech,</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Great question! As you know, the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/e-2-visa-treaty-investors/">E-2 visa</a> for treaty investors, essential employees and spouses requires that at least half of the U.S. business is owned by people or companies from your country of citizenship. (There are more requirements, but those are the basics!).</p>
<p>I recently shared updates about some immigration changes on my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/095-recent-immigration-updates-2021/">podcast</a> that affect some of the options that may be open to you, such as the International Entrepreneur Parole program and green cards. For additional options that meet your goals and any timing issues you have, I recommend that you consult an immigration attorney.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2100312 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="1024" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<h2>Visa alternatives</h2>
<p>Most founders would initially consider applying for an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/015-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp/">O-1A</a> for extraordinary ability or an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/episode-11-your-startups-first-h-1b/">H-1B</a> for specialty occupations, but usually dependent O-3 and H-4 spouses are not immediately eligible to obtain work authorization.</p>
<p>Many startup founders, particularly those who have secured funding from investors, qualify for the O-1A, which is one of the quickest work visas to obtain and has some of the most stringent requirements. However, spouses are not eligible to apply for a work permit merely based on O-3 status.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if your equity is diluting, you might actually be better poised for an H-1B. This option can be made more predictable through an alternative to the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/060-h-1b-lottery-planning-part-2/">H-1B random lottery</a> in the spring if you pursue a <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/066-cap-exempt-h-1bs-with-danielle-goldman/">cap-exempt H-1B</a> with a nonprofit or other qualified organization and possible concurrent employment. How does it work? Having one cap-exempt H-1B means you don’t have to go through the H-1B lottery process. Next, your startup could concurrently sponsor you for an H-1B, avoiding the lottery process as well. However, your spouse would not be eligible to apply for an H-4 work permit until you reach certain milestones in the green card process.</p>
<p>If you’re currently in the U.S. in E-2 status, you might consider filing for a Change of Status with USCIS. Premium processing is available for both the O-1A and H-1B petitions. With premium processing, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) guarantees it will expedite its decision within 15 business days. A decision means either approval, a request for more evidence or a denial. Seeking a change of status is not the same as applying through a consulate abroad for a single- or multiple-entry visa in your passport.</p>
<h2>International Entrepreneur Parole</h2>
<p>If you established your company within the past 18 months, raised at least $264,147 in funding from a U.S. investor or investors (or $105,659 in government awards or grants) and maintain at least 10% equity in your startup, then you might qualify for <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/073-international-entrepreneur-parole-is-back/">International Entrepreneur Parole</a> (IEP). IEP allows you and your family to stay in the U.S. for up to 30 months — and your spouse is eligible to obtain a work permit.</p>
<p>I’m celebrating a victory — I recently helped advocate to make IEP better for founders, and as a result, one of the IEP program’s largest challenges was recently removed. Although IEP allows for an initial stay in the U.S. of up to 30 months, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) officers, who have the final say on whether you and your family are granted IEP and for how long when you physically enter the country, were only authorizing entry in 12-month increments.</p>
<p>That was putting a burden on families, because it meant you and your family would have to exit and reenter the U.S. again in 12 months. That also meant that an IEP spouse’s work permit was only valid for a few months given the backlog in processing applications and the fact that the work permit is only valid for as long as the IEP stay is valid.</p>
<p>I’m happy to report that this situation has changed for the better! I’m part of a group that is offering feedback to the government on how to make the IEP program more efficient and effective. We recently received confirmation that CBP now has the capacity to approve an initial stay in the U.S. for the full 30 months (not just 12 months at a time).</p>
<p>For more details on how to get IEP, take a look at this previous <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/dear-sophie-whats-the-process-for-getting-international-entrepreneur-parole/">Dear Sophie column</a> on that topic, or for context, you can listen to my podcast episodes on the &#8220;<a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/078-parole-entry-process/">Parole Entry Process</a>.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Green card options</h2>
<p>Except for perhaps the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/marriage-based-green-cards/">green card through marriage</a>, green cards take much longer to obtain than a work visa. Most employment-based green cards, such as the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-1a-green-card/">EB-1A green card for individuals with extraordinary ability</a> and the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-2-niw-startup-green-card-dhanasar-national-interest-waiver/">EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver) green card for individuals with exceptional ability</a>, take a couple of years or potentially longer if you were born in India or China and you don’t have a priority date yet.</p>
<p>If you were born in China or India, you face waiting several years for a green card number to become available under the EB-2 NIW category. Processing for the EB-1A is the quickest of the two, particularly since this category is current for all countries according to the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin/2022/visa-bulletin-for-november-2021.html">November Visa Bulletin</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/074-diversity-immigrant-visa-program/">Diversity Immigrant Visa Program</a> (DV Program) offers another green card option, but it could take up to two years to get a green card if you’re selected in the annual DV Program lottery. The registration period for the fiscal year 2023 lottery is currently open through November 9, 2021, at 12:00 p.m. EST.</p>
<p>Each year, the U.S. Department of State, which oversees the DV program, reserves 50,000 green cards for individuals born in countries that have low rates of immigration to the United States. The State Department publishes instructions each year, which includes the countries whose natives are eligible to register for the annual diversity lottery. Here is <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Diversity-Visa/DV-Instructions-Translations/DV-2023-Instructions-Translations/DV-2023-Instructions-English.pdf">the latest version</a>.</p>
<p>Be aware that as of October 1, 2021, all green card candidates must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 before their immigration medical examination.</p>
<p>One benefit of pursuing a green card is your spouse’s work authorization. If you’re currently in the U.S. and able to get to the stage of filing an I-485, the adjustment of status application, you and your spouse can also each file a work permit application, which would allow your spouse to work for an employer or be self-employed in the U.S. Many founders on E-2, for example from Europe, choose to self-petition an EB-2 NIW green card and concurrently file adjustment of status applications for the whole family.</p>
<p>Wishing you the best on whatever path you choose to take!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apps tend to get bigger over time. Adding new features means adding more code, more third-party frameworks and more assets like images or videos. Resources like fonts or support documents get duplicated and things slip through the build process without the best optimization or compression.</p>
<p>Keeping apps small has upsides for the users and the developers, but it&#8217;s not necessarily top-of-mind all of the time. It&#8217;s the kind of thing that, depending on the size of a dev team and its priorities, can get forgotten until someone complains.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.emergetools.com">Emerge</a>, a company out of YC&#8217;s W21 class, is building tools that help to keep apps small — monitoring changes from build to build and recommending actions that can trim the required storage space.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228699" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Why keep apps small? There&#8217;s a bunch of reasons, as Emerge co-founder Joshua Cohenzadeh points out. Make your iOS app too big, for example, and the App Store will suggest to your users that they wait until they&#8217;re on WiFi — an opportunity for them to lose interest all together (in a<a href="https://eng.uber.com/how-uber-deals-with-large-ios-app-size/"> recent blog post</a>, Uber said that App Store size limitations cost them up to 10% of installs.) If you&#8217;re hoping to build a user base worldwide, meanwhile, you&#8217;ve got to consider that many potential users might be on slower networks or paying by the megabyte — so every byte counts. Plus, who hasn&#8217;t been trying to free up some space on their phone and thought &#8220;Wait, why the hell is [app x] taking up 400 MB?&#8221;</p>
<p>Emerge co-founders Josh Cohenzadeh and Noah Martin have been building things together since they were, quite literally, kids. In high school they built <a href="https://www.thnkdev.com/QuickRes/">QuickRes</a>, a menu bar tool for quickly changing the screen resolution on a Mac; over the years, they&#8217;d build a popular screenshot manager for the Mac, a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nikola/id1412473099?mt=12">menu bar widget for controlling a Tesla</a> and a now-retired <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/fire-for-tinder-2">tool for A/B testing your Tinder photos</a> that Cohenzadeh says got them on the wrong side of a cease-and-desist order.</p>
<p>After college and stints at big companies, the two decided to stop making what were arguably side projects (or, as Josh lovingly referred to them, &#8220;dinky little apps&#8221;) and go full time into building a startup. They set out to apply to Y Combinator, and, while brainstorming ideas, came across research on the great lengths users were going to to transfer data in countries with limited mobile networks. This got them looking into where apps were wasting data … and the deeper they dug, the more they realized that app size was something that many teams — even within many big companies — weren&#8217;t consistently focusing on.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re a small company, you don&#8217;t have the resources to have your own performance team. You don&#8217;t have the resources to do all these crazy optimizations and things like that.&#8221; says Josh. &#8220;So the foundation of Emerge was just … let&#8217;s standardize this.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Emerge provides its insights in a few different ways. It can hook into your team&#8217;s GitHub to flag app size changes as comments in each pull request; Emerge&#8217;s dashboard, meanwhile, gives you multiple different views into what&#8217;s taking up space in your app and suggests ways to slim it down.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228711" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228711" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2228711" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emerge-xray.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emerge-xray.jpg 1225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emerge-xray.jpg?resize=150,66 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emerge-xray.jpg?resize=300,133 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emerge-xray.jpg?resize=768,340 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emerge-xray.jpg?resize=680,301 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/emerge-xray.jpg?resize=50,22 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228711" class="wp-caption-text">Emerge&#8217;s X-Ray view. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Emerge</p></div></p>
<p>The &#8220;X-ray&#8221; view gives an at-a-glance overview of how much space is taken up by each framework or asset. If you&#8217;re only using a certain framework for one or two rarely used features but it accounts for one-fifth of your app&#8217;s size, is it worth it? It&#8217;ll also highlight files that managed to sneak into your build multiple times. &#8220;It&#8217;s <em>shocking</em> how many companies have duplicate files,&#8221; says Josh.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Breakdown&#8221; view splits it up by category — how much of your app is the binary itself, how much of it is assets like images or video, etc.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228713" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228713" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2228713" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emerge-Insights.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="738" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emerge-Insights.jpg 1230w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emerge-Insights.jpg?resize=150,108 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emerge-Insights.jpg?resize=300,216 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emerge-Insights.jpg?resize=768,554 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emerge-Insights.jpg?resize=680,490 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Emerge-Insights.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228713" class="wp-caption-text">Emerge&#8217;s Insights view. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Emerge</p></div></p>
<p>An &#8220;Insights&#8221; tab, meanwhile, offers up the actions that could have the biggest impact on app size — like stripping binary symbols in a Swift binary, using a different image type for a given platform (like HEIC instead of PNG on iOS), or figuring out how to ditch those aforementioned duplicate files.</p>
<p>Curious as to what Emerge might find in your app? There&#8217;s one catch: Their tools aren&#8217;t open to everyone just yet. They&#8217;re currently working with each new company individually — because, as Josh tells me, most of the companies they&#8217;re working with require strict security reviews and legal agreements before granting tools like this any sort of access. Emerge plans to launch a &#8220;full self-service model&#8221; for smaller teams soon, he notes. Pricing varies company by company, based on criteria like number of apps, number of builds, team size and which platforms they&#8217;re building for. When it launched earlier this year, Emerge focused solely on iOS apps; last month the team added support for Android apps.</p>
<p>Emerge recently closed a $1.7 million round — its first so far. Cohenzadeh tells me the round was backed by Haystack, Matrix Partners, Y Combinator, Liquid2 Ventures and a handful of angel investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fresh water is one of the many resources increasingly being affected by climate change, which in turn affects businesses that rely on this abundant but still limited natural resource. <a href="https://www.waterplan.com/">Waterplan</a>, armed with a $2.6 million seed round, is looking to analyze and track not just how a company&#8217;s water use affects the local environment, but the mitigations that could help keep things wet when the seemingly inevitable crisis arrives.</p>
<p>Jose Galindo, Nicolas Wertheimer and their colleagues Matias Comercio and Olivia Cesio founded Waterplan after both working in and around the environmental sector for years. They realized that although there was a lot of action, data and planning around carbon emissions, comparatively little was being done around water risk, since it has yet to become as visible of a threat. They started the company and took it through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/here-are-all-the-companies-from-day-two-of-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day/">Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer 2021 cohort</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;More companies are disclosing and acting on water security and other water matters, but there&#8217;s a need for a SaaS platform to quantify and mediate water risk,&#8221; said Galindo. &#8220;Companies have had a reactive approach, but since these [climate-related] disruptions are getting more frequent, there&#8217;s an opportunity for them to predict this kind of thing and act proactively. Climate change is here, and this is going to accelerate.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227830" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Of course this isn&#8217;t simple advice like &#8220;don&#8217;t leave the tap running&#8221; but industrial-scale efforts like water table replenishment, major municipal works and so on. Waterplan first distills data from satellite imagery, which shows canopy, water bodies and other important indicators as objective measurements with plenty of context — years of images and analysis have established clear trends. This is combined with direct measurements made by water and environmental authorities that closely monitor these resources.</p>
<p>So (to invent an example) a factory that processes coffee beans might use 10,000 gallons per hour of water from a nearby river. Analysis could show that in 5-10 years that will no longer be a sustainable rate and will cause issues downriver, since there&#8217;s before and after data showing the factory&#8217;s effects. These issues would end up costing the company $40 million over that period. However, if local efforts to restore forests and extend tree canopy are doubled at a cost of $10 million, it will improve water retention and slow erosion, leading to a net increase in water availability — and sidestep that $40 million risk.</p>
<p>The actual reports are obviously more detailed and highly specific to a given location and company, but you can see below the kinds of scales they&#8217;re operating in and the type of data they track.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2228662,2228663,2228664,2228665"]</p>
<p>This sort of analysis and advice isn&#8217;t unprecedented by any means, but it&#8217;s the kind of thing that tends to be done once or a few times a year (if that) by an environmental consultant. Waterplan&#8217;s approach is to automate this as much as possible, making it a big data problem where factors can be plugged in and things like risk and mitigation strategies come out the other end. Of course it&#8217;s not so simple as that, but with the speed at which both markets and natural phenomena are changing these days, it needs to be done faster and in a more targeted, actionable way, the founders explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more expensive to be reactive than proactive,&#8221; said Wertheimer. &#8220;We need to make this a conscious effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>Galindo emphasized the fragmentation and incompatibility of much of the data concerning local water supplies, restoration efforts and other factors. It takes a lot of work to rectify these disparate sources and combine their data into a cohesive map and prediction.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s important for companies to be able to make sense of what&#8217;s happening in different climate scenarios and locations, and to see it in a continuously updated and detailed way,&#8221; Galindo said. &#8220;Water is cheap and plentiful today but it won&#8217;t always be; there&#8217;s going to be a 30% gap in 2030 between supply and demand. We think that pressure will appear over the next 10 years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those with better data and a track record of taking steps proactively will be in a better position as the resource dwindles or competition over something like water credits heats up. Even now there is a serious shortage of carbon credits and other such resources and investments, meaning even companies that want to spend hundreds of millions may not have the opportunity to. (Carbon futures are a potential solution to this and a similar market may appear for resources like fresh water.)</p>

<p>Getting in early to what could be a major part of the climate monitoring ecosystem in the next decade seems to have been judged a fairly good bet by Waterplan&#8217;s first set of investors (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/here-are-all-the-companies-from-day-two-of-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day/">after Y Combinator</a>). The $2.6 million round was led by Giant Ventures and a rather star-spangled list of individual participants: &#8220;Sir Richard Branson’s family, Monzo founder Tom Blomfield, Unity founders David Helgason and Nicholas Francis, NFL legend Joe Montana, Microsoft’s former global water program manager Paul Fleming, MCJ collective, Climate Capital, Newtopia, Jetstream and Mixpanel founder Tim Treffen.&#8221;</p>
<p>The near-term plan, Wertheimer and Galindo said, is primarily to ramp up development; they need engineers and hydrologists to handle the complex work of building out the platform so it can continue to produce the kinds of insights desired by various industries and environments.</p>
<p>Although the data and analysis they produce would likely be welcomed by governments and NGOs, the stakeholders most likely to make change (and, it must be said, pay for the service) are private companies aiming to cut risk or improve their local standing. But once traction is achieved and the product and methods nailed down, the founders (who emphasized their involvement with water access and NGOs earlier) hope to make it more widely available.</p>

<p>The U.S. automaker has been accepting $100 refundable reservations for the vehicle since its unveiling. Ford has seen a high level of consumer interest, bagging 20,000 reservations on the first day, 44,000 by the end of the second day and 120,000 by the end of June.</p>
<p>In a second-quarter earnings call in June, CEO Jim Farley said that nearly 75% of those customers were new to Ford.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228671" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>He added that around 40% of people were planning on trading in an internal combustion engine truck, which “it indicates a move a little bit faster to full-size truck [battery electric vehicles] than maybe our optimistic assumptions,” he said.</p>
<p>In response to the reservation figures, the automaker said it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/ford-boosts-spending-to-increase-production-capacity-of-its-f-150-lightning-electric-truck/">earmark an additional $250 million and bolster its workforce by 450</a> to increase the annual production capacity of the Lightning. The trucks will go on sale to customers in spring 2022.</p>
<p>The Lightning, which will be available in four trims, is a critical part of the automaker’s strategy to transition a greater portion of its fleet to electric. Ford is joining newer entrants like Rivian — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/first-drive-rivian-delivers-the-electric-truck-weve-been-waiting-for/">which rolled its first R1T truck off the production line in September</a> — in taking aim at the pickup truck segment. The F-150 is the best-selling truck in America. Ford reported it had sold 787,422 F-series trucks in 2020.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The base version of the Lightning will start at $39,974, while the midseries XLT model will start at $52,974, both excluding taxes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The BlackMatter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> operation, which came to prominence earlier this year following the demise of the DarkSide ransomware gang, is allegedly shutting down due to “pressure from the authorities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group announced plans to shut down in a message posted on its ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) portal, where other criminal groups typically register in order to get access to the BlackMatter ransomware strain. The message, obtained by a member of the <a href="https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1455750066560544769">vx-underground</a> infosec group, translates to:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>&#8220;Due to certain unsolvable circumstances associated with pressure from the authorities (part of the team is no longer available, after the latest news) — project is closed.</p>
<p>“After 48 hours the entire infrastructure will be turned off, allowing — Issue mail to companies for further communication;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Get decryptor. For this write &#8216;give a decryptor&#8217; inside the company chat, where necessary. We wish you all success, we were glad to work.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228523" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s unclear what “latest news” is referring to, although the message follows a recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/02/us/politics/russian-hacking-government.html">New York Times</a> report that announced that the U.S. and Russia had started collaborating more closely to crack down on cybercriminal organizations based in Russia.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>It also comes after CISA, the FBI and the NSA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/cisa-nsa-blackmatter-food-industry/">published an advisory warning that the BlackMatter ransomware group has targeted “multiple” organizations considered critical infrastructure</a>, including two organizations in the U.S. food and agriculture sector. The advisory provided information on tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) associated with the ransomware gang.</p>
<p>There’s also a chance that BlackMatter’s missing team members could be linked to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/europol-hackers-norsk-hydro/">a recent international law enforcement operation that detained 12 individuals</a> linked to 1,800 ransomware attacks in 71 countries.</p>
<p>The BlackMatter group first emerged in July this year and is believed to be responsible for numerous attacks against U.S. companies, including the recent attack on NEW Cooperative, an Iowa-based farm service provider that was hit with a $5.9 million ransom demand to unlock their systems. BlackMatter also hit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/technology-giant-olympus-hit-by-blackmatter-ransomware/">Japanese technology giant Olympus</a> in September, forcing the shutdown of the company’s European, Middle East and Africa network.</p>
<p>BlackMatter ransom demands have ranged from $80,000 to $15 million in cryptocurrency, according to the recent advisory from U.S. law enforcement agencies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>However, New Zealand-based cybersecurity company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/blackmatter-ransomware-bug-decryption-tool/">Emsisoft claims to have prevented “tens of millions of dollars” in ransom payments from reaching the BlackMatter group</a>. After uncovering a flaw in the group’s encryption process, it was able to quietly help BlackMatter ransomware victims recover encrypted files without having to pay the ransom.</p>
<p>At the time, Emsisoft threat analyst Brett Callow said this decryption campaign could be BlackMatter’s demise. Now, however, he&#8217;s not so sure.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s impossible to say whether this will be a permanent exit or simply another rebrand,&#8221; Callow told TechCrunch. &#8220;Let’s hope it’s the former.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is <a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1455947657067782148?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1455947657067782148%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php">bringing back</a> support for Twitter Card previews starting today. Now when users share an Instagram link on Twitter, a preview of the post will be shown in the tweet. Prior to this change, when users posted an Instagram link on Twitter, the tweet would only display the URL of the Instagram link.</p>
<p>The social media platform made the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/09/it-appears-that-instagram-photos-arent-showing-up-in-twitter-streams-at-all/">controversial decision</a> to remove Twitter Card support back in 2012. At the time, Instagram founder Kevin Systrom said the reason was that Instagram wanted to take control of its content and that the company wanted images to be viewed on Instagram, as opposed to Twitter.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">They said it would never happen… Twitter Card previews start rolling out TODAY. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228644" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Now, when you share an Instagram link on Twitter a preview of that post will appear. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f64c.png" alt="🙌" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/XSZRx9dzd1">pic.twitter.com/XSZRx9dzd1</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Instagram (@instagram) <a href="https://twitter.com/instagram/status/1455947657067782148?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The change was met with backlash, as it made cross-posting more difficult for users. In some cases, users found workarounds through third-party platforms in order to feature Instagram posts in tweets.</p>
<p>Twitter has also acknowledged the change in a <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1455952061665841157?s=20">tweet</a>, noting that “if you want to share your latest Instagram post on the Twitter timeline too, you’re in luck. Now when you share a link to an IG post in a Tweet, it’ll show up as a card with a preview of the photo.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The change is rolling out on Android, iOS, and the web for all users starting today. Although it&#8217;s a small feature, it&#8217;s one that will be welcomed by users as it makes cross-posting from Instagram to Twitter a lot easier and more accessible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Webflow has raised more than $200 million and become a household name in the world of web design, creation and hosting. What makes Webflow special is that it has been a pioneer in the no-code space, allowing everyday, non-engineer folks to build websites without writing a single line of code.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amid a growing number of banking apps aimed at teens, Square Inc.&#8217;s Cash App today is broadening its reach by making its payments app <a href="https://cash.app/13+" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available to younger teens</a> between the ages of 13 and 17. Previously, the app required users to be at least 18 years old, like <a href="https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/209690188-Requirements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rival</a> Venmo. The company says younger teens will need to get a parent or guardian to <a href="https://cash.app/help/us/en-us/6486-authorized-users-under-18" target="_blank" rel="noopener">authorize</a> their account, but can then begin to send peer-to-peer payments and take delivery of a customized Cash Card, powered by Visa.</p>
<p>The Cash Card, essentially a Visa debit card tied to the teen&#8217;s Cash App account, can be personalized using the Cash App mobile app. Teens (or any user, really) can pick out the card&#8217;s color, add stamps, draw on it, or even make it glow in the dark, the company&#8217;s website explains.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228572" style="width: 623px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228572" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2228572" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_02.png?w=613" alt="" width="613" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_02.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_02.png?resize=135,150 135w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_02.png?resize=270,300 270w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_02.png?resize=768,852 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_02.png?resize=613,680 613w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_02.png?resize=45,50 45w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228572" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cash App</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228555" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In addition, teens will be able to send and receive peer-to-peer payments with family and friends, or anyone else on Cash App&#8217;s network of over 40 million monthly active users.  Other features also mirror the existing version of Cash App, including access to spending rewards at top retailers, ATM access with a $2 fee, and support for paycheck direct deposit.</p>
<p>However, teens will not be able to access either Bitcoin or stock investing at this time, the company notes. Other features limited to users 18 and up include Borrow, Check Deposit, Paper Money Deposit, and cross-border payments.</p>
<p>The teens&#8217; accounts are designed to be managed with parental oversight. Parents who authorize Cash App for their kids are the account&#8217;s legal owner and will be able to review their teen&#8217;s monthly activity through Statements. They&#8217;ll also be able to pause or cancel the teen&#8217;s account and Cash Card at any time.</p>
<p>Like some other banking services aimed at teens, there are also restrictions about where Cash Card can be used, based on merchant categories. In Cash App&#8217;s case, younger teens can&#8217;t use the card at bars and clubs, liquor stores, cigar stores, hotels or other lodgings, or for lottery tickets, casinos or gambling, bail and bond payments, or car rentals.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company believes the expansion will open Cash App up to a large market of new users, noting that there are approximately 20 million teens in the U.S. today, who will soon represent a greater portion of spending power in the years to come.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228568" style="width: 623px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228568" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2228568" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_06.png?w=613" alt="" width="613" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_06.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_06.png?resize=135,150 135w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_06.png?resize=270,300 270w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_06.png?resize=768,852 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_06.png?resize=613,680 613w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_06.png?resize=45,50 45w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228568" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cash App</p></div></p>
<p>The expansion comes at a time when Cash App has become one of the fastest-growing digital payments apps in the U.S. Today, it counts<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/09/20/dont-look-now-cash-app-almost-as-big-as-venmo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 70 million</a> annual transacting customers and, recently, introduced tighter integrations with parent company Square, Inc. via the September <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/cash-app-pay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> of Cash App Pay, a Cash App-based checkout experience for Square merchants.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s growth also benefitted from the broader shift to digital payments that took place during the pandemic and its support for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cash-apps-surge-during-covid-19-pandemic-fuels-square-stock-11599039003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accepting users&#8217; COVID stimulus checks</a> and unemployment benefits. In 2021, it generated a gross profit of $546 million, up 94% year-over-year. This growth has put Cash App <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/09/20/dont-look-now-cash-app-almost-as-big-as-venmo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">within striking distance</a> of Venmo, which as of its most recent report, had 76 million users. Now, by opening up to a new teenage userbase, Cash App could close that gap even further.</p>
<p>However, Cash App won&#8217;t be without its competition. The mobile banking market has seen a number of entrants in recent years developing solutions aimed at addressing the needs of teenage users and their families, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/03/greenlight-is-a-debit-card-for-kids-that-parents-manage-from-their-phones/">Greenlight</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/teen-banking-service-step-raises-100m-series-c-announces-steph-currys-investment/">Step</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/mobile-banking-app-current-raises-20m-series-b-tops-half-a-million-users/">Current</a>, <a href="https://www.revolut.com/en-US/get-junior-card" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revolut</a>,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/forget-the-piggy-bank-till-financials-kids-spend-management-app-gets-gates-backing/"> Till Financial,</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/gohenry-a-pre-paid-card-and-finance-app-for-6-18-year-olds-raises-40m/">Go Henry</a>, and others outside the U.S. But what Cash App may have going for it is that its app is not just a &#8220;teen banking service&#8221; &#8212; it&#8217;s an app that users can continue to use even when they age up.</p>
<p>The Cash App for teens is available starting today across iOS and Android in the U.S. Teens and families can learn more through the dedicated website, <a href="http://cash.app/13+" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cash.app/13+</a>.</p>

		Victoria Pettibone is managing partner of Astia Fund, a program of <a href="https://www.astia.org/">Astia</a>, a global organization that invests in women-led companies.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">There is a growing body of articles about the important issue of the lack of investment dollars flowing to Black women founders. For anyone following venture news, this data should not be new: <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/12/02/black-women-female-founders-venture-capital-funding-vc-2020-project-diane/">Fortune</a> reported that while the numbers have tripled since 2018, Black women still only receive 0.27% of all venture dollars in the U.S.;<a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/black-entrepreneurs-vc-funding/"> Sifted</a> reported the number in the U.K. to be 0.24%.</p>
<p>But data, though important for building a case, rarely seems to change behavior (just look at vaccination rates or climate change policy). And data does not begin to articulate the complexity and interconnectedness of the hurdles and barriers causing those numbers, meaning that even well-intentioned investors may be unwittingly contributing to the paltry statistics.</p>
<p>We must do better. As we have worked at Astia to improve our own investment statistics around racial inclusion, we have come face-to-face with some of the nuances behind the numbers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223454" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As a white female investor, I am conscious that my vantage point is one of privilege looking from the outside in, and that there are many more layers that I am not in a position to address. I believe, however, it is important to share some of what I have observed as these are problems that must be addressed &#8212; not just talked about &#8212; by all investors if we are ever to actually change the investment landscape.</p>
<p>Attention must be paid to the many repercussions of the prior-funding hurdle. Because systemic racism in the U.S. has stymied wealth creation over generations for Black women, most Black women founders do not have family and close friends to tap into for that first essential round of funding.</p>
<p>Even if a CEO has broken through barriers and made it to a top university, as was the case in one Astia deal I led, she is less likely to be included in the kind of network that could provide that initial round of funding because networks still, for the most part, divide along gender and race.</p>
<p>One outcome of this lack of a &#8220;friends and family round&#8221; is that a CEO ends up raising in dribs and drabs over many years with smaller check sizes spaced out over a longer time. This can result in her never being able to make key senior hires, invest adequately in marketing or hire top legal professionals, as just a few examples.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The result is a double bind &#8212; the key performance indicators compared to competitors are deemed not good enough to attract investment, but without investment, those KPIs cannot be improved.</p>
<p>Another outcome of raising small checks over time is a cap table can become bloated with hundreds of investors. Most VCs walk away from such a large cap table, missing out on potentially great companies founded by CEOs who lack a wealthy circle of initial investors.</p>
<p>In these moments, it is important to double down and do the work to get the company investment-ready, as a large and potentially messy cap table is the result of a problem with the system, rather than the company or an entrepreneurial red flag.</p>
<p>Coupled with the above, what I have observed is that investors judge Black women to a far higher standard than their counterparts, including white women and <em>especially</em> white men. Rather than being praised for how much she has accomplished with such limited resources, she is judged for what she has achieved to date and not a day further.</p>
<p>Conversely, men &#8212; again, especially white men &#8212; are judged on the vision of what they <em>will</em> create, the promise of what will be. In all cases, when I held conversations with potential syndicate investors, I was struck by how often the reasons for not investing sounded rational but never would have been reasons to <em>not</em> invest were the founder a white man.</p>
<p>Because the reasons sound rational and are connected to KPIs, however, the investor can avoid considering that their own bias might be at play. Never did an investor flip their logic and remark how incredible it was that the KPIs were what they were given the meager funding history to date.</p>
<p>We need to shift the perspective from one of insufficiency &#8212; what hasn’t the founder accomplished? &#8212; to one of opportunity &#8212; what <em>has</em> she accomplished despite the odds and what could be accomplished with resources?</p>
<hr />
<p>The first time I heard an investor use the word “trust” when discussing his interest (or lack thereof) in investing in a Black woman founder, I was struck.</p>
<p>In my experience, that word had never come up in conversations about non-Black CEOs. “I don’t trust her numbers<em>”</em> is a different sentiment than &#8220;That’s an aggressive financial projection,<em>&#8220;</em> which would be the more likely phrasing if she were a man (and were she a man, the reaction would more likely be, &#8220;That CEO has great vision&#8221;).</p>
<p>A huge driver of early-stage investing is betting on the CEO and their team. But through media depictions of male leadership, stories and culture, we have, for the most part, been socialized to more easily <em>trust</em> a white male persona, so when it comes to early-stage investing, this concept of trust is quite insidious.</p>
<p>It is important we pay attention to what words and concepts are being used and point out when words like <em>trust</em> are thrown around. We must question the investor to look deeply at where that is coming from and try to help them see that they are applying a biased lens to their assessment. Sometimes having an uncomfortable conversation directly can help shift a perspective.</p>
<p>Venture capital places substantial value on a company having a lead investor who brings in a significant portion of the round. This construct is potentially problematic for the success of Black women CEOs given that less than 0.3% of venture capital is invested into them. Not only this, but the majority of new funds coming to market that have a focus on underrepresented founders are sub-$100-million funds, due in part to allocators not committing enough capital to that segment (but that is the subject for another column entirely).</p>
<p>Taking these stats into consideration, finding a lead investor who can support a majority of the round is far more challenging &#8212; if not impossible &#8212; for a Black woman CEO. While having one investor negotiate and set terms can be helpful, the idea that a lead has to take a majority position in the round is one that we have chosen to ignore.</p>
<p>Twice we have led the deal into a company run by a Black woman with only a fraction of the full raise to deploy. Eyebrows were raised, especially when we claimed a board seat. We countered those raised eyebrows by saying, &#8220;If you would like to lead, please step in.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one did in either case. By putting a stake in the ground, however, and backing the companies with our reputation, support, contacts and connections, we were able to start attracting additional investment. So while Silicon Valley lawyers or other investors may insist “that’s not how it is done,” remember that what they are saying is “that is not how it is done for white men”<em> &#8212;</em> and go ahead and be a non-traditional lead.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it often seems that naysayers need to experience the problem themselves or be overridden by converts. In the case of funding to Black women CEOs, the overall trend may not change very much until the small number of VCs who are making the bets on Black women CEOs show the world that those bets are paying off.</p>
<p>Happily, there are several new firms taking proactive steps to invest in Black women CEOs, but many have limited pools of capital dedicated to that strategy. My experience with the deals I’ve worked on was that I often had to call upon social capital to pressure other investors to step up as advocates within their own investment committees.</p>
<p>Extra time and thought were required to clean up the historic investment mess that was a result of the prior lack of funding and get the company investment-ready. With far less capital to deploy than I would have wanted, we had to structure investor-attractive deals that gave other investors little reason to say “no” and forced them to push past their biases.</p>
<p>For two of the deals, we held a first close at only 15% of the round, which also raised eyebrows because, again, “that’s not how it is done,” but we had to get cash in the door to support the companies so that they could get through the raise, again due to the lack of prior funding. By taking these <em>abnormal</em> steps, we were finally able to get the ball rolling and investors started to come to the table. In one case, the story ended up a success &#8212; the round was oversubscribed.</p>
<p>But this happened due to a huge amount of intentionality, of constantly facing and confronting biases &#8212; including our own &#8212; and working through them and of learning to become comfortable with uncomfortable conversations.</p>
<p>Without intentionality, these investments could easily have not happened at all, and one &#8212; or four &#8212; more exceptional founders could have ended up out of business, not because of a lack of vision or execution or market size or product-market fit, but because of the numerous barriers tied up in race and gender and that unfortunately are too often overlooked or misunderstood, even by a “well-intentioned” investor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Scale AI has <a href="https://scale.com/blog/siasearch-acquisition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired a small startup</a> that could help expand its reach in Europe and speed up development of its newest product.</p>
<p>Financial terms were not disclosed.</p>
<p>SiaSearch, which spun out of European venture studio Merantix, has built out a data management platform that acts as a search engine for petabyte-scale data captured by advanced driving assistance and automated driving systems. The startup, which is already working with automakers like Volkswagen and Porsche, is able to automatically index and structure the raw sensor data collected by fleets of vehicles.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228163" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That capability fits in nicely with Scale AI&#8217;s existing technology. Scale uses software and people to label image, text, voice and video data for companies building machine learning algorithms. It initially launched to provide autonomous vehicle companies with the labeled data needed to train machine learning models to develop and deploy robotaxis, self-driving trucks and automated bots used in warehouses and on-demand delivery. The company has long since expanded beyond data labeling and is now more of a data management platform. It&#8217;s also serving other industries such as government, finance, e-commerce and enterprise and is now working with companies like Airbnb, DoorDash and Pinterest.</p>
<p>Berlin-based SiaSearch could be particularly beneficial in the build out of Nucleus, which Scale AI co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang has previously called &#8220;the first product of our future.&#8221; The plan is to fold the team into the Nucleus effort, according to Wang.</p>
<p>Nucleus is an AI development platform that Wang describes as the &#8220;Google Photos for machine learning data sets.&#8221; The product provides customers a way to organize, curate and manage massive data sets, giving companies a means to test their models and measure performance among other tasks. SiaSearch allows Scale AI to accelerate its efforts and even expand the functions to support the entire machine learning lifecycle, Wang said.</p>
<p>The aim is weave SiaSearch&#8217;s tech into Nucleus to offer a full data engine that any AI developer can use — even outside of automotive or AV tech. That could prove enormously useful to any company — including robotics companies and automakers — that needs to not only capture, label and organize data, but also to have additional tools to continually redefine what new kinds of data are needed to improve algorithms used in its products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s akin to what Tesla has done, Wang said, who pointed out the company spearheaded the data engine concept to help engineers improve the Autopilot advanced driver assistance system.</p>
<p>Wang said that automotive and robotics companies have struggled with how to make the most of the vast amounts of data, especially as its fleets of vehicles, robots or other devices expand. Merely uploading all of this data back into the cloud would cost literally billions and billions of dollars, Wang said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically what every AI team is really looking for, is how do we supercharge our machine learning development and accelerate our data set efforts, as much as as Tesla&#8217;s been able to,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re just going to give them the same superpowers that Tesla has in terms of being able to constantly supercharge their algorithms with the most relevant, most interesting data from their mobile fleets.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We’ll have a clearer view of 2021 when all the data trickles in after the conclusion of Q4, but it’s clear that female-founded startups are having a better year than they did in 2020.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The coronavirus pandemic disproportionately <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/pandemics-impact-disproportionately-reduced-vc-funding-for-female-founders/">reduced venture capital funding</a> for female founders last year, despite a greater boom in fundraising thanks to megafunds and the advent of Zoom investing. The result was an uneven landscape in which capital flowed more toward men than was normal historically.</p>
<p>But the gender gap in startup fundraising is closing slightly, new PitchBook data shows. Female-founded companies raised $40.4 billion across 2,661 deals through the first three quarters of 2021, almost doubling 2019’s total of $23.7 billion and over 10 times 2011’s total of $3.6 billion.</p>
<p>There’s still significant work to be done, as we remain far from even, far from fair and far from seeing enough change to stop tracking this data set. Companies started by women still raise less and receive lower valuations from investors.</p>
<p>While the rising tide of venture hasn’t lifted all boats, we’ll use this data to explore early inklings of a comeback for the historically overlooked group, from funding to exits to decision-makers.</p>
<h2>Rising investment in female-founded startups</h2>
<p>Venture capital totals are surging around the world, bouncing back sharply from a short period of COVID-induced conservatism that caused some startups to struggle to raise capital at the start of the pandemic. PitchBook, which analyzed investment activity in U.S.-based startups with at least one female founder, shows that female founders are breaking records in this environment.</p>
<p>If you didn’t expect to see improved numbers for female-founded startups this year, you weren’t overly pessimistic: In 2020, despite rising venture capital totals in general, U.S.-based startups founded by women actually saw their deal count fall by 2% and total dollars invested in their enterprises fall by 3%.</p>
<p>As the venture capital pie got larger, female-founded startups raised fewer dollars from fewer rounds, a sharp decline compared to previous years. PitchBook said that in 2019, female founders landed 150 to 200 deals per quarter, worth between $700 million and $950 million. In Q3 2020, the cohort only landed 136 rounds, worth just $434 million. That was in an <em>upmarket</em>.</p>
<p>In better news, thus far in 2021, the backsliding has more than stopped. Indeed, it has shot the other direction.</p>
<p>The headline number of $40.04 billion for U.S.-headquartered, female-founded startups actually doesn&#8217;t pay enough respect to the accelerating pace at which female founders have raised capital. Observe the following chart from the PitchBook-NVCA report:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2227957" style="width: 872px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2227957" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2227957 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-1.59.56-PM.png" alt="" width="862" height="496" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-1.59.56-PM.png 862w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-1.59.56-PM.png?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-1.59.56-PM.png?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-1.59.56-PM.png?resize=768,442 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-1.59.56-PM.png?resize=680,391 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-1.59.56-PM.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2227957" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PitchBook</p></div></p>
<p>The data is clear that female-founded startups just had their best quarter on record in terms of total deal value, despite a modest dip in deal volume from recent all-time highs. This chart is more than bullish, just as its 2020 data points are gobsmackingly bad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Paytm has raised $1.104 billion in India’s largest-ever anchor round as part of its initial public offering, which is also shaping up to be the nation’s largest, as the poster child of the Indian startup ecosystem moves closer to listing in the public markets.</p>
<p>Blackrock, GIC, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Birla MF are among the investors who financed the anchor round, Paytm <a href="https://www.bseindia.com/markets/MarketInfo/DispNewNoticesCirculars.aspx?page=20211103-64" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> in a filing with a local exchange. Bidding for shares of Paytm was oversubscribed by 10 times, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>With Wednesday&#8217;s investment, Paytm has now secured nearly half of the $2.45 billion capital it is looking to raise from the IPO. The startup, which offers a range of financial services, is seeking a valuation of over $19 billion in the IPO, it said in a call with reporters last week. Backed by Alibaba, Berkshire Hathaway and SoftBank, Paytm was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/24/paytm-1-billion/"> valued at $16 billion in its previous funding round</a> in the second half of 2019.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228519" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The investments of $140 million by Blackrock and $126 million by CPPIB are also the largest by institutional investors in an Indian IPO. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Dutch pension investment firm APG, City of New York, Texas Teachers Retirement, NPS Japan, University of Texas, NTUC Pension out of Singapore, University of Cambridge, UBS, Mirae Asset and Standard Life Aberdeen also participated in the anchor round.</p>
<p>Paytm, which will open the bid for its shares for three days starting November 8, has kept the share price range between 2,080 to 2,150 Indian rupees ($27.9 to $28.85). The startup is planning to list around November 18, TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/paytm-seeks-20-billion-valuation-in-indias-biggest-ipo/">previously reported</a>.</p>
<p>A successful listing would enable Paytm to attain the title of the biggest IPO in India, surpassing a record $2.07 billion initial public offering by government-owned coal mining and refining firm Coal India 11 years ago.</p>
<p>Paytm launched in 2009 to help users easily make digital payments from their phones and top up credit. It has since expanded to a wide range of services such as payment gateway, e-commerce marketplace, movie and travel ticket booking, as well as insurance and digital gold.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, led by Vijay Shekhar Sharma, describes itself as having “created a payments-led super app, through which we offer our consumers innovative and intuitive digital products and services.” The startup says it has amassed more than 330 million users across its services, more than a third of whom transact annually.</p>
<p>In a filing last week, Paytm disclosed that it clocked $118 million in revenue from its operations in the quarter that ended in June this year, up 62% from the prior quarter. In Q2, the startup’s losses surged to $50.9 million, Paytm said, citing additional marketing and promotional campaigns in the run up to the IPO.</p>
<p>Paytm’s IPO comes at a time when the pandemic has fuelled India’s digital economy and local stock exchanges are showing growing appetite for consumer tech stocks. Indian food delivery giant Zomato made a stellar debut earlier this year. Shares of Nykaa, a fashion e-commerce startup, and Indian insurance aggregator PolicyBazaar, have also seen strong interest by institutional investors in recent days as both of them plan to list later this month.</p>
<p>In the filing last week, Paytm said that it plans to deploy more than $250 million of the total capital it is seeking to raise in the IPO to enter new initiatives and explore acquisition opportunities. The startup’s offerings compete with a range of services, including Google Pay, WhatsApp Pay, PhonePe, MakeMyTrip and BookMyShow.</p>

The US Commerce Department has added NSO to its Entity List, effectively banning trade with the firm. The move bars American companies from doing business with NSO unless they receive explicit permission. That&#8217;s unlikely, too, when the rule doesn&#8217;t allow license exceptions for exports and the US will default to rejecting reviews.</p>
<p>NSO and fellow Israeli company Candiru (also on the Entity List) face accusations of enabling hostile spying by authoritarian governments. They&#8217;ve allegedly supplied spyware like NSO&#8217;s Pegasus to &#8220;authoritarian governments&#8221; that used the tools to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nso-spyware-targeted-journalists-politicians-190234376.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">track activists, journalists</a> and other critics in a bid to crush political dissent. This is part of the Biden-Harris administration&#8217;s push to make human rights &#8220;the center&#8221; of American foreign policy, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p>The latest round of trade bans also affects Russian company Positive Technologies and Singapore&#8217;s Computer Security Initiative Consultancy, bot of which were accused of peddling hacking tools.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228563" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We&#8217;ve asked NSO Group for comment, although its official media contact address produced an error. The company has strongly rejected claims of enabling abuses in the past, including denials that Pegasus was used to target murdered journalist <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-26-khashoggi-saudi-arabia-hacking-team-tech-blood-money.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">Jamal Khashoggi</a>. NSO said it had blocked access for previous abuses, and it even hired a libel attorney who accused investigative journalists and their partners of misinterpretation and making unfounded assumptions.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department claims to have evidence of NSO&#8217;s actions, though. The net effect is the same. NSO isn&#8217;t necessarily doomed. Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-expands-huawei-trade-restrictions-140237627.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">blocklist member Huawei</a>, though, it may struggle to operate without access to any American partners it used before.</p>
<p><strong>Update 11/3 12PM ET:</strong> An NSO Group spokesperson told Engadget the company was &#8220;dismayed&#8221; by the decision, and claimed its tools helped the US by &#8220;preventing terrorism and crime.&#8221; NSO said it would call for a reversal of the ban and reiterated claims it had the &#8220;world’s most rigorous&#8221; human rights and compliance systems. You can read the full statement below.</p>
<blockquote><p>NSO Group is dismayed by the decision given that our technologies support US national security interests and policies by preventing terrorism and crime, and thus we will advocate for this decision to be reversed. We look forward to presenting the full information regarding how we have the world’s most rigorous compliance and human rights programs that are based the American values we deeply share, which already resulted in multiple terminations of contacts with government agencies that misused our products.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify is <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-11-03/spotify-and-peloton-partner-to-help-you-break-a-sweat-without-missing-a-beat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnering</a> with Peloton to launch a new dedicated &#8220;Curated by Peloton&#8221; shelf within the streaming service’s &#8220;Workout Hub.&#8221; Starting today, Spotify users will get access to seven rotating playlists from Peloton instructors. The playlists include “Running by Peloton,” “Tunde Oyeneyin’s Playlist,” “Strength by Peloton” and more. The curated playlists offer users an inside look into the songs featured in their workout classes.</p>
<p>Spotify has also launched a new “Find Your Instructor” quiz to help users find out which Peloton instructors&#8217; musical tastes align with their own. The quiz asks users a few questions and also looks at their listening behavior to find their best match.</p>
<p>Peloton also notes that it&#8217;s marking the partnership with 11 classes featuring songs from some of Spotify’s popular playlists, including “Today’s Top Hits,” “Door Knockers,” “Lofi Beats,” “Indigo” and “Baila Reggaeton.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228510" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s worth noting that this isn’t the first time Spotify and Peloton have collaborated. Last year, Peloton introduced dozens of classes that featured songs from Spotify’s “Power Hour,” “Rock This” and “Viva Latino” playlists. Spotify also launched a &#8220;Track Love&#8221; feature, which allows Peloton users to save their favorite songs as they play during a class.</p>
<p>The partnership expansion comes as both Spotify and Peloton have fared well over the past year, as the pandemic forced people to explore ways to work out and stay motivated at home.</p>
<p>It also comes as Spotify has been looking to expand its service and partner with other digital companies. Last month, the streaming service partnered with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/spotify-partners-with-shopify-to-add-merch-to-artists-profiles/">e-commerce platform Shopify</a> to allow artists on its service to connect their profiles to their Shopify stores in order to market their merchandise directly to fans through the Spotify app. Spotify also announced a partnership with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/spotify-partners-with-giphy-to-connect-users-with-artists-music-via-gifs/">online GIF database GIPHY</a> earlier this year to enable the discovery of new music through GIFs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is furthering its investment in original podcasts with today&#8217;s debut of the new true crime-focused Apple Original podcast &#8220;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hooked/id1592401710?ign-itscg=80085&amp;ign-itsct=pod_show_AppleOG_hooked" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hooked</a>.&#8221; The nine-part series will explore the story of a top engineer, Tony Hathaway, whose addiction to opioids led him to become one of the most prolific bank robbers in U.S. history. The podcast is produced by Campside Media and is hosted by its co-founder, Josh Dean. It features interviews conducted over three years with Hathaway, his family, law enforcement officers and others involved in the story.</p>
<p>While the subject matter may be compelling, what makes this podcast stand out is that, despite being branded an &#8220;Apple TV+ podcast,&#8221; the show &#8220;Hooked&#8221; is not a tie-in to another Apple TV+ series or film. (At least not one that&#8217;s been announced.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228543" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228543" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2228543" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228543" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228505" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Other Apple TV+ branded podcasts, meanwhile, serve as companions to the streaming platform&#8217;s original video programming, including &#8220;The Line&#8221; (tied to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/originals/the-line/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warfare documentary</a> airing later this month), as well as &#8220;For All Mankind: The Official Podcast,&#8221; &#8220;Foundation: The Official Podcast,&#8221; and &#8220;The Problem With Jon Stewart: The Official Podcast.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not the first time Apple has experimented with a standalone podcast of some kind, however.</p>
<p>Last year, it launched the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/apple-further-expands-into-original-podcasts-with-launch-of-the-zane-lowe-interview-series/">music interview podcast &#8220;The Zane Lowe Interview Series,</a>&#8221; which saw Apple&#8217;s Global Creative Director Lowe having conversations with popular artists like Billie Eilish, Justin Bieber, Kanye West, Hayley Williams and Lady Gaga. Before that, Apple published corporate news as podcasts, including its <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-keynotes/id275834665" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keynotes</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-keynotes/id275834665" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earnings calls</a> and <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/artist/events-at-the-apple-store/409812684" target="_blank" rel="noopener">events</a> at the Apple Store. It also once used the podcasting medium to distribute its 2019 Grammy&#8217;s Celebration, which had first livestreamed on Beats 1.</p>
<p>Although produced by Campside Media, the new &#8220;Hooked&#8221; podcast was developed through the Apple TV+ creative team, which is why Apple TV+ is credited on the podcast&#8217;s page alongside the media company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The launch of a standalone podcast in a top genre like true crime could indicate an interest in testing the market for more Originals that aren&#8217;t necessarily tied to other efforts, like Apple TV+ or Apple Music.</p>
<p>Unlike some of rival Spotify&#8217;s Originals and Exclusives, this show won&#8217;t be locked into the Apple Podcasts app. Instead, users can choose to tune in via an app of their choosing, as the episodes are published both on Apple Podcasts and via RSS.</p>
<p>Apple Podcasts is available in more than 100 languages and in over 170 countries and regions across iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV, HomePod mini, CarPlay, iTunes on Windows and via other smart speakers and car systems, notes Apple.</p>
<p>But RSS means the show can also be streamed via a third-party podcast app, like Pocket Casts, Overcast, Castbox, Podbean and others.</p>
<p>The first three episodes of &#8220;Hooked&#8221; are live today and new episodes will subsequently roll out every Wednesday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Take a dollop of machine learning, a handful of radar sensors and a market that is clamoring for autonomous cars not mowing down hordes of pedestrians, and you&#8217;ve got yourself a particularly frothy fundraising environment. Hot on the heels from the $10 million round <a href="https://spartanradar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spartan Radar</a> announced <a href="https://spartanradar.com/blog/spartan-radar-raises-10-million-in-seed-funding-to-advance-autonomous-vehicle-radar-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in August</a>, the company today announced it snagged another $15 million from investors led by <a href="https://www.primemoverslab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prime Movers Lab</a>. Additional investors include 8VC and Mac VC.</p>
<p>Not half shabby for a company that didn&#8217;t exist two years ago &#8212; it was founded in 2020. The company is putting itself in the mix in the intersection between the car&#8217;s radar and its self-driving tech. It argues that the radar technology on current and next-generation autonomous vehicles (AV) is pretty decent, but that the car often doesn&#8217;t know what to make of what the radar &#8220;sees,&#8221; and ends up making mistakes in the process.</p>
<p>&#8220;The automotive industry&#8217;s pivot to lower levels of automation makes radar more attractive than lidar,&#8221; Spartan Radar founder and CEO Nathan Mintz maintains. &#8220;While showing lots of initial promise, lidar is failing to live up to all the hype, but the need for high-resolution systems hasn&#8217;t gone away. The processing power finally exists to utilize advanced algorithms like super-resolution in real time to make radar a far better option for automakers.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228270" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company calls its product Biomimetic Radar and claims that it can mimic <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">human perception processes for enhanced focus and context. It says its algorithms dramatically speed up processing and reduce radar’s historic shortcomings, including lower resolution and false detections. This, in turn, clears the way for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_driver-assistance_systems#ADAS_levels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADAS level 2</a> and beyond in terms of safety and commercial deployment of autonomous vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> The company’s software can be deployed on almost all existing radar systems, and while the company didn&#8217;t comment on any specific deals it has in the pipeline, the two rapid-fire funding rounds would suggest there are customers waiting in the wings.</span></p>
<p>“Unfortunately, we are seeing evidence that lidar-based systems can behave like the distracted drivers they were intended to replace. Spartan’s radar systems are a leap forward in autonomous vehicle technology, bringing AVs and ADAS systems to where they need to be for the needs of the industry today,” said David Siminoff, general partner at Prime Movers Lab, who will be joining the company&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>“After billions of dollars in investments and several AV companies going public, the industry is finally ready to move beyond R&amp;D to commercialize at scale in defined use-cases like last-mile delivery, trucking and robotaxi. OEMs and AV developers need safe, robust sensor solutions that are ready to go to market next year and we&#8217;re prepared to meet that need,” Mintz said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

The powerplants, taken from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-mach-e-gt-hands-on-american-muscle-car-for-the-21st-century-100005360.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">Mustang Mach-E GT</a>Performance Edition, give the F-100 a total 480HP and 634lb/ft of torque. Ford didn&#8217;t discuss performance benchmarks or range, but it&#8217;s safe to presume you could smoke some sports cars with that kind of power.</p>
<p>The truck has more customizations beyond the EV motors, including the vertical center-stack touchscreen from the Mach-E. You&#8217;ll also see custom aluminum Forgeline wheels, a billet aluminum dash from JJR Fabrication and avocado-tanned leather from MDM Upholstery. This may look like a classic truck, but it&#8217;s not appointed like one.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t buy this concept, as you might have guessed. Instead, Ford would rather you buy the $3,900 Eluminator motor for your project car. The automaker eventually hopes to supply everything you might need for an EV retrofit, including batteries, controllers and traction inverters. You&#8217;d only want to buy the motor right now if you have the resources to complete the rest of the puzzle yourself. This does, however, hint at a future where many beloved combustion engine cars can get a second life through an EV transplant.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228477" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/clearview-ai-ruled-illegal-by-canadian-privacy-authorities/">Canada</a>, now Australia has found that controversial facial recognition company, Clearview AI, broke national privacy laws when it covertly collected citizens&#8217; facial biometrics and incorporated them into its AI-powered identity matching service &#8212; which it sells to law enforcement agencies and others.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/updates/news-and-media/clearview-ai-breached-australians-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> today, Australia&#8217;s information commissioner and privacy commissioner, Angelene Falk, said Clearview AI&#8217;s facial recognition tool breached the country&#8217;s Privacy Act 1988 by:</p>
<ul>
<li>collecting Australians’ sensitive information without consent</li>
<li>collecting personal information by unfair means</li>
<li>not taking reasonable steps to notify individuals of the collection of personal information</li>
<li>not taking reasonable steps to ensure that personal information it disclosed was accurate, having regard to the purpose of disclosure</li>
<li>not taking reasonable steps to implement practices, procedures and systems to ensure compliance with the Australian Privacy Principles</li>
</ul>
<p>In what looks like a major win for privacy down under, the regulator has ordered Clearview to stop collecting facial biometrics and biometric templates from Australians; and to destroy all existing images and templates that it holds.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228433" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) undertook a joint investigation into Clearview with the U.K. data protection agency, the Information Commission&#8217;s Office (IOC).</p>
<p>However the U.K. regulator has yet to announce any conclusions.</p>
<p>In a separate <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2021/11/clearview-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> today &#8212; which possibly reads slightly flustered &#8212; the ICO said it is &#8220;considering its next steps and any formal regulatory action that may be appropriate under the UK data protection laws&#8221;.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the ICO declined to elaborate further &#8212; such as on how long it will be thinking about maybe doing something.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>U.K. citizens should be hoping the regulator doesn&#8217;t take as long &#8220;considering&#8221; Clearview as it has chewing over (but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/adtech-told-to-keep-calm-and-fix-its-lawfulness-problem/">failing to act against) adtech&#8217;s lawfulness problem</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other European regulators have already hit users of Clearview with sanctions&#8230;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Sweden&#8217;s data watchdog slaps police for unlawful use of Clearview AI&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/swedens-data-watchdog-slaps-police-for-unlawful-use-of-clearview-ai/embed/#?secret=GT1atsyXsB" data-secret="GT1atsyXsB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Back on the other side of the world, the OAIC isn&#8217;t wasting any time acting against Clearview, nor mincing its words.</p>
<p>In public comments on the OAIC&#8217;s decision (<a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/11284/Commissioner-initiated-investigation-into-Clearview-AI,-Inc.-Privacy-2021-AICmr-54-14-October-2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pdf</a>) finding Clearview breached Australian law, Falk said: &#8220;The covert collection of this kind of sensitive information is unreasonably intrusive and unfair. It carries significant risk of harm to individuals, including vulnerable groups such as children and victims of crime, whose images can be searched on Clearview AI’s database.&#8221;</p>
<p>“By its nature, this biometric identity information cannot be reissued or cancelled and may also be replicated and used for identity theft. Individuals featured in the database may also be at risk of misidentification,&#8221; she also said, adding: “These practices fall well short of Australians’ expectations for the protection of their personal information.”</p>
<p>The OAIC also found the privacy impacts of Clearview AI’s biometric system were &#8220;not necessary, legitimate and proportionate, having regard to any public interest benefits&#8221;.</p>
<p>“When Australians use social media or professional networking sites, they don’t expect their facial images to be collected without their consent by a commercial entity to create biometric templates for completely unrelated identification purposes,” said Falk.</p>
<p>“The indiscriminate scraping of people’s facial images, only a fraction of whom would ever be connected with law enforcement investigations, may adversely impact the personal freedoms of all Australians who perceive themselves to be under surveillance.”</p>
<p>Australia&#8217;s regulator said that between October 2019 and March 2020 Clearview AI provided trials of its tool to some local police forces &#8212; which conducted searches using facial images of individuals located in Australia.</p>
<p>The OAIC added that it is currently finalising an investigation into the Australian Federal Police’s trial use of the tech to decide whether the force complied with requirements under the Australian Government Agencies Privacy Code to assess and mitigate privacy risks. So it remains to be seen if local law enforcement will get a sanction.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Sweden&#8217;s data protection watchdog warned the country&#8217;s cops over what it said was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/swedens-data-watchdog-slaps-police-for-unlawful-use-of-clearview-ai/">unlawful use of Clearview&#8217;s tool</a> &#8212; issuing a €250,000 fine in that instance.</p>
<p>Returning to the OAIC, it said Clearview defended itself by arguing that the information it handled was not personal data &#8212; and that, as a company based in the U.S., it did not fall under the jurisdiction of Australia&#8217;s Privacy Act. Clearview also claimed to the regulator that it had stopped offering services to Australian law enforcement shortly after the OAIC’s investigation began.</p>
<p>However, Falk dismissed Clearview&#8217;s arguments, saying she was satisfied it must comply with Australian law and that the information it handled was personal information covered by the Privacy Act.</p>
<p>She also said the case reinforces the need for Australia to strengthen protections through a <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act/review-of-the-privacy-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">current review of the Privacy Act</a>, including restricting or prohibiting practices such as data scraping personal information from online platforms. And she added that the case raises<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> additional questions about whether online platforms are doing enough to prevent and detect scraping of personal data.</span></p>
<p>“Clearview AI’s activities in Australia involve the automated and repetitious collection of sensitive biometric information from Australians on a large scale, for profit. These transactions are fundamental to their commercial enterprise,” said Falk. “The company’s patent application also demonstrates the capability of the technology to be used for other purposes such as dating, retail, dispensing social benefits, and granting or denying access to a facility, venue or device.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearview was contacted for comment on the OAIC&#8217;s decision.</p>
<p>The company confirmed that it will be appealing &#8212; sending this statement (below), attributed to Mark Love, BAL Lawyers, representing Clearview AI:</p>
<blockquote><p>Clearview AI has gone to considerable lengths to co-operate with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. In doing so, Clearview AI has volunteered considerable information, yet it is apparent to us and to Clearview AI that the Commissioner has not correctly understood how Clearview AI conducts its business. Clearview AI operates legitimately according to the laws of its places of business.</p>
<p>Clearview AI intends to seek review of the Commissioner&#8217;s decision by the (Australian) Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Not only has the Commissioner’s decision missed the mark on the manner of Clearview AI’s manner of operation, the Commissioner lacks jurisdiction.</p>
<p>To be clear, Clearview AI has not violated any law nor has it interfered with the privacy of Australians. Clearview AI does not do business in Australia, does not have any Australian users.</p></blockquote>
<p>The controversial facial recognition company has faced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/14/class-action-suit-against-clearview-ai-cites-illinois-law-that-cost-facebook-550m/">litigation on home soil in the U.S.</a> &#8212; under Illinois&#8217; Biometric Information Privacy Act.</p>
<p>While, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/minneapolis-facial-recognition-ban/">earlier this year</a>, Minneapolis voted to ban the use of facial recognition software for its police department &#8212; effectively outlawing local law enforcement&#8217;s use of tools like Clearview.</p>
<p>The fallout from Clearview AI&#8217;s scraping of the public web and social media sites to amass a database of over 3 billion images in order to sell a global identity-matching service to law enforcement may have contributed to an announcement made by Facebook&#8217;s parent company Meta yesterday &#8212; which said it would be deleting its own facial biometric data mountain.</p>
<p>The tech giant cited &#8220;growing concerns about the use of the technology as a whole&#8221;.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="BpIEhbqZMZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/facebook-face-recognition-data-deleting/">Facebook says it will delete facial recognition data on more than a billion users</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook says it will delete facial recognition data on more than a billion users&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/facebook-face-recognition-data-deleting/embed/#?secret=BpIEhbqZMZ" data-secret="BpIEhbqZMZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> In addition to the above statement, Clearview&#8217;s founder, Hoan Ton-That, has also issued a personal response (pasted below) to the OAIC&#8217;s decision &#8212; in which he expresses his disappointment and argues that the privacy commissioner&#8217;s decision misinterprets the value of his &#8220;crime fighting&#8221; technology to society:</p>
<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr">
<div dir="ltr">I grew up in Australia before moving to San Francisco at age 19 to pursue my career and create consequential crime fighting facial recognition technology known the world over. I am a dual citizen of Australia and the United States, the two countries about which I care most deeply. My company and I have acted in the best interests of these two nations and their people by assisting law enforcement in solving heinous crimes against children, seniors and other victims of unscrupulous acts. We only collect public data from the open internet and comply with all standards of privacy and law. I respect the time and effort that the Australian officials spent evaluating aspects of the technology I built. But I am disheartened by the misinterpretation of its value to society. I look forward to engaging in conversation with leaders and lawmakers to fully discuss the privacy issues, so the true value of Clearview AI’s technology, which has proven so essential to law enforcement, can continue to make communities safe.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tinder has already undergone a big revamp with its recent <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-06-22-Tinder-Expands-Into-Video-and-Social-Experiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> of &#8220;Explore,&#8221; a new section inside the app that will enable more interactive experiences, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/tinders-new-murder-mystery-themed-swipe-night-returns-november-7/">the second &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; series</a>, real-time chat, interest-based matching and more. Now, parent company Match Group is detailing its longer-term vision for Tinder and Explore, which will expand to include exclusive, shared and live experiences and a virtual goods-based economy, supported by Tinder&#8217;s new in-app currency, Tinder Coins. In addition, Match spoke today about its broader plans for a dating &#8220;metaverse,&#8221; and avatar-based virtual experiences that may later roll out to apps across its portfolio, including Tinder.</p>
<p>In terms of the virtual economy, the first phase of its development includes Tinder Coins, which are already being tested in several markets, including a few countries in Europe, Match said.</p>
<p>Next year, Tinder Coins will become available to global users to make in-app purchases of Tinder&#8217;s à la carte products, like Boost and Super Like &#8212; tools aimed at helping online daters get more matches. They&#8217;ll also be used for new pay-as-you-go products that were previously only available with a subscription, like the See Who Likes You feature. And they&#8217;ll be used to incentivize certain behaviors on the app, like encouraging members to verify their profiles or add videos to their bio, for example.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228395" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2228443" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228443" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2228443" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-03-at-10.48.01-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228443" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Match Group</p></div></p>
<p>Longer-term, however, Tinder will evolve its app to include virtual goods and a trading ecosystem, which is being planned for 2022 and beyond. This strategic initiative was detailed during Tinder parent company Match Group&#8217;s Q3 earnings, including in its Shareholder Letter and on its earnings call with investors on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>Across its dating app portfolio, Match Group had <a href="https://ir.mtch.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Match-Group-Reports-Third-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> Q3 revenue of $802 million, up 25% year-over-year, and 16.3 million paid subscribers, up 16%. But the company was transparent about the fact that the COVID pandemic has had an impact on its business &#8212; lockdowns early in the pandemic had forced a pivot toward virtual experiences. And now, some users are still less inclined to meet in-person, compared with before the pandemic. In addition, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-02/match-forecast-misses-estimates-on-lingering-covid-in-asia?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">citing lingering COVID effects in Asia</a>, Match Group forecasted weaker Q4 growth than expected, with $810-$820 million in revenue instead of the analyst forecast of $838 million.</p>
<p>To address this changing market for online dating, Tinder has leaned into virtual experiences that take place inside the app, instead of only pushing people to get offline for connections. That&#8217;s led to the launch of Tinder Explore, and now, it&#8217;s driving plans for the forthcoming virtual goods-based economy Tinder has in the works.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>According to Match Group CEO Shar Dubey, speaking to investors on today&#8217;s call, Tinder&#8217;s virtual goods will &#8220;help users with both self-expression as well as the ability to stand out &#8212; particularly in a one-to-many surface area that &#8216;Explore&#8217; experiences will enable,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And so the way we envision virtual goods is that it&#8217;s something users will be able to collect, as well as give and gift to others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dubey said Tinder in 2022 would be working to design the virtual goods, categorize them, create their value structure and determine where to best showcase the items on users&#8217; Tinder profiles. This will involve testing virtual goods then iterating and refining the product further, based on those tests. Despite the work that still needs to be done, the exec was optimistic about this plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we get this right, I do think this could be a multi-year revenue vector for Tinder, which doesn&#8217;t exist today,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>In addition to developing a virtual goods economy inside Tinder, Match Group also spoke to its larger plans for leveraging Hyperconnect, the Seoul-based social app maker it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/match-hyperconnect-acquisition/">acquired for $1.73 billion</a> earlier in 2021. So far, Hyperconnect has not performed as well as expected, in part due to COVID and in part due to other issues &#8212; including marketing performance and product delays, the company admitted.</p>
<p>But Match still believes in Hyperconnect&#8217;s long-term value to its business, Dubey said.</p>
<p>She talked specifically about Hyperconnect&#8217;s test of an avatar-based dating app and &#8220;metaverse&#8221; experience called Single Town, where users interact using real-time audio and meet each other in virtual spaces, like a bar, where they have live audio conversations. Users can express interest in one another in the virtual world, then choose to connect privately to continue their conversations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is metaverse experiences coming to life in a way that is transformative to how people meet and get to know each other on a dating or social discovery platform, and is much more akin to how people interact in the real world,&#8221; Dubey said of the test.</p>
<p>This type of interactivity is something Match Group eventually wants to leverage across its portfolio, the company said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This next phase of dating apps, in particular, is going to be all about richer, more organic and more akin to real-life ways of discovering, meeting and getting to know people. Technology is finally getting there. And this underlying technology platform Hyperconnect has built that powers Single Town has been built in a way that it can be leveraged by other platforms easily,&#8221; Dubey noted, but without naming which Match-owned apps she had in mind.</p>
<p>However, it seems a metaverse-like platform for dating could later tie into something like Tinder&#8217;s virtual goods economy, though the company didn&#8217;t state this was the plan. But based on current social trends, it&#8217;s obvious how a dating app&#8217;s users could one day buy items to accessorize their avatar or buy gifts for other users, which are purchased with virtual currency &#8212; much like in other &#8220;metaverse&#8221; platforms, like Roblox, Fortnite or within Meta&#8217;s (Facebook&#8217;s) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751220/facebook-portal-oculus-quest-meta-horizon-renaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon.</a></p>
<p>In its Shareholder Letter, Match Group only hinted toward the possibilities for this dating metaverse and the experiences it creates.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new experience provides a glimpse into how metaverse experiences could be applicable to dating and it is the sort of innovation that will help us evolve our portfolio as we enter the next phase of dating,&#8221; the letter stated.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re still very optimistic about the long-term prospects for Hyperconnect,&#8221; explained Match Group CFO and COO Gary Swidler, on the call. &#8220;It can contribute extremely significantly to the long-term growth of the overall Match Group. There&#8217;s many ways that we can do that. We think that we can leverage video, audio, AI capabilities that they&#8217;ve got, things in moderation, and safety. There&#8217;s a number of things that we&#8217;re working very hard at leveraging,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;The new metaverse elements and the experience that we&#8217;re seeing in that beta test &#8212; that is something that potentially we can build into either standalone app and/or potentially leverage that user experience into some of our apps in the portfolio,&#8221; Swidler said.</p>
