										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/techcrunch-live/">TechCrunch Live</a> (formerly Extra Crunch Live) has been <em>incredibly</em> educational over the past few months. We&#8217;ve learned how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/stephanie-zhan-walks-through-the-rec-room-pitch-deck-that-won-sequoias-investment/">Rec Room&#8217;s pitch landed investment from Sequoia</a>, how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/06/craft-your-pitch-deck-around-that-one-thing-that-can-really-hook-an-investor/">Wheel crafted a pitch deck that hooked Tusk Venture&#8217;s Jordan Nof</a>, how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/how-retail-ziplines-series-a-pitch-deck-ticked-every-box-for-emergence-capital/">Retail Zipline ticked every box for Emergence Capital</a> and how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/ceo-shishir-mehrotra-and-investor-s-somasegar-reveal-what-sings-in-codas-pitch-doc/">Coda made their pitch doc sing for Madrona Capital</a>.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s plenty more where that came from.</p>
<p>TechCrunch Live is specifically designed to help founders build better venture-backed businesses. We do this by bringing together startup founders and the investors who back them to talk about what, specifically, helped close the deal. What metrics are the investors looking at? What questions did the founders answer that made the VCs want to learn more? How did the founders communicate their grand vision, and their step-by-step plan to getting there?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217550" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We cover all this &#8212; complete with a look at these companies&#8217; early pitch decks, and more &#8212; on TechCrunch Live. TechCrunch Live is also home to the TCL Pitch-off, where founders in the audience can get on our virtual stage to pitch their startup to our esteemed guests and get their live feedback.</p>
<p>As with any TechCrunch event, this weekly series also features networking so you can meet and greet other attendees.</p>
<p>The event goes down every Wednesday at noon PT/3pm ET, and is free to attend. Only TechCrunch+ members get access to the complete library of on-demand content, so if you haven&#8217;t yet already, sign up now!</p>
<p>And without any further ado, here is a look at the outstanding guests joining us on TechCrunch Live in November.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Storing great pools of data is an increasingly figured-out challenge. Between public clouds, and data lakes more specifically, you can stick oceans of corporate data in any number of places. But leveraging that data into something useful is another challenge altogether.</p>
<p>The analogy that data is this era&#8217;s oil is at best half-baked. Oil takes ages to form, while data doesn&#8217;t, for example. But where the data:oil comparison does work to a degree is that crude oil is not good for that many things by itself. You have to refine it to get the plethora of products that still power the modern world.</p>
<p>Data isn&#8217;t too different. And at the upcoming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=datapanelpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=datapanelpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechCrunch Sessions: SaaS on October 27</a> event we&#8217;re hosting a panel to dig more deeply into the matter. Barr Moses, co-founder and CEO of Monte Carlo will join DataRobot CEO Dan Wright and Jenn Knight, co-founder and CTO at AgentSync to guide us through the topic.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219477" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Monte Carlo helps companies with their data ingestion through a product-set called data <em>observability. </em>AgentSync sits inside the world of insurance data, helping pass key information regarding brokers between different parties. And DataRobot, recently valued at $6.25 billion per Crunchbase data, has built a data platform that combines AI, automation, and machine learning into a single package, making machine learning more efficient.</p>
<p>So, we&#8217;ll have folks with deep knowledge regarding how to make sure data arrives, how to link data to other platforms, and how to massage it deeply to better understand its contours.</p>
<p>With that collected panel, we&#8217;ll dig into two main themes. The first dealing with their companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why there are so many startups attacking the data market from different angles, and when we may see consolidation in the market for data-related products</li>
<li>Building platforms versus building more targeted solutions</li>
<li>What&#8217;s ahead for the data market that founders may not be aware of</li>
</ul>
<p>And some more in-market questions regarding how modern companies are leveraging data today:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li>How effectively startups are using machine learning today, and corporations more generally</li>
<li>How data can lead to better customer understanding, if at all</li>
<li>The tension between greater data collection, and analysis and privacy</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s going to be a blast. I can&#8217;t wait to host, as I am going to learn a lot. Tickets start at just $35 but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=datapanelpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=datapanelpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book yours today</a> before prices go up at the door. See you there!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">John Diener, the CEO of an aquaculture nutrition and genetics company, would visit hundreds of shrimp farms as part of his job. But gradually he became frustrated by some of the environmentally unsustainable practices used in many locations. One night, his wife bought some frozen shrimp to cook for dinner and he realized the industry he was involved in was poised to affect the health of his own family. Why? Because the shrimp was from a country that is known to use antibiotics on its shrimp farms. He decided enough was enough, and set about building a new model for seafood.</p>
<p>The result was <a href="http://verticaloceans.blue">Vertical Oceans</a>, a startup that grows sustainable shrimp in huge &#8220;aqua towers&#8221;, which can be located inside cities, potentially in facilities that even look like buildings. The towers can incubate shrimp without chemicals or antibiotics, and out of season. And let’s remember, Shrimp is a $50 billion a year market globally.</p>
<p>Coming out of IndieBio, Vertical Oceans has now closed a $3.5 million seed round with Khosla Ventures. This would appear to be the first time a major Silicon Valley fund has invested directly in an aquaculture startup (as far we know). Khosla led the round at $3 million and <a href="https://sosv.com/">SOSV</a> followed their pro-rata for the remaining $500,000.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220298" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>So far the startup has had 10 harvests in the last 6 months from its small proof of concept facility in Singapore to demonstrate the core biological concept works and can produce a good product.</p>
<p>Competition-wise, there are two companies in Singapore with vertical aquaculture systems &#8211; Universal Aquaculture and Apollo Aquaculture. There is an indoor system in the US called Tru Shrimp which is not specifically vertical farming but is developing a scalable indoor farming technology.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220314" style="width: 707px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220314" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2220314" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iHAB-ISO-Cover.jpg" alt="Vertical Oceans tanks" width="697" height="330" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iHAB-ISO-Cover.jpg 697w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iHAB-ISO-Cover.jpg?resize=150,71 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iHAB-ISO-Cover.jpg?resize=300,142 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iHAB-ISO-Cover.jpg?resize=680,322 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/iHAB-ISO-Cover.jpg?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220314" class="wp-caption-text">Vertical Oceans tanks</p></div></p>
<p>Diener says: “Our product tastes like fresh shrimp from the ocean, that&#8217;s really hard to achieve consistently in a recirculating aquaculture system. Because our product is so high quality and fresh, we can sell on par with fresh wild-caught versus farmed frozen shrimp. This higher price more than offsets the costs of going vertical and urban.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The system is specifically designed to be ‘location agnostic’ vertical farming in urban locations, including cities with cold winters like Chicago. It’s now expanding into a new facility adjacent to downtown Singapore where it will develop its technologies at full scale.</p>
<p>Diener and co-founder Enzo Acerbi previously worked together at an insect protein company where we helped to develop and scale up their technology so we have experience with scaling AgriTech.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since its earliest days, the Portal line has been plagued by one major question: why? Not so much why did Facebook make it (for that I give you the following: $$$), but rather, why should people be interested, given Amazon and Google’s respective head starts in both the smart assistant and display categories?</p>
<p>In addition to its integration with Facebook services, Portal’s original standout feature was smart panning, which used object detection to reframe its subjects. It was a clever addition &#8212; if not necessarily enough to justify purchasing a Facebook-produced product over the competition. Since then, however, Google, Amazon and even Apple have introduced their own versions of the technology, removing Facebook’s edge.</p>

<p>While the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/facebook-adds-a-battery-powered-smart-screen-to-the-portal-line/">Portal Go</a> doesn’t address the larger question of why, it does once again showcase Facebook’s ability to think outside the smart screen box by adding portability to the mix. Honestly, it’s one of those things I’m surprised the competition hasn’t gotten on board with. Amazon discontinued its portable Bluetooth speaker, the Tap, some time ago.</p>
<p>Beyond that, you’d have look to an Alexa-enabled Fire tablet or third-party devices for a similarly portable solution. Otherwise, the Amazon and Google solution has effectively been convincing users to simply stick a device in every room in which they plan to use it. Personally, I’ve always wondering why they’ve not embraced the flexibility of a battery-powered model.</p>
<p>The Go was built with portability in mind, right down to the inclusion of a built-in handle on the rear of the device. It’s a reasonably light three pounds (compared to, say, the 4.7-pound MacBook Pro that Apple just launched). Does anyone need a smart screen they can take with them? Certainly no more than anyone needs a smart screen period, but there’s a lot to be said for flexibility. For a device primarily designed for video, it’s genuinely nice to be able to pick it up and take it with you.</p>

<p>The key to this is a built-in battery and wireless charging. The latter relies on a proprietary three-pin charging pad with a USB-C plug on the other side. The charger may be my biggest complaint about product design here. I understand why Facebook decided not to go hardwired here, so you can simply pick it up and go without unplugging. But a wired charging option would have been nice, letting you top that battery up faster. At the very least, it would be great to have a charging pad that snaps into place magnetically, because it’s a pain getting the pins aligned to charge the thing.</p>

<p>The display is a 10-inch touchscreen, with 1280 x 800 resolution. Nothing to write home about there, but certainly adequate for a vast majority of what you need to do on this thing, from teleconferencing to watching bite-sized videos through Facebook. That’s coupled with a 12-megapixel front-facing camera and a four-mic array. Again, this isn’t going to compete with the teleconference setup you invested in when the world went to hell and all meetings went virtual, but it’s perfectly fine for calling family or even taking the occasional work meeting. The fabric-covered back of the device houses two rear-facing speakers and a woofer. The sound isn’t great. It&#8217;s a bit muffled. Not something I would use in everyday music listening, but it works in a pinch.</p>
<p>The device is chunkier than most smart displays. It’s got rounded corners and a sizable bezel, wrapped in a fabric covering that’s standard fare for home products these days. In fact, the design is something of a cross between an Echo or Nest-style home product and something targeted toward kids. The latter lends it a kind of robustness you’d want out of a portable product like this.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2218427" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2218427" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2218427" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0406.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2218427" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>It’s not rugged exactly, but it can probably handle the occasional accidental knocks and bumps better than, say, the Nest Home. That, combined with some of the storybook content, may make the Go better suited than most for a setting with younger kids around. There’s a physical shutter that slides over the front-facing camera. If you’re like me, you’re probably going to keep that on 90% of the time &#8212; essentially any time I’m not making a call. That doesn’t disable the microphone, but a circular button sitting next to the volume keys will. Clicking that will take the camera and microphone offline, denoted with a red light.</p>
<p>For Facebook calling in particular, the thing is a cinch. Say, “hey Portal, call such and such,” and it will show you a name and ask if it found the right person. This is really the heart of the product, offering a device specifically tailored to the sorts of conversations you would have through Facebook Messenger. You can add filters and watch videos or read story books together. The device’s strength has always been in these shared experiences, built specifically around Facebook&#8217;s software.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220179" style="width: 6730px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220179" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2220179 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg" alt="" width="6720" height="4480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0469.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6720px) 100vw, 6720px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220179" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>There are shared storybooks, good for grandparents connecting remotely with grandkids. The selection of filters in the Facebook Messenger app is just okay. They’ll add funny hats and occasionally distort your voice, but aren’t really aimed at, say, smoothing perceived flaws, for better or worse. I found that they struggled a bit on slower Wi-Fi, ditto for the Facebook Watch videos &#8212; in some cases there was a lag, which can ruin the effect a bit.</p>
<p>The app selection beyond Facebook is limited. Spotify, Tidal, Deezer and Pandora are nice. The Go works as a portable Bluetooth speaker with a built-in display. I found myself turning off the camera, bringing it into the bedroom and listening to music by interacting with Spotify on the touchscreen. You’ve got a decent selection on the teleconferencing front, including Zoom, WebEx and Blue Jeans. It’s not a catchall, but that should cover a decent number of work meetings.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220178" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220178" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2220178" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0472.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0472.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0472.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0472.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0472.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0472.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0472.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0472.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220178" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>It handles these well &#8212; in fact, that, combined with portability, is probably the most compelling use case of the bunch. The leading smart displays all have some compatibility with third-party teleconferencing apps, but it’s nice being able to move it around and not have to worry about finding an outlet if you don’t want to be stuck to your desk all day.</p>
<p>Beyond this, the app selection is bare-boned. There are a couple of news and cooking apps, while popular third-party services like YouTube are available as browser shortcuts. If you want to, say, watch Netflix, you can visit the site in the browser and watch it that way. Ultimately, much of it comes down to that. If you’re all in on Facebook apps (and all of the complications that brings), then one of these is probably the device for you.</p>
<p>On the portability side, there’s isn’t really any direct competition to the Go at the moment. The product doesn’t answer the broader questions of “why” for the Portal line, but at least it addresses the &#8220;where.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Sixteen years in and now valued at $7.5 billion, Automattic has found a multitude of strides, even as it strives to own ever more of the media market.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s hard to build a publishing empire, and it&#8217;s just as easy to lose one. Newspaper magnates were mostly replaced by broadcast moguls, first radio and then TV and cable, and now of course, they are all fighting against the social media tycoons and streaming impresarios who want to capture our attention. Each generation of media titans dies off and is replaced, just as each medium finds its niche only to be supplanted by something novel.</p>
<p>So when it comes to <b>Automattic</b>, the leading commercial complement to the open-source <b>WordPress</b> publishing platform, time and longevity have a rather peculiar meaning in an industry littered with the gravestones of media sites of yore. Founded in 2005, the company continues to assiduously evolve and expand as it staves off that ambient and inclement sense of doom that pervades media.</p>
<p>Sixteen years in and now valued at $7.5 billion, Automattic has found a multitude of strides, even as it strives to own ever more of the media market. It’s a publisher, a social media network via its acquisition of Tumblr, an e-commerce giant with WooCommerce, a productivity tool with P2, and more. It reached this peak doing pretty much everything wrong, according to VCs, a strategy, as we will see, that proved to be exponentially effective in the long run.</p>
<p>The lead writer for this TC-1 (our slightly rechristened EC-1 to match our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/introducing-techcrunch-plus/">TechCrunch+ rebrand</a>) is <b>Chris Morrison</b>. Chris has been among our most productive analysts of breakthrough companies, profiling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/roblox-ec1/">Roblox</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1/">Klaviyo</a> in previous entries of this series. In addition to writing and analyzing, he’s an independent game developer and brings his expertise in business development and engineering to bear in understanding Automattic and its open source focus. The lead editor for this package was <b>Danny Crichton</b>, the assistant editor was <b>Ram Iyer</b>, the copy editor was <b>Richard Dal Porto</b> and illustrations were created by <b>Nigel Sussman</b>.</p>
<p><i>Morrison has no financial ties to Automattic or other conflicts of interest to disclose.</i></p>
<p>The Automattic TC-1 comprises four main articles numbering 10,700 words and a reading time of about 40 minutes. Let’s take a look:</p>
<ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nothing has been automatic about the success of <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>.</p>
<p>Today, to those who haven’t been paying attention, the company looks a bit like an overnight success story. WordPress, the open source software behind the company, is now estimated to power roughly 42% of all websites on the internet. Automattic’s e-commerce plugin, <a href="https://woocommerce.com/">WooCommerce</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/19/automattic-buys-woocommerce-the-popular-plugin-for-turning-wordpress-into-a-store/">which it purchased in 2015</a>, is believed to run more than a quarter of all online storefronts.</p>
<p>The company has 1,700 employees in a distributed, asynchronous, global workforce, and has raised nearly $1 billion, according to Crunchbase, <a href="https://ma.tt/2021/08/funding-buyback-hiring/">most recently at a $7.5 billion valuation</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_999732" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-999732" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-999732 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/matt-mullenweg4.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/matt-mullenweg4.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/matt-mullenweg4.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/matt-mullenweg4.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/matt-mullenweg4.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/matt-mullenweg4.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/matt-mullenweg4.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/matt-mullenweg4.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><p id="caption-attachment-999732" class="wp-caption-text">Automattic founder and CEO Matt Mullenweg at TechCrunch Disrupt 2014. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>But reaching this point has taken 16 years — or 18, if you count from the founding of WordPress. And over those many years, the company did pretty much everything wrong, if you ask the venture capitalists.</p>
<p>Automattic focused on media at a time when that industry was being demolished by the internet. It eschewed the kinds of walled gardens that turned Facebook, Apple and Google into monopolistic powerhouses and built its business on top of a volunteer-run, open source infrastructure that gave many investors serious pause.</p>
<p>Its workforce has always been fully remote and distributed — 16 years before last year’s pandemic spread that model throughout the corporate world. Automattic’s founder, Matt Mullenweg, was barely of American legal drinking age (21) when he began building, at a time when venture capitalists wanted “adult supervision” at their companies.</p>
<p>But in retrospect, doing everything wrong was exactly the right strategy — a fact that’s just now becoming apparent.</p>
<p>“With exponential growth, things look small until the end,” says Mullenweg. In his reckoning, Automattic isn’t yet close to the end, but the curve is starting to become visible.</p>
<p>It all began with a blog post.</p>
<h2>The jazz saxophonist who started a weblog revolution</h2>
<p>Massive changes often begin as ephemeral, uncertain ideas. The technology is unstable and experimental; the audience unclear; and the commercial applications murky or completely unknown.</p>
<p>Back in 2003, that was the context for the so-called weblog, which would shortly be elided to blog. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2003/02/why-did-google-want-blogger/">Blogger had just sold itself to Google</a> — for an undisclosed and presumably small price. The year before, political bloggers at Instapundit and Talking Points Memo had shaken up American politics when <a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/12/blogs-make-the-headlines/">they managed to intensify attention on a story about Trent Lott</a>, forcing his resignation as the minority leader in the U.S. Senate. Yet, traditional media remained the undisputed king of communication, and the era of professional blogs (including the one you’re reading) was still a distant dream.</p>
<p>One early adopter was Matt Mullenweg, a 19-year-old jazz enthusiast in Texas. In a blog post that’s <a href="https://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/">still online</a>, he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>My logging software hasn’t been updated for months, and the main developer has disappeared, and I can only hope that he’s okay.</p>
<p>What to do?</p></blockquote>
<p>Mullenweg himself didn’t necessarily look like the person to come up with a solution. His interests were eclectic and wide-ranging — while he imagined himself as a future jazz saxophonist, he was also studying political science at the University of Houston, and spent a good deal of his time working on his photography (to this day, Mullenweg’s Twitter handle is <a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt">@photomatt</a>). His tech hobbies, including open source software, were inspired by his father’s job as a professional programmer, but Mullenweg didn’t yet seem certain about following his father&#8217;s profession.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, his post got the attention of a few other developers and the group set out to create the open source <a href="https://wordpress.org">WordPress project</a>, focused on blog publishing. The first version of WordPress was <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2003/05/wordpress-now-available/">released</a> in May 2003 and became the official version of b2, an older project that had been abandoned.</p>
<p>Mullenweg became the center point of a growing community. An October 2004 Houston Press <a href="https://www.houstonpress.com/news/the-blog-age-6574261">profile</a> of him noted that WordPress was running more than 29,000 blogs. Mullenweg’s own blog was the third most popular in the world, and all the attention he received resulted in an offer to leave college and become a senior product manager at CNET, a San Francisco media company. WordPress, though, was still referred to as a &#8220;hobby.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The good side of spam</h2>
<p>CNET turned out to be the perfect employer. The company’s job offer allowed Mullenweg to spend 20% of his time working on WordPress and also let him retain ownership of source code he wrote while at the company. The role also gave him an inside view of the internal systems of a large media organization.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The tech industry has made a full 180-degree turn with regard to open source in the 16 years since Matt Mullenweg founded Automattic, the commercial backer of open source CMS, WordPress.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The tech industry has made a full 180-degree turn with regard to open source in the 16 years since Matt Mullenweg founded <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, a major commercial backer of open source content management system <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft, whose executives once used phrases like “un-American” and “cancer” to describe open source, is now one of the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3121792/whos-no-1-in-open-source-microsoft.html">world’s largest contributors</a>. Elastic, Confluent and GitLab have proven that startups, too, can layer commercial success on top of open source projects.</p>
<p>Even true believers can be shocked by the extent to which open source has succeeded. “To me, one of the most incredible examples of this is Chromium being used not just by Brave, but by Internet Explorer,” Mullenweg, who is also CEO of Automattic, said. “That&#8217;s the tech equivalent of peace in the Middle East — it felt so far away and unimaginable.”</p>
<p>WordPress and Automattic are key leaders in this trend. WordPress remains a vibrant project: Around a thousand active “core” contributors engineer the product, while a massive, 55,000-strong group of “extender” contributors builds themes and plugins that expand the platform’s functionality. The more than <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/cms/WordPress">28 million</a> WordPress sites represent about <a href="https://w3techs.com/blog/entry/40_percent_of_the_web_uses_wordpress">40%</a> of the web, making the project among the most deployed open source platforms.</p>
<p>Mullenweg, however, views all of this as merely a starting point. In his reckoning, WordPress could double its current scale in the coming years, a proposition that can make even the most bullish open source software engineer nervous.</p>
<p>To get there, Automattic has to shepherd and evolve its developer community even as it empowers more and more of its open source contributors to take leadership roles in the future of the WordPress ecosystem. That hasn’t always gone well, as we will see with a transition around a new version of WordPress called Gutenberg, but ultimately, the company is doubling down on community engagement, hoping that growth in the next 16 years of Automattic will be even faster than the last era.</p>
<h2>One company that doesn’t rule them all</h2>
<p>Both large and small companies contribute back code and time to the community, often following some version of Mullenweg’s <a href="https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/">Five for the Future</a> initiative, which asks organizations using WordPress to spend 5% of their resources contributing to its further development.</p>

<p>Automattic may be the largest contributor in the WordPress community, but there are many other companies who lend to the success of the ecosystem. The largest are mostly domain registrars such as GoDaddy and Bluehost, which use their lead generation from registrations to upsell customers on WordPress hosting.</p>
<p>Scores of other companies round out the ecosystem. Most are small design agencies and paid plugin developers, such as <a href="https://yoast.com/">Yoast</a>, a search engine optimization tool that has over 5 million users.</p>
<p>Then there are the thousands of individual contributors. Contrary to the perception that open source developers work exclusively for free, most open source communities include the concept of “sponsorship,” in which a commercial company like Automattic underwrites an open source developer to keep working on the project full time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020FOSSContributorSurveyReport_121020.pdf">In its annual open source contributor survey from 2020</a>, the Linux Foundation and The Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard found that more than half of core and frequent contributors to open source projects were financed for their work, either by their current employer or by a third party. That proportion is actually lower for WordPress, where only about a third of developers are believed to be sponsored.</p>
<h2>Founding privilege</h2>
<p>While thousands of individuals and companies contribute to the development of WordPress, it’s clear that Automattic plays the lead role in shaping the community, even though many paid contributors to the project are not even sponsored by the company.</p>
<p>One of the founding strengths of WordPress is that it was conceived without immediate commercial intent. The project started two years before Automattic, as we saw in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-origin/">part one</a> of this TC-1, so no company’s leadership was written into the project’s creation. Mullenweg was simply a co-founder of the project, albeit one of its most active public cheerleaders.</p>
<p>Even after Automattic launched, a few other startups seemed poised to lead the community. Hosting service <a href="https://wpengine.com">WP Engine</a>, for instance, was founded in 2010 and grew quickly, raising nearly $300 million, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wp-engine">according to Crunchbase</a>.</p>
<p>Automattic gained one sustainable advantage early on, however: It successfully secured the WordPress.com domain as a as a counterpart to the open source project’s WordPress.org. That ownership gave Automattic symbolic and long-lasting weight within the community.</p>
<p>“Because we were the first to do it, we had the name, and our service took off. The copies sat there for a while and gave up,” recalls Toni Schneider, who served as Automattic’s CEO during the company’s early years.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[WooCommerce began life as WooThemes, a small design firm that didn’t look very different from the many others that created WordPress themes.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite Automattic’s respected position, awareness of its myriad businesses tends to be spotty.</p>
<p>“I spend a lot of time with investors, press and research analysts, and I&#8217;m always stunned that people say, ‘We know WordPress.’ But they don&#8217;t know Woo,” says Mark Davies, Automattic’s chief financial officer, referring to the company’s <a href="https://woocommerce.com">WooCommerce</a> subsidiary. “It&#8217;s always interesting when we say we&#8217;re doing $30 billion of payments volume through Woo and Automattic.”</p>
<p>Why should they care? For starters, WooCommerce is used by <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/shop/">more sites than Shopify</a> — which those same investors, press and analysts definitely know about.</p>
<p>It’s also the lifeline that Automattic needs this decade to rebuild the internet in an open direction. Sixteen years after its founding, the company has seen its valuation grow rapidly from $3 billion with a round led by Salesforce in 2019 to <a href="https://ma.tt/2021/08/funding-buyback-hiring/">$7.5 billion with a share buyback a few months ago</a>. That growth has been predicated on expanding beyond its traditional remit of publishing into the hugely lucrative terrain of e-commerce, as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/12/automattics-bargain-bin-tumblr-deal-plugs-right-into-the-wordpress-business-model/">through its acquisition of Tumblr</a>.</p>
<p>The strategy here is simple: Continue opening up larger swaths of the internet to open-source innovation outside of the walled-garden platforms developed by Amazon and Facebook. If Automattic’s strategy works out, Woo, Tumblr and WordPress will link to new services that nobody yet associates with Automattic.</p>
<p>It’s an audacious vision, but the company is setting itself up for a battle against some of the most formidable — and deeply pocketed — companies in the tech world.</p>
<h2>From custom themes to billions in payments volume</h2>

<p>WooCommerce began life as WooThemes, a small design firm that didn’t look very different from the many others that created WordPress themes. In 2011, the company expanded to build themes for online stores.</p>
<p>“They&#8217;d spotted an opportunity where a lot of the themes they were selling were more commerce oriented, so they hired some guys they were incubating for a commerce platform, brought them into the team, and that quickly overtook the company for the lion&#8217;s share of attention,” says Paul Maiorana, the current CEO of WooCommerce, a subsidiary of Automattic.</p>
<p>Despite WooCommerce’s popularity (its plugin was among the top 10 most popular for WordPress), its success was mostly contained within the broader WordPress ecosystem. When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/19/automattic-buys-woocommerce-the-popular-plugin-for-turning-wordpress-into-a-store/">Automattic acquired WooCommerce in 2015</a>, the move went mostly unnoticed in the broader tech community.</p>

<p>WooCommerce still had less than 100 employees, and it didn’t appear to be a significant buy. E-commerce, while obviously growing, had yet to reach stratospheric highs.</p>
<p>Internally at Automattic, there were uncertainties over whether WooCommerce was worth the purchase, the value of which was never disclosed but was described to TechCrunch at the time as “the biggest acquisition by Automattic to date.”</p>
<p>“Even at the board level, we honestly asked if we should even be doing this. Everyone is saying this is a bad idea and you can&#8217;t compete with Amazon,” recalls Matt Mullenweg, Automattic’s founder and CEO. The counter view was that it was important for Automattic to cover all its bases. “Our ambitions are incredibly broad, and we take a very long-term view.”</p>
<p>Before long, WooCommerce was exploding in size, and the acquisition proved to be one of the most important decisions Automattic had ever made. “I&#8217;d call it a significant moment, like the birth of a child,” says Mullenweg.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s impossible to talk about <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> without talking about remote work. The company is a role model and innovator in this area: It has been entirely remote since 2005, and at 1,700 employees, it has helped prove that a remote workplace culture can succeed at scale.</p>
<p>But “remote” has taken on a different meaning than it denoted two years ago. Since COVID-19 began, companies that never planned on working remotely have moved millions of employees online. Zoom’s video meeting minutes <a href="https://backlinko.com/zoom-users">grew 30x</a> as employers made a mad dash to replicate physical offices within virtual meeting rooms. Initial studies have shown that <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/study-microsoft-employees-shows-remote-work-puts-productivity-innovation-risk/">productivity declined</a> as a result.</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s why Automattic rejects the word “remote” entirely. Instead, its leaders use words like “distributed” and “asynchronous.” There is no online analogue to an office; indeed, Automattic doesn’t even require that employees know what each other’s faces look like.</p>
<p>At its most basic level, Automattic’s model isn’t about remote work at all. Instead, it’s about how the company is structured, from its management, to its communication style, right down to its hiring process.</p>
<h2>No more meetings</h2>
<p>I got a peek into just how different Automattic is from ordinary companies while scheduling one of the interviews for this article. Usually, finding a good time with interviewees involves hunting through a packed schedule for the few morsels of time available. A busy executive might have two or three openings during a week with every other slot filled.</p>
<p>Instead, when Monica Ohara, chief marketing officer of WordPress.com, sent me her Calendly link, I saw a wide open schedule. Ohara, by all appearances, wasn’t doing much work. When I asked about it, she laughed.</p>
<p>“It’s the thing I think is really broken with normal office work,” she said. “Your meeting calendar was a badge of honor and having so many meetings meant you were so important. That&#8217;s not a paradigm here.”</p>
<p>Instead, most communication is written and asynchronous — meaning that it can be addressed anytime during the work day.</p>
<h2>A CMS for a CMS company</h2>
<p>Automattic’s replacement for meetings and most office collaboration is <a href="https://wordpress.com/p2/">P2</a>, a modification of WordPress that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/wordpress-com-launches-new-p2-to-take-on-internal-communication-tools/">it announced in August 2020 at the height of the pandemic</a> and offers as a paid service.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4jgnalGM1f"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/wordpress-com-launches-new-p2-to-take-on-internal-communication-tools/">WordPress.com launches new P2 to take on internal communication tools</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;WordPress.com launches new P2 to take on internal communication tools&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/06/wordpress-com-launches-new-p2-to-take-on-internal-communication-tools/embed/#?secret=4jgnalGM1f" data-secret="4jgnalGM1f" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>A P2 post looks more or less like a blog post, with threaded discussions, the ability to follow replies and a Like button. Whenever employees want to discuss anything with distant colleagues — for instance, a coder in the United States who wants to share something with a designer in South Africa who’s asleep at the time — they can write about it on the company’s P2 instance. Anyone else who is potentially interested can find the same post with a search or through various discovery features built into the platform.</p>

<p>Documentation is the order of the day, up to and including information that would be hidden at other companies.</p>
<p>“You need to be extremely transparent. Matt [Mullenweg, Automattic’s founder and CEO] posts what he&#8217;s working on. I post what I&#8217;m working on,” said Mark Davies, Automattic’s CFO, who previously worked at smart home platform Vivint, which operated as a much more traditional company. “When I came here for the first time, I had a board meeting, and I said, ‘Let&#8217;s get to work.’ They said, ‘No way, you need to post the board deck and what the decisions were.’ I said, ‘You&#8217;ve got to be kidding me!.&#8217;”</p>
<p>P2 isn’t the only communication method at Automattic — the company also uses software like Slack and Jira. Nonetheless, all the company’s tools share a common thread of asynchronicity: You have colleagues across the world, so don’t expect an immediate reply.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;d think that things could move slower here, but they really don&#8217;t. I think in offices, there&#8217;s also this perception that you have to be in-person. People are saving things up for their one-on-one or meeting when they could have sent an email,” said Ohara. “Here, I&#8217;ll often wake up and find out there&#8217;s lots happening in Europe that I need to catch up on versus us having to wait a week or two to get a conference room.”</p>
<p>Documenting everything and allowing employees to consume only what they need saves time. “I spend a lot more time communicating and a lot less time listening and sitting in reviews,” said Davies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Headlines from China concerning its technology market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/as-china-shakes-up-regulations-tech-companies-suffer/">haven’t been kind in recent months</a>. Not that they have been unfair.</p>
<p>The Chinese technology market has been rocked by a wave of regulatory actions <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/chinese-crackdown-on-tech-giants-threatens-its-cloud-market-growth/">in recent quarters</a> that changed the business landscape amid crackdowns by the country’s government on other areas of national activity. Tech titans were hit with fines and business model shakeups &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/">business model <i>terminations,</i> in the case of many edtech companies</a> &#8212; while certain cultural items like <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/behind-china-s-crackdown-on-k-pop-and-fan-clubs/ar-AAOhdUf">celebrity fan culture</a> and <a href="https://qz.com/2072074/china-seeks-full-news-monopoly-by-banning-private-capital-in-media/">media were also taken to task</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>You might imagine that a broad push by a central government to more control both its national economy and mind wouldn&#8217;t be conducive to overall startup fundraising and activity. And yet.</p>
<p>When The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/vcs-unfazed-by-chinese-regulatory-shakeups-so-far/">recently looked into the Chinese venture capital market</a> in the wake of some of its national government’s regulatory actions, things appeared surprisingly stable. Since then, <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q3-2021/">data from CB Insights covering the full Q3 period</a> has made an even stronger case: Putting aside a single outsized 2018 round, the third quarter of 2021 was the best three-month period for Chinese startups ever.</p>
<p>And not just in the value of the rounds they raised &#8212; they also raised more rounds.</p>

But that’s what makes data useful: No matter what you expect, what actually happened will set your thinking straight.</p>
<p>This morning, we’re digging into the data, looking at leading rounds to better understand where the money is going, and &#8212; with some help from TechBuzzChina’s Chinese technology analyst and angel investor, <a href="https://twitter.com/ruima">Rui Ma</a> &#8212; trying to get our heads around what’s going on.</p>
<p>Let’s talk China!</p>
<h2>China’s monster Q3</h2>
<p>Sure, the value of Alibaba stock fell from a 52-week high of $319.32 per share to just $166.82. Didi dropped from a recent local maxim of $18.01 to $8.24. And the value of Tencent Music collapsed from $32.25 &#8212; its last 52-week high &#8212; to just $7.72 per share (all data via Yahoo Finance).</p>
<p>But leading tech companies&#8217; plummeting stock prices have done seemingly nothing to blunt interest in Chinese technology startups.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.bluepallet.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BluePallet</a>, an online marketplace connecting manufacturers with the chemical industry, announced today that it has raised $5 million in a funding round led by Vinmar Ventures, a subsidiary of petrochemical manufacturer Vinmar International. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup also announced today that it has become the first industrial commerce platform to “officially” operate on Alibaba.com. This means that BluePallet’s network of chemical manufacturers and distributors will be exposed to millions of business buyers from around the world who source supply on the e-commerce site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing brings BluePallet’s total raised to $10 million and included participation from chemical industry veterans Terry Hill, Barentz CEO of North America; Mathew Brainerd, CEO of Brainerd Chemical Co.; and Bruce Schechinger, former chairman of the National Association of Chemical Distributors. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219907" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BluePallet was founded in 2020 through the merger of then three-year-old chemical marketplace EchoSystem and Velloci, a fintech company. BluePallet’s goal is to apply its “market network model” to modernize trade and transactions for a massive industry that has historically lagged when it comes to technology. (I should know, I covered the petrochemical industry in the late 1990s).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chemical industry is not considered a sexy one, but it supports many other sectors that we all depend on, such as the manufacturing of everyday consumer products, pharmaceuticals and agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BluePallet says its e-commerce model offers industrial buyers and sellers access to a broader marketplace while at the same time “strictly adhering” to the requirements of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regulatory compliance and responsible distribution</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It claims that it&#8217;s able to give buyers and sellers more control over their supply chain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The BluePallet site offers three products: TradeHub &#8212; a permission-based marketplace where users can find and list products with networking tools; TradePass &#8212; a “proprietary” business verification technology that aims to ensure “network integrity” by reviewing thousands of operational, commercial and financial risk data points on “a continual basis”; and TradeCart &#8212; a proprietary checkout system that integrates payment processing, authentication and logistics. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conjunction with the financing, BluePallet is also announcing that it is relocating its headquarters from Chicago to Austin, Texas. The reasoning behind this is closer proximity to Houston, which is home to a robust chemical industry, and to be able to take advantage of Austin’s “vibrant tech and entrepreneurial scene.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BluePallet CEO Scott Barrows, who had founded EchoSystems, said the raise represents validation for its offering. (Barrows previously co-founded ticketing platforms Epic Seats and ZeroHero, which is today used by LiveNationand TicketMaster).

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As we continue to grow, we are setting our eyes to the East and aim to quickly establish a regional presence in Asia,” he added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asia Pacific is the largest region in the global chemicals market, accounting for 49% of the $3.34 trillion industry in 2020. North America is the second-largest region and accounts for 17% of the market. Because BluePallet is partnered with the NACD with access to its 750,000 member companies, Barrows believes the startup has significant room to grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We&#8217;re really challenging and pushing the realms of what can be done in these B2B transactions,” he told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the company works to build its marketing network platform, it has attempted to partner with existing fintech companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We found that even the biggest ones had a max of $100,000 per transaction, or that they would not want to do business with the chemical industry, which is crazy,” Barrows told TechCrunch. “So we decided we’re going to go solve this problem for the $5 trillion chemical industry, and build this technology ourselves.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In what Barrows believes is a strong differentiator, he says that BluePallet is able to handle transactions of up to $1 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now that we can move money in this way, we’re building into more and more international markets,” he said. “We think this is the key, and that’s missing in a lot of these new offerings by a lot of startups.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also emphasizes that BluePallet is more than a “matchmaker.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most other sites are literally just matchmakers and that’s it,” he said. “They have no ability to actually complete a transaction and instead make the parties go complete the transaction offline. So this is really going to change and improve the way that people in the industry are doing commerce.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram today announced a number of new features that will roll out this week across both the Instagram Feed and its TikTok competitor, Reels. The creator-focused additions will allow users to collaborate with one another, raise funds and make better use of music on Reels, among other things. The company will also make its Instagram desktop website more usable, by allowing people to finally be able to post both photos and videos less than one minute in length using their desktop web browser.</p>
<p>The latter has been a long-requested new feature, the company notes, and will become available to global audiences as of Thursday, October 21.</p>
<p>The company had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/instagram-post-from-desktop/">previously tested the feature</a> this summer, but it was not widely available.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220189" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2220230" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220230" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2220230" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="417" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png 3504w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png?resize=300,184 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png?resize=768,471 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png?resize=680,417 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png?resize=1536,942 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png?resize=2048,1255 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Desktop-Feed-Creation.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220230" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>The other new features will drop throughout the week, starting today with &#8220;Collabs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instagram describes this feature as a &#8220;test,&#8221; explaining that it will allow people to co-author both Feed posts and Reels. To do so, users can invite another account to be a collaborator from the tagging screen on Instagram. If the other person accepts, both accounts will appear in the post or the Reels header and content will be shared to both sets of followers. Although Instagram is only announcing the test today, many Instagram users have already spotted the feature in the app, as the company <a href="https://twitter.com/vishalshahis/status/1417884832323964930">began a small-scale global test</a> of this feature back in July.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">(1/3) Collaborating is a huge part of how people connect on Instagram. To make that easier, we’re testing a new way for people to co-author Feed Posts and Reels, called Collab. <a href="https://t.co/YD1SaSYHOl">pic.twitter.com/YD1SaSYHOl</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Vishal Shah (@vishalshahis) <a href="https://twitter.com/vishalshahis/status/1417884832323964930?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 21, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>At the time, Instagram said only a small number of people would have access to the feature, and it didn&#8217;t indicate when it would roll out more broadly.</p>
<p>When two creators choose to collab, the post or Reel will appear on both their Profile Grids and it will have a shared view count, like count and comment thread, Instagram says.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Instagram will also begin to test a new way to create fundraisers for nonprofits, with the introduction of a feature that lets you start the fundraiser directly from the creation button (the &#8220;+&#8221; plus button at the top right of the screen.). When you tap this option, instead of selecting Post, Story, Reels or Live, you&#8217;ll see an option to select a nonprofit and add the fundraiser to your Feed post.</p>
<p>Instagram has supported fundraisers for some time, even adding support for nonprofit fundraising during livestreams last year. But it hadn&#8217;t before offered a way to create a fundraiser from a standalone spot right from your Instagram profile.</p>
<p>This feature had been spotted ahead of this week&#8217;s launch by developer and reverse engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1439196528367779845">Alessandro Paluzzi</a>, who found the new fundraiser button in development back in September.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Instagram?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Instagram</a> is working on adding the &quot;Fundraiser&quot; option to the Create menu <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/Od4dcdkHaO">pic.twitter.com/Od4dcdkHaO</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Alessandro Paluzzi (@alex193a) <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1439196528367779845?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Two other new additions are meant to enhance Instagram Reels, when used with music.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Instagram will introduce two new effects called Superbeat and Dynamic Lyrics, which will help creators who edit and perform using music on Reels. Superbeat will intelligently apply special effects to music to the beat of the user&#8217;s song while Dynamic Lyrics will display 3D lyrics that will flow with the song&#8217;s &#8220;groove,&#8221; says Instagram.</p>
<p>These new features follow TikTok&#8217;s rollout of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/as-competition-heats-up-tiktok-announces-six-new-interactive-music-effects-for-creators/">half dozen interactive music effects</a> back in April, including several that add visual effects synced to the beat of a song. Reels, meanwhile, has offered a much more limited selection of first-party creative effects until now, instead relying on its community to expand its library beyond the basics like a timer or speed adjustment tool, for instance.</p>
<p>The Reels features will arrive alongside posting from the desktop, which Instagram says will be limited to photos and videos less than one minute in length. The company this month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/instagram-ditches-the-igtv-brand-combines-everything-but-reels-into-an-instagram-video-format/">dropped its IGTV brand</a> for long-form video, but still allows for videos up to 60 minutes. That&#8217;s now just considered &#8220;Instagram Video&#8221; &#8212; a term that includes anything that&#8217;s not video in a Story or in Reels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Human Landing System saga is far from over.</p>
<p>Senators on Monday released <a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/CJSRept_Final.PDF">a draft version of the appropriation bill</a> that governs NASA’s budget for fiscal year 2022, directing the agency to select two teams for the Human Landing System (HLS) program – but only giving the agency an additional $100 million to do so.</p>
<p>The total funding for the program would stand at $1.295 billion, with NASA receiving an overall budget of $24.83 billion for the next fiscal year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220252" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Using this funding, NASA is expected to ensure redundancy and competition, including robust support for research, development, testing, and evaluation for no fewer than two HLS Teams,” the draft bill says. “The [Senate appropriations] Committee expects real investments in development rather than additional studies.”</p>
<p>The directive is clear. What’s not clear is how NASA expects the agency to fund two HLS teams without a commensurate increase in funding.</p>
<p>First, a little refresher: the HLS is a critical part of NASA’s Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon for the first time since the Apollo space program days. Back in April, NASA selected Elon Musk’s SpaceX – <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-to-develop-human-landing-system-for-returning-to-the-moon/">and only SpaceX</a> – to develop the landing vehicle for astronauts under Artemis. The company beat out defense contractor Dynetics and Blue Origin, which developed a “national team” that included aerospace primes Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper, for the award.</p>
<p>In the past, NASA had generally operated by choosing at least two vendors to encourage competition, and as a hedge in case one company’s project doesn’t pan out. That was how it operated with the Commercial Crew program for the International Space Station, when NASA awarded both SpaceX and Boeing contracts to build astronaut transport spacecraft. So, it’s fair to say that the agency did veer from historical precedent in selecting only SpaceX.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since April, Blue Origin has mounted a campaign protesting NASA’s decision, first by disputing the contract award to government watchdog the Government Accountability Office and then – when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/feds-dismantle-blue-origin-and-dynetics-protests-of-nasas-spacex-lunar-lander-award/">GAO rejected the company’s protest</a> – via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-goes-toe-to-toe-with-nasa-in-federal-court-over-award-to-spacex/">a complaint filed in a federal claims court</a>.</p>
<p>NASA maintains that it selected SpaceX because the company offered the most robust lander proposal at the lowest price, given budgetary constraints: only $2.9 billion, compared to the price tags of Blue Origin’s proposal ($5.9 billion) and Dynetics ($9 billion). Given the significantly difference in cost between the three proposals, it’s unclear how the Senate’s increase to the HLS program – which is only $100 million – will enable NASA to select an additional team.</p>
<p>NASA administrator Bill Nelson seems confident that the agency will eventually get the funding it needs. “I think at the end of the day, after all the shouting is over, after all the pushing and tugging, a lot of which has nothing to do with NASA, you will see that NASA will have the funds that it needs,” <a href="https://spacenews.com/nelson-remains-confident-on-nasa-funding-for-artemis/">he said in an interview with SpaceNews</a>,</p>
<p>According to the bill, “having at least two teams providing services […] should be the end goal of the current development program.” If this version of the bill makes it into the final budget – which is unclear, as it would still need to be negotiated with the House – NASA would have 30 days to explain to Congress and the public how it plans to comply with the new directive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is <a href="https://scontent-cdg2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/245645778_229514682497390_5814575696636412345_n.pdf?_nc_cat=102&amp;ccb=1-5&amp;_nc_sid=ad8a9d&amp;_nc_ohc=vMfQUa02-cIAX_UoJ5X&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-cdg2-1.xx&amp;oh=d6a5616da9c2d543f4e3bdab2dacc95d&amp;oe=61744796">launching</a> a small pilot of its cryptocurrency wallet named <a href="https://www.novi.com">Novi</a>. A limited number of people in the U.S. and Guatemala can sign up to Novi and start using it.</p>
<p>Facebook is a founding member of the Diem Association. Instead of taking advantage of the association&#8217;s stablecoin (Diem) on the association&#8217;s blockchain (the Diem network), the company is partnering with Paxos and Coinbase to let users send and receive USDP, with Coinbase managing crypto custody. But this is just an intermediate step as Facebook still plans to replace USDP with Diem at some point.</p>
<p>Facebook originally had big plans for its crypto project. The company created a consortium of companies called the Libra Association. Together, they were supposed to launch the Libra cryptocurrency, a brand new currency tied to a basket of fiat currencies and securities. Originally, it wouldn’t be based on a single real world currency, but on a mix of multiple currencies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220245" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But Facebook faced strong opposition from many central banks — they feared that Libra would become a quasi-sovereign currency in some countries. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/facebook-backed-association-revamps-libra-following-regulatory-concerns/">Last year</a>, the association announced that it would reduce its ambitions by focusing on single-currency stablecoins.</p>
<p>A stablecoin is a crypto asset with a fixed value that doesn’t fluctuate over time. For instance, the Libra Association wanted to launch the LibraUSD. One LibraUSD would always be worth one USD.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/libra-association-rebrands-as-diem/">A few months later</a>, the Libra Association announced some changes once again. The project was rebranded to the <a href="https://www.diem.com">Diem association</a>. Similarly, Facebook’s wallet project was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/26/facebook-rebrands-libra-wallet-service-calibra-to-novi/">rebranded from Calibra to Novi</a>. But neither Diem nor Novi were ready for prime time.</p>
<p>And now, Facebook is going to start testing Novi with some real users. The company is focusing on remittance between the U.S. and Guatemala. Novi users who want to send money can download the Novi app, create an account and add money using a payment method, such as a debit card.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Whenever you add USD, your money is converted to USDP without any fees. USDP is a stablecoin tied to USD created by <a href="https://paxos.com">Paxos</a>. It used to be called the Pax Dollar (PAX), but Paxos <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/paxos-renames-its-stablecoin-from-pax-to-usdp/">recently rebranded it</a> to USDP.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, USDP is backed by cash and cash equivalents to ensure its value. User funds are <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-to-power-crypto-custody-for-facebooks-novi-90dc8d3f5830">managed</a> by Coinbase Custody, meaning that Coinbase stores USDP funds for Novi users.</p>
<p>Novi users can then send USDP to other Novi users. Once again, there are no fees involved with money transfers. But chances are you can’t use Novi to pay in store or pay your rent. That’s why users can withdraw their Novi balance at a cash location, or transfer their balance to a bank account.</p>
<p>But Novi doesn’t say if there are fees involved when you convert your USDP to Guatemalan quetzal. So we’re back to square one as Novi has to pick an exchange rate, which involves spread, liquidity and other variables. Novi also has to create fiat-to-crypto on-ramps and off-ramps across all markets where it wants to operate.</p>
<p>Facebook says that this is just the beginning for Novi. First, it is only available as a pilot for some users in Guatemala and the U.S. (except Alaska, Nevada, New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands). Second, Facebook and the Diem Association haven’t shelved plans to launch their own cryptocurrency at some point.</p>
<p>“I do want to be clear that our support for Diem hasn’t changed and we intend to launch Novi with Diem once it receives regulatory approval and goes live. We care about interoperability and we want to do it right,” Novi project lead David Marcus said on Twitter.</p>
<p>Facebook unveiled the Libra cryptocurrency <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/18/facebook-libra/">in June 2019</a>. The crypto ecosystem has changed drastically since then. In particular, some stablecoins have become incredibly popular — Tether and USD Coin have a combined circulating supply of more than $100 billion right now. So it’s going to be interesting to see if Diem can catch up with existing stablecoins and unlock some new use cases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-music-brings-spatial-audio-more-customers-ever">announced</a> that starting today, Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers can stream spatial audio with their current headphones on its Android and iOS apps. The company currently supports two forms of spatial audio: Sony’s Reality Audio and Dolby Atmos.</p>
<p>Amazon first introduced spatial audio in 2019, but it was limited to a small number of devices. With this latest expansion, spatial audio will work with any pair of headphones that a user owns.</p>
<p>“We’ve always believed that the highest-quality audio possible should be the norm for streaming music, and that’s why today, we’re making spatial audio available to our customers without any special equipment needed, and no upgrade required,” said Steve Boom, the vice president of Amazon Music in a statement.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220206" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Users can now also stream spatial audio with Alexa Cast on select devices, including the Echo Studio. Additional devices that support 360 Reality Audio with Alexa Cast include Sony’s SRS-RA5000 or SRS-RA3000 wireless speakers, and home theater systems such as HT-A9, HT-A7000, or HT-A5000.</p>
<p>Further, Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers with an Individual, Family, or Student Plan will now automatically have access to HD and Ultra HD music at no extra cost.</p>
<p>Amazon Music Unlimited Individual Plans cost $7.99/month for Prime members and $9.99/month for Amazon customers. Family Plan customers can stream Amazon Music Unlimited on up to six devices for $14.99/month.</p>
<p>Amazon Music isn&#8217;t the only music streaming service to leverage spatial audio, as Apple Music launched spatial audio for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/apple-music-launches-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio-adds-spatial-audio-playlists/">iOS</a> in June and for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/apple-music-brings-its-spatial-audio-and-lossless-streaming-to-android/">Android</a> in July. In order to compete with Apple Music and Amazon Music, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-a-new-high-end-subscription-spotify-hifi/">Spotify</a> said earlier this year that it would roll out a high-end subscription service called &#8216;Spotify HiFi,&#8217; which would enable lossless audio.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that music streaming services aren&#8217;t the only platforms that are looking to leverage spatial audio, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/clubhouse-adds-clips-replays-for-asynchronous-listening-better-search-and-spatial-audio-for-android/">Clubhouse</a> recently introduced spatial audio for Android last month. Additionally, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/spatial-audio-is-coming-to-netflix-on-iphone-and-ipad/">Netflix</a> recently announced that spatial audio is coming to its iPhone and iPad apps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.electric.ai/">Electric</a>, makers of IT infrastructure software for SMBs, has been on a tear lately.</p>
<p>The company announced the close of a $90 million Series D financing round today. GGV, an existing investor, led the round, with participation from other existing investors Bessemer, Primary Venture Partners, Greenspring Associates, 01 Advisors, Atreides Management, Vintage Investment Partners and Slack.</p>
<p>What Electric does for IT infrastructure is similar to what <a href="https://justworks.com/">Justworks</a> does for HR. Instead of an SMB hiring out a person or a department to handle the basics of IT, 90 percent of which is maintenance and compliance, Electric software handles distribution, maintenance and security for an organization.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220159" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Before Electric, there were two options for SMBs: build out your own IT department, or use a local IT provider. Electric came on the scene and allowed an admin within the company to make sure all devices were up to date, secure and compliant, as well as issue new equipment and revoke permissions.</p>
<p>In the COVID era, where remote work has become the default, the need for something like Electric has only grown, which is showing in the startup&#8217;s metrics.</p>
<p>In 2020, the company saw more than 100 percent revenue growth. Interestingly, Electric set very aggressive growth targets for 2020 and beat all of them, despite the fact that they went two months at the beginning of lockdown without selling a single thing. (Many startups saw an accelerating digital transformation create a warm market for their products.)</p>
<p>This led to the company&#8217;s Series C funding, closed in February, with Electric counting just shy of $20 million worth of ARR and 400 customers at the time. The growth continued through this year, with the startup&#8217;s customer count rising to 700, along with 40,000 total end users and 111 percent ARR growth on the year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ojSTdM8Q8v"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/electric-raises-40m-series-c-to-put-small-business-it-in-the-cloud/">Electric raises $40M Series C to put small-business IT in the cloud</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Electric raises $40M Series C to put small-business IT in the cloud&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/electric-raises-40m-series-c-to-put-small-business-it-in-the-cloud/embed/#?secret=ojSTdM8Q8v" data-secret="ojSTdM8Q8v" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Investors came a knockin&#8217; to raise yet again, and Denehy thought about the long-term trajectory of the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started to realize that we could double the business again next year, we can double it probably the year after that, and all of a sudden we could have a company that could be ready to go public in two to three years,&#8221; said Denehy. &#8220;That&#8217;s a really compelling opportunity but it&#8217;s going to take more capital to really prepare ourselves and the team and the product to be on a true pre-IPO trajectory.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right now, the company is tracking at just under $40 million ARR for 2021.</p>
<p>As with most scaling SaaS businesses, focus is the greatest challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have the same competitive pressures as most B2B SaaS companies and we&#8217;ve got an operationally complex business,&#8221; said Denehy. &#8220;So on any given day, there are so many economically compelling opportunities and so many things that we could do to flip a. switch and get a new line of business generating millions of dollars in revenue. But at the same time, we have to respect that the reason we don&#8217;t have any venture-backed direct competitors is because this is a super hard problem to solve. So if we start to get distracted by running in too many different directions, we&#8217;re going to dilute the quality of everything else that we do and potentially get taking off track.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-its-unleashed-event-this-morning/">slew of interesting announcements at its event on Monday</a>. But one that stood out to me &#8212; and I feel didn’t get as much attention &#8212; is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/apple-debuts-a-4-99-per-month-apple-music-voice-plan-designed-mainly-for-homepod-use/">new pricing tier of Apple Music</a>. A new &#8216;Voice&#8217; tier will offer the entire Apple Music library to subscribers at a reduced rate of just $5 per month: The catch is you have to use Siri to access it, eschewing the standard Apple Music visual and typing-friendly in-app user interface.</p>
<p>Apple didn’t share why it is launching this plan, but I think it’s reasonable to speculate that the iPhone-maker is lowering the price barrier and persuading more people to use Siri because it wants to gather more voice data to train and improve its voice assistant.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re excited that even more people will be able to enjoy Apple Music simply with their voice,&#8221; Apple chief executive Tim Cook said at the event.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220184" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I can’t imagine any other compelling reason why the Apple Music Voice plan exists, especially since Apple is likely offering the new service with much lower margins than the standard plan as the licensing agreements with labels remain the same to offer up the entire Apple Music catalog.</p>
<p>Again, this is just speculation, but I think given the stiff competition between Apple and Spotify, if the Swedish firm could offer its streaming service at $7-8 a month to beat Apple Music at price, it would. And Apple is taking some loss with the new subscription tier because it really wants to gather vast amounts of data. When I <a href="https://twitter.com/refsrc/status/1450418281127428098">tweeted</a> this theory, my colleague Alex <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1450420803527450630">wondered aloud</a> why wouldn&#8217;t Apple just make the subscription free? I suppose Apple, a $2.5 trillion dollar company, can technically swallow that much of a hit on the balance sheet, but it doesn&#8217;t want to attract more criticism from standalone music streaming firms such as Spotify. It&#8217;s already facing scrutiny for anti-competitive behavior on a number of fronts.</p>
<p>Tech firms feed their AI models with vast amounts of data to improve the services’ capabilities. Even as Siri has considerably improved over the years, the general consensus among many people who work in tech and the masses alike is that Amazon’s Alexa and Google Assistant are far superior.</p>
<p>It’s likely that Apple has already been gleaning such voice data from existing Apple Music users, but as a friend suggested, “the point is this &#8211; this feature always existed. It&#8217;s just that they&#8217;d put a high paywall. They&#8217;ve lowered that wall now.” In addition to lowering the barrier to entry, making Music voice-only via the new plan means people have to engage with Siri to make use of it; Siri is a feature for standard Apple Music subscribers, but it&#8217;s highly likely that most users primarily or exclusively access the content via the app&#8217;s UI.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you want an example of what can happen for voice-powered assistants when you require that users treat it as a voice-first or voice-only service, look at Amazon&#8217;s Alexa. Out of the gate, Alexa had to be accessed by voice. This allowed Amazon to not only collect massive amounts of training data for its Alexa algorithms, but also helped train users about how to use it to maximum effect.</p>
<h3>Understanding accents and dialects</h3>
<p>Another reason why I think my theory works is the markets where Apple plans to offer this new subscription tier first: Australia, Austria, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</p>
<p>Having India, Spain, Ireland and France in the first wave of nations suggests that Apple is looking to amass a wide-range of dialects and accents from across the globe. On a side note, voice search is<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-end-of-typing-the-internets-next-billion-users-will-use-video-and-voice-1502116070"> very popular in many markets</a>, including developing nations such as India, and in markets like China and Japan where text input can sometimes be unnecessarily complex vs. spoken word. (A Google executive told me once that the surprising mass adoption of voice searches in India, the world&#8217;s second largest smartphone market and where Android commands about 98% of the pie, helped the company improve Google Assistant and prompted more aggressive approach to innovate on the voice front.)</p>
<p>Siri is often framed as a bit of a laggard in terms of its competence vs. the rest of the voice assistant competition, and Apple&#8217;s latest move in services could be an attempt to help it close the perceived gap, while offering customers a discounted way to onboard to its music streaming service.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">How can you anticipate the content people want before they want it? How do you figure out where your audience lives online and what they like? What <i>is </i>a creator, after all?</p>
<p>At TechCrunch Disrupt 2021, we were joined by Julia Munslow, special projects editor at Yahoo News, Alexis Gay, comedian and host of Non-Technical Podcast, and Sushma Dwivedi, who leads communications and brand marketing at Daily Harvest. All three of our speakers come at the challenge of building a brand online from different angles, and they all had valuable perspectives to share for navigating a social media landscape that has very high expectations from anyone creating content in 2021.</p>
<p>Whether you’re an independent creator or a company, you need to think about how to connect with the audience that’s right for <i>you</i> before dipping your toes into brand building. With more platforms than ever, and more savvy content perpetually upping the social game, it’s worth remembering that building your audience doesn’t just mean accumulating a sky high follower count.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t really help anybody to try and be everything to everyone at any size of brand, no matter how big or small,&#8221; Dwivedi said. &#8220;… When you&#8217;re really looking to galvanize a base, and build some momentum amongst a dedicated base of customers, it serves you to really think about who they are. What do they need? Where are they and how on those platforms are they being communicated to?&#8221;</p>
<p>Before you can study an audience you want to reach, you have to figure out where they live online. And as new social platforms and products emerge, that process can require quite a bit of trial and error. For Daily Harvest, TikTok was a successful experiment that continues to pay off, but not all experiments will work out — and according to Dwivedi, that’s just fine. Daily Harvest dipped a toe into Clubhouse when the social audio app took off, but because of the visual nature of its brand and audience, it wasn’t a perfect fit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.instacart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instacart</a> made its name by providing a way for consumers to bypass shopping in stores in person, by ordering items online and getting them delivered to their homes &#8212; a business that positively boomed in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. But with physical stores still looming large in the world of groceries, Instacart is also wants to play a role there, too. Today, the company announced that it is acquiring <a href="http://caper.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caper AI</a>, a startup that builds smart cart and cashier-less checkout technology that uses computer vision and other techniques to detect items and ring them up for shoppers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Instacart confirmed that it is paying around $350 million for the startup, in a combination of cash and shares.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The acquisition is part of Instacart&#8217;s expanding &#8220;B2B2C&#8221; retail technology strategy. Alongside its mainstay online ordering and grocery delivery service, the company &#8212; as of March this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/instacart-raises-265m-at-a-39b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at $39 billion</a> &#8212; is building out a stack of products and services for stores that they in turn can use to provide new services to their customers. It follows just weeks after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/instacart-is-acquiring-catering-software-company-foodstorm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instacart acquired FoodStorm</a> to help stores take and manage catering-style larger orders of ready-made food.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220072" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Instacart&#8217;s CEO Fidji Simo (who joined </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/instacart-hires-facebook-executive-as-new-ceo-ahead-of-expected-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier this year from Facebook</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">), said in an interview with TechCrunch this week that this acquisition is in keeping with what retailers themselves want and need to do. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Against the backdrop of huge competition from the likes of Amazon &#8212; which has its own cashier-free check out technology and is getting much more aggressive with its physical store strategy &#8212; retailers are chasing a customer base that increasingly expects and will use more modern, digital services than earlier generations of shoppers.</span></p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We are&#8230; unlocking for retail partners [what] we think is what’s next. We are meeting the evolving needs of customers online or offline. Retailers want to develop unified offerings that break down silos,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We see ourselves as a retail enablement company&#8230; We already have a vast platform to power commerce services [covering] both delivery and pick up that already blends the lines.&#8221;</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Simo said that the plan will be to continue Caper&#8217;s business as it is today &#8212; the company already has smart cart technology development deals with <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Kroger and Wakefern in the U.S., Sobeys in Canada and Auchan in France and Spain; and it provides smart checkout counters (where items are placed in a weight-sensitive box that scans and automatically rings up the items for the shopper) across a range of smaller convenience stores. Now Instacart will shop Caper&#8217;s tech to its wider network of existing grocery partners, too.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I’m incredibly proud of the business we’ve built and the technological leap forward our products represent for the entire grocery industry. The powerful technology we’ve created is intuitive for customers, easy to deploy for retailers of all sizes, and creates a physical retail ecosystem that never existed before,” said Lindon Gao, cofounder and CEO of <span class="il">Caper</span> AI, in a statement. “We share <span class="il">Instacart</span>&#8216;s vision of enabling grocery retailers with new innovations that create step changes for their businesses, and we’re proud to now be joining forces with <span class="il">Instacart</span> to develop even more solutions that help bring the online and offline together for retailers.”</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But it will also supercharge Caper&#8217;s expansion and how it is used. For example, there are plans to integrate Caper&#8217;s tech into Instacart&#8217;s app: people who start their in-person shopping lists on the Instacart app can then use the Caper technology to automatically ring up the items once they are in stores.</span></p>
<p>While this deal will be bringing a hardware business, as well as more hardware expertise, to Instacart, the company looks like it will be taking a more conservative approach to that area, at least in the short/medium term.</p>
<p>&#8220;For now we want to focus on these [existing] products,&#8221; Simo said of Caper Cart and Caper Counter, as its two products are called. &#8220;It&#8217;s important to get the tech absolutely perfect and adopted globally. There is a lot of work to do to get to scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Caper, this is a great landing. The company had raised just $13 million from investors that included Lux Capital, First Round, FundersClub and Y Combinator. Simo said that Instacart proactively approached Caper to do a deal while it was in the middle of fundraising, and it was intent on acquiring rather than just investing to bring the IP, talent and existing business into the Instacart fold.</p>
<p>But, it has to be said that as an independent startup, Caper would have been facing a very impressive and large slate of competition.</p>
<p>Amazon has built its &#8220;Just Walk Out&#8221; technology (as its cashier-free tech is called) mainly to run in Amazon&#8217;s own brick-and-mortar stores, but with Amazon you should never count out how it might eventually productize its own technology and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/09/amazon-is-now-selling-its-cashierless-store-technology-to-other-retailers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sell it to others as a service</a> (as it has done with AWS, its fulfillment tech, and so on). Trigo out of Israel has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/trigo-bags-10m-for-its-computer-vision-based-checkout-tech-to-rival-amazons-just-walk-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised over $100 million</a> and just today debuted its latest customer, the supermarket giant Tesco, which is <a href="https://www.tescoplc.com/news/2021/tesco-opens-new-checkout-free-store-getgo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using its tech in its new GetGo stores</a>. Standard Cognition, now <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/amazon-go-rival-bets-pandemic-bolstered-case-for-cashierless-shopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at over $1 billion</a>, wants to be in 100 stores by the end of this year and most recently brought on Circle K as a customer. Shopic and Imagr are also working on continuing to hone their technology, and there are a number of others.</p>
<p>In that regard, this acquisition will give Instacart a way of competing against all of the above, and also getting its oar in to be the provider of that tech to retailers. A lot of the technology for cashier-free is still relatively nascent, and therefore some conceptions of how it should look and work are very expensive &#8212; perhaps cost-prohibitively so. Caper AI&#8217;s approach, Simo points out, is plug and play and relatively easy (and therefore cheaper) to implement than systems that involve retrofitting entire stores with overhead cameras, large computing systems to process the information, bringing in new physical carts and so on.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were attracted to the smart cart solution the form factor that retailers will already understand,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And that doesn’t require a big investment.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other side of the equation, of course, is the labor situation: solutions like these inevitably will raise questions of what the impact will be on people who traditionally would have worked as cashiers. And for Instacart, it&#8217;s notable that it is buying into technology that removes people from the checkout equation precisely at the same time that it is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/instacart-shopper-activist-group-asks-customers-to-delete-the-app-until-demands-for-better-conditions-are-met/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facing backlash of its own</a> over its labor practices. These issues are unlikely to be resolved with or without this specific acquisition, but there are questions and choices that Instacart, grocers, and consumers need to consider longer term.</p>
