					<description><![CDATA[What OpenAI — and crucially, the beta testers with access to GPT-3 and other models — are able to accomplish continues to surprise and in many cases, unexpectedly delight us.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The introduction of GPT-3 in 2020 was a tipping point for artificial intelligence. In 2021, this technology will power the launch of a thousand new startups and applications. GPT-3 and similar models have brought the power of AI into the hands of those looking to experiment &#8212; and the results have been extraordinary.</p>
<p>Trained on trillions of words, GPT-3 is a 175-billion parameter transformer model — the third of such models released by OpenAI. GPT-3 is remarkable in its ability to generate human-like text and responses &#8212; in some respects, it’s eerie. When prompted by a user with text, GPT-3 can return coherent and topical <a href="https://twitter.com/OthersideAI">emails</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sushant_kumar/status/1283314235842297856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1283314235842297856%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevminator.com%2Fforums%2Ftopic%2Ftweet-generator-gpt-3-openai-api-example%2F">tweets</a>, <a href="https://lacker.io/ai/2020/07/06/giving-gpt-3-a-turing-test.html">trivia</a> and much more.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			In 2021, this technology will power the launch of a thousand new startups and applications.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Suddenly, authoring emails, customer interactions, social media exchanges and even news stories can be automated &#8212; at least in part. While large companies are pondering the pitfalls and risks of generating text (remember Microsoft’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/25/microsoft-apologizes-for-hijacked-chatbot-tays-wildly-inappropriate-tweets/">disastrous</a> Tay bot?), startups have already begun sweeping in with novel applications &#8212; and they will continue to lead the charge in transformer-based innovation.</p>
<p>OpenAI researchers first released the paper introducing GPT-3 in May 2020, and what started out as some nifty use cases on Twitter has quickly become a hotbed of startup activity. Companies have been formed on top of GPT-3, using the model to generate emails and marketing copy, to create an interactive nutrition tracker or chatbot, and more. Let OthersideAI take a first pass at writing your emails, or try out Broca or Snazzy for your ad copy and campaign content, for instance.</p>
<p>Other young companies are harnessing the API to accelerate their existing efforts, augmenting their technical teams’ capabilities with the power of 175 billion parameters and quickly bringing otherwise difficult products to market with much greater speed and data than previously possible. With some clever prompt engineering (a combination of an instruction to the model with a sample output to help guide the model), these companies leverage the underlying GPT-3 system to improve or extend an existing application’s capabilities.</p>
<p>Sure, a text expander can be a useful tool for shorthand notation &#8212; but powered by GPT-3, that shorthand can be transformed into a product that generates contextually aware emails in your own style of writing.</p>
<p>As early-stage technology investors, we are inspired to see AI broadly, and natural language processing specifically, become more accessible via the next generation of large-scale transformer models like GPT-3. We expect they will unlock new use cases and capabilities we have yet to even contemplate.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.techstars.com/accelerators/music">Techstars Music</a> is announcing 11 new companies that have joined its ranks, along with a partnership with Atlanta media house Quality Control.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s easy to mentally bunch everything Techstars does together under the singular &#8220;Techstars&#8221; name, it&#8217;s actually made up of 40+ interconnected accelerator programs each with its own focus and portfolio. The majority of these are focused on a specific region — programs like Techstars Boulder, Boston, or LA. Others focus on a specific vertical or industry — like Sports, Space, or, in this case, Music.</p>
<p>So what all does that &#8220;Music&#8221; focus cover? It&#8217;s not just music creation tools, or apps for artists. As Techstars Music Managing Director Bob Moczydlowsky put it in a Q&amp;A <a href="https://www.techstars.com/the-line/5-questions/bob-moczydlowsky">last year</a>, &#8220;we don’t invest in music companies — we invest in companies solving problems for music. &#8220;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Their past portfolio includes <a href="https://endel.io">Endel</a>, which generates &#8220;personalized soundscapes&#8221; meant to help you focus or fall asleep faster, and <a href="https://blinkidentity.com">Blink Identity</a>, a company looking to replace the paper/digital concert ticket with facial recognition machines.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.westcottmultimedia.com">Westcott Multimedia</a>: An automated advertising platform that looks for events related a music catalog (like, say, an artist&#8217;s birthday, or a song being played in the background of a viral video) and builds marketing campaigns around them.</p>
<p>Along with this latest class, Techstars Music is also announcing that it&#8217;s partnering with Quality Control, the media house behind Quality Control Music — best known as the label behind Migos, Lil Yachty, and Lil Baby. Quality Control joins Techstars Music as a &#8220;member&#8221; company (sort of like their equivalent to an LP, offering investment, helping with sourcing and vetting companies and mentoring them once they&#8217;re in); existing members include Amazon Music, AVEX, Bill Silva Entertainment, Concord, Peloton, Entertainment One, Right Hand Music Group, Royalty Exchange, Sony, and Warner Music Group.</p>
<p>Moczydlowsky tells me that Techstars Music alumni companies have raised over $105m since the first class in 2017, and that the group above has already raised over $3M ahead of its Demo Day in May.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Epic Games is quickly becoming a more dominant force in gaming infrastructure M&amp;A after a string of recent purchases made to bulk up their Unreal Engine developer suite. Today, the company announced that they&#8217;ve brought on the team from photogrammetry studio <em>Capturing Reality</em> to help the company improve how it handles 3D scans of environments and objects.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed.</p>
<p>Photogrammetry involves stitching together multiple photos or laser scans to create 3D models of objects that can subsequently be exported as singular files. As the computer vision techniques have evolved to minimize manual fine-tuning and adjustments<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, designers have been beginning to lean more heavily on photogrammetry to import real world environments into their games. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Using photogrammetry can help studio developers create photorealistic assets in a fraction of the time it would take to create a similar 3D asset from scratch. It can be used to quickly create 3D assets of everything from an item of clothing, to a car, to a mountain. Anything that exists in 3D space can be captured and as game consoles and GPUs grow more capable in terms of output, the level of detail that can be rendered increases as does the need to utilize more detailed 3D assets.</p>
<p>The Bratislava-based studio will continue operating independently even as its capabilities are integrated into Unreal. Epic announced some reductions to the pricing rates for Capturing Reality&#8217;s services, dropping the price of a perpetual license fee from €15,000 to $3,750 USD. In FAQs on the studio&#8217;s site, the company notes that they will continue to support non-gaming use clients moving forward.</p>
<p>In 2019, Epic Games acquired Quixel which hosted a library of photogrammetry &#8220;mega scans&#8221; that developers could access.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://detail.co">Detail</a>, a new startup working on an app for iOS and macOS so that you can turn your iPhone into a software-optimized camera for live video. The startup wants to make it easy to use the phone that you have in your pocket with the livestreaming platform that you already use, such as Zoom, Google Meet, Twitch, Hopin or YouTube Live.</p>
<p>Over the past year, if you have had to present something to a large audience over a livestream, chances are you’ve faced a few challenges. First, as Joanna Stern of the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/series/joanna-stern-personal-technology/webcam-showdown-macbook-air-dell-xps-theyre-pretty-bad/415D393C-4320-442B-974D-1887E20C057F">demonstrated</a>, laptop webcams suck. There’s no way you’re going to look good with your computer.</p>
<p>Second, if you’re willing to invest some money, you can buy a ring light, a dedicated camera, a good microphone, etc. The issue is that it’s expensive. More importantly, it’s been really hard to buy some of this stuff as many remote workers have been looking for those devices.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Third, you might be good at teaching something, but not good at video production. Those are different skills and somehow people are telling you that you should know everything about white balance, anti-flickering and more.</p>
<p>As for Detail, the company wants to make it as easy as possible to go from zero to livestream. The best camera that you have is most likely the one in your pocket, right there on the back of your smartphone. For the past few years, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/22/the-future-of-photography-is-code/">computational photography</a> has led to tremendous improvements when it comes to taking photos with your phone. But there’s still some work to do on the livestreaming front.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5fwJ5PNlX0"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/22/the-future-of-photography-is-code/">The future of photography is code</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The future of photography is code&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/22/the-future-of-photography-is-code/embed/#?secret=5fwJ5PNlX0" data-secret="5fwJ5PNlX0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Detail founder Paul Veugen <a href="https://medium.com/detailapp/the-third-act-1a6472bd1932">rightly points out</a> that hosting a live video has become a commodity. But everything that happens before you send the video feed over the internet could be improved.</p>
<p>At first Detail is going to be an iPhone and Mac app that works hand in hand like <a href="https://reincubate.com/camo/">Camo</a> and <a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/epoccam">EpocCam</a>. There are going to be some easy-to-use settings to tweak color grades, add filters, etc. It’s going to be a more opinionated take on the smartphone-as-a-webcam movement.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the team is composed of some of the people that worked on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/human/">Human</a>, an app I started covering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/03/meet-human-a-beautiful-fitness-tracking-app-to-effortlessly-stay-healthy/">way back in 2013</a>. Human was a passive fitness tracking app — you could set it up and get insights about how active you had been over the past few days. Essentially, it was like Apple’s activity rings before Apple introduced the Apple Watch. Human was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/18/mapbox-is-acquiring-passive-fitness-tracking-app-human/">acquired by Mapbox</a> in 2016.</p>
<p>Detail raised a $2 million pre-seed round led by Connect Ventures. Hustle Fund, Alexander Ljung, Anke Huiskes, Arthur Kosten, Elodie and Tony Jamous, Hiten Shah, Janis Krums, Mart Kelder, Micha Hernandez van Leuffen, Othman Laraki, Omri Amir and Sten Tamkivi are also participating in the round.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>As you can see, Detail is still in active development and the beta test is going to start soon. But it’s an intriguing app and I’m going to keep an eye on it to see how it pans out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://capsule.social">Capsule</a>&#8216;s plan to launch a super simple decentralized social media platform which is safe from censorship by Big Tech has advanced another stage: The nascent startup has closed a seed round of funding ($1.5M) led by Beacon Fund, a dedicated crypto fund by Polychain Capital &#8212; which is itself focused on startups building on Dfinity&#8217;s decentralized network for next-gen &#8216;open&#8217; apps (aka, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/dfinity-launches-an-open-source-platform-aimed-at-the-social-networking-giants/">the Internet Computer</a>).</p>
<p>As we reported in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/18/cryptocat-author-gets-insanely-fast-backing-to-build-p2p-tech-for-social-media/">January</a>, the idea for Capsule started with a tweet that almost immediately pulled in a pre-seed raise of $100k. That&#8217;s now been topped up with seed financing to get a prototype to market later this month.</p>
<p>Mobile apps are also on the cards and the funding will be used to build out Capsule&#8217;s team as well (currently it&#8217;s around four people).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Capsule founder Nadim Kobeissi, a cryptography researcher who previously authored the open-source E2E-encrypted desktop chat app Cryptocat, says they&#8217;re on track to put out an MVP this month &#8212; once they&#8217;ve made a few tweaks to the infrastructure.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prototype is ready,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We’re investigating switching some of the infrastructure from GUN to IPFS [InterPlanetary File System; aka a p2p hypermedia protocol], and improving the user interface. We could launch an MVP now but are choosing to hold off by a few weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Polychain Capital outted its Beacon Fund last September. The $14.5M investment vehicle is funded by Polychain, Andreessen Horowitz, and the Dfinity Foundation &#8212; and aims to support entrepreneurs and teams building on Dfinity&#8217;s the Internet Computer (TIC); aka a serverless architecture for natively hosting software and services (which it refers to as the &#8220;first blockchain computer that runs at web speed with infinite capacity&#8221;).</p>
<p>Kobeissi&#8217;s original concept for Capsule, meanwhile, was to create self-hosting microservices. He says that hasn&#8217;t changed &#8212; but sees potential for TIC to help solve some specific technical issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Internet Computer will hopefully be helping us build a &#8216;customized mini-blockchain&#8217; to solve two issues with Capsule: Global authenticated timestamps for posts as well as a root of trust for user’s authentication keys for posts,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We were looking to solve these issues somehow before this investment and were already considering Dfinity as the potential solution given that it has a programming language that allows for building these &#8216;custom mini-blockchains&#8217; as we see them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The rest will still be a self-hosting, self-contained, precisely engineered micro-services concept, with IPFS (previously GUN) as a decentralized database/connectivity back-end,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Given the intent with TIC is to hosts all sorts of decentralized apps it&#8217;s possible &#8212; indeed, likely &#8212; that a bunch of decentralized social media plays will emerge. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/dfinity-launches-an-open-source-platform-aimed-at-the-social-networking-giants/">Last year</a>, for example, Dfinity launched a proof of concept for an &#8216;open&#8217; version of the professional social network, LinkedIn &#8212; which it punningly called &#8216;LinkedUp&#8217;.</p>
<p>It went on to demo a TikTok clone &#8212; and to open TIC up to outside developers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/dfinity-demos-its-tiktok-clone-opens-up-its-internet-computer-to-outside-developers/">last summer</a>. So there could soon be a bunch of apps built atop its network touting social networking services without the meddling hand of Big Tech. Where, then, does Kobeissi see Capsule&#8217;s USP &#8212; i.e. if/when there&#8217;s a sea of decentralized &#8216;mega-apps&#8217; that can also claim resilience to censorship?</p>
<p>&#8220;We think Capsule’s value will lie in its exceptional user experience, quality, performance, ease of use and high quality engineering that draws on advanced technologies such as TIC and IPFS without saddling bloat,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Others may use the same technology but I think we can do a good job on building something simple that just works and that is a pleasure to use.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, I think that Capsule will be to Facebook what healthy, vegetarian diets are to a McDonald’s diet,&#8221; he adds more generally of his intent for the service. &#8220;Capsule may be a social media service but its relationship with its users and developers will be fundamentally different than Big Tech platforms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Below are a few screenshots showing current mock-ups of the Capsule interface.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In December, Walmart partnered with TikTok on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/">the first pilot test of a new livestreamed shopping experience</a> in the U.S. on the video platform. That test seemingly performed well, as today Walmart announced it will return to TikTok to host another livestream shopping event, the &#8220;Spring Shop-Along: Beauty Edition,&#8221; which will feature TikTok creators and influencers in an hour-long livestream.</p>
<p>The retailer didn&#8217;t disclose to what extent its first TikTok live shopping event drove sales, but noted that it netted 7x more views than it had anticipated and was able to grow its TikTok follower base by 25%. These metrics were encouraging enough to send Walmart back to the platform for another go &#8212; this time, to promote beauty products instead of apparel, which had been the focus of the holiday livestream.</p>
<p>The new Spring Shop-Along will run this Thursday, March 11 at 9 p.m. EST on the Walmart TikTok channel. Like the prior holiday event, the new livestream shopping event will see various TikTok creators joining to talk about and demonstrate their favorite items. One participating creator has already been announced: Gabby Morrison (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gabbymorr?lang=en">@GabbyMorr</a>) who has over 3.5 million TikTok followers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2123002" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2123002" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2123002" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="443" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.png 1840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.png?resize=300,196 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.png?resize=768,501 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.png?resize=680,443 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.png?resize=1536,1002 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2123002" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walmart</p></div></p>
<p>Gabby and others will demo their skincare, makeup and hair routines and reveal the Walmart beauty products they&#8217;re using during the 60-minute live event. Featured beauty brands will include NYX, Maybelline, The Lip Bar, Bliss, Kim Kimble and Marc Jacobs fragrances.</p>
<p>Viewers watching the event will be able to get beauty tips as well as shop the products featured directly in the TikTok app by tapping on product &#8220;pins.&#8221; This will allow them to add items to their cart that they can then check out either during or after the event.</p>
<p>&#8220;Brands have found a unique home on TikTok to create content that speaks to the community and inspires engagement, whether it&#8217;s participating in trends or discovering new products,&#8221; said Blake Chandlee, president of TikTok Global Business Solutions, in a statement about Walmart&#8217;s plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the shoppable livestream experience, it&#8217;s exciting to see how the TikTok community loves engaging with their favorite creators and discovering new products. We look forward to continue building innovative ways to power the path from discovery to purchase, and seeing brands like Walmart bring their creativity to users,&#8221; Chandlee added.</p>
<p>Walmart had already signaled its interest in leveraging TikTok for e-commerce ahead of the holiday livestream. Notably, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/tiktok-deal/">had planned to invest in TikTok</a> when the video app was threatened with a ban under the Trump administration, unless it sold its U.S. operations to an American company. That forced sale, which would have spun out TikTok&#8217;s U.S. business to new owners Oracle and Walmart, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/tiktoks-forced-sale-to-oracle-is-put-on-hold/">shelved</a> for the time being as the Biden administration <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-sale-to-oracle-walmart-is-shelved-as-biden-reviews-security-11612958401">reviews</a> the agency action under Trump.</p>

<p>Livestreamed shopping is an area of increasing interest and investment in the U.S. The trend has seen a number of startups enter the market, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/26/ntwrk-moves-into-live-events/">NTWRK</a> and recently funded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/bambuser-live-video-shopping/">Bambuser</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/popshop-live-gets-3-million-to-bring-live-streaming-to-shopping/">Popshop Live</a>, among others. Larger tech companies are also taking part &#8212; including across mobile video and live video shopping.</p>

<p>Walmart had said its plan to partner with TikTok on livestream shopping wasn&#8217;t a result of its deal talks, however &#8212; it&#8217;s been an active brand on TikTok&#8217;s platform for well over a year. The retailer even <a href="https://www.modernretail.co/retailers/a-true-influencer-program-inside-walmarts-growing-army-of-employee-tiktokers/">tasked its employees to make TikTok videos</a>, in addition to running its own TikTok channel.</p>
<p>Reached for comment, the retailer declined to provide further metrics about its first livestream on TikTok, but felt the pilot test delivered above expectations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were happy with getting 7x more views than anticipated and the 25% increase in TikTok follower growth after the first event. We were also pleased with the smooth checkout experience,&#8221; a spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;We aren’t able to share sales numbers, but can share that we hit the projections we set ahead of the event.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following this week&#8217;s live shopping event, Walmart says it plans to bring more shopping experiences to TikTok in the months to come, by continuing to partner with creators to highlight different products via different formats.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://carbonengineering.com/">Carbon Engineering</a> is moving ahead with its carbon removal service business, allowing customers to buy the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere using its direct air capture technology.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The launch of the service, and the announcement that Shopify will be the company&#8217;s first customer, comes as the company&#8217;s most direct competitor, Climeworks, made moves of its own &#8212; striking a deal with the Swedish sequestration services company Northern Lights to move forward with its own direct air capture as a service offering.</p>

<p dir="ltr">With the  <span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><a href="https://www.shopify.ca/about/environment" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.shopify.ca/about/environment&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615385146024000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEOEsUe_h0xnmXZTq7QHIIVrTrfVA">Shopify</a> agreement, Carbon Engineering has the first paying customer for 10,000 tonnes of permanent carbon removal capacity from a large-scale DAC project. The removal and sequestration will be done by CE’s plant development partner, <a href="https://www.1pointfive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.1pointfive.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615385146024000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE3WRJFnmCJ3-jSSRVOdwL3srk2Kw">1PointFive</a> – the US development company that&#8217;s currently engineering CE’s first industrial-scale facility, the company said. That facility is due to be completed in 2024. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“Early customers for direct air capture (DAC) &#8212; especially companies with ambitious climate goals &#8212; can have outsized impact today: not only does procuring DAC services enable companies to hit &#8216;net-zero&#8217; pledges faster, but it helps DAC technology come down the &#8216;learning curve,&#8217; driving cost reductions and making DAC services more affordable and accessible for a wider customer base in the future,&#8221; said Noah Deich, president and founder of the climate focused advocacy group Carbon180. &#8220;I&#8217;m very excited to see Carbon Engineering announce a way for early corporate leaders &#8212; and hopefully a wave of fast followers &#8212; to devote more of their climate spend towards DAC.”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Their timeframe puts the Carbon Engineering timetable on roughly even footing with Climeworks for getting to market. Luckily for both firms, given the billions of tons of carbon dioxide emissions that need to be captured and sequestered it&#8217;s a market that&#8217;s definitely big enough for both of them. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">With its commitment, Shopify becomes the largest publicly-announced purchaser of direct air capture-based carbon removal.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“Carbon Engineering’s mission has always been to deliver a highly scalable and affordable solution for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere,” said CE CEO, Steve Oldham, in a statement. “We’re on the brink of large-scale deployment of our technology and the next critical step is accumulating market interest and securing customers. This new service allows us to do that. It also makes it easy for companies and governments to include permanent carbon removal in their net-zero plans. We’re thrilled to expand our relationship with Shopify and welcome them as our first carbon removal customer, and we look forward to supporting others so we can collectively make large-scale carbon removal a reality.”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">Carbon removal unit purchases will be fulfilled by distributed air capture facilities deployed by 1PointFive, Carbon Engineering&#8217;s development partner, which is backed by deep-pocketed investors including <a href="https://www.oxylowcarbon.com/">Oxy Low Carbon Ventures, LLC</a>, a subsidiary of Occidental, and <a href="https://www.rusheen.com/">Rusheen Capital Management</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Carbon Engineering is also working with<span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"> <a href="https://pale-blu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pale-blu.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1615385146024000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFuF-j_Fv-oA8qeD_Z-ckz2rymsZQ">Pale Blue Dot Energy</a> out of the UK to bring its direct air capture technology across the Atlantic.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">“We welcome this news and applaud Shopify on their climate leadership position,” said 1PointFive Chairman Richard Jackson. “Alongside climate experts like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we recognize that permanent carbon removal is going to be necessary to achieve our vision of a sustainable low-carbon world. 1PointFive looks forward to bringing large-scale carbon removal capability based on CE’s technology to the market, helping customers worldwide to achieve their climate goals.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world of cybersecurity has seen a huge proliferation of new technology and services over the years. But with the primary focus being on solutions for larger enterprises, it leaves a big gap in the market for small and medium businesses, not least because they are increasingly finding themselves to also be a focus of malicious hackers. Today, a startup called <a href="http://actzero.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ActZero</a> is coming out of stealth with a set of solutions aimed specifically at SMBs. Along with its public launch, it&#8217;s also announcing that it has raised a seed round $40 million to get its business going.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our main focus is SMB security,&#8221; Sameer Bhalotra, the co-founder and CEO, said in an interview. The way he and the others at ActZero see it, many startups have emerged to target the security issues faced by big government and large enterprises. &#8220;But we want to help the small and medium businesses who we feel might need help the most. No one has stitched the products together the way SMBs need them to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>That solution is focused around monitoring, managed detection and response, he said, not just to discover but to contain cyber threats, which ActZero powers by way of a comprehensive, cloud-based AI platform. The AI in turn helps automate some of its services, bringing down the pricing and making it all something within the budgetary reach of a typical SMB. ActZero&#8217;s smallest customers have a few hundred employees, while the biggest have a headcount of around 3,500.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are bringing technology to bear to democratize access,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The funding is coming from a single investor, Point72 Hyperscale, a VC firm backed by Stephen Cohen, who may be most well known for his track record in private equity. That money was raised, Bhalotra said, &#8220;on day one&#8221; of ActZero being founded in 2019.</p>
<p>$40 million may sound like a lot for a seed round, especially for a company that had yet to launch a service or acquire a customer. But it&#8217;s money that has been put to work already.</p>
<p>Some of the funding was used to acquire IntelliGo, a security startup out of Canada, last year, to give the company a head start on training its AI models with IntelliGo&#8217;s data, and also to bring on the startup&#8217;s customers to be its first users.</p>
<p>Another reason for the large funding round and strong confidence in what was just a concept at the time is the track record of the startup&#8217;s executives.</p>
<p>A previous security company cofounded by Bhalotra, StackRox, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/redhat-is-acquiring-container-security-company-stackrox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by RedHat</a>, and another, Impermium, where he was a key executive, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/15/impermium-google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Google</a> where he became a cybersecurity executive. He was also senior director for cybersecurity in the Obama White House, among many other critical roles.</p>
<p>Co-founder Ed Gardner was a longtime security architect and program manager first at Akamai, then Amazon and then Microsoft. ActZero&#8217;s COO Chris Finan also spent years at Impermium, Shape Security, and in a number of security roles over many years in Washington.</p>
<p>The work that they and others on the ActZero team put into managing cybersecurity in years past saw their primary focus train on formidable opponents that came in the form of state actors or those financed by large entities intent on stealing state intelligence, intellectual property from major companies, money laundering, and disrupting networks and normal activity for other motives. &#8220;Cyberdefense was mostly about big banks and government agencies,&#8221; Bhalotra said, speaking with just a little wistfulness in his voice, maybe because it was, relatively speaking, a lot simpler back then.</p>
<p>These are not exactly the same kinds of issues that SMBs have traditionally faced, but times are changing. In more recent years, the evolution of cybercrime has been swift and &#8212; ironically &#8212; democratized in the process, where not even the smallest companies are totally safe.</p>
<p>And in some ways, the threat is proportionately worse for less well-equipped smaller companies not set up to weather risky financial events. Recent research from the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/uk-en/security/data-breach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ponemon Institute and IBM</a> found that the average cost of a breach can reach into the millions of dollars, which can cripple smaller businesses.</p>
<p>You can liken the situation in enterprise security somewhat to the offline world of organized crime, where there are higher levels of groups that are dealing with huge sums of money and engaging in major industries, while there are also lower levels involved in more localized and smaller activities, and even low runs working in petty crime.</p>
<p>A lot of the primary threat for SMBs in recent years has been around ransomware, &#8220;and criminal organizations have innovated on their business models and they have now moved beyond ransomware to data extortion,&#8221; said Finan. &#8220;It&#8217;s actually been fascinating to see how vertically integrated these organizations have become. You might have accounts receivable arms, R&amp;D arms.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sometimes malicious hackers will attack SMBs as part of their &#8220;testing&#8221; process, he added. And their arsenal of tools of course now also include artificial intelligence, giving them machine speed to fuel malicious human intent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rise of Covid-19, which has led to so much more business and activity being carried out online, has led to a growing &#8220;opportunity&#8221; for them, Finan said. &#8220;I have been astounded by the level of sophistication, and Covid has accelerated that shift downmarket.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem is that SMBs, even those with thousands of employees, may lack the knowledge, budget or human resources to hire the kinds of security teams they need to have to address all of this.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish that these small businesses were still under the radar because they are not up to the challenge for dealing with these groups,&#8221; said Bhalotra. &#8220;It&#8217;s just not the case any longer that they&#8217;re being ignored. We want to democratize cyber defense because hackers target everyone. We see multiple attacks daily, and they vary tremendously.&#8221;</p>
<p>There have been tools built to address security for SMBs before, although traditionally the focus has been around antivirus, firewalls and other basics. The key with what ActZero is doing is that it&#8217;s conceiving of SMB solutions on par with what is being built for their larger counterparts. It&#8217;s a next-generation security approach being taken also by a few others, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/enterprise-cybersecurity-startup-bluevoyant-raises-82-5m-at-a-430m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlueVoyant</a> and <a href="https://www.finsmes.com/2019/09/skout-cybersecurity-raises-25m-in-funding.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skout</a>, both of which have also raised <a href="https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/temasek-bluevoyant-197626/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sizeable rounds of funding</a>.</p>
<p>The bet is that ActZero&#8217;s team&#8217;s track record and knowledge sets them up to be leaders in this area.</p>
<p>“ActZero has developed an elegant solution for addressing the most pressing security concerns of SMBs today with its unified, AI-powered platform,” said Dan Gwak, head of Point72 Hyperscale, in a statement. “ActZero is unique in its appreciation for and realization of a combined people and automation model. We believe that ActZero has the potential to transform how security solutions are delivered to help businesses achieve better security posture more affordably. We’re excited to partner with them on this critical journey.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoFi, more formally known as Social Finance, announced today that it has agreed to acquire Golden Pacific Bancorp (GPB) for about $22.3 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dollar amount is not staggering. What is more notable about the acquisition is that it’s giving SoFi a quick route to getting a national bank charter. SoFi, a digital personal finance company, got </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sofi-bank-charter/fintech-startup-sofi-gets-preliminary-approval-for-u-s-bank-charter-idUSKBN27D27W"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preliminary approval for a bank charter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last October. By acquiring Golden Pacific, the company gets a fast track into that process. Once the transaction closes later this year, GPB will become a subsidiary of the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A national bank charter will give SoFi the ability to accept deposits and make loans that use SoFi’s member deposits as opposed to funding its loan offerings as a nonbank, by contracting external underwriters at a premium.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result of the proposed acquisition, SoFi said it would switch its current de novo (i.e., net new) bank application to a change of control application. GPB currently has about $150 million in assets, but if the OCC and Federal Reserve grants SoFi a national bank charter, the company said it will then put $750 million toward its national, digital business plan. At the same time, it will maintain GPB’s community bank business and footprint, including its current three physical branches. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoFi expects the acquisition to close by year’s end. At that time, GPB’s community bank business will operate as a division of SoFi Bank, N.A., a renaming of GPB&#8217;s bank entity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GPB President and CEO Virginia Varela will continue to lead the GPB community bank business under the direction of Paul Mayer, who will serve as president of SoFi Bank, N.A.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that by pursuing a national bank charter, we will be able to help even more people get their money right with enhanced value and more products and services,” said SoFi CEO Anthony Noto in a written statement. “We are thrilled to have found a partner in Golden Pacific Bank to both accelerate our pursuit to establish a national bank subsidiary, as well as begin to expand our offerings in SoFi’s financial products and Galileo’s technology platform to serve local communities.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SoFi expects to file shortly with the Federal Reserve for Bank Holding Company status and, together with GPB, to file an updated business plan with the OCC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco-based SoFi is the latest in a string of fintechs that are either becoming banks, or launching bank arms.</span></p>

Square Financial Services completed the charter approval process with the FDIC and Utah Department of Financial Institutions, meaning it was ready for business as of last week.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many companies have turned to self-serve sales, which may encourage people to try freemium or open source versions of a product. Some percentage of these users may turn into paying customers, and in the best case will act as leaders to bring a product into their organization.</p>
<p><a href="https://calixa.io/">Calixa</a>, an early stage startup believes that this type of sale, known as a bottom up sales motion, requires a new kind of tool to manage the process, and today it announced a $4.25 million seed round.</p>
<p>Kleiner Perkins led the round with help from Operator Collective, Liquid 2 Ventures and a bunch of individual investors. The round closed in February 2020, but is only being announced today.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Calixa co-founder and CEO Thomas Schiavone says the roots of the company began when he was working at Twilio in 2010, and saw how powerful it was for developers to purchase tooling themselves. And an idea began to form that CRM tools like Salesforce weren&#8217;t built to deal with this kind of sales motion.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I realized [at Twilio] was that developers were just signing up more and more every day, and that if you really wanted to stay on top of what was going on and try to effectively grow and retain those accounts, you weren&#8217;t looking in Salesforce,&#8221; Schiavone told me.</p>
<p>He said that he decided to start Calixa in 2019 to solve this problem once and for all. While this kind of user-driven, bottom up sale has been in place at software companies for years, he still saw a dearth of tools for dealing with its unique qualities in one place.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw a great opportunity to build something that democratizes [&#8230;] running a bottom up company by not only giving all customer facing teams the ability to see what&#8217;s going on with customers, but also take action,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This ability to manage the process and maybe extend a trial, issue a credit or even reset a password while letting these teams see and understand the underlying customer data was what set it apart from traditional CRMs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The central thesis here is that Salesforce and other CRMs, don&#8217;t have that data. They&#8217;re too divorced or too much in this rigid world of the typical sales model, and you need something different to be an effective company,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>To use the product, you simply sign up and then link the various accounts the product needs to compile the data it needs. It uses various API connectors to make this happen, and all it requires is that you enter your user name and password to access the accounts and begins pulling together the data.</p>
<p>Bucky Moore, a partner at lead investor Kleiner Perkins says that the pandemic has accelerated the move to a bottom up approach as in person sales models have been impossible. &#8220;Core to the success of this strategy is a data-driven understanding of each customer and user. By democratizing this capability to companies of all sizes, Calixa&#8217;s opportunity is to become the de-facto customer operations platform for the modern software business,&#8221; Moore said.</p>
<p>Schiavone reports the company has 7 employees spread across the U.S., Canada and Columbia. He says that as he hires, he will have offices in cities close to his clusters of employees, but he sees a hybrid approach where employees can decide just how much they want to be in the office.</p>
<p>The company spent last year building the product and working with 21 beta customers. The product will be generally available starting today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A security vulnerability in a popular iPhone call recording app exposed thousands of users&#8217; recorded conversations.</p>
<p>The flaw was discovered by Anand Prakash, a security researcher and founder of PingSafe AI, who found that the aptly named <a href="http://www.recorderforiphone.com/">Call Recorder</a> app allowed anyone to access the call recordings from other users — by knowing their phone number.</p>
<p>But using a readily available proxy tool like Burp Suite, Prakash could view and modify the network traffic going in and out of the app. That meant he could replace his phone number registered with the app with the phone number of another app user, and access their recordings on his phone.</p>
<p>TechCrunch verified Prakash&#8217;s <a href="https://www.pingsafe.ai/blog/how-we-could-have-listened-to-anyones-call-recordings?=7194ef805fa2d04b0f7e8c9521f97343">findings</a> using a spare phone with a dedicated account.</p>
<p>The app stores its user&#8217;s call recordings on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cloud-storage/">cloud storage</a> bucket hosted on Amazon Web Services. Although the public was open and lists the files inside, the files could not be accessed or downloaded. The bucket was closed by press time.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the cloud storage bucket had more than 130,000 audio recordings, amounting to some 300 gigabytes. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/apps">app</a> says it has more than 1 million downloads to date.</p>
<p>TechCrunch contacted the app developer and held this story until the flaw was fixed. A new version of the app was submitted to Apple&#8217;s app store on Saturday. The release notes said the app update was to &#8220;patch a security report.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite a brief response to our initial email acknowledging the security issue, the app developer Arun Nair has not returned several requests for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The investment firm <a href="https://www.flagshippioneering.com/">Flagship Pioneering</a> has incubated a lot of life sciences companies since it was founded in 2000. In fact, while a general partner with Flagship Pioneering over the last 15 years, David Berry has started more than 30 companies, five of which trade publicly right now: Seres Therapeutics, Sensen Bio, Evelo Biosciences, T2 Biosystems, and Axcella Health.</p>
<p>Berry is often a company&#8217;s first CEO, then transitions out of the company within 18 months. But he has no plans to leave his post as CEO of <a href="https://www.valohealth.com/">Valo Health</a>, a three-year-old, Boston-based, 110-person drug discovery company that Berry and Flagship seem to think could become one of the firm&#8217;s most important companies yet. That&#8217;s notable, considering that Flagship incubated 11-year-old Moderna, which currently boasts a $50 billion market cap thanks in large part its coronavirus vaccine.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s no surprise, given Berry&#8217;s and Flagship&#8217;s track record that Valo has attracted believers. Notably, today it is announcing a fresh $110 million in extended Series B financing from Koch Disruptive Industries that brings the round total to $300 million and the overall amount the young company has raised to more than <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/valo-health/company_financials">$450 million</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Still, given that there are hundreds of drug discovery companies in the world seizing on the latest advancements in AI, machine learning and computation, it&#8217;s easy to wonder what&#8217;s so special about this one. We got Berry&#8217;s take during a chat with him yesterday, parts of which we are featuring below edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Valo is trying to accelerate the creation of drugs, and it has a computational platform called Opal to do it faster and more effectively than many rivals. Is there a way to make it clearer to outsiders why this platform is so unique? </strong></p>
<p>DB: First, from day one, we were operating on a different scale [than past Flagship Pioneering companies]. Typically, when you look at Flagship companies, there&#8217;s an [exclusive] initial commitment by Flagship of plus or minus $50 million. But because of the scale of the opportunity that we saw ahead of us with Valo, we actually started out by bringing in external financing partners as part of a Series A that was right around $100 million.</p>
<p>[Also unique is the] breadth of what we&#8217;re trying to achieve through our systematic approach to R&amp;D, as opposed to a targeted approach to thinking about it. There&#8217;s been an historical challenge in life sciences in that companies are primarily viewed based on what their lead therapeutic asset looks like. But if you have the potential to change the scope, the scale, the potential, the speed, the probability of success, [and] the cost of developing drugs, you&#8217;re not going to look like a typical therapeutics company.</p>
<p><strong>TC: So your focus on multiple therapeutic areas at once &#8212; oncology, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases &#8212; is a distinguishing element of the company. How are you tackling so much simultaneously?</strong></p>
<p>DB: The legacy biopharma model is basically this point-to-point system [where up to 15 groups] do some work, and then they basically take the result of it and they throw it over a wall to another group that has its own framework. The model is intrinsically disintegrated. They use mice. They use cell lines. They use extracted organs. And those just don&#8217;t represent what a full, intact living human actually looks like, and they don&#8217;t reflect what the disease looks like in the context of that human.</p>
<p>What we&#8217;re doing is what I would call that next transformation . . . enabled by high-quality human-centric data [that we analyze] in an end-to-end, but componentized manner. What I mean by that is we&#8217;ve created a single underlying architecture so that we&#8217;re using the same species, we&#8217;re using the same decision-making criteria. we&#8217;re using the same KPIs throughout the entirety of the R&amp;D cascade, [and] we&#8217;re using the same bases of the core computation. We&#8217;re using the same self-reinforcing model to learn as we go. We have a local expression, because we have to perform a certain set of tasks in order to comply with the regulatory environment. But by doing it in this way as we do those tasks, we&#8217;re learning a lot more and we&#8217;re keeping that human centricity, so when we uncover, for example, a new target in cardiovascular disease or neurodegenerative disease, it&#8217;s based on our human data. It&#8217;s not based on a dog model or mouse model or something along those lines. It&#8217;s not based on cells adapted to plastic in a lab.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Where is that human data coming from? Is the data you&#8217;re feeing into Opal somehow better or different than what others are using?</strong></p>
<p>DB: We haven&#8217;t we haven&#8217;t yet disclosed where our datasets are coming from, but we have reason to believe that the scale and quality of the data sets are substantially high. We have not seen data sets that compare in scope and size. We have announced one subset of our data lake, but I would call it a small subset through a data partnership we announced earlier. [Editor&#8217;s note: this is with a company called Global Genomics Group, which gives Valo access to a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/valo-announces-exclusive-partnership-with-g3-the-worlds-largest-and-detailed-cardio-metabolic-datasets-301197305.html">cardio-metabolic dataset</a>.]</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;ve been at this for a few years. Have you had any major breakthroughs?</strong></p>
<p>DB: I believe what we&#8217;ve done over the last two years is build an incredibly strong technology basis and foundation [for] transformation. We&#8217;ve announced four therapeutic programs that we&#8217;ve launched thus far, and each represents not only something where we&#8217;ve been able to develop a therapeutic candidate in very short periods of time, but we&#8217;ve also been able to overcome historical barriers that made developing those sorts of candidates much more difficult, and we were able to overcome those barriers in weeks.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Can you elaborate on one of those therapies to underscore your point?</strong></p>
<p>DB: One of the programs we announced is called NAMPT. What was really interesting about it is it&#8217;s a very powerful cancer target. The downside of it is it&#8217;s known to cause a very particular toxicological effect &#8212; it causes retinal toxicity &#8212; and we wanted to figure out whether we could get the benefit of the molecule by targeting the target but avoid getting that molecule into the retina, which required a very specific design. Long story short, in a couple of weeks, we were able to achieve a molecule that had enough differentiation between the blood in the eye that it shouldn&#8217;t have any substantial effects.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Are any of these four candidates heading into the market any time soon?</strong></p>
<p>DB: I would love them to be in the market soon, but they&#8217;re not yet there. We are expecting that with the financing in hand, we should ultimately have molecules in clinical trials, and ultimately, we&#8217;re very excited to be able to transition some of the drugs that we are developing into [viable offerings in the market].</p>
<p><strong>TC: Would you sell then sell these to a big pharma company, or would Valo be marketing these itself?</strong></p>
<p>DB: Both are viable potential paths. Because we&#8217;re developing a number of different therapeutics, it gives us flexibility in the way we think about our ultimate business model.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is facing another privacy complaint in Europe: A startup lobby group, <a href="https://francedigitale.org">France Digitale</a>, has asked the country&#8217;s data protection watchdog to investigate alleged breaches of EU rules.</p>
<p>The complaint, reported earlier by <a href="https://pro.politico.eu/news/french-startup-lobby-files-privacy-complaint-against-apple">Politico</a>, follows two similar complaints lodged in Germany and Spain by EU privacy campaign group noyb <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/apples-idfa-gets-targeted-in-strategic-eu-privacy-complaints/">last year</a>.</p>
<p>All these complaints are (directly and indirectly) targeting Apple&#8217;s IDFA &#8212; aka its mobile device Identifier for Advisers &#8212; with noyb arguing Apple should be gathering consent from users in the EU prior to assigning this unique device (whose purpose is, as the name suggests, to enable device tracking for ad targeting).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="zJ0pW8IcCq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/apples-idfa-gets-targeted-in-strategic-eu-privacy-complaints/">Apple&#8217;s IDFA gets targeted in strategic EU privacy complaints</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple&#8217;s IDFA gets targeted in strategic EU privacy complaints&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/apples-idfa-gets-targeted-in-strategic-eu-privacy-complaints/embed/#?secret=zJ0pW8IcCq" data-secret="zJ0pW8IcCq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>France Digitale&#8217;s complaint also raises competition concerns, pointing to a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/apple-takes-aim-at-adtech-hysteria-over-ios-app-tracking-change/"> looming switch by Apple</a> &#8212; to require opt in for third party apps to track users &#8212; and contrasting that with a &#8216;personalized advertising&#8217; setting in iOS which it says lets Apple track users and is switched on by default.</p>
<p>It suggests that default is contrary to requirements under EU law (citing consent standards in the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation; GDPR).</p>
<p>The France Digitale complaint also raises questions over the level of data access Apple provides iOS users related to the ad targeting it carries out &#8212; saying users are only provided with &#8220;generic data (year of birth, sex, location)&#8221;, rather than fuller targeting data.</p>
<p>In a statement responding to the complaint, an Apple spokesperson told us:</p>
<blockquote><p>The allegations in the complaint are patently false and will be seen for what they are, a poor attempt by those who track users to distract from their own actions and mislead regulators and policymakers. Transparency and control for the user are fundamental pillars of our privacy philosophy, which is why we’ve made App Tracking Transparency equally applicable to all developers including Apple. Privacy is built into the ads we sell on our platform with no tracking. We hold ourselves to a higher standard by allowing users to opt out of Apple&#8217;s limited first-party data use for personalized advertising, a feature that makes us unique.</p></blockquote>
<p>The CNIL has also been contacted for comment on the complaint.</p>
<p>The latest IDFA-related complaint against Apple is a little unusual as it&#8217;s not coming from a privacy group &#8212; but a startup lobby.</p>
<p>Evidently, though, Apple&#8217;s decision to switch to requiring opt-in from iOS users to third party tracking (rather than opt out) is ruffling feathers. (The move also led to a publisher lobby group in France to file a competition complaint last year). The not-so-subtle subtext, here, is Apple is being accused of privacy hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Asked why France Digitale is making a privacy complaint against Apple, a spokesman told TechCrunch: &#8220;Startups play by the rules. We expect the world&#8217;s largest tech company to do so. We believe no scale-up can thrive without a regulatory level-playing field.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are merely asking the CNIL to enforce the law. Privacy watchdogs investigate our startup members all the time. Lets them use their expertise on the bigger cats,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>While the group has attracted some quick publicity with the complaint to the CNIL, under GDPR&#8217;s one-stop-shop mechanism the matter would have to be referred to Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission &#8212; which is Apple&#8217;s lead data supervisor in the EU &#8212; which would then take a decision on whether or not to investigate. So there&#8217;s unlikely to be any quick regulatory action on this issue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Most companies claim they want a diverse staff but at the same time, complain they don’t know how to go about recruiting more diverse candidates.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Enter <a href="https://seekout.com/">SeekOut</a> &#8212; a startup that is out to give companies no excuses with its AI-powered platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A group of former Microsoft executives and engineers &#8212;  <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/anoop-gupta-b16d">Anoop Gupta</a>,<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/aravind-bala-f211"> Aravind Bala</a>,<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/john-tippett-4a54"> John Tippett</a>,<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/vikas-manocha-7c7e"> Vikas Manocha</a> &#8212; founded SeekOut in 2016. The team started out building a messaging platform that provided a deep level of information about people that others might be emailing. When they realized that what customers really were after was the information they were uncovering, and not so much the messaging capability, the company pivoted in 2017.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Today, SeekOut’s goal is to help talent acquisition teams to recruit “hard-to-find and diverse talent.” The startup wouldn’t name names but said it is working with 6 out of the 10 “most highly valued companies” by market cap in the U.S. Overall, it had about 500 customers as of January across a range of industries from technology to pharmaceutical to aerospace and defense to banking.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over the years, SeekOut has built out a database with hundreds of millions of profiles using its AI-powered talent search engine and “deep interactive analytics.” It finds talent by scouring public data and using natural-language and machine-learning technologies to understand the expertise of each candidate and build a complete 360-degree view of each potential employee. Specifically, it blends info from public profiles, GitHub, papers and patents, employee referrals, company alumni, candidates in ATS systems.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While SeekOut initially focused strictly on technical talent, it has since broadened its base to helping recruiters and sources find more diverse candidates in general as well as people with simply “hard-to-find&#8221; skill sets. And it claims to do it with “unprecedented speed and precision&#8221; via a blind hiring method designed to reduce bias. SeekOut then gives recruiters a way to engage with candidates instantly by getting access to the right contact information in a &#8220;single click.”</p>

Image courtesy of SeekOut</p></div></p>
<p dir="ltr">The startup is hitting such a sweet spot that it attracted the attention of Tiger Global Management, the global investment firm that just led a $65 million Series B that values SeekOut at around $500 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Existing backers Madrona Venture Group and Mayfield also participated in the financing, which brings SeekOut’s total funding since inception to $73 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a world where so many startups have yet to turn a profit, SeekOut is a refreshing exception. Since its $6 million Series A raise in May 2019, the SaaS company says it has grown its subscription revenue (ARR) by “more than 10-fold” (although it declined to reveal hard revenue figures). And it’s been profitable, or cash-flow positive, each of the last two years.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gupta, who serves as the company’s CEO, said its platform (dubbed Talent-360) helps companies not only find diverse talent, but helps them improve retention by finding the “right” candidate to begin with.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While there was a pause almost across the board in hiring when the COVID-19 pandemic began, the emergence of remote work as a new normal has forced companies to think more creatively about hiring &#8212; especially since they are not constricted by geography as in the past &#8212; according to Gupta.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“This freedom also means their need for tools like SeekOut increased and we have seen our business take off as a result,” he told TechCrunch. “The focus on diversity hiring and our unique approach to finding the talent and offering blind hiring features has super charged the adoption.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.daily.co/">Daily</a>, the makers of a developer platform for real-time audio and video, has been booming in recent months &#8212; in part, due to the pandemic&#8217;s impact on remote work, virtual events, telehealth and more. Over the past year, Daily saw around a 20x increase in the number of paying customers and a 30x increase in revenue, it says. Though the team was initially hesitant to raise funds in light of this growth, they have now closed on $15 million Series A funding.</p>
<p>The new round was led by early Stripe employee-turned-investor <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/lachy-groom">Lachy Groom</a>, who became connected with the startup via his portfolio company Interval.com, a Daily customer. Tiger Global, other angels and most of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/daily-co-raises-4-6m-video-chat-api-service/">Daily&#8217;s seed investors</a> also participated, bringing Daily&#8217;s total raise to date to $22 million.</p>
<p>Daily itself was founded in 2016 as a big bet on video, and WebRTC in particular, but has been boosted by the pandemic and the market shifts that resulted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We believed back then and have believed for a while that video would be everywhere. It would be a crucial part of how we live and work and engage with all sorts of products,&#8221; explains Daily co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nina-kuruvilla/">Nina Kuruvilla</a>. &#8220;We thought that this shift would require new platforms and tools to make working with video as easy as possible,&#8221; she says.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Teamflow lands $3.9 million for a productive virtual HQ platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/teamflow-lands-3-9-million-for-a-productive-virtual-hq-platform/embed/#?secret=82Vt8dOYF5" data-secret="82Vt8dOYF5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>As it turns out, Daily&#8217;s bet was a good one &#8212; though it took a few years and a global pandemic to see the hockey stick growth that startups aspire to.</p>
<p>Today, Daily is used by a number of companies focused on the future of work, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/tandem/">virtual office startup Tandem</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/teamflow-lands-3-9-million-for-a-productive-virtual-hq-platform/">virtual HQ platform Teamflow,</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/pitch-a-presentation-startup-from-wunderlists-founders-raises-30m-more-to-take-on-powerpoint/">presentation startup Pitch</a>, pair programming tool <a href="https://gitduck.com/">GitDuck</a>, virtual recruiting startup <a href="https://start.florecruit.com/">Flo Recruit</a> and others. It&#8217;s also been adopted by enterprises in spaces like healthcare and customer support.</p>
<p>With Daily&#8217;s platform, developers can either use a prebuilt UI to integrate video calls with just two lines of code, or they can opt to build out their own custom video <a href="https://uxplanet.org/what-is-ui-vs-ux-design-and-the-difference-d9113f6612de">UI and UX</a>. With the former, developers can embed a video call widget that features video chat, screen sharing and recording capabilities. Meanwhile, the latter gives developers more control over the layout, workflow and video and audio tracks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Video is a big challenging problem &#8212; real-time video and real-time audio. You need some set of tools to help you do it &#8212; especially if you&#8217;re going to roll it out quickly and you&#8217;re going to then scale it,&#8221; explains Daily co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kwkramer/">Kwindla Kramer</a>. &#8220;We give you the APIs that let you develop really quickly, [that are] flexible enough for you to keep improving the product over time. And then we also have this global infrastructure that makes it possible for our customers to scale without having to, you know, build a whole equivalent of AWS themselves,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>With Daily, developers gain access to servers spread out in different regions all over the world, to protect against latency issues. Daily also does the heavy lifting in terms of making sure the product works well across all platforms and devices.</p>
<p>From a security and privacy standpoint, it&#8217;s HIPAA compliant and doesn&#8217;t capture customer data. It&#8217;s also transparent about when and how encryption is applied. For example, Daily&#8217;s peer-to-peer calls are end-to-end encrypted, while calls routed through media servers are encrypted to and from the servers, but are decrypted on the servers in order to do things like forwarding and recording.</p>
<p>The technology itself is flexible, too. Daily lets customers specify if they don&#8217;t want audio and video packets to move outside the EU, for regulatory reasons. Customers can choose to integrate with their preferred transcription engine or other major recording and live streaming APIs.</p>
<p>Through Daily&#8217;s developer dashboard, customers can view call quality insights and visualizations.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122567" style="width: 1250px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122567" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2122567 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daily-Product-Call-quality-visualizations.jpg" alt="" width="1240" height="1698" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daily-Product-Call-quality-visualizations.jpg 1240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daily-Product-Call-quality-visualizations.jpg?resize=110,150 110w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daily-Product-Call-quality-visualizations.jpg?resize=219,300 219w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daily-Product-Call-quality-visualizations.jpg?resize=768,1052 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daily-Product-Call-quality-visualizations.jpg?resize=497,680 497w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daily-Product-Call-quality-visualizations.jpg?resize=1122,1536 1122w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Daily-Product-Call-quality-visualizations.jpg?resize=37,50 37w" sizes="(max-width: 1240px) 100vw, 1240px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122567" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Daily</p></div></p>
<p>To attract customers, Daily kept its pricing model simple. It has introductory plans for smaller customers that grow to the larger &#8220;Scale&#8221; plan at $199 per month for 10,000 minutes. From there, customers just pay an additional rate per minute as they grow.</p>
<p>The company was already seeing steady demand for video ahead of COVID, particularly in areas like remote work and healthcare. But COVID accelerated those use cases and impacted others, as well. After March 2020, the world quickly woke up to the need to prioritize video.</p>
<p>&#8220;Productivity and the future of work is rapidly changing. Online events, healthcare, customer support, interactive live streaming. IoT and robotics use cases. Social and gaming,&#8221; Kuruvilla says, rattling off the various Daily use cases.</p>
<p>During the first six months of the pandemic, Daily&#8217;s adoption grew as customers looked to get up-and-running with video quickly. Later, they began to shift toward innovating around what it means to build a digitally native service with video.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;An unsurprising wave of video-focused startups is trying to make video calls better&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/an-unsurprising-wave-of-video-focused-startups-is-trying-to-make-video-calls-better/embed/#?secret=Vncb9s35YY" data-secret="Vncb9s35YY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That&#8217;s helped to advance new models for how video can be used &#8212; like virtual fitness classes where people not only see the instructor, but also their friends who signed up with them. Or hybrid video and audio experiences for live events; real-time video conversations during livestreams; live e-commerce events; and more.</p>
<p>The company believes that this leap forward means Daily has a future even when, post-pandemic, things &#8220;go back to normal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think some traditional video call usage is probably going to stagnate or go down, but all of these new use cases just feel like they&#8217;re ramping up &#8212; because it&#8217;s early innings and they&#8217;re really genuinely useful,&#8221; notes Kramer.</p>
<p>The team says they chose to work with Lachy Groom because &#8212; unlike the dozens of investors they pitched during their seed stage who thought video was a niche market &#8212; Lachy understood what Daily was doing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only after we got to know Lachy that we really felt like there was another investor, like [<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/daily-co-raises-4-6m-video-chat-api-service/">seed investor</a>] Jenny [Lefcourt from Freestyle], who really understood what we needed to do as a company to be the best possible company we could be. And that was worth raising a round with,&#8221; says Kramer.</p>
<p>With the additional funds, Daily will hire more engineers and focus on various product initiatives around call quality and reliability, expanding its global infrastructure and supporting larger calls and more hybrid use cases.</p>
<p>In addition to Lachy Groom and Tiger, Daily is backed by Freestyle Capital, Root Ventures, Y Combinator, Slack Fund, Moxxie Ventures, Haystack Ventures, TenOneTen Ventures, Ground Up Ventures, Offline Ventures, Work Life Ventures, Basement Fund, Compound, and numerous angel investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.global-e.com/en/">Global-e</a>, an e-commerce platform that helps online sellers reach global consumers, filed to go public this morning. The company&#8217;s F-1 filing is <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1835963/000119312521073395/d77487df1.htm#rom77487_19">here</a>, if you&#8217;d like to read along.</p>
<p>While Global-e is not a United States-based company &#8212; it also has offices in the U.K. and Israel, among other countries &#8212; its recent growth underscores that the e-commerce boom we&#8217;ve seen domestically is hardly unique. Indeed, Global-e&#8217;s growth has been rapid and impressive.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Hell, the company is profitable while scaling, a rare sight among recent technology IPOs.</p>
<p>We care about the Global-e IPO because it&#8217;s a venture-backed former startup. Reading its filing, we can see that <a href="https://red-dot.capital/">Red Dot Capital Partners</a> has a material stake. Logistics giant DHL also put money into the company, along with money managed by Apax Partners and Vitruvian Partners, both private equity players.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Regardless, here&#8217;s a company that represents a bucket of private cash going public during a period of intensive flotation activity. Let&#8217;s get acquainted with what it does, dig into its numbers and add it to our IPO list.</p>
<p>Recall that Roblox is expected to begin trading tomorrow and Coupan on Thursday, after pricing Wednesday. Olo will price and trade next week. Coinbase is somewhere in the wings ahead of its own direct listing. And there are others: It&#8217;s going to be a regular IPO run for the next few weeks, not counting the other filings that will surely drop.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s get our heads around Global-e. Into the tables!</p>
<h2>What is Global-e?</h2>
<p>Selling and shipping across borders can prove difficult and is probably hardest for smaller online sellers. And the global market is just that, so if you want to reach it, you have to do extra work. Global-e provides services to sellers to make selling around the world a bit easier. Things like, per its F-1 filing, localized browsing, pricing and checkout, shipping options, locally friendly payment solutions and returns support.</p>
<p>Given the e-commerce boom of the COVID-19 era, the company&#8217;s business exploded in 2020.</p>
<p>A few metrics make that plain. From 2018 to 2020, the company&#8217;s processed gross merchandise volume, or GMV, rose from $211 million to $382 million to $774 million. As you can imagine, its revenues grew as well, scaling from $38.6 million to $65.9 million to $136.4 million across the same time frame.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At TechCrunch Sessions: Justice, we examined the importance of ensuring products are designed to be accessible from the beginning. And how building the expertise of disabled technologists and advocates and into the DNA of your company from the start is vital not only to produce better products but also in the pursuit of a functioning and more equitable society.</p>
<p>On the panel were Cynthia Bennett of Carnegie Mellon University’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Srin Madipalli who founded accessible travel marketplace Accomable (which exited to Airbnb), and Mara Mills, Associate Professor of Media, Culture, and Communication at New York University and a co-founder and co-director of the NYU Center for Disability Studies.</p>
<hr />
<h3>On a defining accessibility</h3>
<p>Any nuanced discussion on designing for accessibility first requires a definition of accessibility. What do we mean by accessible products and how should founding teams and those involved in designing product frame internal thinking about accessibility.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We learned that on one level the notion of accessibility is very simple: making products that everybody can use. However, from a company building point of view, it&#8217;s also important to think about accessibility from an internal tooling and processes perspective. It&#8217;s not enough to have accessible products for your users. If the software tools or ways of working at your startup exclude people with various disabilities, it&#8217;s infinitely harder to design accessible products anyway as prospective or existing employees with disabilities will be prohibited from doing their best work.</p>
<p>There was one other caveat, too: Disability is not an umbrella category and what works for one group may not work for another. And in fact, some accessibility features or culture and process changes might even be inaccessible to a specific group and this sense there isn&#8217;t a quick technological fix and you&#8217;re done.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Madipalli:</strong> It&#8217;s just simply a way of designing products and services to make sure that anybody could use them regardless of disability. And it&#8217;s very simple level. And, of course, there are nuances to that, and to what specific things one needs to do in order to achieve that. But at its most basic, it&#8217;s just making sure that we design things that everybody can use. <strong>(Timestamp: 1:24)</strong></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Bennett:</strong> Accessibility is not just about making sure that the products that leave the door are accessible, but also the tools and the processes, and the cultures are accessible. So if the products are accessible, are the tools used to create those products able to be used by everyone.<strong><em> (Timestamp: 2:18)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Mills:</strong> It&#8217;s important to remember that access technologies are not inherently accessible themselves, whether we&#8217;re talking about software or a physical ramp, they have to be affordable, they have to be discoverable, people need to know that they exist, they often require training to use… they have to be employed in welcoming settings, the culture has to be there too. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 3:04)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Mills:</strong> Disability is an umbrella category, and it&#8217;s really internally diverse. And we sometimes see access efforts that work for one group, creating new forms of inaccessibility for other groups. And I think that&#8217;s been really true in this moment of video conferencing where certain tools like Zoom work for certain groups and then they don&#8217;t really work that well for deaf and hard of hearing people or they haven&#8217;t before automated captioning became available. So just keeping in mind the diversity of disability and the diversity of access needs. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 3:51)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h3>Medical and social models</h3>
<p>Entrepreneurs like to fix problems, they’re wired that way. But what is the &#8220;problem&#8221; you&#8217;re trying to solve. This is where it&#8217;s useful to take the time to understand different models of disability, namely the medical versus social models.</p>
<p>The social model, which has overwhelmingly been adopted by disabled people themselves, says that a person isn&#8217;t made disabled by their medical impairment alone but by the way society is often arranged, including how the world is designed but also the societal attitudes towards people with disabilities and the barriers to inclusion this creates.</p>
<p>This means that disability is everybody’s problem and that the solution is to fix society not the individual.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mills:</strong> Disability activists in the 70s, were pushing back against what you just said, they&#8217;re pushing back against this dominant medicalised perception of disability, that they called the medical model, which imagines disability only as a so called defect or a disorder, something that requires a cure <em><strong>(Timestamp: 6:19)</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Mills:</strong> According to the social model of disability, the intervention required is not medical, and it&#8217;s not individual, it&#8217;s a matter of social justice. So things like new architecture, new designs, new laws, new software. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 7:27)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<h3>What&#8217;s the right time to begin thinking about accessibility?</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re a founder or product team aiming to bring a new product or service into the world, hopefully by now you&#8217;re already wondering when the right time is to start thinking about accessibility. The answer, of course, is now. If there&#8217;s pushback within your organisation, you&#8217;re missing the opportunity to build a best in class product and remain competitive in just the same way that you wouldn&#8217;t neglect things like being mobile-friendly, security or designing for privacy etc. And, of course, leaving money on the table.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Bennett: </strong>It&#8217;s never too early… If we say no to accessibility, which sometimes might be said explicitly, and other times it might be said implicitly through the technologies we design not being accessible, you are kind of deciding that a swath of humanity is not going to be able to use whatever you&#8217;ve developed. And that to me should never be okay <strong><em>(Timestamp: 9:38)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Madipalli: </strong>It&#8217;s an opportunity rather than a problem, it is something that actually, if it&#8217;s baked into the very beginning, and it&#8217;s seen as part of the workflow of building a product, doesn&#8217;t have to be of a different challenge. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 12:32)</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Madipalli: </strong>It&#8217;s really important for founders to not see this as a problem to be solved, that this can be something that is just part of making our product or service kind of usable by our customers and delivering a great customer experience. And, and again, at a fundamental level, a startup can only survive by building a product that customers like, and I would see making sure the product is accessible is central to that in the first place. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 13:26)</em></strong></p></blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>Nothing about us without us</h3>
<p>The need to involve disabled people in the design process, both as internal employees but also externally, was a recurrent theme of our discussion. “Nothing about us without us” is a political slogan used historically by the disability rights movement and its simplicity acts as a useful reminder of the importance of co-design. And while the aim of accessibility is simple, in practice designing for accessibility is nuanced and can often be imperfect. Luckily, our panelists shared a number of practical tips, such as using flexible language or feature or disability aid specific when recruiting for user testing.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Mills:</strong> Nothing about us without us is like this century old political slogan that was taken up by disability activists in the 80s, and the 90s. And if you think about that phrase, initially, the goal behind it was inclusion, and self representation. So like wrenching discourse about disability away from rehabilitation specialists who weren&#8217;t disabled and centering disabled people in discussions of disability. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 14:57)</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Bennett: </strong>Part of bringing everyone to the table is recognizing that we all come to the table with histories. And it&#8217;s likely that when we work with people, they&#8217;ve probably tried to solve the problem that we think they have, in many different ways. And so sometimes, that is amplifying a solution. Or sometimes it&#8217;s recognizing there might not be a solution. But we&#8217;re here to listen, and design can be kind of an amplifier of this tension or conflict that is probably unsolvable. But that we can kind of chip away. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 17:53)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Bennett: </strong>People with disabilities need to be in all positions of power in these processes. They&#8217;re both people on the inside, but you know, also people who can give that fresh perspective from those of us who might be on the inside and remember, kind of outsider or more diverse perspectives<br />
<strong><em>(Timestamp: 18:37)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Bennett: </strong>I am a disabled person, and I&#8217;m very proud of that identity. But not everyone who experiences discrimination based on the way their body or their mind works, uses that language. So often, when I&#8217;m trying to talk to folks, I&#8217;ll use terms like chronic illness or impairment or mental health condition or the deaf community. And so I try to have educated myself and I&#8217;m still learning about the different words that people use. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 19:00)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Bennett: </strong>When you&#8217;re looking to reach out to folks I also sometimes specify the type of interaction I&#8217;m looking for. So for example, you might recruit blind people to kind of take part in a design process with you, when really maybe what you&#8217;re looking for is people who use screen readers or people who use Braille or people who use magnification. Being specific about the interaction technique or accessibility feature can help you make sure you get the more specific group that you&#8217;re looking for. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 19:36)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Madipalli: </strong>It&#8217;s really important to make sure disabled people are at the table in that decision making process, from the more kind of entrepreneurial or the industry perspective, it also just makes really good sense to make sure that the people that you are building solutions for help you co-create those solutions in the first place, just as a fundamental efficiency. If you&#8217;re trying to make your product better for disabled people, you can do that so much better if disabled people are helping you build that in the first place. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 20:17)</em></strong></p></blockquote>

<h3>How do companies avoid paying lip service to accessibility?</h3>
<p>Talk is cheap, so how do we avoid just paying lip service to accessibility? The answer is deceptively simple, have accessibility be “non-negotiable from the top down”. That includes resourcing accessibility efforts properly and incorporating it into performance reviews. And by doing this from the get-go, you have the opportunity to build an inclusive design and company culture that can scale and will last.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Bennett: </strong>[By] putting material commitments and money toward this, having accessibility be non negotiable from the top down, I&#8217;ve talked about kind of incorporating it into performance reviews, like when people are being great allies, and are incorporating accessibility, that should count and there should be consequences when that&#8217;s not happening. So I&#8217;m really into like, putting the power and the money and having consequences when it&#8217;s not happening. <strong>(Timestamp: 27:36)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Madipalli: </strong>There are decisions that can be implemented from the get go, that does create a more inclusive culture from the beginning. And when you do have that buy in from the very top from the beginning, this doesn&#8217;t have to be the afterthought. And if it is there from the beginning, hopefully that is embedded. And as the company and organization scales, this is just something that is ingrained into into the organization. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 28:42)</em></strong></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Toxic culture, deadly conspiracies and organized hate have exploded online in recent years. At TechCrunch Sessions: Justice we talked about how much responsibility social networks have in the rise of these phenomena and how to build healthy online communities that make society better, not worse with <a href="https://colorofchange.org/">Color of Change&#8217;s</a> Rashad Robinson, <a href="https://accountabletech.org/">Accountable Tech&#8217;s</a> Jesse Lehrich and Naj Austin, of <a href="https://www.somewheregood.com/">Somewhere Good</a> and <a href="https://www.ethelsclub.com/">Ethel&#8217;s Club</a>.</p>

<h3>On building intentional social spaces that cultivate positive behavior</h3>
<p id="speakable-summary">When we think of social networks, we think of the huge platforms that dominate that conversation today. But those aren&#8217;t the only models for how digital communities can grow. Alternative social networks designed with specific communities in mind could cultivate healthier, more positive experiences for the people who need those spaces most.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Austin:</strong> One of the aspects that was really important to us when we got started was size. And so one of the factors of somewhere good is kind of connecting people with smaller, more intimate communities, because people tend to behave better in smaller networks. One of the things that we use in our product meetings to kind of base a lot of our decisions off of is mimicking a real life dinner party. Who would you invite to that party? How do people interact when they&#8217;re in those kinds of smaller intimate spaces, it tends to, again, be a lot more aligned with better behavior. And then that&#8217;s, you know, that&#8217;s our perspective in terms of the many ways in which social networks can sort of be more user friendly and a multitude of ways. (1:26)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Even with Ethel&#8217;s Club, the physical location in Brooklyn, we built it out, so that it necessitated smaller, more intimate interactions with our members. And so we took that same little nugget of knowledge and used it digitally and Somewhere Good is now our technology platform that allows us to build that out on a much larger, faster scale, but still at that level of intention that people want to be connected in a more intimate manner with one another.&#8221; (2:49)</p></blockquote>

<h3>On tech industry exceptionalism</h3>
<p>Tech, in spite of its historic wealth and power, lobbying efforts, addictive products and global effects would never liken itself to something like the oil and gas or tobacco industries. But now that we&#8217;re seeing some of the society-wide ills Silicon Valley has sown, tech&#8217;s exceptionalism is looking more misguided than ever.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Robinson:</strong> I do think that in Silicon Valley, there&#8217;s&#8230; a tendency for people to be maybe a lot more impressed with themselves and impressed with their politics and impressed with their sort of like, ability to believe in something bigger&#8230;</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s a lot easier to deal with a Coca Cola where like I go in, and I know that these people think that they&#8217;re making soda, not making like a new society for all of us. And I can like, deal with the impacts of something that they&#8217;re doing. And we can all be on the same page, because they don&#8217;t think that they should get a Nobel Peace Prize. But in tech world, they people think that they can code, we can code our way out of structural racism, when in fact, the code is just amplifying structural racism. (8:15)</p></blockquote>

<h3>On lessons about online hate and disinformation from the Clinton campaign</h3>
<p>In 2021&#8217;s pandemic-ravaged world, 2016 feels like a world away but Donald Trump&#8217;s successful campaign for president, the Russian disinformation scandal and an open embrace of white supremacy in mainstream politics gave a telling glimpse of what was to come in the next four years — and beyond.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Lehrich:</strong> Did I see QAnon coming? Probably not. But did I see this, like, horrifying crawl toward more and more explicit, you know, racism that&#8217;s always been there, obviously, but had been sort of at least relegated to the corner&#8230; You know, like, out and out racists like proud to be part open out in the open being part of these kinds of communities? That was that we definitely saw that on the horizon.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t think we necessarily grappled with it the right way. I don&#8217;t know, it was a really challenging thing to try to navigate at the time, but I very much felt like something really ugly is coming. And I definitely poured every hour of my waking time during the year and a half into that campaign, in part because I was like, terrified of where the country was headed if we didn&#8217;t win the election, and everything and more that I shared has definitely come to fruition.

<h3>On how social platforms mirrored entrenched racism in society</h3>
<p>Like more traditional sectors, the tech industry is dominated by white men who have created wealth by building what they know. The industry may be ahistorical by definition, but without looking back and grappling with the ugly side of societal power structures like misogyny and white supremacy, tech is doomed to perpetuate those same inequities at scale.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Austin:</strong> I don&#8217;t think the issues we&#8217;re seeing come from the internet and social platforms being free. I think it&#8217;s deep embedded systemic problems, as Rashad mentioned, that have haunted this country since day zero, think the people that are creating these platforms are creating what they know, which is to create, patriarchal, you know, systems that live within platforms that look glossy, and have illustrations and use fun, human centric language, but at the heart of it don&#8217;t make space for what marginalized communities feel on those platforms. And so I think that&#8217;s just embedded in almost every platform we use. As Rashad mentioned, we&#8217;ve got&#8230; the fact that [Zoom] didn&#8217;t recognize that there are people who want to purely cause terror to black people and people of color, for fun — it is a big issue.

<h3>On how lived experience influences design</h3>
<p>One way to build social networks that allow a diverse range of communities flourish is to have those people in the room to begin with, building together on day one. Imagining online social spaces that feel safe and enriching is a natural process when your community has had to deal with online hate and harassment everywhere else for years.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Austin:</strong> How do you get in front of these issues that my team which is composed of black people, Latino people, Asian American people, queer people, non binary people, the things that we experience every single moment of being online and sort of a larger explanation of that, right? That can be Tumblr, it can be Twitter, it can almost be can every platform. All the things that we&#8217;ve lived through, we are saying, What if we didn&#8217;t have to? (16:35)</p></blockquote>

<h3>On how the government should hold social platforms accountable</h3>
<p>Federal and state governments are interested in cracking down on tech&#8217;s outsized power for the first time. A good place to start might be looking at tech like we already look at regulation on issues like food safety.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Robinson:</strong> We need some sort of CFPB, FDA version of infrastructure at the government level. Because anyone who has watched some of the hearings, knows that the hearings on nuclear power, or even keeping our milk safe, would look the same if we didn&#8217;t actually have government infrastructure, people who we elect to be in Congress or Senate can&#8217;t be experts on all these issues.</p>
<p>And so part of having that infrastructure is the same way I talked about having buildings that meet code. It&#8217;s not because of our elected officials or experts. It&#8217;s because we build the infrastructure at the government level, and that we actually have fines and accountability that&#8217;s at scale to make sure that they&#8217;re that they&#8217;re that there&#8217;s consequences. (22:19)</p></blockquote>
<p>The big challenge in regulating big tech companies is that they&#8217;ve become so large and so powerful that financial punishments can&#8217;t even make a dent at this point. Meaningful change needs to realign the industry&#8217;s incentives by examining the structures that allowed these companies to grow so powerful with no oversight to begin with.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Lehrich:</strong> The fundamental incentive structure around large social media platforms right now is so perverse, they are incentivized to amplify the most toxic content, disinformation, hate speech — like that stuff drives engagement. And so long as they have platforms that where they have no accountability&#8230; talking about Section 230 reform, there&#8217;s no way to hold them liable from a legal standpoint, the FTC is not hitting them with fines that really hurt them. They don&#8217;t have ends and, and there&#8217;s just no friction anywhere.</p>
<p>&#8230; Until we fundamentally, fundamentally upend that incentive structure, they&#8217;re gonna continue profiting off hate and distortion and deceit and delusion and discrimination. And that&#8217;s just the reality.&#8221; (24:39)</p></blockquote>
