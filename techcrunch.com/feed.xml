					<description><![CDATA[CEO Shishir Mehrotra and Madrona partner S. Somasegar joined Extra Crunch Live to discuss Coda's pitch doc -- and give live feedback on pitches from the audience.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coda entered the market with an ambitious, but simple, mission. Since launching in 2014, it has seemingly forged a path to realizing its vision with $140 million in funding and 25,000 teams across the globe using the platform.</p>
<p>Coda is simple in that its focus is on the document, one of the oldest content formats/tools on the internet, and indeed in the history of software. Its ambition lies in the fact that there are massive incumbents in this space, like Google and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Shishir Mehrotra told TechCrunch that that level of competition wasn&#8217;t a hindrance, mainly because the company was very good at communicating its value and building highly effective flywheels for growth.</p>
<p>Mehrotra was generous enough to let us take a look through his pitch doc (not deck!) on a recent episode of Extra Crunch Live, diving not only into the factors that have made Coda successful, but how he communicated those factors to investors.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167195" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167195" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2167195" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-4.43.21-PM.png" alt="Coda Pitch Doc" width="1024" height="563" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-4.43.21-PM.png 1822w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-4.43.21-PM.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-4.43.21-PM.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-4.43.21-PM.png?resize=768,422 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-4.43.21-PM.png?resize=680,374 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-4.43.21-PM.png?resize=1536,845 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-4.43.21-PM.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167195" class="wp-caption-text">A screenshot from Coda&#8217;s pitch doc.</p></div></p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live also features the ECL Pitch-off, where founders in the audience come &#8220;onstage&#8221; to pitch their products to our guests. Mehrotra and his investor, Madrona partner S. Somasegar, gave their live feedback on pitches from the audience, which you can check out in the video (full conversation and pitch-off) below.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Extra Crunch Live takes place every Wednesday at 3 p.m. EDT/noon PDT. Anyone can hang out during the episode (which includes networking with other attendees), but access to past episodes is reserved exclusively for Extra Crunch members. Join <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe">here</a>.</p>
<h2>The soft circle</h2>
<p>Like many investors and founders, Mehrotra and Somasegar met well before Mehrotra was working on his own project. They met when both of them worked at Microsoft and maintained a relationship while Mehrotra was at Google.</p>
<p>In their earliest time together, the conversations centered around advice on the Seattle tech ecosystem or on working with a particular team at Microsoft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many people will tell you building relationships with investors … you want to do it outside of a fundraise as much as possible,&#8221; said Mehrotra.</p>
<p>Eventually, Mehrotra got to work on Coda and kept in touch with Somasegar. He even pitched him for Series B fundraising &#8212; and ultimately got a no. But the relationship persisted.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">According to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinehaskins1/new-law-restrict-stingray-surveillance-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1"><em>BuzzFeed News</em></a>, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden and Representative Ted Lieu will introduce legislation later today that seeks to restrict police use of international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) catchers. More commonly known as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-12-edmonton-police-stingray.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">Stingrays</a>, police frequently use IMSI catchers and cell-site simulators to collect information on suspects and intercept calls, SMS messages and other forms of communication. Law enforcement agencies in the US currently do not require a warrant to use the technology. The Cell-Site Simulator Act of 2021 seeks to change that.</p>
<p>IMSI catchers mimic cell towers to trick mobile phones into connecting with them. Once connected, they can collect data a device sends out, including its location and subscriber identity key. Cell-site simulators pose a two-fold problem.</p>
<p>The first is that they&#8217;re surveillance blunt instruments. When used in a populated area, IMSI catchers can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-21-court-stingray-without-warrant-violates-fourth-amendment.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">collect data from bystanders</a>. The second is that they can also pose a safety risk to the public. The reason for this is that while IMSI catchers act like a cell tower, they don&#8217;t function as one, and they can&#8217;t transfer calls to a public wireless network. They can therefore prevent a phone from connecting to 9-1-1. Despite the dangers they pose, their use is widespread. In 2018, the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/stingray-tracking-devices-whos-got-them" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">American Civil Liberties Union found</a> at least 75 agencies in 27 states and the District of Columbia owned IMSI catchers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In trying to address those concerns, the proposed legislation would make it so that law enforcement agencies would need to make a case before a judge on why they should be allowed to use the technology. They would also need to explain why other surveillance methods wouldn&#8217;t be as effective. Moreover, it seeks to ensure those agencies delete any data they collect from those not listed on a warrant.</p>
<p>Although the bill reportedly doesn&#8217;t lay out a time limit on IMSI catcher use, it does push agencies to use the devices for the least amount of time possible. It also details exceptions where police could use the technology without a warrant. For instance, it would leave the door open for law enforcement to use the devices in contexts like bomb threats where an IMSI catcher can prevent a remote detonation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our bipartisan bill ends the secrecy and uncertainty around Stingrays and other cell-site simulators and replaces it with clear, transparent rules for when the government can use these invasive surveillance devices,&#8221; Senator Ron Wyden told <em>BuzzFeed News</em>.</p>
<p>The bill has support from some Republicans. Senator Steve Daines of Montana and Representative Tom McClintock of California are co-sponsoring the proposed legislation. Organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Electronic Privacy Information Center have also endorsed the bill.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lately, Snapchat&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/everyone-you-know-is-a-disney-princess-which-means-ar-is-queen/?tpcc=ECTW2020">3D Cartoon lens</a> has been all the buzz, making all of our friends look like Pixar characters. But since 2013, a staple filter on the ephemeral photo sharing app has been the speed filter, which shows how fast a phone is moving when it takes a photo or video. Today, Snapchat confirmed that it will pull the filter from the app.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/17/1007385955/snapchat-ends-speed-filter-that-critics-say-encouraged-reckless-driving">NPR first reported this today</a>, calling it a &#8220;dramatic reversal&#8221; of Snap&#8217;s earlier defense of the feature. Over the years, there have been <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/accidents/snapchat-video-appears-to-show-driver-going-115-mph-on-night-of-crash-that/2300400/#">multiple car accidents</a>, <a href="https://abc11.com/action-news-investigation-snapchat-fatal-car-crash-philadelphia/1198049/">injuries</a>, and <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article229028219.html">deaths</a> that were related to the use of the filter. In 2016, for instance, an eighteen-year-old took a Snapchat selfie while driving, then struck another driver&#8217;s car at 107 miles per hour. The other driver, Maynard Wentworth, suffered traumatic brain injuries and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/28/snapchats-speed-filter-cited-in-lawsuit-following-atlanta-highway-crash/">sued Snap</a>. His lawyer said that the eighteen-year-old &#8220;was just trying to get the car to 100 miles per hour to post it on Snapchat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snapchat&#8217;s filter-related offenses don&#8217;t begin and end here. Last year on Juneteenth, a day that commemorates the end of slavery, Snapchat released a filter that prompted users to &#8220;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/19/21296713/snapchat-juneteenth-filter-smile-chains-controversial">smile to break the chains</a>.&#8221; On 4/20 in 2016, Snapchat partnered with Bob Marley&#8217;s estate to release a feature that gave users dreadlocks and darker skin, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/20/snapchats-new-bob-marley-filter-prompts-blackface-backlash/">committing blackface</a>. And even after Snapchat&#8217;s speed filter was linked to fatal car accidents, it remained available in the app with a simple &#8220;don&#8217;t snap and drive&#8221; warning.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Today the sticker is barely used by Snapchatters, and in light of that, we are removing it altogether,&#8221; a spokesperson from Snap said, adding that the feature had previously been disabled at driving speeds. The company has begun removing the filter, but it might take several weeks to take full effect.</p>
<p>This new stance from Snap comes after the Ninth Circuit Appeals Court found in May that the company can be sued for its role in a fatal car accident.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Generally, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/section-230-bills-algorithms-congress-hearing/">Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> protects websites, or &#8220;interactive computer services,&#8221; from lawsuits like this, providing immunity for these platforms from third-party content posted on them. But in 2019, the parents of two children killed in crashes – Landen Brown and Hunter Morby – filed another lawsuit. They argued that the app&#8217;s &#8220;negligent design&#8221; (including a speed filter to begin with) contributed to the crash. A California judge dismissed the case, citing Section 230, but in May of this year, three judges on the federal Ninth Circuit Appeals Court ruled that Section 230 actually </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2021/05/04/20-55295.pdf">doesn&#8217;t apply here</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. The conflict isn&#8217;t with Snapchat&#8217;s role as a social media platform, but rather, the app&#8217;s design, which includes a demonstrably dangerous speed filter.</span></p>
<p>So, the sudden removal of the speed filter isn&#8217;t as random as it may seem. Now that their Section 230 defense is no longer, it makes sense that keeping the filter isn&#8217;t worth the legal risk. You&#8217;d think that the filter-related accidents would have been enough for Snapchat to take down the filter years ago, but better late than never.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Robotic process automation (RPA) is rapidly moving beyond the early adoption phase across verticals. Automating just basic workflow processes has resulted in such tremendous efficiency improvements and cost savings that businesses are adapting automation at scale and across the enterprise.</p>
<p>While there is a technical component to robotic automation, RPA is not a traditional IT-driven solution. It is, however, still important to align the business and IT processes around RPA. Adapting business automation for the enterprise should be approached as a business solution that happens to require some technical support.</p>
<p>A strong working relationship between the CFO and CIO will go a long way in getting IT behind, and in support of, the initiative rather than in front of it.</p>

			A strong working relationship between the CFO and CIO will go a long way in getting IT behind, and in support of, the initiative rather than in front of it.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>More important to the success of a large-scale RPA initiative is support from senior business executives across all lines of business and at every step of the project, with clear communications and an advocacy plan all the way down to LOB managers and employees.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve seen in real-world examples, successful campaigns for deploying automation at scale require a systematic approach to developing a vision, gathering stakeholder and employee buy-in, identifying use cases, building a center of excellence (CoE) and establishing a governance model.</p>
<h2>Create an overarching vision</h2>
<p>Your strategy should include defining measurable, strategic objectives. Identify strategic areas that benefit most from automation, such as the supply chain, call centers, AP or revenue cycle, and start with obvious areas where business sees delays due to manual workflow processes. Remember, the goal is not to replace employees; you&#8217;re aiming to speed up processes, reduce errors, increase efficiencies and let your employees focus on higher value tasks.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The biggest tech companies have put a lot of time and money into building tools and platforms for their data science teams and those who work with them to glean insights and metrics out of the masses of data that their companies produce: how a company is performing, how a new feature is working, when something is broken, or when something might be selling well (and why) are all things you can figure out if you know how to read the data.</p>
<p>Now, three alums that worked with data in the world of big tech have founded a startup that aims to build a &#8220;metrics store&#8221; so that the rest of the enterprise world &#8212; much of which lacks the resources to build tools like this from scratch &#8212; can easily use metrics to figure things out like this, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://transform.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transform</a>, as the startup is called, is coming out of stealth today, and it&#8217;s doing so with an impressive amount of early backing &#8212; a sign not just of investor confidence in these particular founders, but also the recognition that there is a gap in the market for, as the company describes it, a &#8220;single source of truth for business data&#8221; that could be usefully filled.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is announcing that it has closed, while in stealth, a Series A of $20 million, and an earlier seed round of $4.5 million &#8212; both led by Index Ventures and Redpoint Ventures. The seed, the company said, also had dozens of angel investors, with the list including Elad Gil of Color Genomics, Lenny Rachitsky of Airbnb and Cristina Cordova of Notion.</p>
<p>The big breakthrough that Transform has made is that it&#8217;s built a metrics engine that a company can apply to its structured data &#8212; a tool similar to what big tech companies have built for their own use, but that hasn&#8217;t really been created (at least until now) for others who are not those big tech companies to use, too.</p>
<p>Transform can work with vast troves of data from the warehouse, or data that is being tracked in real time, to generate insights and analytics about different actions around a company&#8217;s products. Transform can be used and queried by non-technical people who still have to deal with data, Handel said.</p>
<p>The impetus for building the product came to Nick Handel, James Mayfield and Paul Yang &#8212; respectively Transform&#8217;s CEO, COO and software engineer &#8212; when they all worked together at Airbnb (previously Mayfield and Yang were also at Facebook together) in a mix of roles that included product management and engineering.</p>
<p>There, they could see first-hand both the promise that data held for helping make decisions around a product, or for measuring how something is used, or to plan future features, but also the demands of harnessing it to work, and getting everyone on the same page to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a growing trend among tech companies to test every single feature, every single iteration of whatever. And so as a part of that, we built this tool [at Airbnb] that basically allowed you to define the various metrics that you wanted to track to understand your experiment,&#8221; Handel recalled in an interview. &#8220;But you also want to understand so many other things like, how many people are searching for listings in certain areas? How many people are instantly booking those listings? Are they contacting customer service, are they having trust and safety issues?&#8221; The tool Airbnb built was <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/how-airbnb-achieved-metric-consistency-at-scale-f23cc53dea70" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minerva</a>, optimised specifically for the kinds of questions Airbnb might typically have for its own data.</p>
<p>&#8220;By locking down all of the definitions for the metrics, you could basically have a data engineering team, a centralized data infrastructure team, do all the calculation for these metrics, and then serve those to the data scientists to then go in and do kind of deeper, more interesting work, because they weren&#8217;t bogged down in calculating those metrics over and over,&#8221; he continued. This platform evolved within Airbnb. &#8220;We were we were really inspired by some of the early work that we saw happen on this tool.&#8221;</p>
<p>The issue is that not every company is built to, well, build tools like these tailored to whatever their own business interests might be.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a handful of companies who do similar things in the metrics space,&#8221; Mayfield said, &#8220;really top flight companies like LinkedIn, Airbnb and Uber. They have really started to invest in metrics. But it&#8217;s only those companies that can devote teams of eight or 10, engineers, designers who can build those things in house. And I think that was probably, you know, a big part of the impetus for wanting to start this company was to say, not every organization is going to be able to devote eight or 10 engineers to building this metrics tool.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the other issue is that metrics have become an increasingly important &#8212; maybe the most important &#8212; lever for decision making in the world of product design and wider business strategy for a tech (and maybe by default, any) company.</p>
<p>We have moved away from &#8220;move fast and break things.&#8221; Instead, we now embrace &#8212; as Mayfield put it &#8212; &#8220;If you can&#8217;t measure it, you can&#8217;t move it.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167627" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167627" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2167627" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/introducing-flow.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="212" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/introducing-flow.png 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/introducing-flow.png?resize=150,47 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/introducing-flow.png?resize=300,93 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/introducing-flow.png?resize=768,239 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/introducing-flow.png?resize=680,212 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/introducing-flow.png?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167627" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://transform.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transform <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Transform is built around three basic priorities, Handel said.</p>
<p>The first of these has to do with collective ownership of metrics: by building a single framework for measuring these and identifying them, their theory is that it&#8217;s easier for a company to all get on the same page with using them. The second of these is to use Transform to simply make the work of the data team more efficient and easier, by turning the most repetitive parts of extracting insights into automated scripts that can be used and reused, giving the data team the ability to spend more time analyzing the data rather than just building datasets. And third of all, to provide customers with APIs that they can use to embed the metric-extracting tools into other applications, whether in business intelligence or elsewhere.</p>
<p>The three products it&#8217;s introducing today, called Metrics Framework, Metrics Catalog and Metrics API follow from these principles.</p>
<p>Transform is only really launching publicly today, but Handel said that it&#8217;s already working with a small handful of customers (unnamed) in a small beta, enough to be confident that what it&#8217;s built works as it was intended. The funding will be used to continue building out the product as well as bring on more talent and hopefully onboard more businesses to using it.</p>
<p>Hopefully might be less a tenuous word than its investors would use, convinced that it&#8217;s filling a strong need in the market.</p>
<p class="p3">“Transform is filling a critical gap within the industry. Just as we invested in Looker early on for its innovative approach to business intelligence, Transform takes it one step further by providing a powerful yet streamlined single source of truth for metrics,” said Tomasz Tungis, MD, Redpoint Ventures, in a statement.</p>
<p class="p3">“We’ve seen companies across the globe struggle to make sense of endless data sources or turn them into actionable, trusted metrics. We invested in Transform because they’ve developed an elegant solution to this problem that will change how companies think about their data,” added Shardul Shah, a partner at Index Ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The AI-powered defense company founded by tech iconoclast Palmer Luckey has landed a $450 million round of investment that values the startup at $4.6 billion just four years in.</p>
<p>In April, reports suggested that the company was <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/anduril-raising-new-round-that-will-double-valuation-to-over-4-billion">on the hunt for fresh investment</a> and headed for a valuation between four and five billion, up from $1.9 billion in July 2020.</p>
<p>The new Series D round was led by angel investor and serial entrepreneur Elad Gil, a former Twitter VP and Googler with a track record of investments in companies with exponential growth. Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund, 8VC, General Catalyst, Lux Capital, Valor Equity Partners and D1 Capital Partners also participated in the round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Just as old incumbent institutions with little to no organizational renewal impacted our ability to respond to COVID, the defense industry has undergone significant consolidation over the last 30 years,&#8221; Gil wrote in a <a href="http://blog.eladgil.com/2021/06/anduril-defense-tech.html?m=1">blog post on the investment</a>. &#8220;There has not been a new defense technology company of any scale to directly challenge these incumbents in many decades&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Anduril <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/anduril-palmer-luckeys-secretive-defense-company-is-booming-under-trump">launched quietly in 2017 but grew quickly</a>, picking up contracts with Customs and Border Protection and the Marine Corps during the Trump administration. Luckey, the young high-flying founder who sold Oculus to Facebook before being booted from the company, emerged as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/16/palmer-luckey-to-host-trump-fundraiser-in-southern-california.html">one of President Trump&#8217;s most prominent boosters</a> in the generally Trump-averse tech industry.</p>
<p>The company makes defense hardware, including long-flying drones and surveillance towers that connect to a shared software platform it calls Lattice. The technology can be used to secure military bases, monitor borders and even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20898931/anduril-anvil-drone-footage-palmer-luckey-quadcopter">knock enemy drones out of the sky</a>, in the case of Anduril&#8217;s counter-UAS tech known as &#8220;Anvil.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anduril co-founder and CEO Brian Schimpf describes the company&#8217;s mission as one of &#8220;transformation,&#8221; pairing relatively affordable hardware with sensor fusion and machine learning technologies through a contract partner more nimble than established giants in the defense sector.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new round of funding reflects our confidence that the Department of Defense sees the same problems we do, and is serious about deploying emerging technologies at scale across land, sea, air, and space domains,&#8221; Schimpf said.</p>

<p>The company set its sights on work with the Department of Defense from its earliest days and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/anduril-air-force-abms-jadc2/">last year was one of 50 vendors tapped by the DoD</a> to test tech for the Air Force&#8217;s own piece of the Joint All-Domain Command &amp; Control (JADC2) project, which seeks to build a smart warfare platform to connect all service members, devices and vehicles that power the U.S. military.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/anduril-palmer-luckeys-defense-company-tests-its-tech-at-the-us-canada-border"> work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection</a> also matured from a pilot into a program of record last year. Anduril supplies the agency with connected surveillance towers capable of autonomously monitoring stretches of the U.S. border.</p>
<p>In April, <a href="https://medium.com/anduril-blog/anduril-industries-acquires-area-i-adds-altius-capabilities-to-hardware-portfolio-36633ebcc73b">Anduril acquired Area-I</a>, a company known for small drones that can be launched from a larger aircraft. Area-I counted the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy and NASA among its customers, relationships that likely sweetened the deal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Krafton, which filed for an IPO earlier this week, has built a gigantic gaming empire. If the firm is able to raise the target $5 billion from the IPO it will be the largest public offering in its home country, South Korea. The firm has something to celebrate elsewhere in the world, too.</p>
<p>On Thursday, it pulled off another feat that no other firm has been able to achieve: Its sleeper hit title, PUBG Mobile, has made a return to India, which banned the title more than nine months ago.</p>
<p>The world&#8217;s second-largest internet market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/india-bans-pubg-and-over-100-additional-chinese-apps/">banned over 200 apps last year</a> citing national security concerns. All the apps New Delhi blocked in the nation had links to China. The move was seen by many as retaliation as tension between the two nuclear-armed neighboring nations escalated last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Every other app that has been banned by India &#8212; and pulled by Google and Apple from their respective app stores in the country in compliance with local government orders &#8212; remains in that state. ByteDance, whose TikTok app identified India as its largest market, has significantly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/bytedance-to-cut-jobs-in-india-amid-tiktok-ban/">downsized its team in the country</a>. (ByteDance runs several businesses in India and many remain operational. Employees have been instructed to stay off the radar.)</p>
<p>Which is what makes PUBG Mobile’s return to India all the more interesting. The game, which has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/krafton-announces-pubg-mobile-india-return-under-battlegrounds-mobile-title/">rebranded to Battlegrounds Mobile India</a> in the South Asia market, is available to download from the Play Store for any user in the country &#8212; provided they sign up for an early access before the imminent launch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YuEX3INeFn"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/krafton-announces-pubg-mobile-india-return-under-battlegrounds-mobile-title/">PUBG Mobile to relaunch as Battlegrounds Mobile in India</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;PUBG Mobile to relaunch as Battlegrounds Mobile in India&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/krafton-announces-pubg-mobile-india-return-under-battlegrounds-mobile-title/embed/#?secret=YuEX3INeFn" data-secret="YuEX3INeFn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Even as PUBG Mobile is now using a different moniker, the game follows the same plot, and the identical home screen greets users with the familiar ecstatic background score.</p>
<p>Moreover, users are offered a quick and straightforward option to migrate their PUBG Mobile accounts to the new app.</p>
<p>Rishi Alwani, the quintessential gaming reporter in India who edits <a href="https://in.ign.com">IGN India</a>, told TechCrunch that the new game is “essentially PUBG Mobile with data compliance, green blood, and a constant reminder that you’re in a ‘virtual world’ with such messaging present as you start a game and when you’re in menus.”</p>
<p>The changes are likely Krafton’s attempt to assuage <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/pubg-video-game-arrests-india-ban">previous concerns</a> from the local authorities, some of whom had expressed concerns about the game’s affect on youngsters.</p>

<p>But these on-the-surface changes raise a set of bigger questions that have been a topic of discussion among several startup founders and policy executives in India in recent months:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did the government of India approve the new game?</li>
<li>If not, why has Google permitted the app on the Play Store?</li>
<li>Assuming the Indian government has approved the new game, what steps did Krafton take that adequately addressed the Indian government’s concerns?</li>
<li>Why has no other app been able to make a return to India so far?</li>
</ul>
<p>Neither the Indian government nor Krafton have publicly said anything on this subject. Krafton, on its part, has taken steps to assuage India’s concerns. For instance, last year the South Korean firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/pubg-cuts-publishing-ties-with-tencent-games-in-india-a-week-after-ban/">cut ties with its publishing partner Tencent</a>, the only visible Chinese affiliation &#8212; if the Indian government was indeed banning just Chinese apps. Krafton also publicly announced that it will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/pubg-mobile-announces-return-to-india-new-game-100-million-investment/">investing $100 million in India’s gaming ecosystem</a>.</p>
<p>The Indian government’s order and the communication and compliance mechanism for concerned entities have been so opaque on this subject that it is unclear on what grounds Krafton has been able to bring the game back.</p>
<p>One explanation &#8212; albeit admittedly full of speculation &#8212; is that it’s a new app in the sense that it has a new app ID. In this instance, it happens to have a new developer account, too. Remember, India banned apps, and not the firms themselves. Several Tencent and Alibaba apps, for instance, remain available in India.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;6 investors on 2021&#8217;s mobile gaming trends and opportunities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/6-investors-on-2021s-mobile-gaming-trends-and-opportunities/embed/#?secret=9PF1jBTCPq" data-secret="9PF1jBTCPq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This would also explain how BIGO has been able to launch a new app &#8212; Tiki Video &#8212; under a new developer account and plenty of effort to conceal its connection. That app, which was launched in late February, has amassed over 16 million monthly active users, according to mobile insight firm App Annie. The app’s existence and affiliation with BIGO have not been previously reported.</p>
<p>But the question remains, are these simple workarounds enough to escape the ban? To be sure, some apps, including Battlegrounds Mobile India, are also hosting their data in the country now, and have agreed for periodic audits. So is that enough? And if it is, why aren&#8217;t most &#8212; if not all &#8212; apps making a return to India?</p>
<p>Regardless, the return of PUBG Mobile India is a welcome move for tens of millions of users in the country, many of whom &#8212; about 38 million last month, according to App Annie &#8212; were using workarounds themselves to continue to play the game.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[At TC Sessions: Mobility 2021, Revel CEO and co-founder Frank Reig, Remix CEO and co-founder Tiffany Chu, and lawyer Tamika L. Butler discussed how mobility companies should think about equity.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobility should be a right, but too often it&#8217;s a privilege. Can startups provide the technology and the systems necessary to help correct this injustice? Shared micromobility, in particular, offers an opportunity for more equitable and accessible mobility within cities, but only if done intentionally. Building equity and accessibility into the business model is not always top of mind for startups looking to pay back investors and make money, and it&#8217;s a time-consuming task. Is it still possible to achieve those goals while remaining profitable?</p>
<p>At our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021?promo=leftrail&amp;display=true">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> event, I sat down with Revel CEO and co-founder Frank Reig, Remix CEO and co-founder Tiffany Chu, and community organizer, transportation consultant and lawyer Tamika L. Butler to discuss how mobility companies should think about equity, why incorporating it from the get-go will save money in the long run, and how they can partner with cities to expand accessible and sustainable mobility.</p>
<h2><strong>What does equity mean?</strong></h2>
<p>Shared mobility services have often directly appealed to the young, able-bodied and affluent, especially when they first dropped into cities around the world. Older populations and communities of color have been less likely to either have access to or to use shared mobility services, but that&#8217;s beginning to change. As mobility startups consider how to weigh providing equitable service while maintaining a profit, Butler outlined the importance of thinking about those who are most vulnerable.</p>
<blockquote><p>Who isn&#8217;t this helping? And it doesn&#8217;t matter if that&#8217;s a small amount of people, right? So you might say something like, people with disabilities might be proportionally a smaller number of people, Black people might be proportionally a smaller number of people. But if you make things better for folks with a disability, say, by adding curb cuts into sidewalks, that actually makes things better for a ton of people. And so you may be thinking of it … only helping a small group of people. And I think we really have to shift the way we think about equity. It&#8217;s not just numbers, who is this going to help the most, it&#8217;s … who is often intentionally neglected or pushed aside because their numbers aren&#8217;t big enough? <em><strong>(</strong></em><em><strong>Timestamp: 19:10)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<h2><strong>Build equity into the business model from the start</strong></h2>
<p>Many startups are just trying to keep their idea alive and start a business at the beginning. They want to solve an essential problem, like lack of socially distanced mobility options, and prove their unit economics so they don&#8217;t come back to their investors empty handed. Some companies might even be of the mindset that building equity and accessibility into their business model isn&#8217;t their concern. But delivering on those core values will just be the price of doing business in the future, so it certainly should be their concern, Butler said.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think for companies, I would say that people like to say it takes too much time or costs too much money to do things equitably. But whether or not you&#8217;re retrofitting a house or whether or not you&#8217;re retrofitting your company, whenever you retrofit something, it costs more money. And so if you think about equity as something you just build in from the beginning, it will actually save you money and take less time than if you try to do it later because someone tells you to do it or you&#8217;ve had some controversy or you all of a sudden feel bad. <em><strong>(</strong></em><em><strong>Timestamp: 4:50)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<p>Reig chimed in to talk about Revel&#8217;s access program, which gives 50% off to riders who are on any form of public assistance.</p>
<blockquote><p>So the access program, for instance, was something from day one. That wasn&#8217;t something we added in a year or two later after venture funding … that was still when we were bootstraped, you know, a company in North Brooklyn with 70 mopeds. From day one, I&#8217;ve never used the gig economy, customer service agent mechanic battery swapper, from day one, every single person on the team is a regular employee. And I think that&#8217;s just a cultural ethos I&#8217;ve always wanted in the company. <em><strong>(</strong></em><em><strong>Timestamp: 6:04)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://vitosha.vc">Vitosha Venture Partners</a> is a brand new venture fund launching out of Bulgaria, and backed by the Bulgarian government. The 26 million euro ($30M) fund aims to invest in approximately 100 companies, starting from low ticket sizes all the way up to a million, in early-stage and growth-stage companies that are based in or related to Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Vitosha will be co-financed by the European Structural and Investment Funds under the Operational Programme for Innovation and Competitiveness 2014-2020, managed by the Fund of Funds in Bulgaria. Beyond standard VC conventions, it will also back companies that matter for the growth, sustainability, and development of the local economy in Bulgaria and the Central European region.</p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call, co-founder Max Gurvits said: “Bulgaria and this whole region of South-eastern Europe is a very early ecosystem. The cool thing that&#8217;s happening here and that&#8217;s something we&#8217;re excited about and proud of is that because Bulgaria started a little earlier in tech than the neighboring countries, it&#8217;s still very early, but there are 1000s of people now in startups.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He added: &#8220;I do think that in Bulgaria, something like the emergence of a unicorn-like UIPath might happen in the next two or three years. So we&#8217;re slowly but surely catching up.”</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of FoodTech / AgTech here, there there&#8217;s a lot of connected hardware manufacturing like electric bicycles. While those companies might not be groundbreaking or world-changing they are  actually quite solid fast-growing businesses that have a pretty high probability of exiting for 2x 3x 4x 5x or more.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Canoo, the electric vehicle startup that recently became a publicly traded company through a merger with a SPAC, plans to build a factory in Oklahoma that will employ up to 2,000 workers, newly appointed CEO Tony Aquila said Thursday during the company&#8217;s investor day presentation.</p>
<p>The factory will be located on a 400-acre site in the MidAmerica Industrial Park in Pryor, Oklahoma about 45 minutes from Tulsa. The facility, which the company describes as a &#8220;mega microfactory&#8221; will include a paint, body shop and general assembly plant and is expected to open in 2023. The site is near a number of manufacturing and logistics businesses, Aquila noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a hub that we think is going to grow like crazy,&#8221; Aquila said at the event. &#8220;In addition to that, it puts you dead center for logistics and movement across North America, so you can get anywhere, same day and back is pretty important.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Canoo, which has said it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/canoos-electric-microbus-will-start-under-35000-when-it-comes-to-market-next-year/">deliver its first EV</a> in the fourth quarter of 2022, also announced it is partnering with Netherlands-based contract manufacturer VDL Nedcar to handle initial production while the factory is being built.</p>
<p>Canoo&#8217;s announcement comes nearly a year after Oklahoma lost its bid to convince Tesla to build its next factory in the state. Tesla ultimately <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/tesla-picks-austin-for-its-next-u-s-factory-to-build-cybertruck-semi-truck-model-y/">picked a site near Austin</a> for the factory, which it has said will produce the Cybertruck, the Tesla Semi and the Model Y and Model 3 for sales to customers on the East Coast.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re super pumped — we think we are the flavor of the month and we are the right place for manufacturing,&#8221; Gov. Kevin Stitt said, noting that the state has the lowest electricity costs in the entire country. Those lower rates have helped attract companies like Google, which operates a data center in Pryor.</p>
<p>Canoo&#8217;s investor day featured a variety of engineers, designers and executives all of whom focused on certain aspects of the company&#8217;s vision. Canoo is focused on products for consumers and commercial customers. All of Canoo&#8217;s EVs will share the same skateboard and use different cabins or &#8220;top hats&#8221; that can be paired to create unique vehicles. The company has unveiled several vehicles, including an electric microbus, a pickup and one designed for business-to-business applications. The company has scaled up its workforce to about 435 people as of the end of the first quarter of 2021 and plans to expand to 690 people by the end of the year, according to CTO Pete Savagian.</p>
<p>It was also the first major public event with Aquila steering the company that has had a bumpy ride in the past year.</p>
<p>Canoo started as Evelozcity in 2017, founded by former Faraday Future executives Stefan Krause and Ulrich Kranz. The company rebranded as Canoo in spring 2019 and debuted its first vehicle several months later. The unique-looking vehicle and Canoo&#8217;s initial plan to offer it only as a subscription helped the company gain the attention of investors and the media. Canoo even landed a <a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2982">partnership with Hyundai</a> to co-develop EVs, but that deal fell apart earlier this year after the company changed its business model and decided to not offer engineering services to other automakers, according to comments made in March by Aquila.</p>
<p>Canoo also lost its cofounders, first Krause, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/apple-confirms-hiring-of-ulrich-kranz-former-ceo-of-ev-company-canoo/">more recently Kranz</a>. And in May, the company disclosed that is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The investigation is broad and covers the special purpose acquisition company Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp.&#8217;s initial public offering and merger with Canoo, the company&#8217;s operations, business model, revenues, revenue strategy, customer agreements, earnings and other related topics, along with the recent departures of certain of the company&#8217;s officers, according to a quarterly earnings report posted May 17.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Apple’s location devices — called AirTags — have been out for more than a month now. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/first-findings-with-apples-new-airtag-location-devices/">initial impressions</a> were good, but as we concluded back in April: “It will be interesting to see these play out once AirTags are out getting lost in the wild.”</p>
<p>That’s exactly what our resident UX analyst, <a href="http://builtformars.com">Peter Ramsey</a>, has been doing for the last month — intentionally losing AirTags to test their user experience at the limits.</p>
<p>This Extra Crunch exclusive is a simplified conversation around <a href="https://builtformars.com/case-studies/apple-airtags">this Built for Mars article</a>, which helps bridge the gap between Apple’s mistakes and how you can make meaningful changes to your product’s UX.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			For an industry that’s often soured by privacy concerns, Apple has an unusually strong stance on keeping your data private.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>AirTag not reachable</h2>
<p>There are two primary purposes of an error message:</p>
<ol>
<li>To notify the user what has gone wrong (and how it affects them).</li>
<li>To help the user resolve the issue.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most businesses do a decent job at the first one, but it’s rare that a product will proactively obsess over the second.</p>
<p>Typically, Apple is one of the few examples that <em>do </em>— it’s indisputably one of the leaders in intuitive design. Which is why I was surprised to see Apple’s error message when an AirTag is not reachable:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166507" style="width: 892px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166507" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2166507" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AirTag-image-1.jpg" alt="" width="882" height="740" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AirTag-image-1.jpg 882w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AirTag-image-1.jpg?resize=150,126 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AirTag-image-1.jpg?resize=300,252 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AirTag-image-1.jpg?resize=768,644 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AirTag-image-1.jpg?resize=680,571 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AirTag-image-1.jpg?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166507" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Built for Mars screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>There’s a huge amount of ambiguity in the statement “move around to connect,” and it fails to mention that this error <em>could be</em> because the AirTag’s batteries have been removed.</p>
<p>Instead, Apple should make this message clickable, which opens a modal to learn more about this issue.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://wise.com">Wise</a>, the fintech company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/wise/">formerly known</a> as TransferWise, has announced that it wants to become a public company on the London Stock Exchange. Instead of following the traditional IPO route, Wise plans to go public via a direct listing. This is going to be the biggest direct listing on the London Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Wise, the company specializes in cross-border money transfers. If you want to send money to someone living in another country, traditional retail banks charge a lot in foreign exchange fees, foreign transaction fees, etc.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some well-known alternative options, such as Western Union and MoneyGram. While those companies provide some convenient on-ramp and off-ramp methods, they’re still more expensive than Wise.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Wise, users first upload money to their Wise account using a bank transfer or a debit card. They can then send money in another currency to a recipient’s bank account. The company tries to be as transparent and upfront as possible when it comes to fixed and variable fees.</p>
<p>Originally founded in 2011, Wise has grown quite a lot as its revenue grew from $422 million to $586 million in its most recent financial year (from £303 million to £421 million respectively). It represents $57 million (£41 million) in profit before tax — the company says it has been profitable since 2017.</p>
<p>Overall, Wise has 10 million customers who process around $7 billion (£5 billion) in cross-border transactions every month. More recently, the company diversified its revenue by adding new products.</p>
<p>For instance, customers can hold money in 56 currencies in their Wise accounts. They get account numbers in 10 different currencies as well as a debit card. This feature is particularly useful for freelancers who want to accept payments in another country or people moving abroad for a year or two.</p>
<p>The company has also expanded beyond B2C with Wise Business. Those accounts work a bit like regular Wise accounts, but with multiple users and additional features. Wise also powers cross-border transactions in third-party services, such as Monzo and N26.</p>
<p>Opting for a direct listing is an interesting move. A few companies have chosen direct listings in the U.S., such as Spotify, Coinbase and Slack. It means that you’re confident there’ll be enough interests from investors as banks aren’t helping you with your introduction.</p>
<p>It also means that Wise doesn’t need more money as a direct listing doesn’t let you raise additional capital.</p>
<p>Like many tech companies, Wise plans to introduce a dual-class share structure, which means that all of Wise’s existing shareholders will get more votes per share for a while. This is going to be an important listing for the European fintech scene and also for the British tech ecosystem. Now, let’s see how investors feel about Wise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Free money from the government sounds like winning the lottery, but the reality is that most tech startups and even local retail businesses and restaurants can potentially qualify for tax credits related to research and development in the United States. Those credits, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/04/amazon-had-to-pay-federal-income-taxes-for-the-first-time-since-2016.html">which is what helps tech giants keep their tax rates to near zero</a>, are hard for smaller companies to receive because of extensive documentation requirements and potential audit costs.</p>
<p>So a number of startups have been launched to solve that gap, and now, larger companies are entering the fray as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://gusto.com">Gusto</a>, which started off with payroll for SMBs and has since expanded into employee on-boarding, insurance, benefits, and other HR offerings, today announced that it is acquiring <a href="https://ardius.com">Ardius</a>, a startup designed to automate tax compliance particularly around R&amp;D tax credits.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Los Angeles-based company was founded by Joshua Lee <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ardius">in 2018</a>, who previously had worked for more than a decade at accounting firm EY. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, and Ardius will run as an independent business with the entire team transitioning to Gusto.</p>
<p>The strategy here is simple: most R&amp;D credits require payroll documentation, data that is already stored in Gusto’s system of record. Ardius in its current incarnation was designed to tap into a number of payroll data providers and extract that data and turn it into verifiable tax documents. With this tie-up, the companies can simply do that automatically for Gusto’s extensive number of customers.</p>
<p>Joshua Reeves, co-founder and CEO of Gusto, said that the acquisition falls in line with the company’s long-term focus on customers and simplicity. “We want to bring together technology, great service, [and] make government simpler,” he said. “In some ways, a lot of stuff we&#8217;re doing — make payroll simpler, make healthcare simpler, make PPP [loans] and tax credits simpler — just make these things work the way they&#8217;re intended to work.” The company presumably could have built out such functionality, but he noted that “time to market” was a crucial point in making Ardius the company’s first acquisition.</p>
<p>Tomer London, co-founder and chief product officer, said that “we&#8217;ve been looking at this space for a long time because it kind of connects to one of our original product principles of building a product that is opinionated,” he said. In a space as complicated as HR, “we want to be out there and be an advisor, not just a tool. And this is just such a great example of where you can take the payroll data that we already have and in just a few clicks and in a matter of a few days, get access to really important cash flow for a business.” He noted that tax credits is “something that&#8217;s been on our roadmap for a long time.”</p>
<p>Gusto works with more than 100 third-party services that integrate on top of its platform. Reeves emphasized that while Ardius is part of Gusto, all companies — even those who might compete directly with the product — will continue to have equal access to the platform’s data. In its release, the company pointed out that Boast.ai, Clarus, Neo.Tax, and TaxTaker are just some of the other tax products that integrate with Gusto today.</p>
<p>Of course, Ardius is just one of a number of competitors that have popped up in the R&amp;D and economic development tax credit space. MainStreet, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/free-money-for-startups-its-possible-with-mainstreets-platform-for-economic-development-incentives/">which I last profiled in 2020 for its seed round</a>, just raised $60 million in funding in March led by SignalFire. Meanwhile, Neo.tax, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/rd-tax-credits-are-due-july-15th-neo-tax-wants-to-help-startups-apply-and-raised-3m-to-do-it/">which I also profiled last year</a>, has raised a total of $5.5 million.</p>

<p>Reeves was sanguine about the attention the space is garnering and the potential competition for Ardius. When it comes to R&amp;D tax credits, “whatever creates more accessibility, we’re a fan of,” he said. “It&#8217;s great that there&#8217;s more awareness because it&#8217;s still under-utilized frankly.” He emphasized that Gusto would be able to offer a more vertically-integrated solution given its data and software than other competitors in the space.</p>
<p>While the pandemic particularly hit SMBs, who often lacked the financial wherewithal of larger companies to survive the crisis, Gusto actually expanded its business as new companies sprouted up. Reeves said the company grew its customer base 50% in its last fiscal year, which ended in April. It “turns out in a health pandemic and in an economic crisis, things like payroll and accessing health care are quite important,” he said. Gusto <a href="https://gusto.com/covid-19/paycheck-protection-program">launched a program to help SMBs collect the government’s stimulus PPP loans</a>.</p>
<p>The company’s main bases of operation are in San Francisco, Denver and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/smb-payroll-startup-gusto-raises-200m-series-d-plans-rd-expansion-to-nyc/">New York City</a>, and the company has a growing contingent of remote workers, including the Ardius crew, who will remain based in LA. While Reeves demurred on future acquisitions, Gusto’s focus on expanding to a comprehensive financial wellness platform for both employees and businesses would likely suggest that additional acquisitions may well be in the offing in the future.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">If I told you a decade ago that a spin bike would be a social community, you’d have had a good laugh. But that’s precisely what Peloton is: A spin bike with a social community where the instructors are the influencers.</p>
<p>Peloton is just one example of how social is being integrated into every aspect of the customer experience in an increasingly digital world. Whether it’s considering a new restaurant to check out, a movie to see or a product to buy, most people look at reviews before making a final decision. They want social proof as an indicator of quality and relevance.</p>

<p>Influencers are a natural byproduct of this desire for social validation, and as social permeates the customer journey, creators have become an essential source of validation and trust. Indeed, social validation is what social platforms are built on, so it’s a significant component of how we derive relevance online — and the deeper integration of social is changing the dynamic between brands and digital creators.</p>
<h2>The shifting economy of creator monetization</h2>
<p>Brand sponsorships are the holy grail for creators hoping to monetize their online influence. According to an <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/influencer-monetization-2021">eMarketer report</a>, brand partnerships are still the No. 1 source of revenue for most digital creators.</p>
<p>However, digital creators have a lot more monetization options to choose from, thanks to Patreon, affiliate platforms, paid content platforms and platform revenue sharing, making it easier to earn a living without relying so heavily on brand sponsorships.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;">Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?<br />
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/help-techcrunch-find-the-best-growth-marketers-for-startups/">Respond to our survey</a> and help us find the best startup growth marketers!</p>
<hr />
<p>As a result, creators are diversifying their revenue streams, which, for some creators, allows them to be more selective about the brands they work with. What’s more, creators aren’t reliant on just one channel or one form of revenue.</p>
<p>YouTube creators probably have the most diversified revenue, often combining brand sponsorships, subscription models, affiliate deals, tipping/donations, their line of branded products and revenue share. However, it’s important to note that not all monetization options apply to every creator. But with so many options to choose from, making a living as a digital creator is more accessible than ever.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the ways online creators can monetize their content:</p>
<p><strong>Ad revenue sharing: </strong>Advertising is the most traditional form of revenue for online creators. With this model, ads are injected into and around the creator’s content, and they make a certain percentage of revenue based on impressions. However, the revenue split can vary based on the platform, and some platforms have a specific threshold creators must hit before they can participate in ad revenue sharing.</p>
<p><strong>Affiliate marketing: </strong>Similar to advertising or a brand sponsorship, affiliate marketing is an agreement for a share of revenue based on products sold. This kind of arrangement generally works best when the creator has a blog, website or YouTube account. Affiliate links allow the influencer to proactively choose the products they want to talk about and earn from, rather than having to wait for a brand deal to come their way.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Three Chinese astronauts have docked at China’s space station core module, named Tianhe, for the first time.</p>
<p>The three astronauts flew to space as part of the Shenzhou 12 mission, China’s first crewed mission since 2012. They will call the core module of the Tiangong space station home until September, making it the longest crewed space mission in China’s history.</p>
<p>The three men, Commander Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo, arrived to their final destination just over seven hours after taking off from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China. Nie had been to low Earth orbit twice before: once on the Shenzhou 6 mission in 2005 and again aboard the Shenzhou 10 eight years later. Boming has also been to space, once in 2008.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The men will be busy during their tenure in orbit. Their mission marks the third of a series of 11 planned launches through 2022, all aimed at getting China’s first space station up and running. The goal of the Shenzhou 12 mission is to bring the core module into service, test its systems and ensure it is ready for subsequent stages of station assembly. Of the eight remaining launches, three are expected to be crewed.</p>
<p>Building its own space station is a logical step for China, a country that has not been shy about its space ambitions in recent years. It especially makes sense considering that China is barred from boarding the International Space Station after Congress passed a law in 2011. However, that does not mean that China’s space station will always be for its own exclusive use, country officials said during a news conference Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ji Qiming, an assistant director with the Shenzhou program, said that China “welcome[s] co-operation in this regard in general,” <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-57504052">the BBC reported</a>. &#8220;It is believed that, in the near future, after the completion of the Chinese space station, we will see Chinese and foreign astronauts fly and work together,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>As part of its burgeoning space program, the Chinese rover Zhurong touched down on Mars last month, making China the only country besides the United States to land a robot on the planet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is following in the footsteps of app store giants Apple and Google with this week&#8217;s introduction of its Amazon Appstore Small Business Accelerator Program. The new program will reduce the commissions Amazon takes on app developer revenues for qualifying smaller businesses. Previously, Amazon&#8217;s Appstore took a 30% cut of revenue, including that from in-app purchases. Now, it will take only 20% from developers who earned up to $1 million in the prior calendar year. The program will additionally offer AWS credits.</p>
<p>This program&#8217;s structure is similar to Apple&#8217;s App Store Small Business Program, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">announced in late 2020</a>, which reduced Apple&#8217;s cut to 15% for developers who earn up to a $1 million threshold, after which they&#8217;re moved to the higher 30% standard rate. This rate then continues as they enter the following year. Google, more recently, took <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/google-play-drops-commissions-to-15-from-30-following-apples-move-last-year/">a slightly different course</a>, by lowering the commissions to 15% on the first $1 million of developer revenue earned through the Play billing system each year.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="5vhdCyIraO"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/google-play-drops-commissions-to-15-from-30-following-apples-move-last-year/">Google Play drops commissions to 15% from 30%, following Apple&#8217;s move last year</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google Play drops commissions to 15% from 30%, following Apple&#8217;s move last year&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/google-play-drops-commissions-to-15-from-30-following-apples-move-last-year/embed/#?secret=5vhdCyIraO" data-secret="5vhdCyIraO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s cut remains larger, at 20%, but that&#8217;s because it&#8217;s offering developers a different type of perk: AWS credits.</p>
<p>The company says developers with less than $1 million in Appstore revenue in a calendar year will receive 10% of their revenue as promotional credit for AWS services. This includes infrastructure technologies like compute, storage and databases &#8212; to emerging technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, data lakes and analytics, and Internet of Things, notes Amazon. This brings total program benefits up to an equivalent of 90% of revenue, Amazon says.</p>
<p>If the developer&#8217;s revenue exceeds $1 million during the current year, they&#8217;ll revert to the standard royalty rate and no longer receive the AWS credits for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>And if the developer&#8217;s revenue in a future year drops below $1 million, they&#8217;ll become eligible for the Small Business program again in the next calendar year.</p>
<p>&#8220;By helping small businesses get started with AWS through credits, we are making it easier for them to build and grow their app businesses,&#8221; noted Amazon Appstore Director Palanidaran Chidambaram, in an <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/appstore/post/93e89be7-1611-4764-8f97-f4eef0a7c0e0/coming-soon-amazon-appstore-small-business-accelerator-program">announcement</a>. &#8220;AWS gives developers easy access to a broad range of technologies so they can innovate faster and build nearly anything they can imagine,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The changes to app store commission structures come at a time when tech giants are seeing increasing regulatory pressure over the nature of their businesses, which larger app publishers, including Basecamp, Spotify, Epic Games and others have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/epic-games-founder-tim-sweeney-likens-fight-against-apple-to-fight-for-civil-rights/">argued</a> are anticompetitive. Epic is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/25/epics-latest-argument-in-its-fight-against-apple-keeps-antitrust-issues-front-and-center/">also</a> suing Apple over its app store fees, in a potentially precedent-setting case. In response, Apple and Google lowered fees for smaller businesses as a gesture of goodwill &#8212; and one that wouldn&#8217;t significantly impact their own app store platform revenues.</p>
<p>Amazon says the new program will launch in Q4 2021, and more details about how to participate will be provided at that time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Databases run the world, but database products are often some of the most mature and venerable software in the modern tech stack. Designers will pixel push, frontend engineers will add clicks to make it more difficult to drop out of a soporific Zoom call, but few companies are ever willing to rip out their database storage engine. Too much risk, and almost no return.</p>
<p>So it’s exceptional when a new database offering breaks through the barriers and redefines the enterprise.</p>
<p><a href="https://neo4j.com">Neo4j</a>, which offers a graph-centric database and related products, announced today that it raised $325 million at a more than $2 billion valuation in a Series F deal led by Eurazeo, with additional capital from Alphabet’s venture wing GV. Eurazeo managing director Nathalie Kornhoff-Brüls will join the company’s board of directors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That funding makes Neo4j among the most well-funded database companies in history, with a collective fundraise haul of more than half a billion dollars. For comparison, MongoDB, which trades on Nasdaq, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mongodb-inc/company_financials">raised $311 million in total</a> (according to Crunchbase) before its IPO. Meanwhile, Cockroach Labs of CockroachDB fame has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cockroach-labs/company_financials">now raised $355 million in funding</a>, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/cockroach-labs-scores-160m-series-e-on-2b-valuation/">a $160 million round earlier this year</a> at a similar $2 billion valuation.</p>
<p>The past decade has seen a whole new crop of next-generation database models, from scale-out SQL to document to key-value stores to time series and on and on and on. What makes graph databases like Neo4j unique is their focus on the connections between individual data entities. Graph-based data models have become central to modern machine learning and artificial intelligence applications, and are now widely used by data analysts in applications as diverse as marketing to fraud detection.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Emil Eifrem said that Neo4j, which was founded back in 2007, has hit its growth stride in recent years given the rising popularity of graph-based analysis. “We have a deep developer community of hundreds of thousands of developers actively building applications with Neo4j in any given month, but we also have a really deep data science community,” he said.</p>
<p>In the past, most business analysis was built on relational databases. Yet, inter-connected complexity is creeping in everywhere, and that’s where Eifrem believes Neo4j has a durable edge. As an example, “any company that ships stuff is tapping into this global fine-grain mesh spanning continent to continent,” he suggested. “All of a sudden the ship captain in the Suez Canal … falls asleep, and then they block the Suez Canal for a week, and then you’ve got to figure out how will this affect my enterprise, how does that cascade across my entire supply chain.” With a graph model, that analysis is a cinch.</p>
<p>Neo4j says that 800 enterprises are customers and 75% of the Fortune 100 are users of the company’s products.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/neo4j-4-0-graph-database-platform-brings-unlimited-scaling/">We last checked in with the company in 2020 when it launched 4.0</a>, which offered unlimited scaling. Today, Neo4j comes in a couple of different flavors. It’s a database that can be either self-hosted or purchased as a cloud service offering which it dubs Aura. That’s for the data storage folks. For the data scientists, the company offers Neo4j Graph Data Science Library, a set of comprehensive tools for analyzing graph data. The company offers free (or “community” tiers), affordable starting tiers and full-scale enterprise pricing options depending on needs.</p>

<p>Development continues on the database. This morning at its developers conference, Neo4j demonstrated what it dubbed its &#8220;super-scaling technology&#8221; on a 200 billion node graph with more than a trillion relationships between them, showing how its tools could offer &#8220;real-time&#8221; queries on such a large scale.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Eifrem said that the new venture funding will be used to continue doubling down on “product, product, product” but emphasized a few major strategic initiatives as critical for the company. First, he wants to continue to deepen the company’s partnerships with public cloud providers. It already has a deep relationship with Google Cloud (GV was an investor in this round after all), and hopes to continue building relationships with other providers.</p>
<p>It’s also seeing a major uptick in interest from the APAC region. Eifrem said that the company recently opened up an office in Singapore to accelerate its sales in the broader IT market there.</p>
<p>Overall, “We think that graphs can be a significant part of the modern data landscape. In fact, we believe it can be the <i>biggest</i> part of the modern data landscape. And this round, I think, sends a clear signal [that] we&#8217;re going for it,” he said.</p>
<p>Erik Nordlander and Tom Hulme of GV were the leads for that firm. In addition, DTCP and Lightrock newly invested and previous investors One Peak, Creandum and Greenbridge Partners joined the round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google this morning announced the launch of Tau, a new family of virtual machines built on AMD’s third-gen EPYC processor. According to the company, the new x86-compatible system offers a 42% price-performance boost over standard VMs. Google notably first started utilizing <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/amd-epyc-processors-come-to-google-and-to-google-cloud">AMD EPYC processors for Cloud back in 2017</a>, while <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/amd/">Amazon Cloud&#8217;s offerings date back to 2018.</a></p>
<p>Google claims the Tau family “leapfrogs” existing cloud VMs. The systems come in a variety of configurations, ranging up to 60vCPUs per VM, and 4GB of memory per vCPU. Networking bandwidth goes up to 32 Gbps, and they can be coupled with a variety of different network attached storage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Customers across every industry are dealing with more demanding and data-intensive workloads and looking for strategic ways to speed up performance and reduce costs,” Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said in a press release.  “Our work with key strategic partners like AMD has allowed us to broaden our offerings and deliver customers the best price performance for compute-heavy, business-critical applications&#8211; all on the cleanest <span class="il">cloud</span> in the industry.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Google has already signed up some high-profile customers for an early trial, including Twitter, Snap and DoIT.</p>
<p>“High performance at the right price point is a critical consideration as we work to serve the global public conversation,&#8221; Twitter Platform Lead Nick Tornow said <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/google-cloud-introduces-tau-vms">in a blog post</a>. “We are excited by initial tests that show potential for double digit performance improvement. We are collaborating with Google Cloud to more deeply evaluate benefits on price and performance for specific compute workloads that we can realize through use of the new Tau VM family.”</p>

<p>The Tau VMs will be arriving for Google Cloud in Q3 of this year. The company has already opened the system up to clients for pre-registration. Pricing is dependent on the configuration. For example, a 32vCPU VM sporting 128GB RAM will run around $1.35 an hour.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch City Spotlight: Pittsburgh is getting closer, with impressive featured speakers including Carnegie Mellon University President Farnam Jahanian and Mayor Bill Peduto. However, we&#8217;ve saved the best for last: Our last speaker is Karin Tsai, director of engineering at Duolingo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/">a $2.4 billion business</a> that is all about making language learning fun and accessible.</p>
<p>The event will be held on June 29, so make sure to <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburg">register here (for free)</a> to listen to these conversations, enjoy the pitch-off and network with local talent.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tsai joined Duolingo in 2012 as one of its first engineers, and witnessed firsthand the growth of the company from a scrappy startup into a 400-person global business. Her timestamp on the company has made her a key decision-maker in many of its biggest decisions, from which features to scrap to how to monetize without compromising its mission of providing free education to all.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">One thing to note is that even though a whimsical owl and creative UX might seem straightforward, the language learning universe is controversial and requires healthy debate &#8212; and testing &#8212; for anyone within it.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“We’re trying to do things that no other apps really tackle: How do we create an experience that actually makes you extremely proficient in a language while accommodating the expectations from our learners” to be fun and convenient, Tsai told me when I interviewed her for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-product/">my Duolingo EC-1.</a> “Balancing efficacy with engagement is something that we constantly struggle with.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In this chat, Tsai will break down how Duolingo turned to A/B testing to answer some of its biggest questions. We&#8217;ll also chat about more meta topics, as when to give up on measuring the unmeasurable, and when tests fail and instinct reigns supreme. Tsai admitted to me once that Duolingo spent years trying to figure out how to find a metric that could encompass learning comprehension and engagement in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>“What used to freeze us is that we thought we would need such a metric to make progress,” she explained. “And I think what honestly liberated us was saying essentially, ‘Screw it.’ We couldn’t make progress waiting for a learning metric.”</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be interviewing Tsai, so anyone who registers for this event is welcome to<a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_"> throw me questions</a> for her that I&#8217;ll try to incorporate into my chat.</p>
<p>Tsai will give us the startup builder perspective, while Mayor Peduto will speak to the challenges of building a startup ecosystem, and Carnegie Mellon University President Farnam Jahanian will discuss how to go from student to startup with the correct resources.</p>
