										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The BMW Group <a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0341522EN/bmw-group-accelerates-co2-reduction-and-focuses-consistently-on-a-circular-economy-with-the-neue-klasse">announced Thursday</a> its intentions to commit to a 50% reduction from 2019 levels in global carbon dioxide emissions during the use-phase of its vehicles by 2030, as well as a 40% reduction in emissions during the life cycle of the vehicle. These goals, including a plan to focus on the principles of a circular economy to achieve a more sustainable vehicle life cycle, will manifest in the company&#8217;s Neue Klasse platform, which should be available by 2025.</p>
<p>Announced in March, the BMW &#8220;New Class&#8221; is a reboot of a line of sedans and coupes the German automaker produced from 1962-1977, a line that established BMW&#8217;s identity as a sports car manufacturer. The new line will feature &#8220;a completely redefined IT and software architecture, a new generation of high-performance electric drivetrains and batteries and a radically new approach to sustainability across the entire vehicle life cycle,&#8221; <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2021/03/17/neue-klasse-bmw-electric-architecture/">according to the company</a>.</p>
<p>“With the Neue Klasse we are significantly sharpening our commitment and also committing ourselves to a clear course for achieving the 1.5 degree target,&#8221; said Oliver Zipse, chairman of the board of management of BMW AG, in a statement. “How companies are dealing with CO2 emissions has become a major factor when it comes to judging corporate action. The decisive factor in the fight against global warming is how strongly we can improve the carbon footprint of vehicles over their entire life span. This is why we are setting ourselves transparent and ambitious goals for the substantial reduction of CO2 emissions; these are validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative and will deliver an effective and measurable contribution.”</p>
<p>BMW says the utilization phase of its vehicles accounts for 70% of the group&#8217;s total CO2 footprint, which makes sense given the fact that most of BMW&#8217;s car sales are still ICE vehicles. In the first half of 2021, about 11.44% of BMW&#8217;s total sales volume were either electric or plug-in hybrid, according to its <a href="https://www.bmwgroup.com/content/dam/grpw/websites/bmwgroup_com/ir/downloads/en/2021/q2/BMW-Group-Halbjahresbericht-2021-EN.pdf">2021 half-year earnings report</a>. The company has expressed a goal of selling 1 million plug-in units, including hybrids, by the end of 2021. As of Q2, it&#8217;s already at around 850,000, but in order to reach its goal of halving emissions during the utilization phase, BMW will need to seriously up its sales of low or zero-emissions vehicles. BMW already has its i3 compact EV out and plans to launch two long-range models, the i4 sedan and iX SUV, later this year, with plans for more in 2022. But unlike GM or Volvo, the automaker has not yet announced plans to kill its ICE vehicles, nor has it begun to sell a full line of vehicles designed from the ground up to run on batteries.</p>
<p>This announcement comes just a couple of months after BMW, along with other German automakers Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche, acknowledged its involvement in colluding on an emissions cartel since the 1990s. The automakers collectively hid technology that would have been able to reduce harmful emissions beyond what was legally required under EU emissions standards. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/eu-fines-bmw-vw-1b-for-running-emissions-cartel-since-the-90s/">The EU fined BMW $442 million</a>, a slap on the wrist given <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/03/bmw-q2-earnings-profit-guidance/">BMW&#8217;s second-quarter profits of close to $6 billion</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, the EU&#8217;s &#8220;Fit for 55&#8221; energy and climate package, which was released last month, upgraded the overall carbon emissions reductions goal from <a href="https://europe.autonews.com/environmentemissions/european-auto-industry-braces-tougher-co2-emissions-targets-2030">40% to 55% by 2030</a>, which means automakers need to pick up the pace of electrification, and BMW knows that. Other proposals reportedly under discussion in the European Commission involve a 60% emissions reduction by 2030, followed by 100% cut by 2035, which would make it near impossible to sell ICE vehicles by that time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>BMW says its Neue Klasse will further the momentum to get EVs to market. The automaker aims to have 10 million all-electric cars on the road over the next decade, with at least half of all BMW Group sales being all-electric and the Mini brand offering exclusively all-electric from 2030. As part of its circular economy focus, BMW also intends to incorporate an increase of use of secondary materials and promote a better framework for establishing a market for secondary materials with the Neue Klasse. The company says it aims to raise the percentage of secondary materials it uses from its current rate of 30% to 50%, but didn&#8217;t specify by when.</p>
<p>BMW says its use of secondary nickel in the iX battery, for example, is already 50%, with the battery housing containing up to 30% secondary aluminum, and the goal is to improve those numbers. BMW is also piloting a project with BASF and the ALBA Group to increase the recycling of plastics used in cars.</p>
<p>As part of what BMW is calling a comprehensive recycling system, &#8220;the ALBA Group analyses end-of-life BMW Group vehicles to establish whether a car-to-car reuse of the plastic is possible,&#8221; according to a statement by the company. &#8220;In a second step, BASF assesses whether chemical recycling of the pre-sorted waste can be used in order to obtain pyrolysis oil. This can then be used as a basis for new products made of plastic. In the future, a new door trim or other components could be manufactured from a used instrument panel, for example.&#8221;</p>
<p>To ensure an easier recycling process, BMW is also incorporating early-stage design of vehicles. Materials must be put together in a way that&#8217;s easy to disassemble at the end of life and then reuse. The automaker says it will increasingly build the interior of a car with monomaterials that can be transferred back into usable material.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, the onboard wiring systems must be easy to remove, in order to avoid mixing steel with copper from the cable harnesses in the vehicles,&#8221; the company said in a statement. &#8220;If this mixing does take place, the secondary steel loses its essential material properties and therefore no longer meets the high safety requirements of the automotive industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>A circular economy also involves using higher-quality vehicles, which will reduce the overall number of materials used because those parts can be recycled or fixed more easily.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The tough calculus of emissions and the future of EVs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/22/the-tough-calculus-of-emissions-and-the-future-of-evs/embed/#?secret=CEVxYWbQUX" data-secret="CEVxYWbQUX" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With this announcement, BMW promises transparency when it comes to the life cycle of its vehicles. The company does indeed publish life cycle assessments (LCAs), as does almost every other major car manufacturer, but there&#8217;s no standard in the industry yet, which means it&#8217;s sometimes difficult to compare different vehicles. Looking at the overall life cycle of a vehicle will be increasingly important if we actually want to cut emissions goals. The emissions that come from the supply chains and manufacturing processes to obtain all the materials needed to even build batteries and vehicles is a body of research that&#8217;s only just coming to light, and what that light reveals is the possibility that these moves <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/22/the-tough-calculus-of-emissions-and-the-future-of-evs/">could even increase emissions in the aggregate</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Embodied emissions can be devilishly difficult to accurately quantify, and nowhere are there more complexities and uncertainties than with EVs,&#8221; writes Mark Mills, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/22/the-tough-calculus-of-emissions-and-the-future-of-evs/">recent TechCrunch article</a> about what it takes to calculate the real carbon cost of EVs. &#8220;While an EV self-evidently emits nothing while driving, about 80% of its total lifetime emissions arise from the combination of the embodied energy in fabricating the battery and then in &#8216;fabricating&#8217; electricity to power the vehicle. The remaining comes from manufacturing the non-fuel parts of the car. That ratio is inverted for a conventional car where about 80% of lifecycle emissions come directly from fuel burned while driving, and the rest comes from the embodied energy to make the car and fabricate gasoline.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Startups devoted to reproductive and women’s health are on the rise. However, most of them deal with women’s fertility: birth control, ovulation and the inability to conceive. The broader field of women’s health remains neglected.</p>
<p>Historically, most of our understanding of ailments comes from the perspective of men and is overwhelmingly based on studies using male patients. Until the early 1990s, women of childbearing age were kept out of drug trial studies, and the resulting bias has been an ongoing issue in healthcare. Other issues include underrepresentation of women in health studies, trivialization of women&#8217;s physical complaints (which is relevant to the misdiagnosis of endometriosis, among other conditions), and gender bias in the funding of research, especially in research grants.</p>
<p>For example, several studies have shown that when we look at National Institutes of Health funding, a disproportionate share of its resources goes to diseases that primarily affect men &#8212; at the expense of those that primarily affect women. In 2019, studies of NIH funding based on disease burden (as estimated by the number of years lost due to an illness) showed that male-favored diseases were funded at twice the rate of female-favored diseases.</p>
<p>Let’s take endometriosis as an example. Endometriosis is a disease where endometrial-like tissue (‘‘lesions’’) can be found outside the uterus. Endometriosis is a condition that only occurs in individuals with uteruses and has been less funded and less studied than many other conditions. It can cause chronic pain, fatigue, painful intercourse and infertility. Although the disease may affect one out of 10 women, diagnosis is still very slow, and the disease is confirmed only by surgery.</p>
<p>There is no non-invasive test available. In many cases, a woman is diagnosed only due to her infertility, and the diagnosis can take up to 10 years. Even after diagnosis, the understanding of disease biology and progression is poor, as well as the understanding of the relationships to other lesion diseases, such as adenomyosis. Current treatments include surgical removal of lesions and drugs that suppress ovarian hormone (mainly estrogen) production.</p>
<p>However, there are changes in the works. The NIH created the women’s health research category in 1994 for annual budgeting purposes and, in 2019, it was updated to include research that is relevant to women only. In acknowledging the <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/jwh.2020.8682">widespread male bias</a> in both human and animal studies, the NIH mandated in 2016 that grant applicants would be required to recruit male and female participants in their <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200812161318.htm">protocols</a>. These changes are slow, and if we look at <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33232627/">endometriosis</a>, it received just $7 million in NIH funding in the fiscal year 2018, putting it near the very bottom of NIH’s 285 disease/research areas.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that critical changes are coming from other sources, and not so much from the funding agencies or the pharmaceutical industry. The push is coming from patients and physicians themselves that meet the diseases regularly. We see pharmaceutical companies (such as <a href="https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-centre-womens-health-focuses-osteoporosis-awareness-may">Eli Lilly</a> and AbbVie) in the women&#8217;s healthcare space following the lead of their patients and slowly expanding their R&amp;D base and doubling efforts to expand beyond reproductive health into other key women&#8217;s health areas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>New technological innovations targeting endometriosis are being funded via <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/vc-finally-invests-in-endometriosis-a-condition-that-impacts-1-in-10-women/">private sources</a>. In 2020, women’s health finally emerged as one of the most promising areas of investment. These <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/femtech-future/">include</a> (not an exhaustive list by any means) diagnostics companies such as NextGen Jane, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/01/a-startup-trying-to-detect-endometriosis-through-smart-tampons-just-landed-9-million-in-series-a-funding/">raised</a> a $9 million Series A in April 2021 for its “smart tampon,” and DotLab, a non-invasive endometriosis testing startup, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/01/with-a-fresh-10-million-in-the-bank-dotlab-founder-hopes-to-bring-novel-endometriosis-test-to-market/">raised</a> $10 million from investors last July. Other notable advances include the research-study app <a href="http://citizenendo.org/phendo/">Phendo</a> that tracks endometriosis, and <a href="https://gynica.com/">Gynica</a>, a company focused on cannabis-based treatments for gynecological issues.</p>
<p>The complexity of endometriosis is such that any single biotech startup may find it challenging to go it alone. One approach to tackle this is through collaborations. Two companies, Polaris Quantum Biotech and Auransa, have teamed up to tackle the endometriosis challenge and other women’s specific diseases.</p>
<p>Using data, algorithms and quantum computing, this collaboration between two female-led AI companies integrates the understanding of disease biology with chemistry. Moreover, they are not stopping at in silico; rather, this collaboration aims to bring therapeutics to patients.</p>
<p>New partnerships can majorly impact how fast a field like women’s health can advance. Without such concerted efforts, women-centric diseases such as endometriosis, triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer, to name a few, may remain neglected and result in much-needed therapeutics not moving into clinics promptly.</p>
<p>Using state-of-the-art technologies on complex women’s diseases will allow the field to advance much faster and can put drug candidates into clinics in a few short years, especially with the help of patient advocacy groups, research organizations, physicians and out-of-the-box funding approaches such as crowdfunding from the patients themselves.</p>
<p>We believe that going after the women’s health market is a win-win for the patients as well as from the business perspective, as the global market for endometriosis drugs alone is expected to reach <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/07/2205739/0/en/Global-Endometriosis-Drugs-Market-to-Reach-2-2-Billion-by-2027.html">$2.2 billion</a> in the next six years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Everything is switching from offline to online mode, spurred by the pandemic, and that also has turned around things for the creative economy. Creative professionals continue to look for ways to monetize their talents and knowledge through online education platforms like <a href="https://class101.co/">CLASS101</a> that bring stable incomes and improve opportunities.</p>
<p>CLASS101, a Seoul-based online education platform, announced today it has closed $25.8 million (30 billion won) Series B funding to accelerate its growth in South Korea, the U.S. and Japan.</p>
<p>The Series B round was led by Goodwater Capital, with additional participation from previous backers Strong Ventures, KT Investment, Mirae Asset Capital and Klim Ventures.</p>
<p>In 2019, the company raised a $10.3 million (12 billion won) Series A round led by SoftBank Ventures Asia along with Mirae Asset Venture Investment, KT Investment, Strong Ventures and SpringCamp.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO of CLASS101 Monde Ko told TechCrunch that the company will use the proceeds to focus on hiring more talent, as well as expanding domestic business and overseas markets in the U.S. and Japan.</p>
<p>Ko and four other co-founders established CLASS101 in 2018, which was pivoted from a tutoring service platform that was founded in 2015, Ko said. It has 350 employees now.</p>
<p>“We will keep supporting creators to monetize their talents and we will also allow creators to expand their revenue streams by selling their goods, digital files and more products via our platform,” Ko said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>When asked about what differentiated it from other peers, CLASS101 provides and ships all the necessary tools and material “Class Kit&#8221;, Ko said.</p>
<p>The company offers more than 2,000 classes within a raft of categories, with drawing, crafts, photography, cooking, music and more. It also provides about 230 classes in the U.S. and 220 classes in Japan. There are approximately 100,000 registered creators and 3 million registered users as of August 2021.</p>
<p>CLASS101 launched its platform in the U.S. in 2019 and entered Japan last year. The company opened online classes for kids aged under 14 in 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;CLASS101 is a company that combines the advantages of Patreon and YouTube, offering tailored support for creators while fulfilling users’ learning needs,” co-founder and managing partner at Goodwater Capital Eric Kim said, adding that it is the fastest growing company “in an economic phenomenon in which individuals follow their passions and do what they really enjoy while also making a living from it.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for Thursday, September 2, 2021. TechCrunch is largely off tomorrow thanks to a pan-Yahoo corporate reprieve. But don’t worry, all systems will continue to function while we recharge ahead of the next chapter of TechCrunch’s varied history of corporate ownership. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.coma/ex;">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/fbi-china-hacking-uyghurs/"><strong>China is hacking U.S.-based Uyghurs:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The campaign by China’s government to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/10/chinas-war-on-uighur-culture/616513/">erase Uyghur culture</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57383548">undermine the Uyghur population</a> inside its borders doesn’t stop there. The Chinese state has been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-cyber-uighurs/china-hacked-asian-telcos-to-spy-on-uighur-travelers-sources-idUSKCN1VQ1A5">hacking Uyghurs while traveling</a>, for example. And the FBI reports today that the Chinese Communist Party is doing the same thing inside the United States’ borders.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/botify-raises-55-million-to-optimize-search-engine-indexing/"><strong>SEO is far from dead:</strong></a><strong> </strong>A new $55 million funding round into startup Botify underscores how the era of search engine optimization is hardly behind us. The company said that despite seeing “more and more sections of the search results coming from first-party or paid results,” organic traffic is still growing. And everyone wants a piece of that clickstream.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/europes-top-court-slaps-down-zero-rating-again/"><strong>Europe, where net neutrality lives on:</strong></a> Europe’s top court has dealt another blow to “zero rating,” TechCrunch reports. Zero rating is the practice by which internet providers don’t count certain content against bandwidth limits, giving certain materials &#8212; often their own &#8212; a leg up. It’s a practice frowned on by open-internet advocates, and the EU is apparently unwilling to bend on the matter.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>We’ll have a huge digest of our Y Combinator coverage so that you can peruse a few hundred different startups tomorrow in Daily Crunch. But we could not resist adding in a teaser. How’s this for a headline: “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/fintech-startup-jeeves-raises-57m-goes-from-yc-to-500m-valuation-in-one-year/"><strong>Fintech startup Jeeves raises $57M, goes from YC to $500M valuation in one year</strong></a>.” Even in 2021 that’s rapid valuation creation for an early-stage startup.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/point-raises-46-5-million-for-its-premium-debit-card/"><strong>Yet more capital for neobanks:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Challenger bank Point has put together a $46.5 million Series B, pouring more fuel into the startup’s goal of building a debit card that offers credit-card-level perks. Point’s service isn’t free, but for folks who don’t want to use revolving consumer credit accounts that often come with high interest rates, its model could be a neat way forward.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/shepherd-raises-6-2m-seed-round-to-tackle-the-construction-insurance-market/"><strong>Shepherd raises $6.2M for construction insurance:</strong></a> TechCrunch is tracking a number of B2B neoinsurance companies today, including Shepherd. The startup is working to offer excess liability insurance to construction companies, building technology usage data into its underwriting models. It’s a neat idea. Procore put capital into the funding round.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/homelight-closes-on-100m-series-d-at-a-1-6b-valuation-as-revenue-surges/"><strong>HomeLight raises $100M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The real estate technology upstart wants to connect buyers and sellers, and also provides title and escrow services. And after its latest funding event, it’s worth $1.6 billion. HomeLight managed such a large round after projecting that its revenues will “triple to over $300 million in 2021.” So, when’s the IPO?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/panorama-raises-60m-in-general_atlantic-led-series-c/"><strong>Edtech’s boom is not done:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s our takeaway from news that General Atlantic has helped pour $60 million into Panorama Education, which has built a “a K-12 education software platform,” per TechCrunch reporting. Edtech startups got a huge boost in 2020 when schools around the world went remote. It appears that that wave has yet to crest.</li>
</ul>
<h2>All the reasons why you should launch a credit or debit card</h2>
<p>The ongoing fintech revolution continues to level the playing field where legacy companies historically dominated startups.</p>
<p>To compete with retail banks, many startups are offering customers credit and debit cards; developer-friendly APIs make issuance relatively easy, and tools for managing processes like KYC are available off the shelf.</p>
<p>To learn more about the low barriers to entry — and the inherent challenges of creating a unique card offering — reporter Ryan Lawler interviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Michael Spelfogel, founder, Cardless</li>
<li>Anu Muralidharan, COO, Expensify</li>
<li>Peter Hazlehurst, founder and CEO, Synctera</li>
<li>Salman Syed, SVP and GM of North America, Marqeta</li>

<li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/virgin-galactic-looks-to-late-september-early-october-for-first-commercial-crewed-flight/"><strong>Virgin Galactic’s first commercial flight coming soon:</strong></a> After sending some folks to either space, or near-space the other month, Virgin Galactic is getting ready for commercial work. Per the company, that mission could come later this month, or in early October. For the company’s shareholders, it’s good news.</span> Scratch that!

And Tesla’s hyper-quick Roadster car <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/elon-musk-warns-the-tesla-roadster-might-not-ship-until-at-least-2023/">might not come until 2023</a>. Follow-up question: When will the Cybertruck roll out?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/india-launches-account-aggregator-system-to-extend-financial-services-to-millions/"><strong>And, finally, news from India:</strong></a> Eight banks in the country are soon rolling out “a system called Account Aggregator to enable consumers to consolidate all their financial data in one place.” India’s banking industry has a history of banding together to create products for consumers, including the “interoperable UPI rails” that many fintech companies in the country depend on, TechCrunch reports.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Remember that story <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/virgin-galactic-looks-to-late-september-early-october-for-first-commercial-crewed-flight/">we posted earlier today</a> about Virgin Galactic’s first commercial flight scheduled to launch in September?</p>
<p>We may have spoken too soon. This afternoon, the Federal Aviation Administration said it was grounding all Virgin Galactic flights until further notice, pending the results of the investigation into the company’s July 11 crewed flight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Virgin Galactic may not return the SpaceShipTwo vehicle to flight until the FAA approves the final mishap investigation report or determines the issues related to the mishap do not affect public safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the July 11 mission was completed with no injuries to staff or crew, including the company’s billionaire founder Richard Branson, it was recently uncovered that the spaceplane deviated its trajectory outside of cleared airspace. During flight, a red warning light came on the spaceplane’s dashboard, indicating that it went off its planned trajectory. The spaceplane flew off-course for a total of 1 minute and 41 seconds, the FAA said. The deviation was first reported by <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-red-warning-light-on-richard-bransons-space-flight">The New Yorker</a>.</p>
<p>The regulator went on to add: “The FAA is responsible for protecting the public during commercial space transportation launch and reentry operations. The FAA is overseeing the Virgin Galactic investigation of its July 11 SpaceShipTwo mishap that occurred over Spaceport America, New Mexico. SpaceShipTwo deviated from its Air Traffic Control clearance as it returned to Spaceport America.”</p>
<p>Depending on whether the investigation is complete &#8212; and what it finds &#8212; that first commercial flight in September may stay stuck on the ground. That flight is supposed to send members of the Italian Air Force and the National Research Council to the edges of space, in order to study the effects of transitioning to microgravity on the human body. But until then, Richard Branson’s supersonic company has to stay grounded.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: A Virgin Galactic spokesperson told TechCrunch the company has been working with the FAA to resolve the issue. The full statement:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>As we have previously stated, we are working in partnership with the FAA to address <span lang="EN-GB">the short time that the spaceship dropped below its permitted altitude</span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span>during the Unity 22 flight. We take this seriously and are currently addressing the causes of the issue and determining how to prevent this from occurring on future missions. Although the flight’s ultimate trajectory deviated from our initial plan, it was a controlled and intentional flight path that allowed Unity 22 to successfully reach space and land safely at our Spaceport in New Mexico. At no time were passengers and crew put in any danger as a result of this change in trajectory, and a<span lang="EN-GB">t no </span>time did the ship travel above any population centers or cause a hazard to the public. FAA representatives were present in our control room during the flight and in post-flight debriefs. <u></u></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I was fascinated by Roli the first time I saw founder/CEO Roland Lamb bending the keys of the Seaboard back at SXSW in 2013. Over the years, the London-based company has continued to offer creative musical solutions, including 2016’s modular Blocks system.</p>
<p>Of course, creativity and runaway startup success don’t go hand in hand as often as we’d like to think. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/roli-administration-luminary-hoxton-seaboard-lumi-music-2021-9?r=US&amp;IR=T">A BI profile</a> on the company notes some of Roli’s recent struggles, referencing a “niche” product set, which is probably fair. In spite of earning some high-profile fans in the music industry and tech press, the company’s devices were seemingly not destined for mainstream success.</p>
<p>That, coupled, with ongoing pandemic struggles, have forced Roli to take somewhat evasive action, filing for administration in the U.K. Lamb and his 70 or so employees will keep the Roli dream alive by way of a spinout called Luminary.</p>

<p>We’ve reached out to Lamb and company to discuss precisely what that means, though we do know that Luminary will be the new home for both Roli’s intellectual property and its debts. All told, Roli raised north of $75 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately what happened was the pro-focused products we initially developed, although successful within their marketplace, the marketplace wasn&#8217;t big enough given our venture trajectory,” Lamb said in an interview. &#8220;We had our eyes set on hypergrowth and that proved to be difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most recently, Roli announced Lumi, a more mainstream offering than its predecessors, which aimed to teach users the piano with light-up keys. The product will be a focus for the similarly named Luminary, along with plans to continue to offer its original Seaboard product under the new banner.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Disrupt is right around the corner, and this year the show is packed to the brim with incredible panels and conversations, an absolutely <em>stacked</em> Startup Battlefield cohort of companies launching on our stage, investor insights and a virtual expo hall <em>full</em> of exciting new products and services in the Startup Alley.</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t wait! Literally. So we&#8217;re giving you guys a sneak peek at some of the startups you might see at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">Disrupt</a> in upcoming episodes of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/ecl">Extra Crunch Live</a>.</p>
<p>Usually, the Extra Crunch Live crew sits down with founders and the investors who finance them to learn how they decided to partner with one another and, ultimately, how startups can get to &#8220;yes&#8221; when fundraising. In the latter half of the episode, those same guests give live feedback to folks in the audience who come on our virtual stage and pitch their products.</p>
<p>Truth be told, everyone loves a good pitch-off. So in these upcoming Startup Alley Edition episodes of Extra Crunch Live, we&#8217;re turning the entire episode into a pitch-off. SUA companies will come on stage, one at a time, and have exactly 60 seconds to get us excited about their startup. But it wouldn&#8217;t be a true pitch-off without some expert feedback.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to announce the investors joining us on these episodes to share their insights and wisdom with both the startups and the audience.</p>
<p><a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-startup-alley-edition-w-neil-sequeira-defyvc-and-stacey-bishop-scaleventurepartners?ref=2fbb5a569df1">On September 1, we&#8217;ll be joined by Neil Sequeira, founder at defy.vc, as well as Stacey Bishop, partner at Scale Venture Partners.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Beleaguered electric truck developer Nikola Corp. has inked a new agreement with Bosch for its hydrogen fuel cell modules. The modules will be used to power two of Nikola’s hydrogen-fueled semi-trucks, the short-haul Nikola Tre and Nikola Two sleeper.</p>
<p>“This announcement is the result of a multi-year working relationship with Bosch,” Nikola CEO Mark Russell said in a statement. “After extensive analysis of the best options out there, we are proud to enter into this strategic relationship with Bosch.”</p>
<p>The news is a positive sign for the relationship between the two companies, which has not always been smooth. Bosch invested at least $100 million in the hydrogen truck startup in 2019 but reduced its shares in the company the following year. Bosch also said last year it would supply fuel cells for Nikola’s European operations.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="s9l2WHdw2c"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/whats-fueling-hydrogen-tech/">What&#8217;s fueling hydrogen tech?</a></p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://nikolamotor.com/">Nikola</a> declined to share the financial terms of the deal or details regarding fuel cell system volume. Nikola will assemble the hydrogen fuel cell power modules at its facility in Coolidge, Arizona. Bosch will also supply fully assembled power modules, the company said in a statement Thursday. To support power module assembly, Nikola said it will expand the Arizona facility by 50,000 square feet and up to 50 new employees by 2023. The truck maker is also planning to expand its engineering and testing facilities at its headquarters in nearby Phoenix.</p>
<p>A Nikola spokesperson said the new agreement does not affect the company’s relationships with other companies for fuel cell systems and components, including a non-binding MOU with General Motors for the automaker’s Hydrotec fuel cell system that was announced in November last year.</p>
<p>Nikola went public via a merger with blank-check firm VectoIQ Acquisition Corp. At the beginning of this month, the company told investors that it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/nikola-cuts-delivery-outlook-for-its-electric-semi-trucks/">cutting its delivery outlook</a> for electric semis from 50 to 100 units to just 25 to 50. However, company executives did say that it had built 14 pre-production vehicles, including five alpha and nine beta prototypes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Meanwhile, Nikola’s former CEO and founder, Trevor Milton, promised a criminal court that he would reside at his Utah ranch until he can be tried for securities fraud and misleading investors.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Cohort analysis is a way of evaluating your business that involves grouping customers into &#8220;cohorts&#8221; and observing how they behave over time. A commonly used approach is monthly cohort analysis, where customers are grouped by the month they signed up, allowing you to observe how someone who joined in November compares to someone who signed up the month before.</p>
<p>Cohort analysis gives you a multivariable, forward-looking view of your business compared to more simple and static values like averages or totals.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Cohort analysis is flexible and can be used to analyze a variety of performance metrics including revenue, acquisition costs and churn.					</blockquote>

	</p>
<p>Let’s imagine you’re the CMO of the &#8220;Bluetooth Coffee Company.&#8221; You sell a tech-enabled &#8220;coffee composer&#8221; that brews coffee, tracks consumption and orders replacement coffee when users are running low. The longer your customers are subscribers, the more money you make. You recently ran a Black Friday feature on a popular deals site and you’re interested to know if you should run it again.</p>
<p>The chart below is a simple analysis you might do to gauge your marketing performance. It shows the total customers added each month, and a clear spike in November following the Black Friday promotion. At first glance, things look good — you brought in more than double the monthly customers in November compared to October.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197687" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197687" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2197687" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png" alt="Marketing campaign results in significant uptick to users added" width="1024" height="525" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png 2921w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png?resize=150,77 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png?resize=300,154 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png?resize=768,394 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png?resize=680,348 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png?resize=1536,787 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png?resize=2048,1050 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/techcrunch_cohort-article_figure-1-1.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197687" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sagard &amp; Portage Ventures</p></div></p>
<p>But before you rebook the promotion, you should ask if these new Black Friday consumers are as valuable as they seem. Comparing monthly customer percentage is a good way to find out.</p>
<p>Below is a monthly cohort analysis of new customers between September 2020 and February 2021. Like our previous chart, we’ve listed the monthly cohort size, but we’ve also included the customer engagement rate (calculated by dividing daily active users by monthly active users or DAU/MAU for each month (M1 is month 1, M2 is month 2, and so on).</p>

<p>From the figures above, we see that most cohorts have a customer engagement rate in their first month (M1, 42%-46%), meaning 42%-46% of new customers use the coffee composer everyday. The November cohort however has materially lower engagement (M1, 30%), and remains lower in subsequent months (M2, 26%) and (M3, 27%). Interestingly, the customer engagement rate only drops with the November cohort, returning to normal with the December cohort (M1, 45%).<br />

					<description><![CDATA[Shepherd fits into a theme of neoinsurance providers selling more to other companies than to consumers -- and wagering on there being margin elsewhere in the insurance world to attack. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://withshepherd.com/">Shepherd</a>, an insurtech startup focused on the construction market, has closed a $6.15 million seed round led by <a href="https://www.sparkcapital.com/">Spark Capital</a>. The funding event comes after the startup raised a pre-seed round in February led by <a href="https://www.susaventures.com/">Susa Ventures</a>, which also participated in Shepherd&#8217;s latest fundraising event.</p>
<p>Thinking broadly, Shepherd fits into a theme of neoinsurance providers selling more to other companies than to consumers. Insurtech startups serving consumers enjoyed years of venture capital backing only to find their public debuts met with early optimism followed quickly by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/why-have-the-markets-spurned-public-neoinsurance-startups/">eroding share prices</a>.</p>
<p>But companies like Shepherd &#8212; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/blueprint-raises-16m-series-b-to-grow-its-title-focused-insurtech-business/">Blueprint Title earlier this week</a> &#8212; are wagering on there being margin elsewhere in the insurance world to attack. For Shepherd, the construction market is its target, an industry that it intends to carve into starting with excess liability coverage.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, Justin Levine, told TechCrunch that contractors in the construction space have a number of insurance requirements, including general liability, commercial auto and so forth. But construction projects often also require more liability coverage, which is sold as excess or umbrella policies.</p>
<p>Targeting the middle-market of the construction space &#8212; companies doing $25 million to $250 million in projects per year, in its view &#8212; Shepherd wants to lean on technology as a way to help underwrite customers.</p>
<p>Levine said that his company&#8217;s offering will have two core parts. The first is what you expected, namely a complete digital experience for customers. The CEO likened its digital offering to table stakes for the insurtech world. We agree. But the company gets more interesting when we consider its second half, namely its work to partner with construction tech providers to help it make underwriting decisions.</p>
<p>The startup has partnered with Procore, for example, a company that invested in its business.</p>
<p>The concept of leaning on third-party software companies to help make underwriting decisions makes some sense &#8212; companies that are more technology-forward in terms of adopting new techniques and methods won&#8217;t have the same underwriting profile as companies that don&#8217;t. Generally, more data makes for better underwriting decisions; linking to the software that helps construction companies function makes good sense from that perspective.</p>
<p>The CEO of Procore agrees, telling TechCrunch that an early customer of his business said that its product is &#8220;a risk management solution disguised as construction management software.&#8221; The more risk that is managed, the lower Shepherd&#8217;s loss ratios may prove over time, allowing it to better compete on price.</p>
<p>On the subject of price, Levine thinks that the construction insurance market is suffering at the moment. Rising settlement costs have led to some legacy insurance books in the space with larger-than-anticipated losses, pushing some providers to raise prices. Levine&#8217;s view is that that Shepherd&#8217;s ability to enter its market without a legacy book of business will help it offer competitive rates.</p>
<p>Excess liability coverage is the &#8220;wedge&#8221; that Shepherd intends to use to get into the construction insurance market, it said, with intention of launching other products in time. The startup is attacking excess liability coverage first, its CEO said, because it&#8217;s the place of maximum pain in the larger construction insurance market.</p>
<p>Frankly, TechCrunch finds the B2B neoinsurance startup market fascinating. Selling policies to consumers has a particular set of cost of goods sold (COGS) &#8212; varying based on the type of coverage, of course &#8212; and often stark go-to-market costs. Furthermore, customer acquisition costs (CACs) can prove irksome when going up against national brands with huge budgets. Perhaps the business insurance market will prove more lucrative for upstart tech companies. Venture investors are certainly willing to place that particular wager.</p>
<p>Natalie Sandman led the deal for Spark, telling TechCrunch that when she first encountered Shepherd it was working on a different project, but that when it shifted its focus, it struck a chord with her firm. The investor said that the idea of bringing new data to the construction insurance underwriting process may help the company make smarter decisions. In the insurance world, better underwriting choices mean more profitable coverage. Which means greater future cash flows. And we all know that that means for value creation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/fbi/">FBI</a> has warned that the Chinese government is using both in-person and digital techniques to intimidate, silence and harass U.S.-based Uyghur Muslims.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The Chinese government has long been accused of human rights abuses over its treatment of the Uyghur population and other mostly Muslim ethnic groups in China&#8217;s Xinjiang region. More than a million Uyghurs have been detained in internment camps, according to a United Nations human rights committee, and many other Uyghurs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/31/china-google-iphone-uyghur/">have been targeted and hacked</a> by state-backed cyberattacks. China has repeatedly denied the claims.</p>
<p>In recent months, the Chinese government has become increasingly aggressive in its efforts to shut down foreign critics, including those based in the United States and other Western democracies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>These efforts have now caught the attention of the FBI.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21053780-unclassified-fbi-bulletin-on-prcuyghurs">an unclassified bulletin</a>, the FBI warned that officials are using transnational repression — a term that refers to foreign government transgression of national borders through physical and digital means to intimidate or silence members of diaspora and exile communities — in an attempt to compel compliance from U.S.-based Uyghurs and other Chinese refugees and dissidents, including Tibetans, Falun Gong members and Taiwan and Hong Kong activists.</p>
<p>“Threatened consequences for non-compliance routinely include detainment of a U.S.-based person’s family or friends in China, seizure of China-based assets, sustained digital and in-person harassment, Chinese government attempts to force repatriation, computer hacking and digital attacks, and false representation online,” the FBI bulletin warns.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The bulletin was reported by <a href="https://ipvm.com/reports/fbi-uyghurs">video surveillance news site IPVM</a>.</p>
<p>The FBI highlighted four instances of U.S.-based individuals facing harassment. In one case from June, the Chinese government imprisoned dozens of family members of six U.S.-based Uyghur journalists in retaliation for their continued reporting on China and its repression of Uyghurs for the U.S. government-funded news service Radio Free Asia. The bulletin said that between 2019 and March 2021, Chinese officials used WeChat to call and text a U.S.-based Uyghur to discourage her from publicly discussing Uyghur mistreatment. Members of this person’s family were later detained in Xinjiang detention camps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“The Chinese government continues to conduct this activity, even as the U.S. government has sanctioned Chinese officials and increased public and diplomatic messaging to counter China’s human rights and democratic abuses in Xinjiang over the past year,” the FBI states. “This transnational repression activity violates US laws and individual rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>The FBI has urged U.S. law enforcement personnel, as well as members of the public, to report any suspected incidents of Chinese government harassment.</p>

<div><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Locast argued that it was acting as a booster for local signals, which third parties are allowed to do under US copyright law, to help people who can&#8217;t pick up a signal with an antenna to watch local TV. However, CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox (which were reportedly backed by AT&amp;T and Dish Network) felt that Locast was </span><a style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-31-cbs-abc-nbc-fox-sue-locast-copyright-infringement.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">dodging carriage fees</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.</span></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.botify.com">Botify</a> has raised a $55 million Series C funding round led by InfraVia Growth with Bpifrance’s Large Venture fund also participating. The company has created a search engine optimization (SEO) platform so that your content is better indexed and appears more often in search results.</p>
<p>Existing investors Eurazeo and Ventech are also investing in the startup once again. Nicolas Herschtel from InfraVia and Antoine Izsak from Bpifrance will join the board of directors. Valuation has tripled since the company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/26/botify-series-b/">previous funding round</a>.</p>
<p>While there are a ton of good and bad practices in the SEO industry, Botify defines itself as “white-hat company”. They respect the terms of services of search engines, they don’t scrape search results for insights, they don’t create shady backlinks on other websites.</p>
<p>“We’re going to optimize every step of the search funnel from first the quality of the website, how it is designed, how is the content going to be enriched with, etc.” co-founder and CEO Adrien Menard told me.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="airXfN5o6X"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/5-advanced-ish-seo-tactics-to-win-in-2021/">5 advanced-ish SEO tactics to win in 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;5 advanced-ish SEO tactics to win in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/5-advanced-ish-seo-tactics-to-win-in-2021/embed/#?secret=airXfN5o6X" data-secret="airXfN5o6X" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>There are now three different components in the Botify product suite. The startup first released an analytics tool that gives you insights about your website. Basically, it lets you see how a crawler analyzes your site.</p>
<p>The company then released Botify Intelligence, which hands you a prioritized to-do list of things you can do to improve your SEO strategy. And now, the company is also working on automation with Botify Activation. When Google’s search engine bot queries your site, Botify can take over and answer requests directly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We’re not trying to trick Google’s algorithm. We’re defining Botify as the interface between search engines and our clients’ websites. Search engines are going to access higher-quality content. And it’s probably cheaper than with a normal process,” Menard said.</p>
<p>Companies aren’t necessarily using all three tools. They may start with analytics and take it from there. “You can use different products depending on the size of the company,” Menard said.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, Google has increased the number of ad slots on search results. It also promotes its own services, such as YouTube and Google Maps, before you can see the organic search results. I asked Menard whether that could be a concern for the future of Botify.</p>
<p>“I agree with you that we’re seeing more and more sections of the search results coming from first-party or paid results,” he said. “But the traffic generated by organic results is growing. It represents 30% of the traffic of the websites of our customers and this average is not decreasing.”</p>
<p>According to him, search keeps getting bigger and bigger. When you invest in search, you can see a clear return on investment when it comes to online sales, traffic, etc.</p>
<p>Right now, Botify has 500 customers, such as Expedia, L’Oréal, The New York Times, Groupon, Marriott, Condé Nast, Crate &amp; Barrel, Fnac Darty, Vestiaire Collective and Farfetch.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company wants to improve its automation capabilities, sign partnerships with more tech companies and increase its footprint with new offices in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last summer, Jeeves was participating in Y Combinator’s summer batch as a fledgling fintech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This June, the startup emerged from stealth with $31 million in equity and $100 million in debt financing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the company, which is building an “all-in-one expense management platform” for global startups, is announcing that it has raised a $57 million Series B at a $500 million valuation. That’s up from a valuation of just north of $100 million at the time of Jeeves’ Series A, which closed in May and was announced in early June.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the pace of funding these days is unlike most of us have ever seen before, it’s pretty remarkable that Jeeves essentially signed the term sheet for its Series B just two months after closing on its Series A. It’s also notable that just one year ago, it was wrapping up a YC cohort.</span></p>
<p>Jeeves was not necessarily looking to raise so soon, but fueled by its growth in revenue and spend after its Series A, which was led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), the company was approached by dozens of potential investors and offered multiple term sheets, according to CEO and co-founder Dileep Thazhmon. Jeeves moved forward with CRV, which had been interested since the A and built a relationship with Thazhmon, so it could further accelerate growth and launch in more countries, he said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CRV led the Series B round, which also included participation from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tencent, Silicon Valley Bank, Alkeon Capital Management, Soros Fund Management and a high-profile group of angel investors including NBA stars Kevin Durant and Andre Iguodala, Odell Beckham Jr. and The Chainsmokers&#8217; Mantis Venture Capital. Notably, the founders of a dozen unicorn companies also put money in the Series B including (but not limited to) Clip CEO Adolfo Babatz; QuintoAndar CEO Gabriel Braga; Uala CEO Pierpaolo Barbieri, BlockFi CEO Zac Prince; Mercury CEO Immad Akhund; Bitso founder Pablo Gonzalez; Monzo Bank’s Tom Blomfield; Intercom founder Des Traynor; Lithic CEO Bo Jiang as well as founders from UiPath, Auth0, GoCardless, Nubank, Rappi, Kavak and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whew.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jeeves emerges from stealth with $131M in debt and equity and a16z as a lead investor&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/fintech-jeeves-emerges-from-stealth-with-131m-in-debt-equity-from-a16z-yc-and-a-bunch-of-unicorn-ceos/embed/#?secret=wiS3qDmIIK" data-secret="wiS3qDmIIK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “fully remote” Jeeves describes itself as the first “cross country, cross currency” expense management platform. The startup’s offering was live in Mexico and Canada and today launched in Colombia, the United Kingdom and Europe as a whole. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thazhmon and Sherwin Gandhi founded Jeeves last year under the premise that startups have traditionally had to rely on financial infrastructure that is local and country-specific. For example, a company with employees in Mexico and Colombia would require multiple vendors to cover its finance function in each country — a corporate card in Mexico and one in Colombia and another vendor for cross-border payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeeves claims that by using its platform’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> proprietary Banking-as-a-Service infrastructure</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, any company can spin up their finance function “in minutes” and get access to 30 days of credit on a true corporate card (with 4% cash back), non card payment rails, as well as cross-border payments. Customers can also pay back in multiple currencies, reducing FX (foreign transaction) fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, a growing business can use a Jeeves card in Barcelona and pay it back in euros and use the same card in Mexico and pay it back in pesos, reducing any FX fees and providing instant spend reconciliation across currencies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thazhmon believes that the “biggest thing” the company is building out is its own global BaaS layer, that sits across different banking entities in each country, and onto which the end user customer-facing Jeeves app plugs into.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, he said, “think of it as a BaaS platform, but with only one app &#8212; the Jeeves app &#8212; plugged into it.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197614" style="width: 427px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197614" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2197614 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeeves-WithCard1-2-1.jpg?w=417" alt="" width="417" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeeves-WithCard1-2-1.jpg 1226w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeeves-WithCard1-2-1.jpg?resize=92,150 92w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeeves-WithCard1-2-1.jpg?resize=184,300 184w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeeves-WithCard1-2-1.jpg?resize=768,1253 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeeves-WithCard1-2-1.jpg?resize=417,680 417w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeeves-WithCard1-2-1.jpg?resize=942,1536 942w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Jeeves-WithCard1-2-1.jpg?resize=31,50 31w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197614" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jeeves</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup has grown its transaction volume (GTV) by more than 5,000% since January, and both revenue and spend volume has increased more than 1,100% (11x) since its Series A earlier this year, according to Thazhmon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeeves now covers more than 12 currencies and 10 countries across three continents. Mexico is its largest market. Jeeves is currently beta testing in Brazil and Chile and Thazhmon expects that by year’s end, it will be live in all of North America and Europe. Next year, it’s eyeing the Asian market, and Tencent should be able to help with that strategically, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re building an all-in-one expense management platform for startups in LatAm and global markets — cash, corporate cards, cross-border — all run on our own infrastructure,” Thazhmon told TechCrunch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our model is very similar to that of Uber’s launch model where we can launch very quickly because we don&#8217;t have to rebuild an entire infrastructure. When we launch in countries, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we actually don&#8217;t have to rebuild a stack.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeeves’ user base has been doubling every 60 days and now powers more than 1,000 companies across LatAm, Canada and Europe, including Bitso, Kavak, RappiPay, Belvo, Runa, Moons, Convictional, Muncher, Juniper, Trienta, Platzi, Worky and others, according to Thazhmon. The company says it has a current waitlist of over 15,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeeves plans to use its new capital toward its launch in Colombia, the U.K. and Europe. And, of course, toward more hiring. It’s already doubled its number of employees to 55 over the past month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former a16z partner Matt Hafemeister was so impressed with what Jeeves is building that in August he left the venture capital firm to join the startup as its head of growth. In working with the founders as an investor, he concluded that they ranked “among the best founders in fintech” he’d ever interacted with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision to leave a16z also related to Jeeves’ inflection point, Hafemeister said. The startup is nearly doubling every month, and had already eclipsed year-end goals on revenue by mid-year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is evident Jeeves has found early product market fit and, given the speed of execution, I see Jeeves establishing itself as one of the most important fintech companies in the next few years,” H</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">afemeister</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> told TechCrunch. “The company is transitioning from a seed company to a Series B company very quickly, and being able to help operationalize processes and play a role in their growth and maturity is an incredible opportunity for me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jeeves is building products and infrastructure that are very difficult to execute but by doing the ‘hard things’ they offer incredible value to their customers,” he told TechCrunch. “We haven&#8217;t seen anyone build from the ground up with global operations in mind on day one.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As one of the frontrunners in the race to build the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/the-roblox-final-fantasy/">metaverse</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/roblox/">Roblox</a> is thinking ahead to what virtual worlds really need. And while the platform has had no shortage of growth on its current path — as of July, it boasted 47 million daily active users — it’s looking to chart a course toward deeper, richer virtual experiences that will keep people coming back for years to come.</p>
<p>To that end, Roblox is taking <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2021/09/future-communication-metaverse/">careful but decisive steps</a> toward weaving voice chat into the platform’s core experience. The first move: inviting a group of trusted developers to explore how they can integrate proximity-based audio into the wildly popular experiences that beat at the heart of the platform — from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tloFO_brF5Y">chill, vaporwavey vibe games</a> to pulling off kickflips in a <a href="https://www.roblox.com/vans">Vans-sponsored skate park</a>.</p>
<p>With spatial audio, users will be able to speak with other people nearby through live voice chat. Roblox sees its new voice product as a natural extension of the way that text chat works now, but instead of text bubbles that pop up over an avatar’s head, visible to anybody around them, players will be able to talk naturally to the other people they bump into.</p>
<p>Say you’re hanging out in a virtual skatepark in Roblox with spatial audio enabled: skaters in the half pipe with you would sound loud and clear, just like they would in real life. But you wouldn’t be able to hear someone walking around on the sidewalk across the street, since they’re too far away. To have a private conversation with a nearby friend, you might peel off and walk toward a store down the block.</p>
<p>“As we think about the future of communication in the metaverse, we think that it needs to be very natural and feel very similar to the way we communicate in the real world,” Roblox Chief Product Officer Manuel Bronstein told TechCrunch in an interview. “But it also can transcend, some of the limitations that physics and space create in the real world.”</p>
<p>Bronstein joined the company in March, leaving Google to help realize Roblox’s particular vision for the metaverse. Prior to hopping over to Roblox, Bronstein worked on product teams at Zynga, Xbox and YouTube — three very different companies that are probably equal parts relevant to his current work.</p>
<p>“If you think about the metaverse as the next incarnation of where you know I could go shopping or I could go to a concert, I could go to school, I think that you need to be relevant to everybody in society and you need to both build the content, the rules, the features that support all of those behaviors,&#8221; Bronstein said. &#8220;And part of bringing voice to the platform is to ensure that our older audiences have a natural way to communicate.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Voice chat is very much on the way to Roblox, but that doesn’t mean it will appear overnight — and that’s by design. The company is inviting an initial group of 5,000 developers, all 13 and older, to try out the new spatial voice chat capabilities in a custom-built Roblox community space.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve put a bunch of neat features in there and places for them to chat and hang out and they’re going to be able to learn from the code that we wrote for that community space… So a few weeks later or a month later they can put that into their experiences and turn it on,” Bronstein said.</p>
<p>Bronstein emphasizes that Roblox will take this process slowly, building new moderation and safety tools in parallel as it goes. The voice rollout will go slowly, starting with the chosen circle of developers and gradually expanding out from there as the company feels confident that it can create a safe enough environment with its moderation tools.</p>
<p>“I think we want to take it slowly and we want to learn as we go through it,” Bronstein said. “We may start, as I mentioned, with the developers. It is likely that right after that, we may go to an audience that is 13+ and park there for a while until we understand exactly if all the pieces are falling into place before deciding if we ever open it to a younger audience.”</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="7DTnDje3Fy"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/the-roblox-final-fantasy/">The Roblox final fantasy</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Roblox final fantasy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/the-roblox-final-fantasy/embed/#?secret=7DTnDje3Fy" data-secret="7DTnDje3Fy" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>To moderate its sprawl of virtual worlds, Roblox uses a blend of automated scanning and a 3,000-person safety team of human reviewers. Like in any social network, players can report, block and mute other players to make their own experiences feel more comfortable. And because half of its player base is under 13, Roblox gives parents options on what kinds of age-appropriate experiences to allow and toggles for things like text chat. If voice chat ever makes its way to younger age groups, parents would be able to disable it altogether.</p>
<p>Roblox’s under-13 crowd comprises a massive chunk of its user base, but a surprising number of older kids and young adults hang out there too. According to the company, 50% of its users are over the age of 13 and it’s seeing the most explosive user growth among 17- to 24-year-olds. Roblox is attracting new users, but its core users are also growing up and the company knows it needs to grow alongside them.</p>
<p>Whether voice chat ever rolls out for younger users or not, Roblox seems well aware that keeping a virtual environment with voice chat feeling safe and friendly is a steep challenge. The company plans to rely on user-initiated reporting as voice rolls out and it’s exploring other tools that could bolster those efforts. The company is looking at a few different tools, including automatically recording a snippet of conversation just prior to a user being reported as a way to capture bad behavior for reviewers. It&#8217;s also interested in expanding reputation systems that automatically restrict users who have a certain number of strikes against them.</p>
<p>Much like any social platform, Roblox will likely lean heavily on user reporting, which disproportionately shifts the burden to users on the receiving end of hate and harassment — an unfortunate outcome that no social company has properly dedicated the human resources to solving.</p>

<h3>Next on the voice roadmap</h3>
<p>Bronstein describes spatial audio as “one component” of Roblox’s vision for natural communication. The next step is integrating a voice chat experience that’s persistent across experiences, letting users who know each other hang out even when they aren’t doing the same thing. For anyone who paid attention to the company’s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/roblox-acquires-discord-competitor-guilded/"> quiet acquisition of a company called Guilded</a> last month, that won’t come as a surprise. Though Roblox’s work on voice pre-dates the acquisition, Guilded will lay the groundwork for Roblox’s future voice plans.</p>
<p>A Discord competitor, Guilded similarly built out a chat platform for gamers, doubling down on the competitive gaming scene where Discord expanded its horizons beyond gaming. Beyond group voice chat, Guilded gives gamers built-in scheduling and community management tools that ease the hassle of organizing complex online social events, like wrangling 20-some-odd gamers to run raids in World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>“In the near term, Guilded has an amazing road map, we want to just continue with that road map and grow it without any hardcore integration at this point,” Bronstein said.</p>

<h3>Into the metaverse</h3>
<p>Moderation challenges aside, there&#8217;s basically nothing in Roblox&#8217;s way. The company went public in March and today it&#8217;s worth $49 billion, making it easily one of the most valuable companies in gaming. Investors, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/infinite-canvas-metaverse-ugc-creators-fortnite-roblox-minecraft/">content creators</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/zuckerberg-is-turning-trillion-dollar-facebook-into-a-metaverse-company-he-tells-investors/"> tech giants</a> alike are going all-in on the metaverse, and really, it looks like a pretty safe bet.</p>
<p>Metaverse is a buzzy term right now, but it&#8217;s more shorthand than empty hype. When people talk about the metaverse, they generally want to evoke a futuristic vision of interconnected virtual worlds — online spaces that we can move through, socialize and shop within (for better or worse, that last part is key). Whether this will all be in virtual reality or not and when is a point of some debate, but really the <em>interconnected</em> part is the bigger challenge. In the app age, software was siloed by design. But to realize the promise of the metaverse, our virtual selves and our virtual stuff will need to be able to move through online worlds fluidly.</p>
<p>A few companies are ahead of the curve on this, and it&#8217;s no coincidence that two of the big ones, Roblox and Fortnite-maker Epic — best known for their virtual worlds stocked with custom avatars, in-game economies and a seamless social layer — are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/infinite-canvas-metaverse-ugc-creators-fortnite-roblox-minecraft/">elevating user-created content</a>. Those experiences, and the ability to easily hang out with friends while doing stuff in them and elsewhere in virtual space, may wind up being what the metaverse is all about.</p>
<p>Most adults can hardly grasp the appeal of the blocky, suburban worlds that their kids love hanging out in, but Roblox understands something fundamental about where online life is <em>going</em>. Or rather where we&#8217;ll all going — into online worlds like Roblox.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just two months after celebrating its first manned launch to orbit &#8212; which is now under investigation with the Federal Aviation Administration &#8212; Virgin Galactic wants to return to space.</p>
<p>The company will be conducting its first commercial mission, the 23<sup>rd</sup> for the VSS Unity rocket-powered spaceplane, in late September or early October from the company’s sprawling Spaceport America facility. The flight will carry three crew members from the Italian Air Force and the National Research Council, each of whom paid an undisclosed amount for the seat. A Virgin Galactic staff member will also be on board.</p>
<p>The role of mission lead will be held by Walter Villadei, a colonel with the Italian Air Force; Angelo Landolfi, a physician and lieutenant colonel; Pantaleone Carlucci, an aerospace engineer on behalf of the National Research Council; and Virgin Galactic’s chief astronaut instructor Beth Moses. Michael Masucci and CJ Sturckow will pilot the spaceplane.</p>
<p>The goal of the mission will be to evaluate the effects of the “transitional phase” from gravity to zero G on the human body; to that end, the crew members will be wearing sensors to measure physiological activity, and Villadei will even be wearing a smart suit that Virgin says will “[incorporate] Italian fashion style and technology.”</p>
<p>The announcement comes just one day after the FAA said that it was investigating the first crewed flight of VSS Unity in July. The news was first reported by <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-red-warning-light-on-richard-bransons-space-flight">The New Yorker</a> and confirmed by the aerospace regulatory, who said that the spaceplane “deviated from its Air Traffic Control clearance as it returned to Spaceport America.” According to journalist Nicholas Schmidle’s reporting, a red warning light appeared on the dash of the Unity during flight, indicating that it had diverged from its planned trajectory.</p>

<p>Virgin Galactic later issued a statement disputing the piece, saying that “although the flight&#8217;s ultimate trajectory deviated from our initial plan, it was a controlled and intentional flight path that allowed Unity 22 to successfully reach space and land safely at our Spaceport in New Mexico.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“At no time were passengers and crew put in any danger as a result of this change in trajectory,” the company added.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Schmidle has uncovered news regarding the safety of Virgin Galactic’s supersonic operations. His book, &#8220;Test Gods,&#8221; also includes a previously unknown account of a 2019 test flight (confirmed in the book by former employees) which saw potentially serious issues with the plane’s wing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Europe&#8217;s top court has dealt another blow to &#8220;zero rating&#8221; &#8212; ruling for a second time that the controversial carrier practice goes against the European Union&#8217;s rules on open internet access.</p>
<p>&#8220;Zero rating&#8221; refers to commercial offers that can be made by mobile network operators to entice customers by excluding the data consumption of certain (often popular) apps from a user&#8217;s tariff.</p>
<p>The practice is controversial because it goes against the &#8220;level playing field&#8221; principle of the open internet (aka &#8220;net neutrality&#8221;).</p>
<p>EU legislators passed the bloc&#8217;s first set of open internet/net neutrality rules <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/27/ep-telecoms-vote/">back in 2015</a> &#8212; with the law coming into application in 2016 &#8212; but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/27/here-are-the-meps-you-should-tweet-about-net-neutrality-this-morning/">critics warned</a> at the time over vague provisions in the regulation which they suggested could be used by carriers to undermine the core fairness principle of treating all internet traffic the same.</p>
<p>Some regional telcos have continued to put out zero rating offers &#8212; which has led to a number of challenges to test the robustness of the law. But the viability of zero rating within the EU must now be in doubt, given the double slap-down by the CJEU.</p>
<p>In its first major decision <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/15/europes-top-court-says-net-neutrality-rules-bar-zero-rating/">last year</a> &#8212; <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">relating to a challenge against Telenor in Hungary &#8212; the court found that commercial use of zero rating was liable to limit the exercise of end users’ rights within the meaning of the regulation.</span></p>
<p>Its ruling today &#8212; which relates to a challenge against zero rating by Vodafone and Telekom Deutschland in Germany (this time with a roaming component) &#8212; comes to what looks like an even clearer conclusion, with the court giving the practice very short shrift indeed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;By today’s judgments, the Court of Justice notes that a ‘zero tariff’ option, such as those at issue in the main proceedings, draws a distinction within internet traffic, on the basis of commercial considerations, by not counting towards the basic package traffic to partner applications. Such a commercial practice is contrary to the general obligation of equal treatment of traffic, without discrimination or interference, as required by the regulation on open internet access,&#8221; it writes in a (notably brief) press release summarizing the judgement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since those limitations on bandwidth, tethering or on use when roaming apply only on account of the activation of the ‘zero tariff’ option, which is contrary to the regulation on open internet access, they are also incompatible with EU law,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to Vodafone and Telekom Deutschland for comment on the ruling.</p>
<p>In a statement welcoming the CJEU&#8217;s decision, the European consumer protection association BEUC&#8217;s senior digital policy officer, Maryant Fernández Pérez, subbed the ruling &#8220;very positive news for consumers and those who want the internet to stay open to all&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;When companies like Vodafone use these ‘zero tariff’ rates, they essentially lock-in consumers and limit what the Internet can offer to them. Zero-rating is detrimental to consumer choice, competition, innovation, media diversity and freedom of information,&#8221; she added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week, Kathryn Zealand shared some insight on the eve of Women’s Equality Day. The post highlighted an issue that&#8217;s been apparent to everyone in and around the robotics industry: there’s a massive gender gap. It’s something we try to be mindful of, particularly when programming events like TC Sessions: Robotics. Zealand cites some pretty staggering figures in the piece.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zippia.com/robotics-engineer-jobs/demographics/">According to the stats</a>, around 9% of robotics engineers are female. That’s bad. That’s, like, bad even by the standards of STEM fields in general &#8212; which is to say, it’s really, really bad. (The ethnic disparities in the same source are worth drawing attention to, as well.)</p>
<p>Zealand’s piece was published on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/robotics-future-lets-make-sure-its-built-everyone-kathryn-zealand/">LinkedIn</a> &#8212; fitting, given that the overarching focus here is on hiring. Well worth your time, if you&#8217;re involved in the hiring process at a robotics firm and are concerned about broader diversity issues (which hopefully go hand in hand for most orgs). Zealand offers some outside of the box thinking in terms of what, precisely, it means to be a roboticist, writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have a huge opportunity here! Women and other under-represented groups are untapped pools of talented people who, despite not thinking of themselves as “roboticists,” could be vital members of a world-changing robotics team.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m going to be real with you for a minute, and note what really caught my eye was that above image. See, Zealand is a Project Lead at Alphabet X. And what you have there is a robotic brace &#8212; or, rather, what appears to be a component of a soft exosuit.</p>

<p>Exosuits/exoskeletons are a booming category for robotics right now that really run the gamut from Sarcos’ giant James Cameron-esque suit to far subtler, fabric-based systems. Some key names in the space include Ekso Bionics, ReWalk and SuitX. Heck, even Samsung has shown off a solution as part of a robotics department that appears to be largely ornamental at the moment.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197565" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197565" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2197565 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sciro_suitdiagram.jpeg" alt="" width="400" height="312" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sciro_suitdiagram.jpeg 400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sciro_suitdiagram.jpeg?resize=150,117 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sciro_suitdiagram.jpeg?resize=300,234 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/sciro_suitdiagram.jpeg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197565" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Harvard Biodesign Lab</p></div></p>
<p>Most of these systems aim to tackle one of two issues: 1) Augmenting workers to assist with difficult or repetitive tasks for work and 2) Provide assistance to those with impaired mobility. Many companies have offers for both. Here’s what Harvard’s <a href="https://biodesign.seas.harvard.edu/soft-exosuits">Biodesign Lab</a> has to say on the matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>As compared to a traditional exoskeleton, these systems have several advantages: the wearer&#8217;s joints are unconstrained by external rigid structures, and the worn part of the suit is extremely light. These properties minimize the suit&#8217;s unintentional interference with the body&#8217;s natural biomechanics and allow for more synergistic interaction with the wearer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alphabet loves to give the occasional behind-the-scenes peak at some of its X projects, and it turns out we’ve had a couple of glimpses of the Smarty Pants project. Zealand and Smarty Pants make a cameo in a Wired UK piece that ran early last year about the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Google/Alphabet X. The piece notes that that the project was inspired by her experience with her 92-year-old grandmother’s mobility issues.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197569" style="width: 1676px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197569" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2197569 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-5.31.06-PM.jpg" alt="" width="1666" height="1142" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-5.31.06-PM.jpg 1666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-5.31.06-PM.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-5.31.06-PM.jpg?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-5.31.06-PM.jpg?resize=768,526 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-5.31.06-PM.jpg?resize=680,466 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-5.31.06-PM.jpg?resize=1536,1053 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-01-at-5.31.06-PM.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1666px) 100vw, 1666px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197569" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alphabet X</p></div></p>
<p>The piece highlights a very early Raspberry Pi-controlled setup created by a team that includes costume designers and deep learning specialists (getting back to that earlier discussion about outside the box thinking when it comes to what constitutes a roboticist). The system is using sensors in an attempt to effectively predict movement in order to anticipate where force needs to be applied for tasks like walking up stairs. The piece ends on a fittingly somber note, “Fewer than half of X’s investigations become Projects. By the time this story is published it will probably have been killed.”</p>
<p>My suspicion is that the team is looking to differentiate itself from other exosuit projects by leveraging Google&#8217;s knowledge base of deep learning and AI to build out those predictive algorithms.</p>
<p>Alphabet declined to offer additional information on the project, noting that it likes to give its moonshot teams, &#8220;time to learn and iterate out of the spotlight.” But last October, we got what is probably our best look at Smarty Pants, in the form of a video highlighting Design Kitchen, Alphabet X’s lab/design studio.</p>

<p>The Wired piece mentions a “pearlescent bumbag,” holding the aforementioned Raspberry Pi and additional components. For you yanks, that’s a fanny pack, which are not referred to as such in the U.K., owing to certain regional slang. Said fanny pack also makes an appearance in the video, providing, honestly, a very clever solution to the issue of hanging wires for an early-stage wearable prototype.</p>
<p>“One of the things that’s really helped the team is being really focused on a problem. Even if you spent months on something, if it’s not actually going to achieve that goal, then sometimes you honor the work that’s been done and say, ‘we’ve learned a ton of things during the process, but this is not the one that’s actually going to solve that problem.’ ”</p>

<p>The most notable takeaway from the video is some additional footage of prototypes. One imagines that, by the time Alphabet feels confident sharing that sort of stuff with the world, the team has moved well beyond it. “It doesn’t matter how janky and cardboard-and-duct-tape it is, as long as it helps you learn — and everyone can prototype, even while working from home,” the X team writes in an associated blog post.</p>
<p>The one other bit of information we have at the moment is<a href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/d6/7d/48/38c3bcd8a1a8d7/US20210084997A1.pdf"> a granted patent application from last year</a>, which comes with all of the standard patent warnings. Seeing a patent come to fruition is often even more of a longshot (read: moonshot) than betting on an Alphabet X project to graduate. But they can offer some insight into where a team is headed &#8212; or at least some of the avenues it has considered.</p>

<p>The patent highlights similar attempts to anticipate movement as those highlighted above. It effectively uses sensors and machine learning to adjust the tension on regions of the garments designed to assist the wearer.</p>

<p>The proposed methods and systems provide adaptive support and assistance to users by performing intelligent dynamic adjustment of tension and stiffness in specific areas of fabric or by applying forces to non-stretch elements within a garment that is comfortable enough to be suitable for frequent, everyday usage. The methods include detecting movement of a particular part of a user&#8217;s body enclosed within the garment, determining an activity classification for that movement, identifying a support configuration for the garment tailored to the activity classification, and dynamically adjusting a tension and/or a stiffness of one or more controllable regions of the garment or applying force to non-stretch fabric elements in the garment to provide customized support and assistance for the user and the activity the user is performing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice seeing Alphabet take a more organic approach to developing robotics startups in-house, rather than the acquisitions and consolidations that occurred several years back that ultimately found Boston Dynamics briefly living under the Google umbrella. Of course, we saw the recent graduation of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/alphabets-intrinsic-aims-to-make-industrial-robots-more-capable/">Wendy Tan White-led Intrinsic</a>, which builds software for industrial robotics.</p>
<p>All right, so there’s a whole bunch of words about a project we know next to nothing about! Gotta love the startup space, where we’re definitely not spinning wild speculation based on a thin trail of breadcrumbs.</p>

<p>I will say for sure that I definitely know more about Agility Robotics than I did this time last week, after speaking with the Oregon-based company’s CEO and CTO. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/agility-robotics-digit-gets-a-warehouse-gig/">The conversation</a> was ostensibly about a new video the team released showcasing Digit doing some menial tasks in a warehouse/fulfillment setting.</p>
<p>Some key things I learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>Agility sold a dozen Cassie robots, largely to researchers.</li>
<li>It’s already sold “substantially more” Digits.</li>
<li>The team includes 56 people, primarily in Oregon (makes sense, as an OSU spinout), with plans to expand operations into Pittsburgh, everyone’s favorite rustbelt robotics hub.</li>
<li>Agility is consulting with “major logistics companies.”</li>
<li>In addition to the Ford delivery deal, the company has its sights set on warehouse tasks in hopes of offering a more adaptable solution than ground-up warehouse automation companies like Berkshire Gray.</li>
</ol>
<p><div id="attachment_2197116" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197116" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2197116" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Made-for-Work.2021-09-01-13_51_18-1.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197116" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Agility Robotics</p></div></p>
<p>Oh, and a good quote about job loss from CEO Damion Shelton:</p>
<blockquote><p>The conversation around automation has shifted a bit. It’s viewed as an enabling technology to allow you to keep the workforce that you have. There are a lot of conversations around the risks of automation and job loss, but the job loss is actually occurring now, in advance of the automated solutions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Agility hopes to start rolling out its robots to locations in the next year. More immediate than that, however, is this deal between <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/simbes-robots-will-be-deployed-across-midwestern-grocery-chain-schnucks/">Simbe Robotics and midwestern grocery chain, Schnuks</a>. The food giant will be bringing Simbe’s inventor robots to all of its 111 stores, four years after it began piloting the tech.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/carbon-robotics-secures-27m/">Carbon Robotics</a> (not to be confused with the prosthetic company of the same name that made it onto our Hardware Battlefield a few years back) just raised $27 million. The Series B brings its total funding to around $36 million. The Seattle-based firm builds autonomous robots that zap weeds with lasers. We highlighted their most recent robot in this column back in April.</p>
<p>And seeing how we recently updated you on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/robotics-roundup-17/">iRobot’s continued indefinite delay for the Terra</a>, here’s a new robotic mower from Segway-Ninebot.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197597" style="width: 682px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197597" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2197597" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Navimow-3-web.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="448" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Navimow-3-web.jpg 672w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Navimow-3-web.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Navimow-3-web.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Navimow-3-web.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197597" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Segway-Ninebot</p></div></p>
<p>Segway&#8217;s first robotic lawnmower is designed for a lawn area of up to 3,000 square meters, has several features of a smart helper in the garden and is the quietest mower on the market with only 54 dB. The Frequent Soft Cut System (FSCS) ensures that the lawn is cut from above and the desired height is reached gradually. Offset blades allow cutting as close as possible to edges and corners.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has ordered Tesla to hand over detailed Autopilot data by October 22nd or else face fines of up to $115 million, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/business/tesla-autopilot-investigation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1"><em>The New York Times</em></a>. Back in August, NHTSA announced that it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-autopilot-investigation-nhtsa-141310451.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">investigating</a> incidents wherein Tesla vehicles with Autopilot activated crashed into parked first responder vehicles with flashing lights. The agency originally cited 11 such crashes, which resulted in 17 injuries and one death since 2018, but a 12th incident occurred just this Saturday.</p>
<p>In a letter it sent the automaker, the NHTSA told Tesla to produce detailed information on how the driver assistance system works. It wants to know how it ensures that human drivers will keep their eyes on the road while Autopilot is engaged and whether there are limits on where it can be used. Feds have long criticized Tesla for not having the safeguards to make sure human drivers are keeping their hands on the wheel. A few months ago, the company finally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-in-car-camera-autopilot-081511875.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">activated</a> the camera mounted above the rear view mirror in Model 3 and Model Y vehicles to &#8220;detect and alert driver inattentiveness while Autopilot is engaged.&#8221; In addition, Autopilot is only meant for use on highways, but there&#8217;s nothing keeping drivers from using it on local roads.</p>
<p>In addition to detailed Autopilot data, the NHTSA is also asking for information on how many cars Tesla has sold in the US. It wants to know every Autopilot-related arbitration proceeding or lawsuit the company has been involved in, along with all the complaints Tesla has received about the driver assistance technology from customers.</p>

Then, at the start of the year, Musk said production on the Roadster <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-roadster-delayed-until-2022-091648834.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">would start in 2022</a>. Whether the car will make its new date is a big if. The global chip shortage that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-delays-the-semi-ev-debut-until-2022-citing-global-chip-shortages-160016735.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">delayed the Tesla Semi</a> is expected to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/the-global-chip-shortage-could-last-until-2023-.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">continue until 2023</a>, and Musk’s tweet hints at the possibility of further delays.</p>
