										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.iprally.com/">IPRally</a>, a burgeoning startup out of Finland aiming to solve the patent search problem, has raised €2 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>Leading the round is by JOIN Capital, and Spintop Ventures, with participation from existing pre-seed backer Icebreaker VC. It brings the total raised by the 2018-founded company to €2.35 million.</p>
<p>Co-founded by CEO Sakari Arvela, who has 15 years experience as a patent attorney, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/iprally" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="iprally">IPRally <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has built a knowledge graph to help machines better understand the technical details of patents and to enable humans to more efficiently trawl through existing patients. The premise is that a graph-based approach is more suited to patent search than simple keywords or freeform text search.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s because, argues Arvela, every patent publication can be distilled down to a simpler knowledge graph that &#8220;resonates&#8221; with the way IP professionals think and is infinitely more machine readable.</p>
<p>&#8220;We founded IPRally in April 2018, after one year of bootstrapping and proof-of-concepting with my co-founder and CTO Juho Kallio,&#8221; he tells me. &#8220;Before that, I had digested the graph approach myself for about two years and collected the courage to start the venture&#8221;.</p>
<p>Arvela says patent search is a hard problem to solve since it involves both deep understanding of technology and the capability to compare different technologies in detail.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is why this has been done almost entirely manually for as long as the patent system has existed. Even the most recent out-of-the-box machine learning models are way too inaccurate to solve the problem. This is why we have developed a specific ML model for the patent domain that reflects the way human professionals approach the search task and make the problem sensible for the computers too&#8221;.</p>
<p>That approach appears to be paying off, with IPRally already being used by customers such as Spotify and ABB, as well as intellectual property offices. Target customers are described as any corporation that actively protects its own R&amp;D with patents and has to navigate the IPR landscape of competitors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, IPRally is not without its own competition. Arvela cites industry giants like Clarivate and Questel that dominate the market with traditional keyword search engines.</p>
<p>In addition, there are a few other AI-based startups, like Amplified and IPScreener. &#8220;IPRally’s graph approach makes the searches much more accurate, allows detail-level computer analysis, and offer a non-black-box solution that is explainable for and controllable by the user,&#8221; he adds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snapchat locked President Donald Trump’s account after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/pro-trump-mob-storms-the-us-capitol-touting-stop-the-steal-conspiracy/">pro-Trump rioters stormed the United States Capitol</a>. A Snap spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the action was taken on Wednesday and added that the company will monitor the situation closely before re-evaluating its decision.</p>
<p>This is not the first time <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/snapchat" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="snapchat">Snap <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has taken action against Trump’s account over concerns about dangerous rhetoric from the president. In June, it announced content from Trump’s Snapchat would no longer be promoted in its Discover tab, and would only be visible to users if they subscribe to or search for it.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/we-stand-together">blog post</a> published shortly before Snap announced its decision, co-founder and chief executive officer Evan Spiegel said that Snapchat &#8220;simply cannot promote accounts in America that are linked to people who incite racial violence, whether they do so on or off our platform.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CeDEyE2k7l"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/snapchat-no-longer-promoting-trumps-posts/">Snapchat is no longer promoting Trump&#8217;s posts</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Snapchat is no longer promoting Trump&#8217;s posts&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/snapchat-no-longer-promoting-trumps-posts/embed/#?secret=CeDEyE2k7l" data-secret="CeDEyE2k7l" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Unlike many other social media platforms, Snapchat was created for users to communicate with friends instead of a wider audience, the Snap spokesperson said. It has focused on making it harder to spread misinformation by relying on moderated and vetted content. For example, the Discover tab only features content from editorial partners like Reuters and other news organizations.</p>
<p>Twitter also locked Trump out of his account after forcing the removal of three tweets, but that action may <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-locks-trump-out-of-his-account-for-at-least-12-hours/">last for only twelve hours</a>. Facebook and Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/facebook-stormthecapitol-hashtag-dangerous-organizations-policy/">locked Trump out of posting for 24 hours</a> and blocked the #StormTheCapitol hashtag.</p>
<p>Many activists are calling for Twitter and Facebook to make their bans permanent, with ethics organization Accountable Tech <a href="https://twitter.com/accountabletech/status/1346938971172073473">tweeting</a> that &#8220;the violent assault on the Capitol today has been heartbreaking, but not entirely unexpected. Sadly, Twitter and Facebook’s preparedness and response has been wildly inadequate. Simply labeling incitements of violence is not enough.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The State Department ordered diplomats to stop posting on social media after pro-Trump rioters stormed the United States Capitol, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/06/politics/state-dept-social-media-silence/index.html">reports CNN</a>, citing three diplomatic sources. Diplomats overseas were also told by the under secretary for public affairs to remove scheduled content for Facebook, Hootsuite and Twitter until told otherwise, and that planned social media posts from the State Department’s main accounts were also being suspended.</p>
<p>According to CNN, diplomats are usually only told to pause social media posts after a terrorist attack or major natural disaster.</p>
<p>As of late Wednesday evening in the United States, the main <a href="https://twitter.com/StateDept">State Department Twitter account </a>had only retweeted a thread by Secretary of State MIchael Pompeo in which he said &#8220;the storming of the U.S. Capitol today is unacceptable.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>So far, the official Instagram accounts of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/statedept/">State Department’s Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/statedept/">Pompeo</a> and the State Department’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/statevideo">YouTube</a> have made no posts after the rioting at the Capitol, while the State Department&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/statedept/posts/10157789477951074">Facebook page</a> has a post repeating Pompeo’s Twitter thread.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has contacted the State Department for comment.</p>
<p>Social media platforms scrambled to react after an extraordinary and terrifying <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/06/politics/us-capitol-lockdown/index.html">day of violence that resulted in the deaths of four people</a>. Rioters breached the Capitol early Wednesday afternoon, as electoral votes were being counted, forcing lawmakers to evacuate (the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/06/us/electoral-vote">joint session was later reconvened</a>).</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, Twitter required the removal of three of President Donald Trump’s tweets and locked his account for twelve hours, before stating that he would be permanently suspended for future violations of its Civic Integrity policy. Facebook and Instagram announced that the president would barred from posting to his accounts for 24 hours and began blocking content posted to the #StormTheCapitol hashtag.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was hard not to feel emotional today, as the world <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/social-media-allowed-a-shocked-nation-watch-a-coup-attempt-in-real-time/">watched for more than four hours</a> as rioters stormed into and throughout the Capitol building in Washington to disrupt the certification of the election win of incoming U.S. President-Elect Joe Biden. They&#8217;d been encouraged earlier in the afternoon by outgoing President Donald Trump to head to the building and protest what he falsely claimed yet again was a stolen election, a lie he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_ESXL7J6DY">began to spread</a> the evening of the U.S. election in November.</p>
<p>While members of Congress called on Trump to make a statement rebuking the rioters&#8217; actions from their undisclosed locations, he instead encouraged his supporters over Twitter, writing of the &#8220;sacred landslide election victory&#8221; that was &#8220;so unceremoniously &amp; viciously stripped away from great patriots&#8221; and later posting a video in which repeated his lies about a &#8220;landslide election that was stolen from us.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/mayhem-erupts-in-the-u-s-capitol-as-congress-certifies-electoral-votes">first time in American history</a> that supporters of the losing presidential candidate forcibly disrupted the official counting of electoral votes, as noted earlier in the evening by PBS. And while Trump&#8217;s tweets were <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://twitter.com/twittersafety/status/1346970430062485505">later deleted</a> by Twitter for &#8220;repeated and severe violations of our Civic Integrity policy,&#8221; the move was viewed by many as <a href="https://twitter.com/samfbiddle/status/1346971654484680707?s=20">too little and too late</a>, including by Silicon Valley investors, a wide number of whom let loose their fury toward the outgoing administration and its enablers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
A lingering question is whether the ignominious day &#8212; one on which a dozen Senate Republicans and dozens more Republican House members had planned to object to the certification of the election results &#8212; will begin to polarize people further or whether, following Trump&#8217;s departure, some of that fury begins to subside instead.</p>
<p>Some investors, at least, say their anger has always had more to do with basic human decency, which seemed frequently to take a backseat during the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Deena Shakir of Lux Capital used to work for the Obama administration and is transparent about her political perspective on Twitter. But she says of today&#8217;s events that they &#8220;are not about politics. What we have witnessed is an affront to democracy, an assault on American history, and a gruesome reflection of the divided nation we live in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hunter Walk &#8212; who cofounded the venture firm Homebrew and today tweeted, &#8220;don&#8217;t be putting [Trump son-in-law and White House advisor] Jared Kushner on cap tables <a href="https://twitter.com/hunterwalk/status/1346923275637571592">when this is all said and done</a>&#8221; &#8212; echoes the sentiment. &#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid to have a strong public voice on issues I consider to be urgent and essential human rights questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for whether the shock of today might make it harder to fund or partner with a team who supported Trump&#8217;s ascendency, Walk suggests it won&#8217;t, that business is business. &#8220;We fund wonderful entrepreneurs and employ no purity tests on whether they agree with us 100%. I&#8217;m certain we&#8217;ve backed people who sit to our political left and to our political right &#8211; that&#8217;s not an issue for us and not an issue for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>To the extent that Walk&#8217;s public political stance may turn off some talented founders who &#8220;would just prefer their investors shut up and write checks,&#8221; that&#8217;s &#8220;ok,&#8221; too, says Walk. &#8220;We don&#8217;t believe we need to compromise our values in order to be successful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shakir meanwhile suggests that she doesn&#8217;t always have the luxury of tuning out politics entirely. For one thing, she considers those who terrorized the nation&#8217;s capital today &#8220;angered perpetrators of a jingoistic, supremacist ideology that is not only normalized but actually incited by the highest branch of our government and amplified via social media.&#8221;</p>
<p>More, she notes, &#8220;Given my focus on healthcare, so much of my own thesis development and so many of my conversations have inevitably been informed by the pandemic, which—for better or worse—has become politicized.&#8221;</p>
<p>Try as she might to bifurcate politics from work, it&#8217;s futile right now, Shakir says. &#8220;These events and policies inform our present and our future, affect the markets that value our companies, and contribute to trends and white spaces.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, she adds, they also &#8220;reflect our values as a nation and as human beings.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Eat Just, a food startup from San Francisco making chicken-less eggs, has ambitions to crack the Chinese market where consumer appetite for plant-based food is growing and other Western vegan substitute brands like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/beyond-meat-china-alibaba/">Beyond became available</a> in recent quarters.</p>
<p>The startup said this week it will be suppling to fast-food chain Dicos, a local rival to McDonald&#8217;s and KFC in China. The agreement will see Eat Just add its plant-based eggs to the restaurant&#8217;s breakfast items across more than 500 locations. The eggs are derived from a legume called mung beans, which have long been a popular ingredient for soup, noodles and dessert in China.</p>
<p>At Dicos in major Chinese cities, consumers will find Eat Just eggs in breakfast burgers, bagel sandwiches and Western-style breakfast plates. That diversifies the Dicos plant-based menu which already includes <a href="https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006329/dicos%2C-chinas-rival-to-kfc%2C-unveils-imitation-chicken-burgers">a vegan chicken burger</a> supplied by local startup Starfield. Dicos also offers a gateway into China&#8217;s low-tier cities where it has built a stronghold and can potentially help evangelize plant-based proteins in communities beyond China&#8217;s urban yuppies. The chain operates a total of 2,600 stores in China and serves 600 million customers a year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Eat Just first entered China in 2019 and currently generates less than 5% of its revenue from the country, Andrew Noyes, head of global communications at Eat Just, told TechCrunch. But over time, the company expects China to account for more than half of its revenue. Ten of its 160 employees are based in China.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2093062" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2093062" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2093062 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/eat-just.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="600" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/eat-just.jpg 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/eat-just.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/eat-just.jpg?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/eat-just.jpg?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/eat-just.jpg?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/eat-just.jpg?resize=1536,900 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/eat-just.jpg?resize=2048,1200 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/eat-just.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2093062" class="wp-caption-text">Eat Just&#8217;s vegan egg recipe / Photo: Eat Just</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We have been intentional about starting small, going slow and hiring people who know the market and understand how to build a sustainable business there. We&#8217;ve also been focused on finding the right partners to work with on downstream manufacturing, sales and distribution, and that work continues,&#8221; said Noyes.</p>
<p>The partnership with Dicos arrived on the heels of Eat Just&#8217;s announcement to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/eat-just-partners-with-proterra-to-launch-a-new-subsidiary-in-asia/"> set up an Asia subsidiary</a>. The nine-year-old company, formerly Hampton Creek, has raised over $300 million from prominent investors including Li Ka-Shing, Peter Thiel, Bill Gates and Khosla Ventures. It was last valued at $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>Before its tie-up with Dicos, Eat Just had already been selling online in China through Alibaba and JD.com among other retail channels. Its China business is currently growing by 70% year-over-year.</p>
<p>While there&#8217;s no shortage of strong competition in the plant-based food race in China, Eat Just claims it&#8217;s taken a unique angle by zeroing in on eggs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plant-based meat companies offer products that pair deliciously with Just Egg,&#8221; the brand name of the startup&#8217;s main product, Noyes noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plant-based foods are increasing in popularity among Chinese consumers and more sustainable eating is becoming part of a national dialogue about the feeding of the country in the future. China produces about 435 billion eggs per year and demand for protein is increasing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, Euromonitor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/beyond-meat-china-alibaba/">predicted</a> that China, the world&#8217;s largest meat-consuming country, would see its &#8220;free from meat&#8221; market size grow to $12 billion by 2023, compared to $10 billion in 2018.</p>

<p>Both <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Instagram also announced that the president would be locked out of posting to his accounts for 24 hours, escalating the consequences for his role in sowing Wednesday&#8217;s violent chaos considerably.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Facebook says that the group of people who rushed into the Capitol Wednesday now fall under the <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/dangerous_individuals_organizations">company&#8217;s policies on &#8220;dangerous individuals and organizations&#8221;</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> — a designation it uses to enforce rules against terrorists, mass murderers and violent hate groups. Last June, the company </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/facebook-boogaloo-ban/">added the anti-government &#8220;boogaloo&#8221; movement</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which encourages its adherents to take up arms and prepare for or incite a civil war, to the same list.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The violent protests in the Capitol today are a disgrace,&#8221; a Facebook spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Facebook and Instagram have both begun blocking content posted to the #StormTheCapitol hashtag. Facebook says that it is in the process of removing any content praising the Trump supporters who infiltrated the U.S. Capitol as well as any other &#8220;incitement or encouragement&#8221; of Wednesday&#8217;s events, including photos and videos from the individuals&#8217; perspectives.</p>
<p>&#8220;At this point they represent promotion of criminal activity which violates our policies,&#8221; Facebook VP of Integrity Guy Rosen and VP of Global Policy Management Monika Bickert <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/responding-to-the-violence-in-washington-dc/">wrote in a blog post</a>. Rosen and Bickert called Wednesday&#8217;s events an &#8220;emergency&#8221; for the platform:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Let us speak for the leadership team in saying what so many of us are feeling. We are appalled by the violence at the Capitol today. We are treating these events as an emergency. Our Elections Operations Center has already been active in anticipation of the Georgia elections and the vote by Congress to certify the election, and we are monitoring activity on our platform in real time.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The company will also crack down on anyone organizing any kind of protest that violates Washington D.C.&#8217;s newly implemented curfew, even peaceful gatherings. Any &#8220;attempts to restage violence&#8221; will also be removed.</p>

<p>Facebook says that it is also scouring the platform for any posts calling for people to bring weapons to a location &#8220;not just in Washington but anywhere in the US — including protests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook also made a few tweaks to &#8220;emergency measures&#8221; it put in place for the U.S. election, including requiring additional admin review for group posts and auto-disabling comments on group posts that attract a &#8220;high rate&#8221; of hate speech or encouragement of violence.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s blog post also mentions previous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gretchen-whitmer-kidnapping-plot-facebook-groups-militias-fbi/">crackdowns on militias</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/facebook-proud-boys-mcinnes-kicked-off/">the Proud Boys</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/facebook-qanon-ban/">&#8220;violence-inducing&#8221; QAnon conspiracy</a>. Each group connected and grew on Facebook before eventually eventually being booted from the platform and all three had a presence at Wednesday&#8217;s violent attempt to overthrow the U.S. election results.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/pro-trump-mob-storms-the-us-capitol-touting-stop-the-steal-conspiracy/">historic and terrifying coup attempt</a> by pro-Trump extremists in Washington, D.C. played out live the same way it was fomented — on social media. Once again Twitter, streaming sites and other user-generated media were the only place to learn what was happening in the nation&#8217;s capital — and the best place to be misled by misinformation and propaganda.</p>
<p>In the morning, official streams and posts portended what people expected of the day: a drawn-out elector certification process in Congress while a Trump-led rally turned to general protests. But when extremists gathered at the steps of the U.S. Capitol building, the country watched isolated flare-ups between them and police turn into a full-blown violent invasion of several federal buildings, including where Congress was holding a joint session.</p>

<p>Network news and mainstream sources struggled to keep up as people on both sides documented the chaos that followed. As extremists pushed into the outlying buildings, then the rotunda, then the House and Senate chambers, everyone from White House press pool reporters to political aides and elected officials from both parties live-tweeted and streamed the events as they happened.</p>
<p>Videos of outnumbered security guards retreating from mobs or trading blows were seen by millions, who no doubt could barely believe it was really occurring. Meanwhile, reports propagated from around the country as smaller invasions of government buildings took place.</p>

<p>On one hand, it<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/18/for-seattles-cop-free-protest-zone-tech-is-both-a-revolutionary-asset-and-disastrous-liability/"> further demonstrated the power of social media</a> to serve as a distributed, real-time aggregator of important information. It is hard to overstate the importance of receiving information directly from the source, such as when people inside the Senate chamber posted images of the rioters attempting to break through a barricaded door while security inside pointed their guns through broken windows.</p>
<p>Representatives, aides and reporters posted live as they were evacuated from their offices, told to lie on the ground to avoid being shot or given gas masks in case tear gas or pepper spray was deployed. What might have seemed an abstraction when reported by a talking head on the National Mall was rendered shockingly visceral as these people expressed fear for their lives. The people to whom we have been trained to alert of such things, our elected officials, were the very ones being threatened.</p>
<p>However, social media also allowed for the amplification and normalization of these historic crimes as rioters streamed as they went and posted images to fringe sites like Parler and Trump-themed Reddit clones. It wasn&#8217;t hard to spot rioters apparently &#8220;doing it for the &#8216;gram&#8221; despite those images and videos comprising what amounts to a confession of a federal crime.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Meanwhile Trump and his allies downplayed the violence, blaming Democrats for using &#8220;malicious rhetoric&#8221; and repeating unfounded claims regarding the election.</p>
<p>Years of &#8220;we take this very seriously&#8221; by the likes of Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg have done little to curb the activity by the likes of white supremacists, self-styled &#8220;militias&#8221; like the Proud Boys, and misinformation aggregators like &#8220;Stop the steal&#8221; groups. Despite constant assurances that AI and a crack team of moderators are on the job, it is still on these platforms that we find misleading and false information about topics such as COVID-19 and election security.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/tech-leaders-speak-out-about-platforms-roles-in-us-capitol-riots/">Tech leaders today voiced, not for the first time</a>, their frustration with these companies, and while deplatforming has proven effective in some ways, it is not a complete solution. As the cost and difficulty of launching, say, a streaming site, continues to decrease, it is only to be expected that when a YouTuber gets kicked off that platform, they will land softly on another and their audience will follow.</p>

<p>The promise and the danger of social media were both on display today at their absolute maximum. One can hardly imagine such an event playing out in the future without the intimate details to which we were treated from the sides of both government and insurrectionists.</p>
<p>While Twitter, Facebook and YouTube have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/facebook-and-youtube-remove-trump-video-calling-extremists-special/">taken varying actions</a>, of varying seriousness and permanence, it seems clear that whether or not they want to crack down on the worst of it, they may no longer be able to, either because they lack the tools, or the offenders have built a Twitter, Facebook and YouTube of their own.</p>

<p>After Trump released a video calling the extremists &#8220;very special&#8221; and telling them to go home, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Twitter have taken down the content. Twitter has locked Donald Trump&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-locks-trump-out-of-his-account-for-at-least-12-hours/">Twitter account for at least 12 hours</a>, warning that &#8220;any future violations&#8221; of Twitter rules will result in permanent suspension of the account.</p>
<p>The riot triggered the platforms, after long scrutiny, to finally react to Trump&#8217;s incendiary tweets and messaging. As the situation continues to play out, some prominent tech figures see the root of the riots as the platforms that ignored and amplified misinformation surrounding the election, allowing violent rhetoric to spin out of control in the final days of the Trump presidency.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Tech platforms have repeatedly come under fire for failing to address the rise of misinformation and groups coalescing around conspiracy theories. Twitter’s latest response has been the introduction of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/trump-tweet-steal-election-vote-by-mail/"> tags to flag potential misinformation.</a></p>
<p>Ellen Pao, tech investor and the former CEO of Reddit, argues today&#8217;s chaos is directly linked to Dorsey&#8217;s inaction. <a href=" https://ekp.medium.com/were-embarrassed-that-it-s-gotten-to-the-point-where-we-have-to-explicitly-write-this-c422f7120e27">In November</a>, Pao and Laura Gómez, a former tech founder and CEO, called on Dorsey to limit Trump’s influence on Twitter, explicitly accusing Trump of using Twitter to incite &#8220;a coup.&#8221;</p>

<p>A recent video from Trump, where he calls the rioters “special people” and urges them to go home, has recently been taken down from Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.</p>
<p>Guy Rosen, VP of Integrity at Facebook, tweeted that the events are an “emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump&#8217;s video. We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.” Facebook <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/responding-to-the-violence-in-washington-dc/">released an official statement as well.</a></p>
<p>With Inauguration Day just two weeks out, platforms will continue to play an intense role in safeguarding a peaceful transfer of power. Today’s events feel like a tipping point. The terrorism has pushed Silicon Valley tech figures to criticize some of the industry’s most powerful leaders and implore them to act before further violence takes place.</p>
<p>“Let me say in no uncertain terms @jack @vijaya @kayvz: If you do not suspend Donald Trump’s Twitter account for the next day at least, this mob attack on Congress is also on you. Sorry, but he has incited violence for days, using your tools in large part and you need to act now,” tech media figure Kara Swisher wrote in a post on Twitter.</p>

<p>Color of Change and other activist organizations have said that major tech and financial service companies are complicit in the insurrection in Washington, D.C. and called for social media to take action. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter </a>has locked the president of the United States’ Twitter account and forced the removal of three offending tweets, but the social media platform has not removed him from the platform altogether.

<p>The organization also launched a petition that people can use to make a direct appeal to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. The petition reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear CEO Jack Dorsey,</p>
<p>Donald Trump has historically violated your terms of service with impunity and now, as a result of his promotion and facilitation of today&#8217;s chaos, insurrectionists have stormed our Senate building leaving Senators, staffers, and building employees fearing for their lives. Trump’s tweets have endangered the lives of millions of Americans, from his rants cheering on white supremacists to now advocating for the National Guard to use deadly force against Americans who are protesting against police killings. There is no excuse for allowing this dangerous user to exploit your platform It’s time to #KickTrumpOffTwitter.</p></blockquote>
<p>Numerous other activist organizations, business groups and tech leaders have used social media to condemn the events Wednesday. <a href="https://accountabletech.org/">Accountable Tech</a>, an ethics organization, tweeted Wednesday that the violent assault has been heartbreaking, but not expected. &#8220;Sadly, Twitter and Facebook&#8217;s preparedness and response has been wildly inadequate.

<p>Other organizations such as the U.S. Travel Association, the Jewish Council for Public Affairs and Business Round Table offered their own condemnations of the events, but didn&#8217;t directly criticize social media for its involvement.</p>
<p>Business Roundtable, whose members are chief executive officers of major United States corporations, focused efforts on Trump and called for an end to the chaos and a peaceful transition of power. Others such as the National Association of Manufacturers used stronger language, noting that the protesters supporting Trump was an act of &#8220;sedition&#8221; and &#8220;mob rule&#8221; and urged Vice President Mike Pence to &#8220;seriously consider&#8221; invoking the 25th amendment.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The service has long contended that tweets from a prominent figure like Trump were in the public interest, in spite of breaking its stated terms of service. According to Twitter guidelines,</span></p>
<blockquote><p>A critical function of our service is providing a place where people can openly and publicly respond to their leaders and hold them accountable. With this in mind, there are certain cases where it may be in the public’s interest to have access to certain Tweets, even if they would otherwise be in violation of our rules.</p></blockquote>
<p>The removed tweets include content that was early flagged by the service, &#8220;due to a risk of violence,&#8221; all arriving in the wake of a violent storming of the U.S. Capitol:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2092972" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trump-deleted-tweets.png" alt="" width="1024" height="581" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trump-deleted-tweets.png 1453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trump-deleted-tweets.png?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trump-deleted-tweets.png?resize=300,170 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trump-deleted-tweets.png?resize=768,436 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trump-deleted-tweets.png?resize=680,386 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/trump-deleted-tweets.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The trio includes a pre-recorded video that pleaded with rioters to &#8220;go home,&#8221; before adding, &#8220;We love you; you&#8217;re very special.&#8221; Following the earlier action, Twitter told TechCrunch, “In regard to the ongoing situation in Washington, DC, Twitter’s Trust &amp; Safety teams are working to protect the public conversation occurring on the service and will take action on any content that violates the Twitter Rule. Let us be clear: Threats of and calls to violence have no place on Twitter, and we will enforce our policies accordingly.”</p>
<p>Calls for the President&#8217;s twitter account to be deleted have intensified during today&#8217;s events. It has largely been assumed that Trump would be allowed to continue tweeting at least through the end of his presidency, but what unfolded at the Capitol today &#8212; and his responding tweets &#8212; appear to have caused the service to accelerate those punitive actions.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s action certainly doesn&#8217;t bode well for the fate of Trump&#8217;s account after returning to civilian life. The White House is also still in control of the @Potus account, through the transition on January 20.</p>

<p>A great deal of video and content from the chaotic scene in Washington, D.C. can be found on social media, but Trump&#8217;s commentary was spare. His posts suggested the rioters &#8220;remain peaceful,&#8221; well after they had broken into the Capitol buildings and Congress had been evacuated.</p>
<p>At about 5 PM Eastern time, Trump posted a video in which he reiterated that the election was &#8220;stolen&#8221; but that &#8220;you have to go home now. Go home, we love you. You&#8217;re very special.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> this was soon restricted, with a large warning that &#8220;this Tweet can&#8217;t be replied to, Retweeted, or liked due to a risk of violence.&#8221;</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter adds huge pop-up warning to Trump video telling Capitol Hill rioters &#8216;we love you&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-pop-up-trump-video-capitol-rally/embed/#?secret=gE1M8Tg5pp" data-secret="gE1M8Tg5pp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Guy Rosen, VP of Integrity at Facebook, wrote on Twitter that &#8220;<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">this is an emergency situation and we are taking appropriate emergency measures, including removing President Trump&#8217;s video. We removed it because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>At Facebook there is some precedent for one of Trump&#8217;s posts being removed. In August, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/facebook-trump-false-covid-claim-fox-news/">company took down a video</a> in which Trump stated that children were &#8220;almost immune&#8221; to COVID-19, a dangerous and false claim not supported by science.</p>
<p>As Twitter and Facebook crafted bespoke policies to address threats to the election leading into November, YouTube mostly remained quiet. In early December, a month after the election, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/youtube-declares-war-on-us-election-misinformation-a-month-late/">the company announced</a> that it would begin removing content that made false claims that the U.S. election was affected by &#8220;widespread fraud or errors.&#8221; YouTube&#8217;s decision to remove the president&#8217;s video on Wednesday aligned with that policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We removed a video posted this afternoon to Donald Trump’s channel that violated our policies regarding content that alleges widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 U.S. Election,&#8221; a YouTube spokesperson told TechCrunch, noting that the video is allowed if accompanied by proper context for &#8220;educational&#8221; value.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol while the president encouraged them on <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and &#8230; well, it feels extremely hard to care about anything else right now.</p>
<p>That said, there was a whole other news cycle before then, and I know you read The Daily Crunch for tech headlines. So I&#8217;ll do my best to carry on and squeeze everything in.</p>
<p>This is your Daily Crunch for January 6, 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>The big story: Trump tweets approvingly as rioters storm US Capitol</strong></p>
<p>As you almost certainly know already, a pro-Trump mob <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/pro-trump-mob-storms-the-us-capitol-touting-stop-the-steal-conspiracy/">entered the U.S. Capitol today</a>, forcing the Senate and House to flee as they were in the process of debating and certifying Joe Biden&#8217;s election as president.</p>
<p>These Trump supporters were chanting slogans like &#8220;stop the steal,&#8221; which grew out of online conspiracy theories that have spread on social media. At least one gunshot victim has been reported, and an explosive device was also detonated safely outside the Republican National Committee.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, President Trump continued to tweet his unfounded and unsubstantiated claims of election fraud and even posted a video telling the rioters, &#8220;Go home, we love you.&#8221; Twitter has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-pop-up-trump-video-capitol-rally/">posted warnings</a> but there are calls for the platform to go further.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As chaos and violence have erupted in Washington, D.C., social media platforms are grappling with the fallout. A spokesperson for <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/reddit" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="reddit">Reddit <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> tells TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reddit’s site-wide policies prohibit content that promotes hate or encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence.

<p>The site reportedly hasn’t seen a major change in user activity leading up to today’s  storming of the U.S. Capitol building &#8212; apparently owing in part to the banning of a number of subreddits, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/trump-suspended-from-twitch-as-reddit-bans-the-the_donald-and-additional-subreddits/">The_Donald</a>, over violations earlier this year.</p>
<p>The statement follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-pop-up-trump-video-capitol-rally/">similar wording from Twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In regard to the ongoing situation in Washington, DC, Twitter’s Trust &amp; Safety teams are working to protect the public conversation occurring on the service and will take action on any content that violates the Twitter Rules.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems clear that much of the current reaction to the situation is in flux as this unprecedented and dark moment continues to unfold in Washington, D.C. For now, much of Reddit&#8217;s content control lies in the hands of site moderators.</p>

<p>Trump&#8217;s new message to his mob of angry supporters came in video form, following an earlier tweet encouraging the crowd to be &#8220;peaceful.&#8221; In the video, Trump both affirmed his supporters&#8217; conspiracy-rooted grievances and gently encouraged them to leave.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know your pain. I know you&#8217;re hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election and everyone knows it. Especially the other side. But you have to go home now,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;Go home, we love you. You&#8217;re very special.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>A crowd of agitated Trump supporters broke into the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C. Wednesday, storming into congressional chambers and even invading the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The effort, connected to the &#8220;Stop the Steal&#8221; movement which Trump has regularly encouraged, happened as Congress was meeting to certify President-elect Joe Biden&#8217;s electoral win.</p>

<p>Twitter has previously hidden the president&#8217;s rule-breaking tweets, affixed them with small warning labels and limited their engagement, but the large pop-up is a tool we hadn&#8217;t yet seen the company use. Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1346926980437061633">said today</a> that it would &#8220;[explore] other escalated enforcement actions&#8221; in light of the situation unfolding at the Capitol. It&#8217;s not clear if the pop-up is appearing for all users and we&#8217;ve asked the company if this was one of the escalated measures it referred to.</p>
<p>&#8220;In regard to the ongoing situation in Washington, DC, Twitter’s Trust &amp; Safety teams are working to protect the public conversation occurring on the service and will take action on any content that violates the Twitter Rules,&#8221; a Twitter spokesperson said. &#8220;Let us be clear: Threats of and calls to violence have no place on Twitter, and we will enforce our policies accordingly.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Shortly after restricting the video, Twitter restricted another tweet by Trump complaining of a &#8220;sacred landslide election&#8221; being &#8220;stripped away from great patriots.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A chaotic scene unfolded in Washington D.C. on Wednesday as a large crowd of pro-Trump protesters stormed the U.S. Capitol Building.</p>
<p>The Trump supporters flooded into the nation&#8217;s capital to attend a rally held earlier by President Trump outside the White House. The rally was timed to protest lawmakers gathering Wednesday to certify President-elect Joe Biden&#8217;s electoral win.</p>
<p>At his own event, Trump encouraged his supporters to continue demonstrating against Congress, claiming incorrectly that Vice President Mike Pence holds the power to overturn the election results. While the situation is still unfolding, protesters penetrated the Capitol building and injuries have been confirmed, including <a href="https://twitter.com/Tom_Winter/status/1346911986810961921">at least one gunshot victim</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>As Trump supporters flooded up the Capitol steps with &#8220;Make America Great Again&#8221; hats and &#8220;Stop the Steal&#8221; banners, the president encouraged his supporters with more conspiratorial talk. &#8220;Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify,&#8221; Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1346900434540240897">wrote</a> in a tweet. &#8220;USA demands the truth!&#8221;</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> appended a warning label calling Trump&#8217;s election fraud claims &#8220;disputed&#8221; to the tweet. After his supporters already made their way into the Capitol building, the president seemed to walk back his calls to action, calling for supporters to remain peaceful.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Twitter has limited retweets and other forms of engagement on Trump&#8217;s tweet, but is not hiding it behind a warning screen at this time. The company says it is &#8220;exploring other escalated enforcement actions&#8221; though declined to elaborate on what those steps were.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/facebook-blocks-sharpiegate-hashtag-election-conspiracies/">Stop the Steal movement</a> grew out of online conspiracies boosting Trump&#8217;s unfounded claims that Democrats had in some way rigged the presidential election. In reality, U.S. electoral results were decisively in favor of Biden, though votes trickled in over an extended period of time, as expected, due to a massive expansion of pandemic-related mail-in voting.</p>

<p>Facebook made efforts to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/facebook-blocks-sharpiegate-hashtag-election-conspiracies/">rein in Stop the Spread groups</a> soon after the election, blocking the hashtag for violating its rules around election misinformation. &#8220;The group was organized around the delegitimization of the election process, and we saw worrying calls for violence from some members of the group,&#8221; Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone said at the time.</p>
<p>Stop the Steal supporters also found a foothold on many other platforms, including Reddit, Twitter and alternative <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/parler-app-store-facebook/">social networks like Gab and Parler</a>, which have attracted far-right users with policies much friendlier to extremist content. The crowd at the capitol also shares <a href="https://twitter.com/willsommer/status/1346920710438936576">considerable overlap with QAnon</a>, a constellation of conspiracy theories that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/facebook-qanon-ban/"> exploded on Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/youtube-bans-videos-promoting-conspiracy-theories-like-qanon-that-target-individuals/">YouTube</a> and other online platforms over the last few years.</p>
<p>In a live address Wednesday, President-elect Joe Biden said the events unfolding on Capitol Hill &#8220;bordered on sedition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At their best, the words of a president can inspire,&#8221; Biden said. &#8220;At their worst, they can incite.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Revenue-based investing (<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/rbi" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="rbi">RBI), <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> also known as revenue-based financing, or revenue-share investing,<sup id="fnref1">1</sup> is a natural next step for the private equity and early-stage venture investment industry. However, due to RBI being a relatively new model, publicly available data is limited.</p>
<p>To address this foundational gap in market information, we have developed a proprietary data set of 32 RBI investment firms, 57 distinct funds and 134 companies that have secured revenue-based investing.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Bootstrapp developed this extensive analysis on revenue-based investing for the purpose of accelerating the shift toward greater transparency and standardization within the industry.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Upon thoroughly analyzing the data, we’ve been able to identify the total number of investment firms and amount of capital that comprise the RBI industry, the specific verticals and business models that are most actively leveraging RBI, and the typical profile of companies that access this form of capital.</p>
<p>These findings are summarized below; a full industry-spanning report that defines the overall revenue-based investing market as it stands today is <a href="https://www.bootstrapp.co/2020-state-of-the-industry-revenue-based-investing/">available to download here</a>.</p>
<p>As context, the financial structures used by VCs haven&#8217;t evolved much since they first emerged in 1957. Today, the model is almost precisely the same, with only incremental changes such as more efficient capital markets and industry standards for structuring deals, pricing companies and more.</p>
<p>More recently, we have seen numerous new investment models and financing instruments, including <a href="https://earnestcapital.com/shared-earnings-agreement/">shared earnings agreements</a> and <a href="https://www.shopify.com/capital">point-of-sale capital</a>. One of the most prominent and popular new models for investors is revenue-based investing (RBI).</p>
<p>However, because the model is new, there is a lack of publicly available data, industry standards have not yet been fully established, and similarly to the equity investment market, there is little transparency into the cost of capital that investees truly pay in exchange for taking on a revenue-based investment.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there have been some notable efforts to drive transparency in the RBI market. For example, Bigfoot Capital open-sourced its RBI model, <a href="https://www.bigfootcap.com/blog/revenue-based-financing">outlining it in a blog post</a> and sharing <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hovkZNDw8nBugtWt3ZqW3VEuJRm_PY_Y4M93KZygjGM/edit?usp=sharing">their RBI financial model</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d-KJRoOHSvDy7Z3yQbv-MMlF9PoQHbiN/view?usp=sharing">anonymized term sheet</a>, but a thorough, quantitative, industry-wide analysis has not been conducted until now.</p>
<p>In order to raise RBI, the company must normally be generating revenue, but is not necessarily required to be profitable, although profitability, or at least a near-term path to profitability, is often an important criteria for many investors. &#8220;For startups with revenue, RBI may be a good option because, even though the startup may not be profitable, it can reduce dilution &#8212; especially for founders,&#8221; said Emily Campbell of The Campbell Firm PLLC, a law firm that represents serial entrepreneurs and venture-backed businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Taking in some smart equity or convertible debt and balancing that money with other financing can be a good strategy for a startup,&#8221; she said. Profitability decreases the risk of default and assures that the investee has the ability to service the debt.</p>
<p>In regards to the applications that are best suited to RBI, B2B software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies rise to the top of the list primarily because one is able to — in essence — securitize the revenue being generated by a company and then lend capital against that theoretical security. In addition to SaaS companies, RBI is being used quite frequently in the impact investing community as it solves the problem of a lack of normal M&amp;A or IPO exit paths for impact-driven companies and are sometimes marketed as a nonextractive form of investment structure.</p>
<p>Beyond B2B SaaS and impact investing, many other verticals are adopting the model as well, including e-commerce/D2C, consumer software, food and beverage, and more. It ought to be noted, however, that regardless of the specific business model a company employs, the investee is typically required to have repeatable sales and a track record that demonstrates a strong revenue stream, and therefore a clear ability to return the capital to the investors.</p>
<h2>The U.S. RBI landscape</h2>
<p>We have identified 32 U.S.-based firms actively investing via a revenue-based investing instrument, with those firms managing 57 distinct funds representing an estimated $4.31 billion in capital. Through our analysis of those firms, funds and investees, we found that:</p>
<ol>
<li>The number of firms and the amount of capital committed to RBI is increasing, and we forecast that this trend will continue.</li>
<li>B2B software was not surprisingly the largest consumer of RBI,</li>
<li>There was a surprising amount of activity across industries that are not yet typically associated with revenue-based investing such as food and beverage, consumer products, fashion, and healthcare.</li>
</ol>
<p>Firms were included in the data set (and by extension, determined to be actively making revenue-based investments) if they:</p>
<ol>
<li>Invest in companies using an instrument where the return is generated from the principal plus a flat fee that is paid back via a fixed percentage of revenue.</li>
<li>Payments to investors are made on a monthly (or longer) basis.</li>
<li>The payback period is expected to be longer than 12 months.</li>
</ol>
<p>The specific number of firms we believe to be quite accurate, representing only active, U.S.-based revenue-based investing firms. The number of funds, however, may be underestimated. This is due to the fact that, although each firm is associated with at least one fund, we did not include additional funds beyond that unless they were confirmed through other sources, such as the firms’ public communications, their <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-d.asp">SEC Form D</a> or other sources as outlined in the methodology section at the conclusion of the full report.</p>
<p>The total amount of RBI capital that has already been allocated to companies across all firms and all years is $2.1 billion. However, it should be noted that this includes the outliers in our dataset, namely Kapitus, Clearbanc, Braavo and United Capital Source. Once we remove those firms, the remaining 28 firms, representing 51 funds, have allocated $592.8 million.</p>
<p>This figure of $592.8 million is almost certainly an underestimate due to the fact that only 19 of 32 firms had a known “amount of allocated capital,” whereas the remaining 13 firms have unknown values (i.e., zeros) for the amount of capital they have allocated thus far. Therefore, if all 32 firms had a valid and confirmed amount of allocated capital, we can logically conclude that the number would rise dramatically from the current figure of $592.8 million.</p>
<h2>Increasing popularity of RBI</h2>
<p>New RBI firms have been founded every year since 2013. In 2010, five firms were founded and in 2015 four additional firms were founded, then from 2014-2019, two or more firms were founded each year.</p>

<p>Clearly, there has been a major uptick in RBI firms being founded since 2005, with a relatively consistent number of new firms being founded over the 15 years since then. In the last 10 years alone, 25 RBI firms have been founded.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snapchat was among the first apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/snapchat-among-first-to-leverage-iphone-12-pros-lidar-scanner-for-ar/">to leverage the iPhone 12 Pro&#8217;s LiDAR Scanner</a> for AR, but now TikTok has followed suit. The social video app confirmed today it has launched its first-ever lidar-powered effect to help its users ring in the new year. The effect features an AR ball, similar to the one that drops in Times Square on New Year&#8217;s Eve. After a countdown, the ball drops and explodes to fill the room with confetti, as well as a floating &#8220;2021&#8221; in the air.</p>
<p>Support for LiDAR, or light detection and ranging, was introduced on the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/apple-unveils-its-flagship-5g-phones-the-iphone-12-pro-and-pro-max/"> new flagship 5G iPhone models</a>, the iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, in the fall. The technology helps the iPhone better understand the world around you, by measuring how long it takes for light to reach an object in the space and reflect back.</p>
<p>Along with improvements to the iPhone&#8217;s machine learning capabilities and dev frameworks, this allows for more immersive augmented reality (AR) experiences.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Snapchat, an early adopter of the technology, had first used the new LiDAR Scanner to create a Lens in its app where flowers and grasses would grow in the room around you. The Lens included virtual vegetation that even climbed up the walls and around the cabinets in the room, for example.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">To ring in 2021 we released our first AR effect on the new iPhone 12 Pro, using LiDAR technology which allows us to create effects that interact with your environment &#8211; visually bridging the digital and physical worlds. We&#39;re excited to develop more innovative effects in 2021! <a href="https://t.co/6yFD2FfHta">pic.twitter.com/6yFD2FfHta</a></p>
<p>&mdash; TikTok_Comms (@tiktok_comms) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiktok_comms/status/1346828242506969089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Similarly, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tiktok" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tiktok">TikTok&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> effect aims to use LiDAR&#8217;s understanding of the room to land the confetti more realistically after the ball explodes.</p>
<p>In the example video the company <a href="https://twitter.com/tiktok_comms/status/1346828242506969089">published on Twitter,</a> it showed the confetti covering the floor, sofa and throw pillows, much as it would in real life. This effect wasn&#8217;t perfect by any means &#8212; it was still very clear this was an AR experience and not real confetti &#8212; but it was an improvement over AR effects that lack the same spatial awareness.</p>
<p>TikTok described the effect as being able to visually bridge the digital and physical worlds, thanks to how the AR effects interact with the user&#8217;s environment. It&#8217;s available globally, with the exception of a few select countries.</p>
<p>Of course, fun AR effects are only one of many use cases for something like lidar. The technology is also being adopted by apps that let you scan to create 3D models, like <a href="https://www.3dscannerapp.com/">3D Scanner App, </a>or those that help with interior design, like <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/roomscan-lidar/id1504050801">RoomScan LiDAR</a>, or even games, like the Apple Arcade title, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hot-lava/id1469252166">Hot Lava</a>.</p>
<p>TikTok says it plans to roll out &#8220;more innovative effects&#8221; over the course of 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/federal-aviation-administration" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="federal-aviation-administration">Federal Aviation Administration <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (FAA) has <a href="https://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=25581">issued new final rules</a> to help pave the way for the re-introduction of supersonic commercial flight. The U.S. airspace regulator&#8217;s rules provide guidance for companies looking to gain approval for flight testing of supersonic aircraft under development, which includes startups like Boom Supersonic, which has just completed its sub-scale supersonic demonstrator aircraft and hopes to begin flight testing it this year.</p>
<p>Boom, which is in the process of finalizing a $50 million funding round and has raised around $150 million across prior fundraising efforts, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/heres-your-first-look-at-boom-supersonics-faster-than-sound-xb-1-demonstrator-aircraft/">rolled out its XB-1 supersonic demonstrator jet in October</a>. This test aircraft is smaller than the final design of its Overture passenger supersonic commercial airliner, but will be used to prove out the fundamental technologies in flight that will then be used to construct Overture, which the company is targeting for a 2025 rollout with airline partners.</p>

<p>Other startups, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/supersonic-aircraft-startup-hermeus-raises-16-million-series-a/">including Hermeus, are also pursuing supersonic flight for commercial use</a>. Meanwhile, SpaceX and others focused on spaceflight like Virgin Galactic are exploring not only supersonic flight, but how point-to-point flight that includes part of the trip at the outer edge of Earth&#8217;s atmosphere might reduce flight times dramatically and turn long-haul flights into much shorter, almost regional trips.</p>
<p>The FAA&#8217;s rules finalization comes in under the wire as the agency prepares for a transition when current U.S. Transportation Secretary <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/elaine-l-chao" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="elaine-l-chao">Elaine Chao <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/biden-nominate-pete-buttigieg-transportation-secretary-n1251291">moves aside for incoming Biden pick Pete Buttigieg</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last month, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/looking-glass" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="looking-glass">Looking Glass Factory <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> introduced the Portrait, its first offering for a more general audience. The device utilizes the company’s impressive holographic imaging technology for a far more accessible form factor &#8212; a technically impressive digital photo frame, put simply.</p>
<p>Of course, one of the biggest question marks for technology like this is always content. More specifically, how do the people who buy the $349 product actually create 3D images to use with it? The startup announced its solution to that issue today in the form of HoloPlay Studio. The company’s proprietary software was created to convert 2D images to 3D.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/4pJxdNRA1CM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Now extremely realistic holographic memories of all sorts can be created and enjoyed by more people than ever before, getting us one step closer to a world in which we’re creating in, communicating with, and reliving our memories through holograms,” CEO Shawn Frayne said in a release.</p>
<p>The company promises a low barrier of entry here. Users just need to upload images to the software. Results will likely vary depending on a number of factors. This is the kind of thing I’d normally like to see in person, first, but it’s been a bad couple of years for hands-on experiences.</p>
<p>The tech is set to go live through Looking Glass’s site at some point in the spring. After that, it will be bundled with the new portrait devices. Backers get 20 conversions for free and then it’s $20 for 100 photos.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a year of video calls and Slack messages, the definition of workplace is set to shift again. In a post-pandemic world, some will return to the office, many will remain remote and regardless of where an employee sits, <a href="https://twitter.com/Altimor">Florent Crivello</a>, the founder of Teamflow, has raised millions for what he views as a trillion-dollar idea to make their work day easier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.teamflowhq.com/">Teamflow</a>, formerly Huddle, is creating a virtual headquarters to help distributed teams collaborate and communicate from a singular platform. The startup, which has been in private beta for six months, today announced it has raised $3.9 million in a seed financing round led by Menlo Ventures&#8217; Naomi Ionita.</p>
<p>It’s good timing, as Crivello notes, as the competition is &#8220;red hot.&#8221; There are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/virtual-hqs-race-to-win-over-a-remote-work-fatigued-market/">dozens of other virtual HQ platforms</a>, some venture-backed and some bootstrapped, similarly mixing gamification and productivity into a service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I think every engineer and every tech person in the Valley has been having a very first-hand experience of this problem over the last year,” Crivello said.</p>
<p>Crivello, who previously led teams at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> sees Teamflow’s focus on virtual work, instead of virtual socializing, as its competitive advantage against other platforms. Competitors include <a href="https://branch.gg/">Branch</a>, which has a more social feel, and Hopin, a platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/hopin-raises-125m-for-its-online-events-platform-on-the-back-of-surging-growth/">last valued at $2 billion,</a> which produces digital conferences.</p>
<p>“We’re not Pokémon kind of fun,” he said. “We’re still very work-focused.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2092771" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/horizontal-screen-comparison-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="436" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/horizontal-screen-comparison-2.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/horizontal-screen-comparison-2.png?resize=150,64 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/horizontal-screen-comparison-2.png?resize=300,128 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/horizontal-screen-comparison-2.png?resize=768,327 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/horizontal-screen-comparison-2.png?resize=680,290 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/horizontal-screen-comparison-2.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>A quick tour through Teamflow illustrates its emphasis on productivity over aesthetic. When you enter the virtual space, you’re greeted with a sidebar of options ranging from white boards, countdown timers, and soon integrations with Notion and Google Docs.</p>
<p>Crivello views Teamflow as being a response to the very “app-centric” world of remote work right now. The platform can be the collaboration layer that brings all the apps out of unorganized tab hell and into one place.</p>

<p>Teamflow uses spatial technology to give employees the feel of spontaneity. If you walk — or toggle — past a co-worker, you’ll be able to join in conversation. The farther you move, the less you hear. There are also breakout rooms where people can enter to have focused, invite-only meetings.</p>
<p>The product has shown some signs of growth since launching its beta. There is 30% growth in hours on the platform week over week, bringing a total of over 50,000 hours of user testing into the platform experience. There are 1,000 users on the waitlist.</p>
<p>“We believe that we are this thing you open in the morning and leave open all day,” Crivello said.</p>
<p>While Teamflow is focusing heavily on productivity, user design does matter when you’re trying to convince consumers to spend an entire work day on your app. Teamflow will need to make more investments in its experience to give it the feel and culture of a virtual HQ, versus another place for employees to spend screen time. It&#8217;s why some competitors are opting for a gamified approach.</p>
<p>Any virtual HQ company will have to convince users to exist passively on its platform for a meaningful amount of time, every single day.</p>
<p>If all goes well, Teamflow is looking to be a remote work solution that can replace Slack and Zoom. Crivello says that he has “several customers” who have stopped using both apps altogether, and Teamflow is currently building an internal chat feature that rivals Slack.</p>
<p>The cost for a subscription per starts at $15 a month, according to the <a href="https://www.teamflowhq.com/pricing">most recent pricing information. </a></p>
<p>“There’s so much more to remote work collaboration than communication,” Crivello said. Slack and Zoom’s primary features are connecting employees to each other to talk; while he hopes that Teamflow allows employees to talk and work in one place.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the opportunity for a platform that can get widespread adoption around distributed teams is grandiose. Pandemic or not, Teamflow thinks that the world has experienced a tipping point that will bring distributed work mainstream. Founders will be looking for solutions to keep their teams happy and productivity high.</p>
<p>“Now, if you don’t offer remote work, you’re at a competitive disadvantage [as a company],” Crivello said.</p>
<p>The beauty of early-stage startups is that long-term success doesn’t need to be obvious from the get go. Yet, when it comes to Teamflow, or any virtual HQ platform, the validation will be simple to prove (or disprove) the moment that post-pandemic consumer habits materialize.</p>
