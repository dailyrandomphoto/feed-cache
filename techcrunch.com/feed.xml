										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">So Plaid now calls itself a payments company. It was only a matter of time, really.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the data and connectivity startup <a href="https://plaid.com/blog/building-a-partner-ecosystem-for-the-future-of-payments/">announced</a> a new <a href="https://plaid.com/plaid-payment-partner-ecosystem/">payments partner ecosystem</a> that will extend its existing payments infrastructure and make ACH bank transfers a more attractive alternative to credit card transactions.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			But the big winners here are merchants, who now have a low-cost alternative to avoid credit card processing fees that cut into their margins.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Before today, most of Plaid’s payments activity centered around improving customer onboarding and account funding through its payment initiation service. But the launch of the payments ecosystem heralds a much deeper integration with the payment flow of its partners and what could be a fundamental reshaping of how certain transactions are made.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why they&#8217;re building the ecosystem and who stands to benefit from it.</p>
<h2>Building a new payments network</h2>
<p>This payments ecosystem is really the culmination of a number of moves the company has made over the years.</p>
<p>First, Plaid enabled data to be connected between fintech apps and financial institutions. It subsequently created an <a href="https://plaid.com/products/identity/">identity product</a> so customers could verify users are who they say they are. Then, it built a tool to <a href="https://plaid.com/products/balance/">check the balance of an account</a> to ensure it has sufficient funds to make a money transfer.</p>
<p>It also added a <a href="https://plaid.com/en-gb/products/payment-initiation/">payments initiation service</a> that leverages the other tools to help customers onboard new users and add funds to their accounts quicker. And finally, it built a tool to <a href="https://plaid.com/signal/">assess the risk of bank transfers</a> and minimize ACH returns.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook has reached a multi-year agreement to pay French publishers for resharing their content on its platforms, it <a href="https://www.facebook.com/journalismproject/facebook-alliance-announce-news-partnership">announced today</a>.</p>
<p>The social media giant said the licensing agreement with the Alliance of national and regional newspapers &#8220;means that people on Facebook will be able to continue uploading and sharing news stories freely amongst their communities, whilst also ensuring that the copyright of our publishing partners is protected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook declined to specify how much it&#8217;s paying for the arrangement with l’Alliance de la presse d&#8217;information générale (APIG) in France when we asked. But in a blog post trumpeting the deal it wrote: &#8220;After constructive negotiations, this solution will further our investment in the news industry, and strengthen the news experience for both people and publishers on Facebook.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222140" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The blog post also specifies that it will be investing &#8220;at least&#8221; a billion dollars to support media companies over the next three years &#8212; however that&#8217;s a collective pot not a France-only pot. So who is getting what exactly &#8212; and where &#8212; remains unclear.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s largesse in France is not voluntary: The development relates to EU law which was updated to reform digital copyright rules <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/european-parliament-votes-for-controversial-copyright-reform/">back in 2019</a> to, among other tweaks, extend neighbouring rights to snippets of publishers’ content in response to criticism from the newspaper industry that adtech giants were freeloading off quality journalism that users of their platforms share.</p>
<p>France has been at the forefront of transposing the EU&#8217;s digital copyright reform into national law but the amended rules are set to apply across the bloc — so adtech giants like Facebook will need to strike multiple deals to cover the region. Hence that &#8220;at least&#8221; $1BN pot.</p>
<p>Google, meanwhile, already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/google-inks-agreement-in-france-on-paying-publishers-for-news-reuse/">reached a deal</a> with news publishers in France at the start of this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However it quickly came under scrutiny by the country’s competition watchdog over how it had approached negotiations with publishers. And this summer the French authority <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">fined Google $592M</a> for breaching an order related to the process — accusing it of failing to conduct good faith negotiations and withholding key information relevant to determine payments.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="INdN4WL0bd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">Google fined $592M in France for breaching antitrust order to negotiate copyright fees for news snippets</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google fined $592M in France for breaching antitrust order to negotiate copyright fees for news snippets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/embed/#?secret=INdN4WL0bd" data-secret="INdN4WL0bd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>France&#8217;s competition watchdog was also unhappy that Google tried to unilaterally impose terms on publishers, seeking to push them to agree to a global news licensing product it has devised, called Publisher Curated News, rather than negotiate local terms, as the law requires.</p>
<p>It’s not clear if the authority’s aggressive enforcement against Google concentrated minds at Facebook to ink its own deal with French publishers &#8212; not least because the amount it’s paying for content resharing isn’t being disclosed &#8212; but it probably helped.</p>
<p>The French publishing alliance group who’s members have agreed terms with Facebook said only that the deal would generate “significant financing”, particularly emphasising the revenue uplift it would generate for its smallest members.</p>
<p>&#8220;This first step in the concrete implementation of neighboring rights shows that solidarity between publishers is key to efficiently defend their interests,&#8221; added Pierre Louette, chairman of the Alliance and CEO of Groupe Les Echos – Le Parisien, in a statement.</p>
<p>Also today, Facebook announced that it will be launching a French news service in January — which it said will give users “a dedicated space to access content from trusted and reputable news sources&#8221; — dialling up its efforts to showcase professional journalism on its platform as a direct result of legislation requiring it to pay for new reuse.</p>
<p>It’s a far cry from recent events in Australia &#8212; where, earlier this year, lawmakers were debating similar legislation related to paying for news content aggregation and reuse. And during that legislative push Facebook temporarily shut down news sharing in the county altogether — along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers/">a whole bunch of other bona fide information sources</a>, seemingly as a sort of &#8216;chaotic evil&#8217; lobbying strategy to try to scare the country&#8217;s lawmakers into abandoning the idea.</p>
<p>What actually happened, though, was Australian lawmakers went ahead and passed a news bargaining code that applies to Facebook and Google this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/after-facebooks-news-flex-australia-passes-bargaining-code-for-platforms-and-publishers/">February</a>.</p>
<p>And deals to pay for content reuse in Australia were <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/australias-nine-entertainment-signs-content-deal-with-facebook-google-2021-05-31/">duly struck</a> between the pair and a number of publishers and broadcasters down under.</p>
<p>So the writing seems to be on the wall for adtech platforms getting a free pass to monetize attention generated by professional news content that&#8217;s passing over their platforms. As other countries outside the EU see big tech&#8217;s wallet being unlocked to pay for news reuse through changes to the law they will surely follow.</p>
<p>But as steady payments flow from tech giants to newsrooms &#8212; last year<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/google-to-pay-out-1b-to-publishers-to-license-content-for-new-google-news-showcase/"> Google also announced a $1BN pot to pay for news licensing</a> &#8212; democracy watchers may have reason to be concerned about dominant Internet platforms becoming a revenue source for a &#8216;free press&#8217;.</p>
<p>Both Google and Facebook are certainly wasting no time milking the publicity opportunity &#8212; suddenly claiming their platforms can now be relied upon as sources of &#8220;trusted and reliable news&#8221;. (Instead of, y&#8217;know, the outrage-driving clickbait and disinformation they have so often been found amplifying for a profit.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Our partnership with Alliance proves the benefits of a strong collaboration,&#8221; gushes Facebook&#8217;s blog post. &#8220;Likewise, we’ve been encouraged by the progress that’s been made elsewhere in Europe, and we hope for continued, constructive conversations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Developments it points to on that front are the recent launch of Facebook News in Germany, with new partners including Axel Springer, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Handelsblatt and Tagesspiegel.</p>
<p>In the U.K., it also notes that it has entered into agreements with a number of publishers, including Conde Nast, The Economist, Guardian Media Group and Hearst.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">With the increase in attention on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues over the past few years, it’s easy for companies to assume that we’ve reached the crest of the ESG wave. However, we are only at the early stages — an ESG tsunami is headed toward Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The increased attention on ESG issues has been across a much broader spectrum than just companies in the technology sector. This has largely been driven by broader societal trends, such as the focus on climate change. However, the ESG wave at companies, particularly public companies, is being accelerated by demands by various investor classes (including pension funds as well as a younger generation of individual investors) to focus more attention on such issues.</p>
<p>As a result, institutions that are trying to attract capital from these investors, such as mutual funds, venture capital funds and hedge funds, must increase their focus on the ESG dimension to stay competitive.</p>
<p>While the increase in focus on ESG has been gradual over the past few years, the level of investor influence on ESG issues took a step function forward with successful campaigns by shareholder activists at energy companies during the spring of 2021, most prominently a prominent proxy contest led by Engine No. 1.</p>
<p>For the first time, investor pressure related to an ESG issue (in this case, climate change), directly led to substantial turnover in the board of a public company. Activist shareholders are tapping into new and powerful ESG themes as leverage in their activist campaigns to change control and strategy at public companies.</p>
<h2>Is the technology sector next?</h2>
<p>Historically, the pattern of investor pressure on governance issues (the “G” in ESG) in public companies is to successively tackle issue after issue, winning on one issue and then moving on to the next. One good example of this is the migration of public companies to have annual elections for all directors for a one-year term rather than staggered elections of a portion of the directors for a three-year term — a so-called “classified board.”</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			An institutional investor that overlooks an ESG-themed activism campaign may risk criticism for disregarding client priorities and even lose out on future investment from ESG-focused investors.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In 2007, 55% of the U.S. incorporated public companies in the S&amp;P 1500 had a classified board. By 2021, after years of governance campaigns by shareholders, this was reduced to 26% of S&amp;P 1500 companies, with the classified board almost extinct at the largest public companies that comprise a larger percentage of investors&#8217; portfolio. Thus, from an investor perspective, the push to achieve annually elected boards is almost entirely resolved and the glare of the investor spotlight moves to focus on other issues.</p>
<p>We expect the same scenario to play out here. At a recent conference, Aeisha Mastagni, a portfolio manager at CalSTRS and one of the architects of Engine No. 1’s proxy contest this spring, stated that she hopes the contest would serve as a wake-up call for all companies across all industries, not just for energy companies. So if targeting climate change in the energy sector was an obvious first choice, the question now becomes “Who’s next?”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">When you think of today’s internet landscape, Google’s overwhelming market share immediately comes to mind.</p>
<p>The latest reports show that Google accounts for <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/">nearly 87%</a> of the global search market, while Chrome makes up <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/544400/market-share-of-internet-browsers-desktop/">over 67%</a> of the global browser market, touting <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/543218/worldwide-internet-users-by-browser/">2.65 billion users worldwide</a>. As such, any startups creating online tools must consider themselves a partner of the tech giant in some capacity, but this market control also means that Google can leverage its browser dominance and change regulations as they please.</p>
<p>In fact, Google has woven certain restrictions on online startups into the fabric of Chrome for the past decade. Years ago, Google started enforcing a “single purpose extension” policy, requiring developers to limit their extension to one narrow focus or browser function.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220359" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>More recently, Google has rolled out <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/mv2-transition/">plans</a> for Manifest V3 — its new specification for building Chrome extensions that strives to improve security and privacy for users. Essentially, the Chrome Web Store will no longer accept new extensions built using the previous Manifest V2 guidelines starting in January 2022, and by the following year, any and all existing programs that fail to comply with Manifest V3 regulations will shut down.</p>
<p>In this case, some startups are facing a life-or-death scenario — either spend the time and resources adapting their product to Manifest V3 or completely cease to exist within Chrome. Ghostery, my employer, is facing this challenge as acutely as any.</p>
<p>While these roadblocks may seem disheartening for some, Google is listening with open ears, eager to hear how this might impact individual players in the space. It even extended the rollout timeline in an effort to gather more developer insights, and startups should take full advantage of this delay to make their specific migration challenges known.</p>
<p>This Chrome update is just one example of how startups that are innovating online could have the rug pulled out from under them at any moment, and as such need to always allocate resources to both staying abreast of these policies and having the proper engineers on deck to navigate these granular changes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nonetheless, having your core business hosted on the internet comes with undeniable benefits like widespread visibility, easy installation and access to an eager user base. If tech giants like Google are willing to work alongside startups on finding the best solution for all parties (and it certainly looks like they are), the onus is on smaller companies to take advantage of these open communication channels and advocate on behalf of their product offerings.</p>
<h2>Look to your network for support</h2>
<p>Luckily, each individual startup doesn’t have to face the shifting internet landscape alone. With a range of players working within the same ecosystem, companies have a vast network of related businesses to tap into for support and advice. Instead of feeling siloed into their own challenges, startups in the online space should feel united by the constant change that impacts all companies within that ecosystem.</p>
<p>For example, we joined the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webextensions/">W3C group</a> for web extensions in the midst of navigating Manifest V3. In this community, we can share our use cases and collaborate with other impacted companies on adjusting our technologies to align with the latest guidelines. By pooling resources and engaging in this cross collaboration, we can troubleshoot early in the adapting process.</p>
<p>Whether it’s seeking out similar groups or even consulting your network of founders and business leaders directly, it’s vital to lean on the startup community in these transitory periods for both product and general business direction.</p>
<h2>Become adaptable in more ways than one</h2>
<p>In addition to proactively allocating resources for adapting your hero product, startups that are innovating online need to constantly reevaluate their product road map and look for unique opportunities to diversify their offerings.</p>
<p>No two years in the history of the internet are the same, but one thing that remains steady is the desire for individuals to have customization options within this ecosystem — nimble startups are primed to offer the latest and greatest solutions, from e-commerce tools to password protection systems, privacy suites and more.</p>
<p>For some companies, this could mean investing more time in product development outside Chrome and researching the capabilities that Firefox, Safari or other alternative browsers could provide. Because each tech giant has their own policies related to browser customization, startups could open themselves up to a whole new user base and build unique features that are compatible with distinct systems.</p>
<p>Startups can also expand into the mobile sector and experiment with how their online innovations could work within the iOS or Android landscape. Ultimately, having a product scope that extends across the various corners of our online life, from in-browser to mobile applications, will make your company resilient against the constant shifts of our online world, and it’s much easier to build this resiliency if diversification is a part of your business plan from the very beginning.</p>
<h2>Embrace the constant of change</h2>
<p>Even though startups creating online tools and programs are constantly challenged with policy changes, regulatory shifts and market demands, those that aren’t afraid to collaborate with Big Tech and pursue an adaptable product strategy will always find a way to continue on their path toward providing consumers with the best products and experiences possible.</p>
<p>Staying steadfast in your mission and being willing to modify your approach along the way will allow you to successfully innovate for years to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After steadily <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">expanding</a> access over the course of the year, Twitter announced today its audio chatroom feature known as Twitter Spaces is now open to anyone who wants to host a Space across iOS and Android. Earlier this year, the company had limited access to hosting Spaces to accounts <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">with at least 600 followers</a>, saying that it found these accounts would be more likely to have a good experience because they had an existing audience.</p>
<p>Now, Twitter says the option will be offered to all its mobile users on the Twitter app. Users are able to start their first Space by tapping on the Compose button &#8212; the button they would otherwise use to post a tweet, according to the graphic shared alongside today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">the time has arrived &#8212; we’re now rolling out the ability for everyone on iOS and Android to host a Space</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222066" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>if this is your first time hosting, welcome! here’s a refresher on how <a href="https://t.co/cLH8z0bocy">pic.twitter.com/cLH8z0bocy</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Spaces (@TwitterSpaces) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1451239134798942208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter was earlier experimenting with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/twitter-redesigns-its-mobile-app-to-make-spaces-the-center-tab/">giving Spaces its own tab in the app</a>, but that has not broadly rolled out and isn&#8217;t shown in the current image shared with the announcement. In fact, Twitter users who are in the beta test for another new feature called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/twitter-communities/">Communities</a> will instead see the Communities button in the center of their app&#8217;s navigation row. Twitter says the dedicated Spaces tab was recently extended to more people in English on iOS, but is not yet available on Android.</p>
<p>Twitter has been rapidly iterating on Spaces since its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-launches-its-voice-based-spaces-social-networking-feature-into-beta-testing/">launch into beta last year.</a> More recently, it added the ability for Spaces hosts to add up to two co-hosts and up to 10 speakers, allowing for larger events with more moderators. It also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/">shut down</a> its Stories feature, called Fleets, this summer, which made Spaces the only product that appears in the top row of the Twitter mobile app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since announcing Spaces, a number of major platforms have launched their own audio networking products following the breakout social networking hit app Clubhouse, which became a popular pastime during the height of the pandemic. Now Spaces and Clubhouse compete with Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/facebook-officially-launches-live-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-in-the-u-s/">Live Audio Rooms</a>, Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">Greenroom</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">Discord</a>, Reddit, Public.com and others.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">For Manu Bansal, founder of <a href="https://www.lightup.ai/">Lightup.ai</a>, raising a seed round from a16z was not a very difficult journey. His previous company, Uhana, launched in 2016, was backed by NEA and had been acquired by VMWare in three years.</p>
<p>So he had demonstrated ability when it came to not just building a product, but building a company, attracting a team, generating revenues and most importantly, getting it to a good exit.</p>
<p>But a challenge came up in 2021 as he was raising the seed round — the venture funding market got white-hot. In 2016, total VC investments in the U.S. were about $80 billion. By 2020, the capital deployed had ballooned to $164 billion, according to PitchBook NVCA. By all means, 2021 will top this trend.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">

			“A sophisticated investor does not follow a fad or measure your progress against generic templates.”					</blockquote>

	</p>
<p>Indeed, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">startups have never had it so good</a>. The list of superlatives describing this insane bull market is getting longer. Silicon Valley is the Walmart on Thanksgiving Day sale.</p>
<p>Founders can raise money fast, really fast. Ask Bansal, inundated by investors and ready to do a preemptive up round just three months after he closed his seed round.</p>
<p>But this can be a gotcha, he warns.</p>
<h2>The vicious preemptive trap</h2>
<p>As the supply of capital grows, competition heats up, especially for people like Bansal. The number of unsolicited inbounds grows, with each attempt to get the founders&#8217; attention getting more crazy. Often, the easiest way investors get the founders&#8217; attention is to pump up the valuation. Up round, anyone?</p>
<p>But the dark side of this market can become a vicious preemptive trap, a cycle where an A round happens too early and a B round follows within a few months and the C round is not far behind.</p>
<p>“A company&#8217;s metrics cannot move materially in such short spans. As one of my investors says, figuring out go-to-market (GTM) has time constants involved,” said Bansal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211021005822/en/Today-at-Amazon-Accelerate-Amazon-Launches-New-Local-Selling-Capabilities-to-Help-Small-Businesses-Grow-by-Reaching-More-Customers-in-Their-Area">rolling out</a> &#8220;Local Selling,&#8221; a set of services that allow local and regional retailers to offer both in-store pickup and fast delivery to nearby customers.</p>
<p>With this new option, sellers can offer in-store pickup for products and services to shoppers in specific ZIP codes. In some instances, customers will be able to purchase items from sellers for same-day pickup at the business’s local retail location.</p>
<p>Products that are available for pickup will have a &#8220;store pickup&#8221; tab on the item page. Once customers place an order, they’ll receive a notification when their item is ready for pickup. When the item is ready, customers will have a five-day pickup window to collect their orders.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2222028" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Shoppers can also choose local delivery, which will be facilitated by the business itself. Once you select the &#8220;arranged delivery&#8221; option at checkout, the local retailer will contact you to schedule the exact date and time for the delivery. Some sellers may also offer installation services that you can add on top of your order.</p>
<p>Amazon Local Selling is now available from both national and local retailers, including Mavis Discount Tire, Sears Hometown Store, 4 Wheel Parts, Electronic Express, Best Buy, Appliance Connection, Mattress Warehouse, Beach Camera, Adorama, DataVision, Exclusive Furniture, World Wide Stereo, MODIA, Focus Camera and others. The company says Local Selling will expand later this year and during 2022, as sellers who are interested in joining the program are able to apply to do so starting today.</p>
<p>“Our research shows that many customers will opt for local pickup when given the choice. This new capability is an exciting way to help sellers reach and delight more customers with great products and convenience,” said Jim Adkins, the vice president of recreational and vocational categories at Amazon, in a statement.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Amazon previously tested in-store pickup options in 2019 with the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/amazon-launches-counter-in-store-pick-up-in-the-us-starting-with-100-rite-aid-locations/">&#8220;Counter,&#8221;</a> a service where Amazon shoppers could arrange to collect packages at retail locations. The service essentially saw the company partner with retailers to arrange pickup counters in their stores for orders placed online.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With this latest launch, Amazon is clearly looking to get orders to customers faster by leveraging its third-party network and their physical stores. It’s a way for Amazon to keep customers on its own marketplace as opposed to retailers’ websites. The launch also comes at a time when curbside pickup options have increased since the start of the pandemic. Companies like Walmart and Target have offered the option for quite some time now, as Amazon is gearing up to further compete with big box stores and retailers with its newest offering. It&#8217;s also worth noting that Shopify offers merchants on its platform in-store pickup options so this could be an attempt to better compete with that as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If challenging the status quo was easy, we’d see a lot more of it. In the world of smartphones, this means daring to think outside the rectangle, a form factor that has been the default for more than a decade and a half. Slowly but surely amid stagnant smartphone sales, companies have been testing the water.</p>
<p>There have, in recent years, been a number of evolutionary dead ends. ZTE’s Axon M comes to mind. A valiant, if deeply flawed, attempt that was, for all intents and purposes, two smartphones stuck together. Samsung’s folding phones seemed destined for a similar fate early on.</p>
<p>After a few generations, the company has turned things around, even if longevity and mainstream implications of both the line and the category broadly are still something of a question. I can genuinely say, for instance, that I’ve enjoyed my time with the Galaxy Z Flip 3. It works as intended, isn’t overly unwieldy like many of its folding brethren and is honestly the first foldable device I would recommend.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221991" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Like Samsung, Microsoft has been well positioned to push the edges of the category. The company long ago abandoned hopes of being a mainstream mobile powerhouse. It’s not for lack of trying, of course. But not even its $7.2 billion Nokia acquisition could keep those dreams alive. Instead, the company found hardware solace in the Surface line, a modest success that has produced some genuinely compelling form factors.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221719" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221719" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2221719" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0476.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221719" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The first Surface Duo was born out of that line, which prided itself in thinking outside the standard PC/tablet form factor. At an event in October 2019, the company introduced the dual-screen Neo laptop and the smaller Duo, a dual-screen Android handset. The former never made it into production. In May, Microsoft confirmed the death of Windows 10X and, seemingly, hopes of the Neo along with it.</p>
<p>When the Duo launched last fall, it was one of the year’s most eagerly anticipated devices. Like ZTE, Microsoft circumvented the need for a foldable display by fusing two screens together with a hinge. With nearly a decade of Surface hardware under its belt, however, the company had clearly created a far more elegant solution. But like the Axon M before it, the original Duo largely disappointed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It wasn’t a failure from a hardware perspective, exactly (though sales may tell a different story), but it was plagued with too many issues to come anywhere near justifying its $1,400 asking price. The lack of an external camera, buggy software and the decision not to include 5G were among the major pain points in a device loaded with pain points. First-generation products are going to be imperfect &#8212; that’s the plight of the early adopter.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221725" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221725" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2221725" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0487.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221725" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>But when asking consumers to shell out that much money for a new device, there are certain levels of quality one anticipates &#8212; ones the original Duo failed to meet. Much to its credit, however, Microsoft listened. Obviously that doesn’t help those chosen few who purchased the original product, but the company is clearly committed to doing better by future customers. In that sense, the Surface Duo 2 is more than just an update to the original device &#8212; it’s an effort to correct some of its predecessor’s biggest mistakes.</p>
<p>You could make a fairly convincing argument that Microsoft would have saved itself a lot of heartache had the first Duo been closer to this new model. The addition of the Snapdragon 888 with 5G, a rear-facing triple camera setup, narrowing the gap between the dual-screens and the continued improvement of software are important steps in the right direction. But the Duo 2 is still far from the sort of device you can heartily recommend. The next couple of generations &#8212; should Microsoft continue to invest in the device &#8212; will determine whether the issues with the device are fundamental or something that simply required continued refinement.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221724" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221724" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2221724" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0485.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0485.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0485.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0485.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0485.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0485.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0485.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0485.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0485.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221724" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>The software, which can still be buggy switching between displays, is likely the latter. Along with developing its own dual-screen software, Microsoft is utilizing much of the work Google has done with companies like Samsung to create a version of Android that works on foldables. Of course, developing for a foldable and a dual-screen form factor is not a perfect one-to-one. But given Microsoft’s immense resources, perfecting that experience is likely a matter of how much time and money it’s willing to invest &#8212; that, in turn, is a product of perceived interest in the device.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2222004,2222005,2222007,2222008,2222009,2222010,2222011"]</p>
<p>Where the original Duo relied on an internal camera for shooting, the 2 now has three rear-facing cameras: a 12-megapixel wide, 12-megapixel telephoto and 16-megapixel ultra-wide. That certainly sounds good on the face of it &#8212; and it’s undoubtedly an improvement. But the camera app is barebones and the picture quality was consistently sub-par compared to significantly less expensive systems. The Duo struggled in mixed and low light more than one would hope on a $1,500 system in 2021.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221721" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221721" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2221721" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CMC_0479.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221721" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater</p></div></p>
<p>Microsoft isn’t as invested in mobile photography as Samsung, Apple or Google. That certainly shows here, but it’s also something that can be improved upon in future generations. Ultimately, however, the camera leads us to one of the potentially fundamental issues with the device. Among the reasons the original Duo relied on an internal camera is a pragmatic issue of form factor: flipping the device open with the camera on one side and the second display serving as a viewfinder on the other.</p>
<p>The company has actually done a decent job working with the camera bump, so the rear of the displays sit together at a slight angle. But actually using the thing is a pain. It’s somewhat handy having the second screen to display the shots after they’re taken, but the process is unwieldy &#8212; more akin to attempting to photograph something using a tablet.</p>
<p>In spite of some seemingly unavoidable flaws like this, the Duo 2 is a nice piece of hardware, and the addition of features like Microsoft Pen support and dual-screen gaming, which arrived on the original Duo back in May, get the product closer to where it should be. Other nice touches like the Glance Bar, which shows glimpses of notifications in the gap between screens when the device is closed, demonstrate how Microsoft is continuing to work cleverly with the form factor it has. But with continued issues and an asking price of $1,500, any hope of the product becoming truly mainstream feel &#8212; at best &#8212; multiple generations away.</p>

<p>For investors, the proposed federal investments for zero-carbon infrastructure, renewable energy, electric vehicles and climate innovations will provide the policy signals we and other investment firms need to confidently fund breakthrough technologies.</p>
<p>Once investors know that the government is serious about taking action to bring the economy into the 21st century and competing with nations already aggressively deploying these technologies, climate and tech investors will increase commitments in these areas.</p>
<p>For example, take transportation electrification. Transportation now emits a greater volume of greenhouse gases than any other U.S. sector, with carbon exhaust from cars, trucks, airlines and shipping adding up to <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions">29% of total U.S. emissions</a>. Despite the temporary reductions in travel-related emissions during the pandemic, transportation emissions were still climbing at last measure and are likely to keep growing. This should alarm us all.</p>
<p>But with the reconciliation bill’s tax incentives for purchasing electric vehicles making these cars much more affordable for Americans &#8212; up to a $12,500 credit if you buy an EV made in the U.S. &#8212; plus the bill’s incentives for manufacturing and deploying EV charging infrastructure, we’d see rapid adoption of clean electric transportation and a steep drop in transportation emissions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Couple the transportation incentives with the reconciliation package’s Clean Electricity Performance Program (CEPP), which encourages utilities to hasten their steady transition to clean energy &#8212; from a national average of 40% today to 80% by 2030 through incentive payments and penalties &#8212; we’d see a precipitous drop in overall emissions.</p>
<p>Transportation and electric power together currently account for more than half of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. These provisions will spur a broad energy generation transition that can also power the EV cars, trucks and fleets of the future.</p>
<p>As investors, we view the budget reconciliation as a long-term catalyst for sustainable growth, and growth translates to jobs. The Economic Policy Institute <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/iija-budget-reconciliation-jobs/">estimates</a> that the budget reconciliation provisions, on their own, could create up to 3.2 million new jobs per year. Through our existing investments, we have seen firsthand how infusions of capital, from both public and private sources, can stimulate job creation, from hourly wage positions all the way up to highly skilled engineering roles. The budget reconciliation will create economic opportunities for all.</p>
<p>There’s clearly a market for climate action: The Global Commission on the Economy and Climate <a href="https://newclimateeconomy.report/">found</a> that bold climate action globally could deliver $26 trillion in economic benefits through 2030. We need this funding to go as far and as fast as possible to avoid a global rise in temperatures of 1.5 degrees C, which experts collectively agree is the tipping point into catastrophic, irreversible climate change. Government policy can both signal and pave the way for broader private-sector investments, as it did decades before with pollution legislation.</p>
<p>And what will happen to these investment dollars if Congress does not pass the infrastructure and budget reconciliation packages? The cost of inaction is far higher than the costs outlined in the budget reconciliation legislation. The climate measures in the bill add up to $700 billion over a decade, or $70 billion a year.</p>
<p>Climate change-induced extreme weather disasters in the U.S. alone cost <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/">roughly $100 billion each year</a>. If measures are not passed, individual citizens will keep paying higher tax and energy bills. Meanwhile, investors will instead put money into companies and sectors in other geographies that are focused on next-generation renewable energy, EV charging and other technologies supported by policy and will look for clean infrastructure plays on other continents where their investment dollars go farther and create faster returns.</p>
<p>In a no-action scenario, the United States will face long-term negative consequences as its economic leadership fades and its OEMs and supply chains gradually lose their position as global leaders. The U.S., as a nation, will in turn lose the financial capacity to mitigate or respond to the devastating local impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>We have an urgent need to address the climate crisis now, with the public and private sectors each maximizing their tools to ensure long-term economic and environmental sustainability. The federal policy tools and opportunities are clear, and the private sector is ready to respond with investment capital.</p>
<p>We urge Congress to pass a budget reconciliation bill and allow its strong climate measures to reap benefits for all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix employees staged a walkout yesterday in response to the company&#8217;s handling of a Dave Chappelle special that premiered on October 5. At the same time, Los Angeles-based trans activist Ashlee Marie Preston hosted a <a href="https://twitter.com/AshleeMPreston/status/1450151113978572800">rally in solidarity</a> with Netflix workers participating in the walkout. Netflix stars like Jonathan Van Ness of &#8220;Queer Eye&#8221; and Mason Alexander Park of &#8220;Cowboy Bebop&#8221; and &#8220;The Sandman&#8221; expressed their solidarity in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnbE18-r_i0">a video</a> made for the rally, alongside other Hollywood stars and trans advocates like Angelica Ross, Jameela Jamil, Kate Bornstein, Our Lady J, Sara Ramirez, Peppermint and Colton Haynes.</p>
<div dir="ltr">
<p>&#8220;We value our trans colleagues and allies, and understand the deep hurt that’s been caused. We respect the decision of any employee who chooses to walk out, and recognize we have much more work to do both within <span class="il">Netflix</span> and in our content,&#8221; a Netflix spokesperson said in a statement provided to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The exact turnouts of the employee walkout and solidarity rally are unclear, but there was enough hype around the event that Preston <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CVOTn2Gv4Uz/">preemptively moved it</a> to a location with more space.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221200" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
</div>
<div dir="ltr"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dnbE18-r_i0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>The employees who participated in the walkout want Netflix to &#8220;adopt measures to avoid future instances of platforming transphobia and hate speech,&#8221; they wrote in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733098/netflix-trans-employees-demands-dave-chappelle-walkout">a letter</a>. They want Netflix to address a list of demands in the categories of content investment, employee relations and safety, and harm reduction.</p>
<p>When it comes to content, the group wants Netflix to increase its funding of trans and non-binary talent, bring employee resource groups into conversations about potentially harmful content, hire more trans and non-binary content executives and revise internal procedures around commissioning and releasing sensitive works. In terms of employee relations and safety, they want Netflix to recruit trans people, especially BIPOC, for leadership roles, allow employees to remove themselves from previous promotional content like allyship and diversity videos, and eliminate references and imagery of transphobic titles and talent in the workplace. For harm reduction, they want Netflix to acknowledge the company&#8217;s harm in platforming transphobic content, add a disclaimer before transphobic titles, boost promotion for trans-affirming titles on the platform and suggest trans-affirming content alongside those flagged as anti-trans.</p>
<p>The demands do not include removing the <a href="https://www.vox.com/22722357/dave-chappelle-the-closer-netflix-backlash-controversy-transphobic">controversial</a> Dave Chappelle special from Netflix, which sparked backlash from some employees and Netflix subscribers concerned with the company&#8217;s platforming of transphobic speech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When asked in an interview with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/netflix-ted-sarandos-dave-chappelle-walkout-1235033910/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, co-CEO Ted Sarandos didn&#8217;t say whether he would meet the group&#8217;s demands.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the last couple of days, it’s been just listening to folks and hearing out how they’re feeling and what they’d like. I want to say that we are deeply committed to inclusion on screen and behind the camera and in our workplace,&#8221; Sarandos told the Hollywood Reporter.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>He seemed doubtful that he would meet their demand to add a disclaimer about transphobia before Chapelle&#8217;s special.</p>
<p>&#8220;The content is age-restricted already for language, and Dave himself gives a very explicit warning at the beginning of the show, so I don’t think it would be appropriate in this case,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Before Netflix released the Chappelle special, employees <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-staff-raised-concerns-about-dave-chappelle-special-before-release?srnd=equality&amp;sref=ExbtjcSG">raised concerns</a> about potentially harmful anti-trans jokes in the show — Chapelle <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/oct/07/dave-chappelle-transgender-netflix-special-backlash">declared</a> that he’s “Team TERF,” referring to trans-exclusionary radical feminists, who oppose the movement for transgender rights. But Sarandos doubled down on his defense of the special, writing <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/ted-sarandos-dave-chappelle-defense-1235088647/">an internal email</a> that “content on screen doesn’t directly translate to real-world harm.” After receiving backlash, he later told The Hollywood Reporter, &#8220;I 100% believe that content on screen can have impact in the real world, positive and negative.&#8221;</p>

<p>Netflix Senior Software Engineer Terra Field, who is transgender, tweeted a <a href="https://twitter.com/RainofTerra/status/1445914236668895236">viral thread</a> about the Chappelle special.</p>
<p>&#8220;We aren&#8217;t complaining about &#8216;being offended,&#8217; and we don&#8217;t have &#8216;thin skin,'&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;What we object to is the harm of that content like this does to the trans community (especially trans people of color) and VERY specifically Black trans women.&#8221;</p>
<p>Field was later suspended, along with two other employees, for attempting to attend an online meeting of top executives, according to <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/dave-chappelle-netflix-suspends-trans-employee-1235086394/">reports</a>. But she was <a href="https://twitter.com/RainofTerra/status/1448097310026747908">reinstated</a> after Netflix found that a director had shared a link to the meeting with her, implying that it was okay to attend.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Several things can be true. Netflix is an incredible, life changing company. And Netflix fucked up majorly.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Soon after, Netflix&#8217;s trans employee resource group began organizing a walkout. But B. Pagels-Minor, the organizer of the walkout and global lead of both the Black and Trans employee resource groups, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/netflix-fired-the-employee-who-organized-a-walkout-in-solidarity-with-trans-workers/">fired on Friday</a>. Their termination sparked more backlash against Netflix.</p>
<p>“We have let go of an employee for sharing confidential, commercially sensitive information outside the company,” a Netflix representative told TechCrunch last week. “We understand this employee may have been motivated by disappointment and hurt with Netflix, but maintaining a culture of trust and transparency is core to our company.”</p>
<p>TechCrunch was able to reach B. Pagels-Minor, but they did not offer a comment.</p>
<p>The leaked information in question appears to be some internal metrics on “The Closer” that appeared in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-staff-raised-concerns-about-dave-chappelle-special-before-release?srnd=equality&amp;sref=ExbtjcSG">story by Bloomberg</a>, which reported that Netflix spent $24.1 million for the one-off special. Meanwhile, the company spent $3.9 million on Bo Burnham’s recent comedy special “Inside” and $21.4 million on the buzzy, nine-episode “Squid Game,” Netflix’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-says-squid-game-is-its-biggest-series-launch-ever?srnd=pursuits-vp">best-ever debut.</a></p>
<p>Netflix told TechCrunch that the employee admitted to sharing the content externally. But Pagels-Minor&#8217;s lawyer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/business/media/netflix-dave-chappelle-employee-walkout.html">told The New York Times</a> this week that “B. categorically denies leaking sensitive information to the press.” A former Netflix employee with knowledge of the situation told TechCrunch that they highly doubt that Pagels-Minor leaked these documents, as they had both been critical of the leaks in public company chats.</p>
<p>Netflix told TechCrunch that its internal access logs showed that only one person viewed sensitive data about the titles mentioned in the Bloomberg article.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Android 12 is now officially available for Google&#8217;s Pixel phones and will slowly roll out to others in the coming months. Chances are, you think of Android as a consumer product, but over the course of the last few years, Google has put a lot of work into making it an enterprise tool, too. It&#8217;s maybe no surprise that with the launch of Android 12, which already includes a number of <a href="https://blog.google/products/android-enterprise/androidenterprise12/">new enterprise features by default</a>, Google is also now announcing a couple of new security-focused initiatives around <a href="https://www.android.com/enterprise/">Android Enterprise</a>, too.</p>
<p>This includes a new bug bounty program, the aptly named <a href="https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/android-rewards/">Android Enterprise Vulnerability Program</a>, which promises up to $250,000 for a full exploit of a Pixel device that runs Android Enterprise.</p>
<p>But Google is also working with its wider partner ecosystem to expand its support for the Zero Trust security model on Android. This means, for example, working with partners like Okta, Ping and ForgeRock to move their authentication workflows from WebView to Chrome <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/custom-tabs/">Custom Tabs</a> on Android. Google has long argued that developers should use Custom Tabs whenever they render content from outside of their own domain, in part for performance reasons, but also because Chrome&#8217;s Safe Browsing features provide additional security.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221905" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;While WebView is a flexible and powerful component for rendering web content, Custom Tabs are more modern and full-featured, allowing identity providers to gather device trust signals, improve employee security and enable single-sign-on across apps and the web<span class="il">,&#8221; explains Rajeev Pathak, a senior product manager</span> at Google, in today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>Google is also extending its Android Management API to make it easier for companies that use Enterprise Mobility Solutions from the likes of Microsoft, Citrix or Google itself to ensure that users &#8220;receive the fastest delivery of all of our enterprise features, with best practices and Android Enterprise Recommended requirements set by default.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European Union lawmakers are mobilizing support for a ban on tracking-based advertising to be added to a new set of Internet rules for the bloc &#8212; which were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">proposed at the back end of last year</a> but are now entering the last stretch of negotiations ahead of becoming pan-EU law.</p>
<p>If they succeed it could have wide-ranging implications for adtech giants like Facebook and Google. And for the holistic health of Internet users&#8217; eyeballs more generally.</p>
<p>The move follows a smorgasbord of concerns raised in recent years over how such creepy ads, which use personal data to decide who sees which marketing message, can negatively impact individuals, businesses and society &#8212; from the risk of discrimination and predatory targeting of vulnerable people and groups; to the amplification of online disinformation and the threat that poses to democratic processes; to the vast underbelly of ad fraud embedded in the current system.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220973" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Gathering so much data about Internet users is not only terrible for people&#8217;s privacy (and wasteful from an environmental perspective, given all the extra data-processing it bakes in), they contend, but tracking opens up a huge attack vector for hackers &#8212; supporting a pipeline of data breaches and security risks, which in turn contravenes key principles of existing EU law (like data minimization).</p>
<p>So arguments in favor of a regional ban are plentiful.</p>
<p>On the flip side, adtech giants Facebook and Google make bank by mining people&#8217;s digital activity and using this surreptitiously sucked up information as a targeting tool to grab attention, darting eyeballs with what they euphemize as &#8220;relevant&#8221; advertising &#8212; meaning ads that use people&#8217;s own information to try to manipulate their behavior for profit.</p>
<p>The powerful pair can easily afford to spend millions lobbying against anything that threatens their tracking-based business models. And they have been doing just that in Europe in recent years, as lawmakers have been working on redrawing the parameters of digital regulations &#8212; along with the tacit (if not very publicly valuable) support of an opaque adtech middleman layer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These are largely faceless (to consumers) entities that benefit from dynamics like the lack of traceability around current ad spending (oh-hi ad fraud!) and arbitrage of quality publishers&#8217; audiences to sell ads against cheap filler content (bye-bye quality journalism!). But that&#8217;s hardly good news for consumers, society or for fair and honest competition, critics say.</p>
<p>While the arguments for banning microtargeting have been getting louder and stronger (with each passing scandal) for years, it&#8217;s fair to say that this remains something of a David vs Goliath battle &#8212; with individual rights, civil society, quality publishers and pro-privacy innovators on one side vs big adtech and the sprawling ecosystem of opaque data-traders and Internet content bottom-feeders that the current Facebook-Google duopoly gives succour to punching down hard on the other.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, high level competition concerns over Facebook and Google&#8217;s power over online advertising is driving increasing scrutiny and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/france-fines-google-268m-for-adtech-abuses-and-gets-interoperability-commitments/">enforcement</a> from antitrust watchdogs in Europe.</p>
<p>But the risk there is regulators could just end up cementing harmful microtargeting &#8212; such as by enforcing increased sharing of people&#8217;s data for ad targeting &#8212; instead of seeking to reboot the market in a way that&#8217;s both healthy for consumers and for healthy digital competition.</p>

<p>So, the next few weeks, really looks like crunch time for anyone rooting for a full reboot of surveillance-based business models.</p>
<p>MEPs in the European Parliament are set to vote on a number of committee reports that contain amendments to the Commission&#8217;s legislative proposals seeking to outlaw or restrict the practice &#8212; with a final plenary vote expected in early November.</p>
<p>Their target is the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA): Incoming EU regulations that contain a range of measures intended to level the playing field between offline and online commerce &#8212; by dialling up accountability on digital businesses and platforms; standardizing elements of governance; and seeking to enforce fairness of business dealing; in the latter case by applying a set of fixed rules to intermediating platform giants like Google and Facebook that play a gatekeeping role over Internet content and/or commerce.</p>
<p>The planned legislation contains a swathe of new rules for how Internet businesses will be able to operate in the EU. But the European Commission, which drafted the proposals, did not include an outright ban on surveillance-based ad business models.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what a number of MEPs are trying to change now.</p>
<p>The Commission sidestepped including a ban in the draft legislation despite pressure from the parliament and other EU institutions to take a tougher line on microtargeting.</p>
<p>There have also been mounting complaints against tracking-based ads under existing EU privacy law (the General Data Protection Regulation; GDPR) &#8212; and a concerning a lack of GDPR enforcement against adtech.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/23/international-coalition-joins-the-call-to-ban-surveillance-advertising/">International backing for a ban on surveillance-based ads</a> has also been growing.</p>
<p>The Commission itself has been actively grappling with related issues &#8212; like how to reduce online disinformation and protect EU elections from interference &#8212; and recently made an<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/europe-to-press-the-adtech-industry-to-help-fight-online-disinformation/"> appeal to the adtech sector</a> to do more to address problematic economic incentives driving the amplification of harmful nonsense.</p>
<p>But although it has said it will be beefing up efforts in those areas it continues to prefer what amounts to a process of adtech industry engagement vs laying down strict legal limits to prohibit such intrusive targeting altogether. So it&#8217;s been left to Europeans&#8217; elected representatives to take a stand against microtargeting.</p>
<p>The next few weeks will be crucial to determining whether the bloc ends up taking the bold but &#8212; many now argue &#8212; necessary step of outlawing surveillance-based advertising.</p>
<p>Alternative forms of Internet advertising are both available and profitable, supporters of a ban say.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that even EU regulators only gave Google the green light to acquire Fitbit at the end of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/europe-clears-google-fitbit-with-a-ten-year-ban-on-using-health-data-for-ads/"> last year</a> after gaining a concession from the tech giant that it would not use Fitbit&#8217;s health data for ad targeting &#8212; for a full ten years.</p>
<p>So if the EU&#8217;s own regulators decided they needed to bake in such extensive precautions before allowing another data-grabbing acquisition by big (ad)tech, it does suggest the fundamental problem here is adtech&#8217;s unfettered use of people&#8217;s data.</p>
<p>If the bloc outlaws microtargeting it would &#8212; conversely &#8212; provide clear impetus for the publishing industry to switch to less intrusive forms of advertising, while simultaneously creating an incentive for increased innovation around pro-privacy business models &#8212; a space where European startups are already among the world leaders.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s a chance for the region to lead in both digital regulations and tech development.</p>

<h2>Growing support for tracking-free ads</h2>
<p>In recent months a coalition of MEPs, civil society organisations and companies from across the EU has been campaigning to end the pervasive tracking advertising industry that dominates the Internet &#8212; organizing under the banner of the <a href="https://trackingfreeads.eu/">Tracking-free Ads Coalition</a>, and most recently <a href="https://trackingfreeads.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Letter-Tracking-free-Ads-Coalition.pdf">writing</a> to 100 of Europe&#8217;s largest advertisers urging them to reconsider their participation in surveillance-based advertising.</p>
<p>The Coalition is also calling on interested parties <a href="https://trackingfreeads.eu/contact/">to join the push</a> to defend fundamental EU rights and counter tracking-based harms.</p>
<p>Although time is now short &#8212; with the window of opportunity for slotting a ban into draft legislation set to close in a few weeks&#8217; (or even days&#8217;) time as the European Parliament has its say on the final shape of the regulations.</p>
<p>The Coalition argues that harms associated with surveillance-based advertising are simply too vast to ignore &#8212; whether it&#8217;s the core erosion of the fundamental right EU citizens have to privacy, or the impact on publishers whose audiences are being arbitraged by big tech and opaque adtech middlemen which in turn undermines quality journalism and supercharges ad fraud.</p>
<p>Media plurality is at threat, they warn.</p>
<p>The group also points out that viable alternatives already exist for funding online content, such as contextual advertising &#8212; used by the likes of pro-privacy search engine DuckDuckGo, which has been profitable for over a decade for example.</p>
<p>DuckDuckGo is one of 14 pro-privacy businesses that have intervened to lobby MEPs on the issue in recent weeks &#8212; along with Vivaldi, Fastmail, Conva, Proton, Tutao, Disconnect, Mojeek, Ecosia, Startpage &amp; StartMai<wbr></wbr>l, Nextcloud, Kobler, Strossle <wbr></wbr>International and Mailfence &#8212; who have written to the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) to express their backing for banning tracking ads.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to the clear privacy issues caused by surveillance-based advertising, it is also detrimental to the business landscape,&#8221; they wrote in their letter to the IMCO committee which makes the case for pro-privacy alternatives to tracking.</p>
<p>&#8220;These practices seriously undermine competition and take revenue away from content creators. Anticompetitive behaviour and effects serve to entrench dominant actors’ positions while complex supply chains and ineffective technologies lead to lost revenues for advertisers and publishers,&#8221; they also argued, adding: &#8220;Although we recognize that advertising is an important source of revenue for content creators and publishers online, this does not justify the massive commercial surveillance systems set up in attempts to &#8216;show the right ad to the right people&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Other forms of advertising technologies exist, which do not depend on spying on consumers, and alternative models can be implemented without significantly affecting revenue. On the contrary &#8212; and that we can attest to &#8212; businesses can thrive without privacy-invasive practices.&#8221;</p>
<p>MEPs backing the Coalition&#8217;s calls for a ban on tracking ads are hoping to convince enough of their fellow parliamentarians to step in over the broad array of harms being associated with surveillance-based business models, including by debunking the economic claims that adtech makes in defence of tracking-ads.</p>
<p>The Coalition is shooting for an outright ban on microtargeting in the DSA, which will apply broadly to all digital services; and also wants to get restrictions on how data can be combined by gatekeeping giants for ad purposes added to the DMA &#8212; which is likely to apply to both Facebook and Google (among other tech giants).</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/eu-parliament-backs-tighter-rules-on-behavioural-ads/">October last year</a> MEPs backed a call for tighter regulations on microtargeting in favor of less intrusive forms of advertising (like contextual ads) &#8212; urging Commission lawmakers to assess further regulatory options, including looking at a phase-out leading to a full ban.</p>
<p>But the Coalition believes the debate has moved on enough that the parliament could vote to back an outright ban.</p>
<p>At the same time, supporters also warn over the frenzied lobbying going on in the background as adtech giants try to derail a threat to what is &#8212; for them &#8212; a very lucrative business model.</p>

<h2>Big adtech&#8217;s EU lobbying frenzy</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/2021-08/The%20lobby%20network%20-%20Big%20Tech%27s%20web%20of%20influence%20in%20the%20EU.pdf">report</a> published <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/us-giants-top-tech-industrys-100m-a-year-lobbying-blitz-in-eu/">this summer</a> by Corporate Europe Observatory and LobbyControl listed US adtech giants Google and Facebook at the top of a list of big spenders lobbying to influence EU lawmakers &#8212; with the pair splurging €5.8M and €5.5M respectively to push their pro-tracking agenda in the region.</p>
<p>However that&#8217;s likely just the tip of the iceberg as Facebook and Google provide funding to an array of third party lobby groups, such as think tanks and industry associations, which can often been heard amplifying their talking points &#8212; without making their links with big tech funders amply clear.</p>
<p>One source close to the parliament negotiations around the DSA and DMA highlighted Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;enormous&#8221; lobbying budget &#8212; saying there&#8217;s a belief among some MEPs that it&#8217;s &#8220;the largest lobbying operation in world history in Europe&#8221;.</p>
<p>With the counter push to amend EU legislation now entering the final stages, o<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ur source on the negotiations suggested there is political momentum to get a ban on microtargeting into EU law &#8212; following the </span><em style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Wall Street Journal</em><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8216;s recent exposé of internal Facebook documents.</span></p>
<p>The whistleblower, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">Frances Haugen</a>, who revealed herself as the source of the document dump, called directly for lawmakers to act &#8212; suggesting changes are needed to Facebook&#8217;s algorithms to prevent a range of virality-generated harms.</p>

<p>Preventing ads from being targeted against personal data would fall into that category &#8212; removing the economic incentives that prop up some types of harmful disinformation and misinformation.</p>
<p>But Paul Tang, of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament &#8212; who is one of the MEPs involved in the push for a ban on microtargeting &#8212; argues there are now scores of reasons to ban tracking ads.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are tons of reasons but the two main concerns we have are as follows: Firstly, we need to stop the massive privacy breaches and monetization of attention. New examples of misuse of data and the harms of polarisation algorithms are being published almost every single week,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Secondly, Google and Facebook have built an opaque advertising ecosystem, allowing ad fraud and giving them a duopoly on the digital advertising market to the detriment of SMEs and traditional publishers, who their income erode. This undermines our public media and by that our democratic institutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another MEP who&#8217;s part of the Coalition, Alexandra Geese, a member of the Greens/European Free Alliance political group, told us her personal concern is how much personal data is being allowed to accumulate in the hands of just two private companies &#8212; with a range of associated risks and concerns.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;While data protection against public authorities works quite well in Europe, we’re only starting to understand the risks and harms that arise because private companies control so much personal data,&#8221; she argued. &#8220;If it were in the hands of a government like in China, there would be a public outcry. Some of the harms are already clearly visible. Disinformation, hateful speech and the polarization of societies as well as electoral manipulation are so widespread because groups of users can be specifically targeted &#8212; be it for commercial reasons (keeping eyeballs to show ads to with strong emotional content), be it for manipulation by malicious actors.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I also have strong economic concerns. In the current advertising ecosystem, no other company can compete and it’s also very difficult to make a different choice. This is already choking publishers. In the long run, this will damage European AI companies. While we can leverage industrial data in Europe, the possibility to predict people’s behaviour as well as being able to train algorithms with such a wealth of data will always be an enormous competitive advantage.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A report by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL) which was prepared at MEPs’ request &#8212; and shared with TechCrunch ahead of publication &#8212; summarises a range of key harms it argues stem from microtargeted ads, underscoring both threats to Europeans&#8217; fundamental rights (like privacy) and the negative impact on media pluralism of adtech giants&#8217; surveillance-based business models enabling an opaque layer of adtech that profits off a shadowy trade in people&#8217;s information and arbitrage of quality publishers&#8217; audience.</span></p>
<p>Estimates for<span class="s1"> the cost of what the ICCL report bills as the &#8220;opaque fees charged on every tracking-based ad&#8221; range between 35%-70% &#8212; which it cites as a key threat to media pluralism.</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">In the report the ICCL also writes that Google has &#8220;diverted data and revenue from publishers to itself&#8221; &#8212; citing a stat that in 2004 half (51%) of the tech giant&#8217;s ad revenue came from displaying ads on publishers’ properties vs &#8220;nearly all&#8221; (85%) now being derived from displaying ads on its own websites and apps &#8212; which the ICCL says Google does &#8220;with the benefit of data taken from publishers’ properties&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">So the narrative here is of theft of individuals&#8217; privacy <em>and</em> publishers&#8217; revenue. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The report also summarises examples of revenue uplift experienced by a number of European publishers after they switched from microtargeting (tracking) to contextual (non-tracking) ads. </span><span class="s1">Such </span><span class="s1">as the 149% <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/24/data-from-dutch-public-broadcaster-shows-the-value-of-ditching-creepy-ads/">boost seen by Dutch publisher NPO Group</a> — or the 210% higher average price reported by TV2, a Norwegian news website for ads sold through Kobler’s contextual targeting vs tracking-based ad targeting.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Practical evidence from European publishers now shows that publishers’ ad revenue can increase when tracking-based advertising is switched off,” the ICCL argues, predicting that: “A switch off across the entire market will amplify this effect, protecting fundamental rights and publisher sustainability. We urge lawmakers to play their part.”</span></p>
<p>Asked about momentum in the Parliament for a microtargeting ban, Tang suggests there is a lot of appetite among MEPs to change what he dubs as &#8220;this opaque and even fraudulent advertising system&#8221;.</p>
<p>But few people TechCrunch spoke to about this issue were willing to predict exactly which way MEPs will jump. So it really looks like it will go down to the wire.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are currently still in hectic negotiations with all political groups but there is for sure a momentum,&#8221; Tang added.</p>
<p>He also gave short shrift to big adtech&#8217;s claims that surveillance-based ads are essential for small businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Facebook promotes itself disingenuously as the champion of small and medium enterprises. The high intermediary costs of Facebook and Google, the prevalence of ad fraud and the limited effectiveness of tracking-ads should all be red flags for every SME out there,&#8221; he suggested.</p>
<p>Also discussing momentum for the campaign, Geese said three groups in the parliament (S&amp;D, Greens and Left) are currently <span lang="EN-US">supporting a ban and a shift to contextual advertising for the whole ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&#8220;Some MEPs of other groups support stronger transparency and better consent regulation as well as a ban of dark patterns,&#8221; she also told us, adding: &#8220;What is interesting is the fact that public awareness is rising and campaigns are picking up speed. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&#8220;People are sick of being tricked into consent and when asked with a simple Yes/No question, refuse consent in high numbers (ca. 80% globally e.g. for iPhone users). The advertising system is evolving and shutting out third party cookies will also mobilize publishers if they don’t want to depend entirely on Google and Facebook,&#8221; she continued, before sticking her neck out with a prediction of victory, saying: </span><span lang="EN-US">&#8220;I’m confident that we will have a majority by the time DSA/DMA go to plenary.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Nonetheless, Geese acknowledged that Facebook and Google continue to have &#8220;huge influence&#8221; over views on this issue.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&#8220;Their lobbying is pervasive and targets the EU commission as well as my fellow lawmakers and national governments,&#8221; she said, noting that she hears colleagues from other parties repeating Google and Facebook claims &#8220;without really understanding the issue&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&#8220;Also all relevant Brussels-based think tanks as well as many academic researcher depend in some way on funding by big tech &#8212; so they all send out the same kind of message.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&#8220;The current main claim is that &#8216;targeted advertising is good for SMEs&#8217; as well as pretending that a ban of surveillance advertising would mean a ban of any kind of advertising &#8212; which is incorrect since we do support contextual advertising,&#8221; Geese went on. &#8220;</span><span lang="EN-US">Many lawmakers are not familiar with the advertising industry and don’t know that surveillance advertising is a rather new form of advertising that has been taking revenue away from European companies and publishers in the last 15 years. Most are also unaware that this market is controlled by a duopoly that faces charges for price-fixing in the US. How can this be good for SMEs or European companies? </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US">&#8220;Furthermore there is no evidence whatsoever that SMEs benefit more from targeted advertising than from contextual. With our proposal, SMEs would still be able to target clients on websites based on their interests or even on their location. Contextual advertising has a huge growth potential and can serve SMEs far better than the current system, not to speak of publishers who have thrived with contextual in the past.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span class="s1">We contacted Google and Facebook for comment on the Coalition&#8217;s campaign. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">At</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> the time of writing neither had responded to the request. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But we also pinged the IAB Europe &#8212; which was happy to defend surveillance-based advertising on the tech giants&#8217; behalf.</span></p>
<p>In a statement attributed to Greg Mroczkowski, the IAB Europe&#8217;s director of public policy, the online ad industry association argued that creepy ads are &#8220;indispensable&#8221; for both small and big business, and &#8212; it claimed &#8212; for &#8220;Europe&#8217;s news publishers&#8221; and for &#8220;content creators of all kinds&#8221;.</p>
<p>Which, as an argument, does seem to gloss over some basic market dynamics &#8212; like, for instance, if you flood the market with &#8220;content&#8221; of any quality that might make it more difficult for news publishers to produce high quality journalism (which is more expensive to produce than any old clickbait) since all this stuff is competing for people&#8217;s eyeballs (and attention is finite).</p>
<p>Similarly, if big business is allowed to use intrusively powerful ad targeting tools, doesn&#8217;t that undermine the ability of small businesses to compete against those brand giants using the same tools &#8212; given they don&#8217;t have the same level of resource to spend on digital marketing and data gathering? So wouldn&#8217;t it be a more level playing field if people&#8217;s data was off-limits and competition could be centred on the relative merits of the products?</p>
<p>But, well, here&#8217;s the IAB&#8217;s statement in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Personalised advertising is an indispensable marketing channel for small businesses and household brands alike. It is also a vital revenue generator for Europe’s news publishers as well as other content creators of all kinds.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The EU’s already extensive legal framework for privacy and data protection applies directly to data-driven ads, and we support <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/iab-europes-ad-tracking-consent-framework-found-to-fail-gdpr-standard/">enforcement of that law</a>. We also welcome measures to further boost trust and transparency in the online advertising ecosystem, but uncosted, untested prohibitions of valuable technological solutions are not the way forward.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The claim by the IAB that it supports enforcement of the GDPR is also worth an addendum, given that its own Transparency and Consent Framework &#8212; a widely used tool for gathering Internet users&#8217; &#8216;consents&#8217; to ad targeting &#8212; is itself the subject of a data protection complaint.</p>
<p>A division of Belgium&#8217;s data protection agency found in a preliminary report <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/16/iab-europes-ad-tracking-consent-framework-found-to-fail-gdpr-standard/">last year </a>that the tool failed to comply with key GDPR principles of transparency, fairness and accountability, and the lawfulness of processing.

<h2>Adtech enforcement gap</h2>
<p>Another important strand to this story is the (much chronicled) lack of enforcement of the GDPR around adtech.</p>
<p>Yet there seems to be a lack of awareness inside parts of the European Commission about this very notable enforcement gap where EU data protection law intersects with tracking-based business models.</p>
<p>One Commission official we spoke to &#8212; in the context of flagging eye-watering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/researchers-show-facebooks-ad-tools-can-target-a-single-user/">research that demonstrates Facebook&#8217;s platform can be used to target ads at a single person</a>; in order to ask whether such a problematic use-case might fall under a proposed prohibition in draft AI regulations (which will forbid subliminal techniques that influence people ‘beyond their consciousness’ and aim to materially distorting a person’s behaviour in a manner that causes or is likely to cause them or another person physical or psychological harm) &#8212; pointed to the GDPR by way of recourse, saying the law already establishes rules on users’ consent and/or their right to object to targeted digital marketing.</p>
<p>However this official seemed entirely unaware that Facebook does not offer an option to use its service without being tracked. Which means EU users simply can&#8217;t obtain their GDPR rights when/if using Facebook.</p>
<p>So if the Commission is imagining that the GDPR provides protection enough against abuse of personal data by adtech it hasn&#8217;t being paying enough attention to the rampant attention-mining going down, consent-free, on the modern web.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/19/french-court-slaps-down-googles-appeal-against-57m-gdpr-fine/">Google has been fined in France under GDPR</a> for failing to be transparent enough about its tracking practices. But privacy experts continue to decry its use of disingenuous dark patterns &#8212; such as labyrinthine settings menus that make it hard for consumers to figure out how to stop it tracking them for ad targeting as they browse the Internet.</p>
<p>While a complaint against Facebook&#8217;s &#8220;forced consent&#8221; has been stalled in Ireland &#8212; which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/irelands-draft-gdpr-decision-against-facebook-branded-a-joke/">has suggested</a> there&#8217;s no legal problem with the tech giant claiming users are actually in a contract with it to receive targeted ads (meaning there&#8217;s no need for it to ask for their consent).</p>
<p>Like Facebook, Google is now regulated on data protection matters by Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission &#8212; which has faced years of criticism for failing to act on cross-border GDPR complaints, including a large number concerning adtech.</p>
<p>So, again, if the Commission takes the view that the GDPR alone can stop unwanted microtargeting it&#8217;s essential to underscore that that certainly has not happened yet &#8212; more than three years after the law came into application.</p>
<p>So the salient question then is, should EU citizens really have to wait <em>years</em> more for Europe&#8217;s top court to enforce the letter of the law? A growing number of MEPs don&#8217;t think so. Which is why they think it&#8217;s vital to put a ban on the face of EU legislation.</p>
<p>If these parliamentarians fail to get a ban on microtargeting into the DSA (and/or adtech data restrictions in the DMA) there is perhaps another looming chance for them to amend legislation to outlaw at least a subset of surveillance ads.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Commission official we spoke to suggested that a prohibition already included in another draft piece of EU legislation &#8212; the AI regulation, which will set rules around high risk uses of artificial intelligence &#8212; could <em>potentially</em> apply to microtargeting of people, if it fulfils all the conditions under article 5(1)a) of the proposed Act.</p>
<p>The problem is that the current Commission proposal sets a very high bar for a ban &#8212; requiring that such an ad is not only targeted at a person without their knowledge but must also &#8220;materially distort&#8221; their behaviour in such a way that it &#8220;causes or is likely to cause that person or another person physical or psychological harm&#8221;.</p>
<p>Safe to say, the adtech giants would deny any such impact is possible from targeted advertising &#8212; even as they rake billions more into their coffers by selling people&#8217;s attention via an industrial data-gathering apparatus which has been baked into the web to spy on what Internet users do and profile people for profit.</p>
<p>If a microtargeting ban fails to make it in the votes now looming in the European Parliament, the AI Regulation could be the next &#8212; and perhaps final &#8212; battleground for EU lawmakers to overrule the surveillance giants.</p>

<p>Techstars&#8217; Jonathan Fentzke and Space Capital&#8217;s Chad Anderson will be joining us at the event, which takes place December 14 and 15 this year. Fentzke is the managing director of Techstars&#8217; Space Accelerator, which partners with JPL, NASA, the U.S. Space Force, Lockheed Martin and more to curate and level-up a group of 10 space-focused deep tech startups for each cohort. Anderson is the managing partner at Space Capital, a seed-stage VC firm and fund, and prior to that he ran Space Angels, a collective of investors focused on funding the industry at the earliest stages.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s always tremendous risk involved in venture capital, and more so in the early offing. But potential reward is greater then, too, and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re excited to be able to chat with Fentzke and Anderson about what&#8217;s involved in placing those early bets, and helping entrepreneurs just getting started make the most of the current moment in the commercial space industry.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221846" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">FIN7, a financially motivated Russian hacking group, has set up a fake company to lure unwitting IT specialists into supporting its continued expansion into <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a>, security researchers have found.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">According to researchers at <a href="https://geminiadvisory.io/fin7-ransomware-bastion-secure/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=pmd_Vc7Ohwvc2RdjE74Btza4vgdCUztbiG1easG_eqmXLE4-1634826118-0-gqNtZGzNAiWjcnBszQe9">Recorded Future&#8217;s Gemini Advisory unit</a>, FIN7 — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/burgerville-hack-fin7-fbi/">known for hacking into point-of-sale registers and stealing over $1 billion from millions of credit cards</a> — is now operating under the guise of Bastion Secure, which claims to offer specialized <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/public-sector/">public sector</a> cybersecurity services.</p>
<p>Bastion Secure’s website looks like the real deal. But the research found FIN7 is using real, publicly available information from existing, legitimate cybersecurity companies — phone numbers, office locations and text pulled from real websites — to create a veil of legitimacy. Bastion&#8217;s website claims it won &#8220;Best Managed Security Service&#8221; at the SC Magazine awards in 2016, and that the fake company&#8217;s consultancy arm was acquired by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/six-degrees/">Six Degrees</a> in 2016. Neither are true.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221820" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Recorded Future&#8217;s analysis of the fake company&#8217;s website found it is largely copied from the website of Convergent Network Solutions, a legitimate cybersecurity company. The researchers said the site is hosted on the Russian domain registrar Beget, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybercrime/">cybercriminals</a> often use, and some of the submenus of the fake company&#8217;s website return a Russian-language &#8220;page not found&#8221; error, which the researchers said could indicate that the site creators were Russian speakers.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, both Chrome and Safari have blocked access to the &#8220;deceptive&#8221; site.</p>

	</p>
<p>Much like the website, Bastion Secure’s advertised vacancies look legitimate enough, too. The fictitious company is looking for programmers, system administrators and reverse-engineers, and the job descriptions are similar to those you&#8217;d find at any cybersecurity company.</p>
<p>But Recorded Future said that FIN7 — under the guise of Bastion Secure — is looking to build a &#8220;staff&#8221; capable of conducting the tasks necessary for undertaking a range of cybercriminal activity.</p>
<p>“Given FIN7’s increased interest in ransomware, Bastion Secure is likely specifically looking for system administrators because an individual with this skill set would be able to,” the researchers found.</p>
<p>The interview process also rang alarm bells for the researchers. While the first and second stages gave no indication that Bastion Secure is concealing a cybercriminal operation, the third — in which prospective employees were tasked with a &#8220;real&#8221; assignment — gave it away.</p>
<p>&#8220;It became immediately clear that the company was involved in criminal activity,” the researchers said. “The fact that the Bastion Secure representatives were particularly interested in file systems and backups signals that FIN7 was more interested in conducting ransomware attacks than [point of sale] infections.”</p>
<p>One of the Recorded Future researchers who was offered a position as IT researcher at Bastion Secure analyzed the tools that were provided by the company and found the tools are components of the post-exploitation toolkits Carbanak and Tirion (Lizar). Both toolkits have been previously attributed to FIN7 and can be used for hacking both point-of-sale systems and deploying ransomware.</p>
<p>“FIN7’s decision to use a fake cybersecurity company to recruit IT specialists for its criminal activity is driven by FIN7’s desire for comparatively cheap, skilled labor,&#8221; Recorded Future said. &#8220;Bastion Secure’s job offers for IT specialist positions ranged between $800 and $1,200 USD a month, which is a viable starting salary for this type of position in post-Soviet states&#8230; In effect, FIN7’s fake company scheme enables the operators of FIN7 to obtain the talent that the group needs to carry out its criminal activities, while simultaneously retaining a larger share of the profits.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the first time FIN7 has masqueraded as a legitimate firm, <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2019/09/13/fin7-sysadmin-pleads-guilty-to-running-it-for-billion-dollar-crime-syndicate/">previously posing as &#8220;Combi Security,&#8221;</a> before unwanted public attention prompted the group to shut down the fake company.</p>
<p>Brett Callow, a ransomware expert and threat analyst at Emsisoft, told TechCrunch that FIN7&#8217;s decision to masquerade as Bastion Secure is likely also an attempt to avoid unwanted attention from law enforcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s not at all surprising that a cybercrime operation would attempt to recruit via a fake company. Hiring from the dark web is problematic and risky,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Ransomware gangs are less welcome on certain cybercrime forums than they once were, and applicants could potentially be law enforcement officers working undercover. Using standard job ads addresses both problems, while the fake company may also serve other purposes — money laundering, for example.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And employees could certainly be misled as to the nature of their work — for example, they may not realize that companies are unwilling recipients of their pen-testing,&#8221; said Callow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is lowering commissions on all subscription-based businesses on the Google Play Store, the company announced today. Previously, the company had followed Apple&#8217;s move by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/google-play-drops-commissions-to-15-from-30-following-apples-move-last-year/">reducing commissions</a> from 30% to 15% on the first $1 million of developer earnings. Now, it will lower the fees specifically for app makers who generate revenue through recurring subscriptions. Instead of charging them 30% in the first year, which lowers to 15% in year two and beyond, Google says developers will only be charged 15% from day one.</p>
<p>The company says 99% of developers will qualify for a service fee of 15% or less, as Google is also further reducing fees for specific vertical apps in the <a href="https://play.google.com/console/about/mediaprogram/">Play Media Experience Program</a>. These will be adjusted to as low as 10%, it says.</p>
<p>The Play Media Experience Program encompasses apps like e-books and on-demand streaming music or video services, where the content costs account for the majority of sales. These are also businesses that, in some cases, compete directly with Google &#8212; as YouTube Music does with Spotify, for example.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221893" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>&#8220;Digital subscriptions have become one of the fastest growing models for developers but we know that subscription businesses face specific challenges in customer acquisition and retention,&#8221; said Google&#8217;s Sameer Samat, vice president, Product Management, in an announcement. &#8220;We’ve worked with our partners in dating, fitness, education and other sectors to understand the nuances of their businesses. Our current service fee drops from 30% to 15% after 12 months of a recurring subscription. But we’ve heard that customer churn makes it challenging for subscription businesses to benefit from that reduced rate. So, we’re simplifying things to ensure they can,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The new fees will kick in starting on January 1, 2022, Google said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company noted it spoke with the developer community to help determine the new fee structure, and took in feedback from a variety of developers across industries and verticals, including Anghami, AWA, Bumble, Calm, Duolingo, KADOKAWA, KKBOX, Picsart and Smule.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when determining the new fees for media apps, Google said that it realized that app-building now requires addressing a number of platforms, including TVs, cars, watches, tablets and more. That requires developers to invest more into their app-based business. In addition, by lowering the fees on apps delivering media experiences, Google believes this could allow businesses to pass on the savings to the artists, musicians, authors and other creators who would be impacted by the changes.</p>
<p>The move comes at a time of increased regulatory scrutiny over the app stores and several antitrust lawsuits, including an ongoing one <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/google-files-a-counterclaim-in-epic-games-lawsuit-saying-its-owed-financial-relief/">in the U.S. with Epic Games</a>. Globally, lawmakers are working to determine if the tech giants are abusing their market power with the app stores, which provide the main distribution path for software that runs on mobile devices. South Korea, for instance, recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">passed</a> an &#8220;anti-Google&#8221; law meant to curb in-app payment commissions. Plus, in many cases, the tech companies are competing with the developers whose apps they distribute through other arms of their much larger businesses, which complicates matters further.</p>
<p>In a clever move to thwart further regulations, Google has managed to get some developers on board with its new commissions ahead of their release. It even today provided statements by Bumble and Duolingo praising the move, with Bumble&#8217;s CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd saying this pricing will allow it &#8220;to better invest in our products&#8221; and Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn saying the reductions will help it to &#8220;accelerate our mission&#8221; and that it&#8217;s &#8220;excited to see Google continuing to collaborate with the ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though lowering its commissions, Google stresses that it does need to charge fees in order to continue to invest in Android, its commerce platform, the Play Store, security, app distribution system and developer tools. Google says it will share more about its coming updates to tools, APIs and other technologies during its <a href="https://developer.android.com/events/dev-summit" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developer.android.com/events/dev-summit&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1634918105089000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGvE5pSQdkH0WQMSFJNguKlq2j1Uw">Android Developer Summit</a> on October 27-28.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s no secret that NFTs have been a hot space for crypto speculators in the Ethereum ecosystem to diversify their holdings, and while some see a golden opportunity to shill bad art to suckers, others believe that NFT-based gaming is destined for the mainstream and that products that nail the mechanics early-on will earn the spoils.</p>
<p>Parallel, a sci-fi card game based on the Ethereum blockchain, has had a more meteoric rise than most crypto projects, and investors have noticed. The platform tells TechCrunch they&#8217;ve raised $50 million at a half-billion dollar valuation from crypto VC firm Paradigm. Previous investors include YouTube co-founder Chad Hurley, Focus Labs, OSS Capital and Yunt Capital, among others.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best crypto games will be the ones that can go beyond first-party content and inspire a community of players and developers to build on the game itself. We were impressed by <span class="il">Parallel</span>&#8216;s unique approach and fervent early community, and excited to support them for their next stage of growth,&#8221; Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang said in an email.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221023" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The project is based around a fantasy storyline about humanity&#8217;s escape from space following an apocalyptic attempt to resolve a global energy crisis. Unlike some of the other highly valuable pixelated NFT projects, like CryptoPunks, Parallel&#8217;s art style is focused on realism &#8212; through a science fiction lens, of course.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221518" style="width: 253px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221518" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2221518" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png" alt="" width="243" height="365" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/unnamed.png?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221518" class="wp-caption-text">An NFT from Parallel&#8217;s upcoming drop. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Parallel</p></div></p>
<p>The sci-fi NFT card game caught fire in August after its first pack drop amid a massive surge in NFT speculation. According to crypto tracker CryptoSlam, the platform did nearly $105 million in transaction volume. One of the titles&#8217; &#8220;Masterpiece&#8221; cards sold for $1.1 million worth of the Ethereum cryptocurrency. Even as sales fell to just over $11 million in September, a huge month like that can do big things for the long-term value of an NFT project, as rarer purchases made during that time that are held onto long-term can establish steadier baseline price floors for new assets minted on-chain.</p>
<p>Nothing stress tests a system like thousands of tech-savvy speculators trying to break down said system in order to get filthy rich. As a result, NFT &#8220;drops&#8221; have been plagued by every kind of nightmarish scenario. So far things have gone pretty well for Parallel, which has built up its own drop system, but with its next drop just days away and the potential value of those cards moving higher, plenty of eyes are centered on how smoothly things go.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The game element of the project doesn&#8217;t actually exist yet; the early funding has been used to build it out. Parallel takes a substantial 10% royalty on NFT sales, with half of that going toward in-game prize pools and the rest going to the company. That money can mean bigger revenues for the core platform down the line, but when the entry-point to a game swells to a few thousand dollars, the nature of the &#8220;game&#8221; becomes something different entirely. Balancing a market that tempts investors with rarity but is also friendly to new users has been a big challenge for NFT gaming projects to tackle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Parking can often feel almost laughably old-fashioned, with some lots still hiring an attendant to collect fees and check for valid tickets. Even when parking lot owners try to modernize &#8212; using an app, for example, or a credit card machine to take payment &#8212; they must deal with a whole array of providers to manage hardware, payment processing and marketing, all separately.</p>
<p>That’s where <a href="https://www.airgarage.com/">AirGarage</a> comes in. The company works with parking real estate owners and offers a full-stack software and management service for their lot or garage. That means handling everything from installing signage to collecting payments, and even providing parking enforcement.</p>
<p>AirGarage already has more than 200 locations across 30 states under its management. To scale its services even more, the startup has just closed a $12.5 million Series A led by a16z, with participation from existing investors Floodgate, Founders Fund and Abstract Ventures.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220963" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company’s undergone a number of pivots since its founding by Jonathon Barkl, Chelsea Border and Scott Fitsimones in 2017. The original instantiation of AirGarage, conceived when the three were students at Arizona State University, was to create a platform for people to rent out their driveways to college students who were paying exorbitant fees for on-campus parking. Barkl referred to this idea &#8212; a peer-to-peer marketplace for parking &#8212; as “AirGarage 1.0.”</p>
<p>“That was how we started getting in to the parking industry, in the parking problem,” he told TechCrunch in a recent interview. “The thread that carries through is we realized there&#8217;s underutilized space that is poorly managed and not really being monetized in the way that it should be, and we just have technology and add software to this, we can change that.”</p>
<p>In 2018, the company made its first shift, moving away from home driveways and toward parking space owners like churches and small businesses, to help them monetize their existing, underutilized asset. That was really when AirGarage hammered out its software-first full-stack approach, Barkl explained.</p>
<p>Two years later &#8212; in May 2020, when many cities were in the midst of their first round of stay-at-home orders and lockdowns &#8212; the company shifted yet again, this time to focus on parking real estate commonly found in downtown urban areas. The pandemic may seem like an odd time for a shift, especially for a startup that generates its revenue at least indirectly by people going outside, but Barkl described COVID as a “lightbulb moment” for AirGarage.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The way much of the parking industry works is by parking garage operators or managers leasing the space from the actual real estate owner. AirGarage started getting approached by owners who felt slighted by the managers during the pandemic, after these managers refused to continue paying them as part of prearranged lease agreements.</p>
<p>Plus, many of these agreements see the managers receiving 100% of the revenue after paying the lease fee; Barkl said they would talk to owners who were receiving $10,000 a month under a lease agreement for parking real estate that was generating $30,000 a month, leaving them with only a third of total revenue.</p>
<p>Instead, AirGarage offers a 70-30 split in the owner’s favor, with full transparency regarding how much money the parking real estate is pulling in each month. To increase revenue even more, AirGarage also collects data on the parking site in order to offer things like dynamic pricing, in addition to conducting all advertising, payment processing and online listings.</p>
<p>On the backend, the startup offers parking enforcement under a program it calls “space force.” It works by engaging gig workers &#8212; an Uber driver who is idling in-between rides, for example &#8212; to pull into lots and check license plates. Drivers get paid for each license they ensure is valid, and that fee is also dynamically priced according to how busy the lot is that day.</p>
<p>With the fresh round of funding, AirGarage is aiming to roll out new software and services so owners can generate revenue not only from personal vehicle parking, but from food trucks that need a place to park or cloud kitchens that need a place to store food. The engineering team is also working on features like using cameras to automatically read license plates so a driver can put her plate number on file with AirGarage and not have to worry about payment in the moment at all.</p>
<p>Barkl estimated that out of the 200-plus customers the company has signed on, fewer than five have cancelled services.</p>
<p>“In the last 20 years, while other industries have had monumental shifts because of technology and software, the parking industry is not quite there yet,” he said. “These companies are just so backwards and old-school in the way that they do things, and the only way to fix that, in our opinion, is to replace those companies entirely with what we&#8217;re building, which is that full-stack operator.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roku shared <a href="https://www.roku.com/blog/update-on-youtube-tv">a progress update</a> today on its ongoing contract dispute with Google related to its attempt to renew the carriage agreement for YouTube TV, Google&#8217;s live TV streaming service. In April, Roku <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/roku-removes-youtube-tv-from-its-channel-store-following-failed-negotiations/">removed</a> the YouTube TV app from its channel store so it was no longer available to new Roku subscribers, but took steps to ensure that existing subscribers could continue to use the service. Today, Roku says it has still not been able to come to a deal with Google, and warns customers that Google could choose to remove YouTube TV from the Roku platform.</p>
<p>YouTube, however, says the breakdown of the negotiations doesn&#8217;t mean YouTube TV&#8217;s existing customers on Roku will be impacted.</p>
<p>Though its partnership agreement will terminate in December, YouTube tells TechCrunch that exiting users on existing Roku devices will still be able to use both YouTube TV and the YouTube app. However, new Roku devices won&#8217;t be able to carry either of the apps, it said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221816" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Roku earlier this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/roku-removes-youtube-tv-from-its-channel-store-following-failed-negotiations/">made the details of its contract dispute public</a>, saying that Google had been asking for special treatment with regard to how its services are integrated into Roku&#8217;s operating system. While the agreement under discussion is related to YouTube TV, Google was also asking for preferential ranking of YouTube content in Roku&#8217;s search results and permissions to override default settings when the YouTube app is open, it said. For instance, if a Roku customer had YouTube open and used voice search to ask for music, Google wanted YouTube Music to play the request, even if the customer had set Pandora as their preferred music app.</p>
<p>Roku also alleged earlier this year that Google was asking for more data on Roku customers than it provides other developers, and said Google threatened to increase the hardware spec requirements for YouTube TV, which would ensure Roku&#8217;s lower-end and more competitively priced players would not be able to access it.</p>
<p>Google has consistently pushed back on Roku&#8217;s statements,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/roku-removes-youtube-tv-from-its-channel-store-following-failed-negotiations/"> saying it had not made requests</a> to &#8220;access user data or interfere with search results.&#8221; The company also shamed Roku for turning to customers in an attempt to sway the negotiations in its favor and said all its requests were about providing a good user experience.</p>
<p>Essentially, today&#8217;s update is to let Roku&#8217;s customers know that no progress has yet been made with the negotiations, and to alert them that Google could later take a more punitive action, if it chose. Roku may be right to warn customers that YouTube TV could one day be pulled from its platform, but it&#8217;s also a risk to share that sort of information this close to the holiday shopping season when consumers are in the market for new streaming devices. (After all, Roku just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/roku-debuts-new-streaming-stick-4k-bundles-software-update-with-voice-and-mobile-features/">released</a> a pair of new Streaming Stick 4K devices and a refreshed Roku Ultra LT, a Walmart-exclusive version of its high-end player.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That Roku would warn customers of a possibility of a removal that even Google says isn&#8217;t yet happening is an indication of how dirty these negotiations have gotten.</p>
<p>Roku&#8217;s arguments seem to largely boil down to what sort of rights it has to dictate how its own software works as the platform provider. That means determining how search results are displayed, what sort of data is shared with its app developers and how apps are meant to behave, according to its own guidelines.</p>
<p>These are the same sort of rules Apple and Google make for their own platforms. But although Roku is the platform in this scenario, it doesn&#8217;t put itself on the side of the tech giants who are accused of abusing their monopoly power &#8212; it paints itself as the victim, having to bow to Google&#8217;s demands or risk losing access to Google&#8217;s must-have apps, like YouTube and YouTube TV. And of course, Google competes directly with Roku via Chromecast.</p>

<p>But Roku is not some indie developer trying to fight back against tech giants who are trying to destroy its business. It&#8217;s a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ROKU/key-statistics/">multibillion</a>-dollar company that&#8217;s <a href="https://nscreenmedia.com/android-tv-market-share/">claimed a larger slice of the U.S. streaming market</a> than Google&#8217;s own Chromecast.</p>
<p>YouTube told TechCrunch it has been negotiating in good faith with Roku and alleges Roku is still making baseless claims that cause alarm among their mutual users. The company reiterated that it has made no requests to access user data or interfere with search results.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since our negotiations with Roku earlier this year, we’ve continued to work with them to find a resolution that benefits our mutual users,&#8221; a YouTube spokesperson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roku has once again chosen to make unproductive and baseless claims rather than try to work constructively with us. Since we haven’t been able to continue our conversations in good faith, our partnership for all new Roku devices will unfortunately end on December 9. We are, however, giving Roku the ability to continue distributing both YouTube and YouTube TV apps to all existing users to make sure they are not impacted,&#8221; they added.</p>
