										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Small and medium-sized exporters in India struggle to communicate their designs with buyers. They can’t list those designs publicly on their website or sell through popular e-commerce platforms as doing so would risk giving away the proprietary property to rivals.</p>
<p>So they have traditionally showcased their work to potential buyers &#8212; who in this equation, depending on the category, could be anyone from Zara to Armani &#8212; in PDF and PowerPoint presentations.</p>
<p>The way their business works is that buyers offer feedback and provide specifications for exactly what they want. PDF and presentations, as you can imagine, are not the most efficient way to relay such conversations.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221599" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That’s the problem that attracted three entrepreneurs &#8212; two of whom worked at Zomato previously and one as an investor at Bessemer. Their startup, five-month-old SourceWiz, said on Thursday it has raised $3 million in a round led by Blume Ventures and Falcon Edge Capital’s Alpha Wave Incubation (AWI).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sourcewiz.co">SourceWiz</a> has built a platform to digitize the way exporters operate. Its platform helps them modernize their cataloguing, which leads to a direct improvement in revenue, said Divyaanshu Makkar, the startup’s co-founder and chief executive, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Cataloguing may sound like an easy problem, but it entails combining information such as images, prices, product ID from multiple databases and then combining them from scratch. “An exporter is able to use our platform to build their customized catalogue in 15 minutes. This task takes about 5 days if done in the traditional way,” he said.</p>
<p>India is one of the world’s largest exporters &#8212; and it’s a space that has become even more popular because of recent geopolitical dynamics, said Sajith Pai, Director at Blume Ventures, in a statement. The total exports of textiles, footwear and miscellaneous design-led products was about $40 billion in the financial year that ended in March.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“As exporters compete on the global stage, they are craving for tools that will digitize their workflows and help them trade faster and better. This is where SourceWiz comes in. We are excited by Sourcewiz’s potential to bring aboard $200b of transactions online. Most of all we are excited by the passion of the founding team &#8211; Divyaanshu, Vikas and Mayur &#8211; and their obsession to take on this massive challenge,” he added.</p>
<p>India’s market is also largely untapped. In recent years, several firms &#8212; including Amazon &#8212; have attempted to make inroads to help Indian businesses sell to customers globally.</p>
<p>Amazon said in August, for instance, that over 70,000 Indian businesses had cumulatively exported over $3 billion worth of items. But Amazon is attempting to cater to different segments of exporters.</p>
<p>SourceWiz is focusing to serve exporters who largely produce and sell hand-made products that aren’t sold without customization. (The startup makes money by charging a licensing fee for its service to exporters.)</p>
<p>The startup has already amassed dozens of exporters on its platform &#8212; despite the hands-on nature of this business, which as you can imagine, has been severely disrupted by the coronavirus. Makkar said the startup will eventually broaden its offerings by integrating logistics, payments, and financing services to its platform.</p>
<p>It also plans to expand its offerings to other Asian countries such as Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Vietnam in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Portuguese VC <a href="https://www.faber-ventures.com/">Faber</a> is launching a new fund, Faber Blue Pioneers I, to invest in early-stage startups &#8211; primarily from Portugal and Southern Europe &#8211; developing innovative “deep tech solutions” around ocean sustainability and climate action,</p>
<p>The fund will have an initial target of €30 million, including funding from Portugal Blue as well as impact-driven institutional investors like Sociedade Francisco Manuel dos Santos (through its investment arm Movendo Capital), Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, and Champalimaud Foundation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Marginalized communities, survivors of abuse, politicians, law enforcement &#8211; they all use encrypted communications to keep their information safe. But the encryption of the kinds of services you and I use every day &#8211; from messaging to confidential internal company communications &#8211; is increasingly under threat by governments globally. The reasons are sometimes understandable, such as the protection of children, but more often than not it’s about state snooping and control of populations, especially in authoritarian regimes. Democratic countries that give the green light to breaking encryption make it easier for dictatorships to argue in its favor.</p>
<p>That’s why a group of civil society organizations and technology companies is today launching a campaign in favor of strong encryption on what they are calling “<a href="https://ged.globalencryption.org/">Global Encryption Day</a>”.</p>
<p>Edward Snowden, the whistleblower behind the NSA surveillance revelations and Board Member of <a href="https://freedom.press/">Freedom of the Press Foundation</a> will launch the day at a special broadcast today at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm  BST / 3pm CET  which you’ll be able to watch live here:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221586" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KrYvzIfY8_w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>While governments worldwide often bleat about criminals exploiting encryption messaging to hide illegal activity, proposals to weaken or undermine strong encryption are far more likely to leave users more vulnerable to cyber-attacks and criminal activity, because once you create those back-doors, anyone can use them.</p>
<p>In a statement, Snowden said: “If you weaken encryption, people will die. This year alone, after the fall of the government of Afghanistan, we saw how crucial encryption is in keeping ordinary people safe. The Covid pandemic brought home how essential encrypted messaging apps on our smartphones are for communicating with loved ones if we’re ill and need help… It would have been impossible for me to whistleblow without encryption.”</p>
<p>He added: “Despite this, governments around the world are seeking to weaken encryption by calling on platforms to create ‘backdoors’ for law enforcement… Weakening encryption would be a colossal mistake that could put thousands of lives at risk.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jimmy Wales, founder of Wikipedia said: “Protecting strong encryption is essential for protecting the human rights of millions of people around the world. Everyone has the right to privacy and security&#8230; Weakening encryption puts us all at risk. When we started Wikipedia, it was prohibitively expensive to use secure encryption for every page on the site, but it was always a priority of ours and we introduced it as soon as we could. There is no excuse for not using encryption now &#8211; governments and technology platforms have a duty to protect the public.”</p>
<p>Global Encryption Day will also feature a series of other online events including <a href="https://www.lgbttech.org/post/lgbt-tech-internet-society-release-new-encryption-infographic">LGBT Tech</a> hosting an Instagram Live, and a leading civil society group in <a href="https://irisbh.com.br/en/eventos/webinar-the-importance-of-encryption-for-activists-and-civil-society/">Brazil hosting an all-women panel</a> discussing the importance of encryption.</p>
<p>The Global Encryption Coalition (GEC) was founded by the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, Global Partners Digital and the Internet Society.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two wheelers have long been a cornerstone of life in India — their smaller size and affordability making these traditionally gas and diesel-powered vehicles a go-to means of navigating the traffic-jammed streets of the country&#8217;s most populous cities.</p>
<p>Now, a new startup called River has come out of stealth with an electric two-wheeler scooter &#8212; and accompanying subscription services &#8212; designed to appeal to modern-day consumers looking for an affordable, yet stylish vehicle that can be used for work, play and every task in between.</p>
<p>River, founded in late 2020 by Aravind Mani and Vipin George with $2 million in backing from Maniv Mobility and TrucksVC, has grown to 42 people in its short life. Its small and growing team, who hail from companies like Ather, Arai, Bosch, Honda, Ultraviolette and Vespa, have developed a prototype vehicle that will be unveiled to consumers later this year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220972" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Both founders also have experience in two-wheeled transport. Mani, an engineer who once worked in the petrochemicals industry before switching to electrified transportation, was most recently vice president of business strategy at Ultraviolette before he left to form River. George worked at Honda R&amp;D in India for eight years, including as head designer, and most recently was design lead at Ultraviolette.</p>
<p>The pair wanted a two-wheeler robust enough to be used as a tool for work or any other task while amping up the performance and style to make it useful and fun for all of the other hours in the day.</p>
<p>&#8220;A parallel would be the truck culture in the United States; if you&#8217;re carpenter or shop owner you have a truck, which you use to carry stuff and it&#8217;s also your primary mode of commute,&#8221; Mani said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have anything similar on the two-wheeler space in India, and that&#8217;s what we want to create.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the same time, Mani noted the vehicle also had to have personality because &#8220;in India it is still a status purchase that you want to show off to your friends; it is a first symbol that you have arrived in life for many people owning a two wheeler.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2221138" style="width: 463px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/River_Frontview.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221138" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2221138 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/River_Frontview.jpg?w=453" alt="River front view of two wheeler electric vehicle" width="453" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/River_Frontview.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/River_Frontview.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/River_Frontview.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/River_Frontview.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/River_Frontview.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/River_Frontview.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/River_Frontview.jpg?resize=1365,2048 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/River_Frontview.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2221138" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> River</p></div></p>
<p>What they came up with is a &#8220;multi-utility&#8221; two-wheeled electric scooter codenamed the RX-1 that is available in several battery pack sizes that can travel between 100 km (62 miles) and 180 km (112 miles) on a single charge.</p>
<p>The vehicle can accelerate from zero to 40 kilometers per hour (25 mph) in 4 seconds and has a top speed of 80 kmph (50 mph). And because its main focus is as a multi-utility vehicle, it has a payload of 200 kilograms, enough for a rider to carry packages.</p>
<p>The price, which depends on the battery pack, ranges between 80,000 INR ($1,070) and 100,000 INR ($1,337).</p>
<p>River&#8217;s launch comes at a fruitful yet fiercely competitive moment in India.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s government, keen to accelerate the adoption of EVs in an effort to get away from polluting gas and diesel powered vehicles, have increased subsidies for electric two-wheelers made in the country. India&#8217;s Department of Heavy Industries <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/renewables/electric-2-wheeler-firms-see-subsidy-pushing-adoption/articleshow/83493217.cms?from=mdr">now offers incentives</a> that provides Rs 15,000 ($200) per kilowatt-hour. The cap on subsidies has also doubled to 40% of the price of the vehicle.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is also an effort by e-commerce and delivery companies, including Flipkart, Swiggy and Zomato to electrify fleets. Zomato to have EV-only fleets by the end of the decade. Startup Swiggy announced in August it would <a href="https://yourstory.com/2021/08/swiggy-aims-8-lakh-kms-per-day-through-electric-vehicles-2025/amp">cover 800,000 kilometers</a> (497,000 miles) every day via electric vehicles by 2025.  In February, Walmart-owned Flipkart said it would deploy more than 25,000 electric vehicles in its supply chain by 2030.</p>
<p>&#8220;About 60% to 70% of the country is self employed and two wheelers are a basic part of the Indian livelihood,&#8221; co-founder Aravind Mani said in an interview, adding that e-commerce has driven growth with an estimated 14 million fleet delivery riders in India today. &#8220;COVID has actually accelerated this trend, and on demand services are continuously increasing.&#8221;</p>
<p>These opportunities have fueled the launch of hundreds of EV startups. There are more than 470 EV companies registered in India, according to March 2021 research note from Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.</p>
<p>&#8220;The gold rush to capture this emerging opportunity has commenced,&#8221; the report from managing director and senior analyst Venugopal Garre said. &#8220;A few will get acquired, several will perish, some will remain low scale niche OEMs, but we think a few will scale up materially.&#8221;</p>
<p>River is going up against bigger and better funded competitors like Ola Electric, Bounce and Aether Energy as well as dozens of smaller outfits. But River&#8217;s co-founders contend their new vehicle and business model fills a gap in the market.</p>
<p>River plans to sell directly to consumers and offer a suite of subscription services and an array of accessories that lets owners customize their scooters and remove them there needs change throughout the day. Sales are expected to begin in the second half of 2022.</p>
<p>The company plans to offer charging, battery packs that will range in size, maintenance and connectivity packages offered through subscriptions. River is not going to take on the costly task of building out charging infrastructure. Instead, the company plans to operate a charging franchise system. Mani said the company is already working set of small businesses that might buy the vehicles and chargers and open up the chargers for public use.</p>
<p>River wants to sell its scooters directly to businesses like restaurants as well as to fleet operators and even larger ecommerce companies that can sell to consumers.</p>
<p>The startup will assemble the scooters at what Mani described as &#8220;small scale manufacturing facilities&#8221; that can turnout around 3,000 vehicles a month. If successful, River wants to create a number of these facilities throughout India. Mani said River has reached initial agreements with several suppliers, including for the co-development and assembly of its battery packs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://stationf.co">Station F</a>, the big startup campus located in Paris, is launching an online component called <a href="https://launch.stationf.co">Launch by Station F</a>. With this new program, entrepreneurs from anywhere can get started and learn all the basics to start a company.</p>
<p>Launched in 2017, Station F is a massive building that used to be a rail freight depot. It has become a flagship entity for the tech community in France with hundreds of startups working from there.</p>
<p>“From day one, Station F has always been about making life easier for entrepreneurs,” Station F director Roxanne Varza said at the launch event earlier today.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221557" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>There are many ways to join the Station F community. And yet, Station F still has to turn down most applications. Right now, around 9% of entrepreneurs applying to a Station F program get accepted. That’s why Station F is launching Launch.</p>
<p>“Launch is a new way to become an entrepreneur. It’s a fully online program, which means you can access it from anywhere in the world,” Varza said. “It’s literally all the basics to start a company. By the time you finish this program, you should understand all that crazy jargon.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2221563" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2221563" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/directory.png" alt="" width="1024" height="640" class="size-full wp-image-2221563" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/directory.png 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/directory.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/directory.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/directory.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/directory.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/directory.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2221563" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Station F</p></div></p>
<p>There are three basic building bricks behind Launch — content, tools and community.</p>
<p>The Station F team has created a ton of videos and articles by talking with some well-known entrepreneurs and investors in the startup community in France. This content will help you understand the tech industry.</p>
<p>People joining the Launch program will also be able to access a collection of essential tools to build a startups with free trials and free tiers. Tools include Notion, Asana, Shopify, Bubble and Qonto.</p>
<p>Finally, the program is based on peer-to-peer feedback. Members can talk to each other in a Slack community, browse a directory of people and more. But the most powerful peer-to-peer component is that you have to give feedback to people when you’re going through the program.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Throughout the program, you’ll be going through the steps of building a pitch deck. It’s really about asking yourself the right questions about the business,” Varza said. And other members will give you feedback on your pitchdeck.</p>
<p>Launch costs €9.90 per month and users can cancel whenever they want. Station F hopes it can attract 5,000 to 10,000 members.</p>
<p>And Station F’s diversity partners, such as Singa, Les Déterminés, La French Tech Tremplin and the Fighters Program, will be able to access the service for free.</p>
<p>With this new online program, Station F is focusing on online education. While a ton of people want to start a startup, there’s still a steep learning curve to get started.</p>
<p>People who complete the Launch program won’t necessarily create a startup. But at least they’ll be able to have a conversation about the business model of a startup, product-market fit and more.</p>

<h2>An update on Station F</h2>
<p>Station F currently hosts dozens of different startup programs. Some programs are managed by partners, while others are managed by the Station F team directly.</p>
<p>Current partners include Ubisoft, Microsoft, Facebook and HEC Paris. Each program selects a batch of startups that can come and work from Station F. In addition to office space, they can network and get some perks from both partners and Station F. Today, Station F announced two new partners — <a href="https://42.fr">Ecole 42</a> and <a href="https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en">CentraleSupélec</a>.</p>
<p>“We also manage our own in-house programs and we have three of them,” Station F head of startup programs Marwan Elfitesse said.</p>
<p>There’s the Founders Program, which was announced back in 2016 when Varza <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/05/with-station-f-paris-will-have-the-worlds-biggest-startup-campus/">unveiled Station F at TechCrunch Disrupt</a>. With this program, pre-seed and seed startups working across any vertical can apply.</p>
<p>“It’s a program designed by entrepreneurs, for entrepreneurs, from day one. The whole selection process is managed by entrepreneurs,” Elfitesse said. There are 130 well-known entrepreneurs who currently participate in the selection process.</p>
<p>Station F also runs the Fighters Program. It is designed specifically for entrepreneurs coming from underprivileged backgrounds. “Good and great entrepreneurs can come from any background,” Elfitesse said.</p>
<p>So far, four cohorts of startups have participated in the Fighters Program. Station F is currently working on the fifth batch. For the first time, Station F is adding a sponsor to this program. TikTok is going to sponsor the Fighters Program’s next batch.</p>
<p>Finally, Station F <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/station-f-launches-femtech-program-on-its-startup-campus/">recently unveiled</a> a third in-house program, the FemTech Program. As the name suggests, this program is going to be focused on companies working on female health, women’s sexual health and more.</p>
<p>“When we looked at the topic, we thought it was both an opportunity and that startups urgently needed some help,” Varza told me <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/station-f-launches-femtech-program-on-its-startup-campus/">at the time</a>. “It’s still a little-known category, it’s still a taboo subject.”</p>
<p>The first batch of companies in the FemTech program will join the campus next month.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[FlixMobility, the $3 billion-German transportation startup that has doubled down on long distance buses and slowly and quietly gobbled up transit lines and operations across Europe, today announced a big move to raise its game in the U.S. The company announced that it is acquiring Greyhound Lines, the iconic U.S. bus network, from UK-based owner [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://global.flixbus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FlixMobility</a>, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/flixmobility-raises-650m-at-a-3b-valuation-to-double-down-on-buses-and-other-transport-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3 billion</a>-German transportation startup that has doubled down on long distance buses and slowly and quietly gobbled up transit lines and operations across Europe, today <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211020006200/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a big move to raise its game in the U.S. The company announced that it is acquiring Greyhound Lines, the iconic U.S. bus network, from UK-based owner FirstGroup. Flix said the deal &#8212; which includes a vehicle fleet, trademarks, and related assets and liabilities &#8212; has an enterprise value on a debt-free / cash-free basis of $46 million, with an unconditional deferred consideration of $32 million with an interest rate of 5% per annum alongside that.</p>
<p>FirstGroup acquired Greyhound back in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/feb/09/transportintheuk.usnews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2007</a> in a bigger $3.6 billion deal, part of a bigger strategy to take on the U.S. market (it also bought Ryder, the yellow school bus network, around the same time). But more recently it has been divesting a number of its U.S. assets in a bid to focus more on the U.K. market. It had in fact been looking to sell the assets Flix has now acquired since 2019. FirstGroup <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-55497587" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hived off its Greyhound facilities last December</a> for $138 million, and in <a href="https://eqtgroup.com/news/2021/eqt-infrastructure-to-acquire-first-student-and-first-transit-the-market-leading-providers-of-essential-north-american-transportation-services-for-usd-4.6bn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April</a> sold off the bulk of the rest of the business to EQT, but that did not include the Greyhound transit network.</p>
<p>The deal signifies a huge move for Flix to double down not just on bus transport, but the U.S. market, where it was already active but with a significantly smaller profile. FlixBus, as the service is known, is today active in more than 2,500 destinations in 36 countries outside the U.S., working across 400,000 daily connections. Greyhound is actually nearly as big: it covers 2,400 destinations in North America, with almost 16 million passengers annually. (Flix&#8217;s last reported customer numbers were from 2019, pre-pandemic, and were more 62 million; those figures would have drastically dropped in recent times given distancing and travel restrictions around Covid-19, which could be one reason why it does not provide more updated numbers.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221545" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The deal is not about expanding Flix&#8217;s network, but also presence and mindshare. Greyhound is nothing short of an iconic presence. In a country fixated on travel, it has figured in <a href="https://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/i-need-help-with-songs-that-mention-greyhound-buses.264464/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dozens of famous songs</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/search/keyword/?keywords=greyhound-bus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">films</a> and <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artwork/berenice-abbott-greyhound-bus-terminal-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other art forms</a>, albeit not always in the most flattering of lights.</p>
<p>And that somewhat extended to the business, too: Greyhound was a waning part of FirstGroup&#8217;s profitability, although Flix would argue that there is still a lot of mileage (sorry) left in long-distance bus transport &#8212; a profile that it believed, even as many stopped traveling anywhere, increased during the pandemic as it presented itself as a lower-cost form of travel at a time when gas prices have gone up, and air travel was too expensive or too difficult to manage, yet people still needed to get from A to B.</p>
<p>This is also where Flix&#8217;s tech comes into play. Like other transportation startups such as Uber but also those that have focused on longer-distance journeys like BlaBlaCar, Flix&#8217;s approach has been to take a legacy service &#8212; in this case buses (it also operates trains) &#8212; and apply better algorithms to determine pricing and routing and timing for the different buses on the network. Indeed, it has often been referred to as the &#8220;Uber of buses.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also generally does not own its fleet, working with third-party independent bus companies to operate vehicles that it brands itself. (I think it&#8217;s very unlikely to drop the Greyhound branding altogether however, given the iconic status of it.) However, this deal appears to represent a shift in that strategy. When the company raised its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/flixmobility-raises-650m-at-a-3b-valuation-to-double-down-on-buses-and-other-transport-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monster $650 round</a> earlier this year &#8212; a round it specifically said would be used to expand in the U.S., a long-desired frontier for the startup &#8212; we raised the question of whether it would, longer term, continue to pursue a model where it does not directly own buses, but instead works with third parties that take on that capital investment themselves (not unlike Uber). The Greyhound deal will include a fleet so it may well be moving further into that realm now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jochen Engert, FlixMobility&#8217;s co-founder and co-CEO said in a statement: “The continuous expansion of our services through partnerships and acquisitions has always been an integral part of our growth strategy to build our global presence. The acquisition of Greyhound is a major step forward in the US. The FlixBus and Greyhound teams share a common vision to make smart, affordable and sustainable mobility accessible to all.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Consumers across North America are increasingly seeking affordable, comfortable, smart and sustainable mobility solutions. A compelling offering will draw significantly more travellers away from private cars to shared coach mobility,&#8221; added André Schwämmlein, another co-founder and co-CEO of FlixMobility, in a statement. &#8220;Together, FlixBus and Greyhound will be better able to meet this increased demand. As our business continues to recover from the effects of the pandemic, we will replicate the success that we have already achieved in 36 countries outside of the US with our innovative and customer centric approach.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just over five months after raising </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/argentinas-pomelo-raises-9m-to-build-a-new-payments-infrastructure-for-latam-fintechs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $9 million seed funding round</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Latin American fintech Pomelo announced today that it is raising $35 million in Series A financing led by Tiger Global Management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup was founded earlier this year to build a fintech-as-a-service platform for Latin America. Its infrastructure aims to allow fintechs and embedded finance players to launch virtual accounts and issue prepaid and credit cards via “compliant” onboarding processes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s impressive just how many high-profile investors the young company has managed to attract in a relatively short amount of time.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221398" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides Tiger, a slew of venture capital firms also participated in the Series A, including Insight Partners, Index Ventures, monashees, SciFi, QED Investors, BoxGroup, Greyhound, Gilgamesh Ventures and Clocktower. A number of notable angels have also invested in the company, such as Affirm founder Max Levchin, Biz Stone, Martin Varsavski, Jackie Reses, a16z’s Angela Strange, N26’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Max Tayenthal, Plaid co-founder William Hockey, Ramp co-founders Eric Glyman and Karim Atiyeh and Unit co-founder and CEO Itai Damti.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding event comes after Pomelo raised a $1 million extension to its seed round in June that included participation from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sequoia Capital, Checkout’s Guillaume Pousaz, GGV’s Hans Tung and GoCardless’ Matt Robinson. The financing marked Sequoia&#8217;s first investment as part of its </span><a href="https://medium.com/sequoia-capital/the-latin-american-startup-opportunity-46ace259777f" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">renewed interest in Latin America</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after taking a break from investing in the region and having previously backed the likes of Nubank and Rappi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven-month-old Pomelo may be in its early stages but it has so far landed four customers, including three fintechs and one embedded finance player. The remote-first fintech started in Argentina and has since launched operations and offices in Brazil and Mexico with plans to also expand to Chile and Colombia. In Argentina, it was granted a Mastercard and payments license.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cards have an estimated payments volume of $900 billion per year, and yet 95% of these transactions are being processed by local incumbents, asserts Pomelo. This is a problem the company’s founders experienced firsthand in previous roles, and are eager to solve by creating a new payments infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We know from previous experiences…that building a fintech, and particularly issuing cards, in Latin America is a real nightmare,” said Pomelo co-founder and CEO Gaston Irigoyen at the time of the company’s last raise. “It takes anywhere from 12 to 18 months to launch a simple prepaid card, and unfortunately companies have to go through the painful experience of repeating the process in every market where they operate.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pomelo’s goal is to solve the problem by creating a new generation of financial services infrastructure that allows companies to build a fintech business and launch cards “much faster” throughout Latin America, which Irigoyen said is home to a financial services infrastructure that is “completely obsolete and highly fragmented.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup claims that its API-driven platform gives companies a way to build compliant onboarding processes, launch virtual accounts that are connected to the local financial systems and issue debit and credit cards throughout Latin America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Each market has its own regulation and nuances, and legacy providers offer poor technology </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">at expensive prices,” he said. “Most founders and technical teams are frustrated with the status quo and can’t scale their products fast enough given the lack of regional solutions. Our goal at Pomelo is to make LatAm look like Europe, meaning that we’ll help our partners unlock multiple markets in a short period of time, allowing them to grow their businesses instead of worrying about regulation, dozens of contracts and backend integrations.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tiger Global partner John Curtius notes what we have also observed here at TechCrunch: that LatAm’s tech scene is “booming” and some emerging startups are working to transform entire industries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve seen some amazing consumer products disrupt consumer banking, lending and insurance in recent years,” Curtius said in a written statement. “We are now excited to partner with Pomelo given their unique perspective about LatAm, their vision for a new regional fintech infrastructure, and a strong team capable of executing with the highest standards.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presently, Pomelo has 100 employees, including people who have previously worked at Mercado Pago, Amazon Payments, Mastercard, Nubank, D-Local, Lime and N26. Its goal is to hire another 150 employees by the end of 2022, according to Irigoyen, who was an early employee at Google LatAm. He is also a third-time founder, with two previous exits (including one to TripAdvisor) and former CEO of Naranja X, one of Argentina’s largest neobanks.</span></p>
<p>(Side note: Pomelo says it gives stock options to all employees, which is somewhat rare in LatAm)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also plans to use its new capital to accelerate its product road map and toward business development efforts.</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a week of fintech infrastructure-related investments in Latin America. On Wednesday, we covered Brazil&#8217;s Hash, a payment infrastructure fintech, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/brazils-hash-raises-40m-in-round-led-by-qed-and-kaszek-for-its-white-label-payments-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising $40 million in a Series C funding round</a> co-led by QED Investors and Kaszek. We also reported on São Paulo-based Pismo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/softbank-amazon-and-accel-back-brazilian-banking-and-payments-infrastructure-provider-pismo-in-108m-round/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closing on $108 million</a> in a Series B funding round co-led by SoftBank, e-commerce giant Amazon and Silicon Valley-based venture firm Accel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/16/lokal-news-yc/">hyperlocal social media platform Lokal</a> has raised $12 million in a new round of financing led by Chinese internet conglomerate Tencent, according to a source familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Existing investors 3one4 Capital, Y Combinator, and India Quotient have also participated in the Bangalore-based startup’s Series A, the source said, requesting anonymity as the matter is private.</p>
<p>Tencent and Lokal did not respond to a request for comment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221535" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>According to estimates, there are over 400 million non-English speaking Indians who are online today. For them, the internet’s offerings are very limited as there aren’t many services that have been built to serve such users &#8212; and many don’t have any offering for such large masses at all.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.getlokalapp.com">Lokal</a> is attempting to reach these users and provide them with a broad range of services. Its eponymous hyperlocal social media app enables non-English speaking users to connect and interact with one another.</p>
<p>The app also helps users find jobs in their vicinity, and keeps them up to date with things such as commodity prices, real estate prices, and matrimonial ads that you would otherwise find in local newspapers. Its offerings also include upskilling services.</p>
<p>The startup says on its website that it has amassed over 10 million downloads and is popular in several states in South India.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new investment comes more than a year and a half after New Delhi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/to-avoid-hostile-takeovers-amid-covid-19-india-mandates-approvals-on-chinese-investments/">introduced rules</a> to require that Indian firms take its approval before raising capital from a Chinese investor. The move significantly slowed down Chinese firms&#8217; investment pace in India. But in recent months, several firms have raised from Tencent.</p>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/tencent-in-talks-to-lead-funding-in-indias-pocket-fm/">reported in August</a> that India&#8217;s Pocket FM was in advanced talks to raise a round from Tencent and others. The Chinese giant, which has <a href="https://the-captable.com/2021/09/tencent-china-debt-india-startups-vc-investments/">invested over $2 billion in Indian startups</a> since 2016, also invested over $200 million in Indian social media platform ShareChat earlier this year, though the startup didn&#8217;t disclose Tencent&#8217;s involvement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/sharechat-valued-at-2-1b-in-502-million-fundraise/">at the time of announcement</a>.</p>
<p>The firm, which also poured in more money in Indian music streaming service Gaana, has made several recent investments in Indian firms as convertible debts to buy the parties time for approval and give Tencent the option to convert its debt into an equity investment in future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Small and medium enterprises make up more than 95% of all businesses in Nigeria. But despite their sheer size and importance, a majority of them are underserved by financial institutions and lack the full suite of financial services needed to scale their operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aside from full-stack financial needs, including credit, small and medium businesses </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">require</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> other essential resources to understand their financial operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.trybrass.com/about/">Brass</a> is a Nigerian fintech tackling these challenges by providing banking services to small and medium businesses. The company has secured a $1.7 million funding round to scale its offerings for &#8220;local entrepreneurs, traders and fast-growing businesses.&#8221;</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220883" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sakindolu">Sola Akindolu</a> and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/emmanix2002">Emmanuel Okeke</a> founded Brass in July 2020. Before Brass, CEO Akindolu was</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the head of product at YC-backed Kudi, while CTO Okeke was an engineering manager at Stripe subsidiary Paystack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akindolu&#8217;s work at Kudi opened his eyes to the problems small and medium businesses face in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He explained that he found out how hard it was for these businesses to have seamless financial operations and cash-flow support services integral to tracking vendor payments, money movement and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overall</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> business health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But why start Brass when there are existing products in the Nigerian market that SMEs and entrepreneurs can use?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/uzoma-dozies-sparkle-raises-3-1m-for-personal-business-neobank-play-in-nigeria/">Sparkle</a>, for instance, offers both personal and business banking services (with more priority on the latter)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consumer neobanks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/nigerian-digital-bank-carbon-hit-240m-in-payments-processed-last-year-up-89-from-2019/">Carbon</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/kuda-the-african-challenger-bank-raises-55m-at-a-500m-valuation/">Kuda</a> are in varying stages of offering business features to SMEs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/nigerias-prospa-gets-3-8m-pre-seed-to-offer-small-businesses-banking-and-software-services/">Prospa</a>, a YC-backed company that doesn&#8217;t like to think of itself as a neobank, also provides software and banking services to microbusinesses and freelancers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akindolu believes that while these products have their entry points into the SME market, they do not capture the entire banking needs of businesses like Brass.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There are many ways money can get out of the business, be it payroll, vendor payment, invoicing. We want to support businesses&#8217; cash flow; we want to support them in those areas to make sure that money keeps running and they can keep growing their business,&#8221; Akindolu said, describing Brass&#8217; application. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So that&#8217;s, for the most part, what we&#8217;re doing with Brass today: financial operations and cash flow support</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brass offers a suite of products &#8212; credit and payment services, payroll and expense management, API support, cash-flow analytics, team and contact management, other core business services such as POS, debit and credit cards &#8212; all wrapped around a business bank account. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of all these features, Brass is betting big on credit with Brass Capital, a space already heating up with other platforms such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/float-wants-to-provide-liquidity-to-african-smbs-in-a-way-never-done-before/">Float</a>, which provides working capital and software services to businesses. That said, Brass Capital has done quite well in a short amount of time; the cash-flow financing service claims to have disbursed more than $2 million in credit after being used for six months by two dozen Brass customers in private beta.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akindolu told TechCrunch that the company would make the service available to the public soon</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brass says that many of its clients use the platform as their default money-operation service provider</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fintech makes money from providing credit and API calls on its regular product offering, said the CEO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has over 5,000 customers ranging from schools and malls to restaurants and fintechs such as Eden and Mono, which use its complete banking solution. And u</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nlike other platforms, Brass is trying to optimize its platform for different levels of businesses with varying needs at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What we&#8217;ve set out to do is to build stacks of financial operation services. We may be overkill for a micro business; they might not find us useful, so we&#8217;re more concerned about small and medium-sized businesses.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mission to make banking work for small businesses was one reason why pan-African VC firm Ventures Platform invested in the company, according to its founder and general partner, Kola Aina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investors include Flutterwave CEO Olugbenga &#8220;GB&#8221; Agboola, Paystack co-founder Ezra Olubi, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/hustle-fund-wants-to-help-spawn-a-new-generation-of-angel-investors/">Hustle Fund</a>, Acuity Ventures and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/japans-uncovered-fund-launches-15m-fund-to-back-early-stage-startups-in-africa/">Uncovered Fund</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to back Sola and the Brass team, who are providing critical financial technology to Africa&#8217;s businesses, starting with Nigeria&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">approximately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 41.5 million businesses,&#8221; said Elizabeth Yin, the general partner at Hustle Fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Nigeria that access to comprehensive banking solutions services continues to be one of the most significant constraints for SMEs &#8212; it&#8217;s most major economies in Africa. Indeed, the continent&#8217;s formal SME sector has an annual financing gap of over <a href="https://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/11/african-smes-face-136bn-financing-gap-annually-ifc/">$136 billion</a>, although they account for over 80% of employed people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this reason, Akindolu affirmed that Brass would use part of the financing to take its business to Kenya and South Africa by next year (it has finalized incorporation in the former). Integral to driving its expansion plans across Africa is a partnership with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Flutterwave</a>, the one-year-old company said in a statement. Brass also plans to diversify its customer base by launching more product categories, especially around credit in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">its markets.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the pandemic turning us into delivery experts, consumers have also switched on to meal-kits on droves, given that it combines both delivery and home cooking. But many meal kits can be inflexible.</p>
<p>The Kitchenful startup in Germany realized this and so it allows users to browse recipes from food bloggers and have personalized meal plans created, adjustable to preferences and dietary requirements. Kitchenful’s other offering is that it tries to be affordable as well, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/kitchenful-combines-meal-planning-with-a-grocery-concierge-service/">we wrote earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>After going through the Y-Combinator Summer 2021 program, it has now raised a $1.9M funding round from VentureFriends, Goodwater Capital, and Jabbar Internet Group.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219781" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Previous investors include Y-Combinator and angels such as Valentin Stalf (Co-Founder and CEO of N26), Samih Toukan (Co-founder at Souq), David Fischer (HighSnobiety), Maik Ludewig (MD of DurstExpress), and Victor Henning (Co-Founder of Mendeley).</p>
<p>Co-Founders Chris Schiller and Christian Hartung now plan to expand into the EU and North America.</p>
<p>Schiller previously spent 4 years as Vice President of Product at Hello Fresh, and both he and Hartung were formerly at Rocket Internet.</p>
<p>Schiller said: “We believe that cooking at home should be simple, fun, and personal. However in today’s world “What’s for dinner” is still a nerve-wracking question, and grocery shopping costs millions of people time and energy every single day. We are fixing this with our new service and the ambition to become the leading brand for cooking at home in the United States and Europe.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apostolos Apostolakis, Co-Founder and Partner at VentureFriends, said: “Online grocery is currently being disrupted and we see a trend of commoditization of delivery services itself which makes the adjacent layers that help to decide what to actually buy ever more relevant. With the founders’ highly relevant backgrounds Kitchenful is in a promising position to become a leading brand in the cook at home space.”</p>
<p>Kitchenful is likely to meet stiff opposition from other new players in this space <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/lollipop-ai-launches-online-grocery-marketplace-where-you-can-build-your-own-recipes/">such as Lollipop</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://360learning.com">360Learning</a> has raised a $200 million funding round from Sumeru, SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2 and Silver Lake Waterman. And this time, the name of the startup describes quite well what it does. 360Learning lets you learn from your peers with an easy-to-use platform that lets you create and share courses with your peers.</p>
<p>Existing investors Bpifrance’s Large Venture fund, XAnge and Educapital are also participating in today’s funding round.</p>
<p>When it comes to content creation, 360Learning lets you mix different kinds of media and work on a course with multiple people in your team. For instance, you can capture video, add questions and give feedback in case someone doesn’t pick the right answer. You can also upload your own files, add YouTube videos and more. The interface is supposed to be easy enough that you don&#8217;t have to be an e-learning expert to create a course. As long as you&#8217;re an expert in your field, you can share knowledge with coworkers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2218840" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Over time, companies end up building their own collection of courses that they can hand out to new employees. It can also be a good opportunity for employees looking for a new job within the same big company.</p>
<p>After that, companies can distribute the course to all employees or a group of employees specifically. Admins can track feedback from employees who completed a course and see completion rates, which can be particularly useful for mandatory compliance trainings.</p>
<p>The company also says that it uses artificial intelligence to identify courses that can be improved because there are some missing information. It can also help when it comes to matching the right course with the right employee at the right time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>1,500 companies are currently using 360Learning, such as LVMH, Aircall, Toyota and Appen. They use the platform for employee onboarding, software training and various courses that help you get better at sales, leadership and soft skills in general.</p>
<p>Today’s funding round is a significant one as the company had only raised $40 million before that. The company plans to hire more people, expand to new markets and make some acquisitions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you’ve been working in the French tech ecosystem, you may remember a startup called AppGratis. The app discovery and promotion startup basically had to stop operating overnight following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/appgratis/">a long and nasty fight with Apple</a>.</p>
<p>From the team that brought you AppGratis, <a href="https://batch.com">Batch</a> is a customer engagement platform that has been operating under the radar for many years. And now, the startup has raised a $23 million (€20 million) funding round led by Expedition Capital with Orange Ventures also participating.</p>
<p>But Batch is a radically different product. It’s a customer engagement platform that competes with <a href="https://www.braze.com">Braze</a> as well as big enterprise solutions from Salesforce, Adobe, Oracle, IBM and Microsoft.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221075" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If you don’t work in martech, a customer engagement platform doesn’t mean much to you. But it’s quite easy to understand what it does. Batch started as a managed push notification platform for iOS, Android and the web.</p>
<p>Essentially, if you run a newspaper app, a banking app or an e-commerce app, you might need to send push notifications to your customers. Those notifications can be both transactional (you received a money transfer) or a marketing message (check this promotion).</p>
<p>Batch lets you manage those notifications at scale. You don’t have to make sure that your servers can handle a jump in traffic, you don’t have to maintain your push notification service.</p>
<p>From that idea, Batch has expanded beyond that to become an interesting martech platform. It integrates with your existing data sources, such as your CRM, CDP and analytics products. This way, you can create segments, orchestrate notifications, retarget your clients and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Batch currently handles 400 billion messages for its 300 enterprise clients. Those customers include Le Monde, Le Parisien, Eurosport, BNP Paribas, Société Générale, Leboncoin, etc. As you can imagine, each client is worth quite a lot of money.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company wants to invest in its internal culture to attract more talent and retain existing talent. The startup will also hire more people to develop the product further and more people in sales and marketing to find new clients.</p>
<p>It has taken a bit of time to get there and recover from the AppGratis debacle. But Batch has clearly proven its resilience and now seems well-positioned to win more customers and grow its platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The edtech boom has focused primarily on students, but teachers are learners, too. <a href="https://www.doyobi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Doyobi</a>, a Singapore-based professional development platform, wants to give educators new, more engaging ways of teaching STEM subjects. The startup announced today it has raised $2.8 million in pre-Series A funding led by Monk’s Hill Ventures.</p>
<p>The round included Tresmonos Capital, Novus Paradigm Capital and XA Network, along with angel investors like Carousell chief executive officer Quek Siu Rui, Glints co-founders Oswald Yeo and Seah Ying Cong and Grab Financial Group head Reuben Lai.</p>
<p>The platform, which includes teacher training and interactive content for their students, is now used by about 2,000 teachers in more than 10 countries in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Two of its largest markets are Indonesia and the Philippines. Doyobi has partnerships with educational platforms Leap Surabaya, Coderacademy and private schools like HighScope Indonesia, Mutiara Harapan Islamic School and Stella Gracia School.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220754" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Doyobi was founded in 2020 as a spin-off from <a href="https://www.saturdaykids.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saturday Kids</a>, a STEM-focused educational program. Co-founder and CEO John Tan told TechCrunch that after operating for eight years, Saturday Kids was only reaching thousands of students a year, even though there are millions of kids around the world who need to learn STEM skills.</p>
<p>“There is a massive gap between what is being taught in schools and what children need to learn in order to be prepared for jobs of the future. Curiosity, imagination and empathy are just as important as literacy and numeracy skills,” he said. “Teachers play an outsize role in shaping learning outcomes, yet most edtech innovations take the teacher in the classroom completely out of the picture.”</p>
<p>Though many governments understand the importance of STEM skills for economic growth, many are struggling to incorporate them into their curriculums, he added. Doyobi wants to solve that problem by reaching students through their teachers.</p>
<p>In addition to developmental training for teachers that include live video lessons, the startup built its own virtual learning environment for educators to use with kids. It includes courses that link new skills to real-world uses, interactive media and Scratch coding projects to reinforce what students learn in class. Doyobi also runs an online community called Teachers As Humans where educators can find peer support.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup will use its new funding to create more courses for educators, along with teaching resources, like videos, quizzes and projects, for their students.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nearly 150,000 Tesla cars are using the company&#8217;s new &#8220;safety score,&#8221; a tool rolled out last month to determine whether owners can access the beta version of its “Full Self-Driving” software, executives said during its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/tesla-charges-forward-with-a-third-quarter-profit-of-1-6-billion/"> third quarter earnings call</a>.</p>
<p>While 150,000 cars are now part of the Full-Self Driving (FSD) beta enrollment program, a fraction of drivers have been given access to the software. Only<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-09-29/tesla-drivers-gripped-by-fomo-clamor-to-be-fsd-beta-testers"> 2,000 drivers</a> have been able to test the FSD program over the past year. Earlier this month, Tesla rolled out version 10.2 to around <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1446104772092772352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1446752265012908032%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2021%2F10%2F12%2Ftesla-invites-drivers-to-fsd-beta-10point2-nda-restrictions-not-included-.html">1,000 additional owners with perfect safety scores</a>.</p>
<p>Tesla charges $10,000 for the FSD software, which CEO Elon Musk has promised for years will one day deliver full autonomous driving capabilities. However, Tesla vehicles equipped with FSD are not self-driving. FSD is an advanced driver assistance system that includes a number of automated features, including its parking tool Summon as well as Navigate on Autopilot, an active guidance system that navigates a car from a highway on-ramp to off-ramp, including interchanges and making lane changes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221381" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The latest FSD Beta is supposed to automate driving on highways and city streets. This is still a Level 2 driver assistance system that requires the driver to pay attention, have their hands on the wheel and take control at all times.</p>
<p>While the safety score, which must be a perfect 100 to gain access to the beta software, is being used to meter out access to FSD, Tesla has other uses in mind. The company wants to use the feature to better inform its blossoming telematics insurance product, which just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/15/tesla-debuts-new-car-insurance-that-uses-texans-real-time-driving-behavior/">launched in Texas in early October</a>. The safety score takes into account things like braking, turning, tailgating, forward collision warnings and forced autopilot disengagements in order to predict the probability of a collision.</p>
<p>So far, Tesla has gathered over 100 million miles of driving data, analysis of which it showed that the probability of a collision for a customer using a safety score versus someone who is not using the safety score is 30% lower, according to Zachary Kirkhorn, chief financial officer of Tesla.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means the product is working and customers are responding to it,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Because Tesla cars are connected, the company has been able to use enormous amounts of data to assess the attributes of drivers and whether those attributes correlate with safety, said Kirkhorn. Tesla has used this driving history data to create the model that&#8217;s able to predict the probability of a collision over a period of time.</p>
<p>&#8220;The model is not perfect, the model is a function of the data we have available,&#8221; said Kirkhorn. &#8220;As that data set continues to grow, we continue to experiment with new variables&#8230;and from that model being able to predict the frequency of collision, we can then align that against a price curve.&#8221;</p>
<p>This allows Tesla to offer individualized pricing that&#8217;s &#8220;integrated into the car, integrated into the app, integrated into that customer&#8217;s experience,&#8221; complete with a feedback loop that communicates to the driver what driving adjustments need to be made to decrease the probability of a collision after every drive.</p>
<p>When Tesla began researching insurance, the company found that traditional insurance companies calculate premiums based on static and existing data, like accident history, marital status, age or other demographic information. Kirkhorn said the result is low-risk customers end up overpaying on their insurance, and that overpayment then goes to subsidize the riskier customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we looked at this and we looked at the data, we though, this just doesn&#8217;t seem like it&#8217;s fair,&#8221; said Kirkhorn.</p>
<p>Tesla has offered insurance in California for about two years, but Texas is the first state where those premiums will be  dictated by safety scores. The company has a roadmap of additional states to launch its insurance as it receives regulatory approvals, and its goal is to be in every major market in which Tesla cars exist, Kirkhorn said.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been several weeks now, and Clubhouse still hasn&#8217;t enabled record/replay. Neither has Twitter Spaces. Facebook just announced a live audio entry too, but no record. With all the drama about Facebook, I&#8217;m not expecting much soon, but c&#8217;mon guys, let&#8217;s get it done.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m loving Youtube TV, which lets me cherry pick hours of cable news repetition and cut to the chase. The collapse of one of the two major political parties puts new pressure on the other one to get things done. This edition of the Gang surfaces the oft-referenced collapse of journalism. Cable news takes a complex struggle like the two infrastructure bills and turns it into a horse race. Is it Manchin&#8217;s fault or Sinema&#8217;s rudeness to the press? Are the Progressives overreaching with not enough strength where it counts, at the ballot box? As Biden&#8217;s poll numbers decline, the chances of a Republican takeover of the House in the midterms improve. C&#8217;mon guys.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221456" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Beatles continue to amaze, as evidenced by the latest remix extravaganza of the ill-fated Let It Be sessions. Coming as they did in the wake of the fractious White Album, Paul McCartney’s self-appointed leadership of the group spurred a struggle between rehearsals at Twickenham Studios and reconstituted recordings at a makeshift studio in the basement of the group’s Apple headquarters on Saville Row. The later sessions were topped off with a live 42-minute performance on the building’s roof.</p>
<p>51 years later (with a year tacked on thanks to the pandemic) the Let It Be release is deconstructed into book, remixed expansions of the eventual release of the material, and a 3-part 6-hour documentary of the project helmed by director Peter Jackson. As with earlier versions of Sgt. Pepper, The Beatles (White Album), and Abbey Road, the expansions prove over and over again how the Beatles and their producer George Martin seized control of the top of the charts and never surrendered it. Even the steady stream of failures of the Let It Be project illustrated how the band moved to blend the individual personalities of its members and their almost biochemical skills as writers to achieve what is now fairly uniformly perceived as the greatest creative force of the pop, rock, and pre-social worlds.</p>
<p>No small credit goes to the precision and command of the recording process by the engineers of the EMI Studios, which were renamed Abbey Road in the wake of the triumphant album recorded just after the sessions of Let It Be. The studio was fundamentally a laboratory where engineers wore white lab coats and followed a hierarchical structure that constrained climbing the ranks based on seniority and not innovation. It took the Beatles many years to subvert the process, but their global success gave them bargaining power to generate their own material, which then led to expanding recording hours from a single 9 to 5 session for their first record to all night odysseys that burned out engineers and broke open an avenue for young emergent talent.</p>
<p>So it was that 19-year old Geoff Emerick arrived just in time as the Beatles’ decision to end touring and precipitated the experiments that began with Revolver and blossomed with Sgt. Pepper and later Abbey Road. While EMI was slow to adopt the wave of studio innovations driven by the American studios, the careful use of mixing down 3 of the common 4 available tracks produced a composite feel of live and complex stacking of instruments, vocals, and orchestral arrangements. Th4 advent of digital recording and mixing gave today’s engineers led by George Martin’s son Giles the tools to pull apart the interim recordings and produce remixes that went beyond even what the original recordings seemed to capture.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Disney has just released a 4-minute trailer of the enhanced Get Back filming, whetting our appetite for the Thanksgiving special on Disney+. The Beatles’ film career started off smashingly with Hard Days Night, floated off in a marijuana haze with Help, and collapsed miserably with a self-produced TV special Magical Mystery Tour. But the Get Back trailer restores not only the struggles and fighting of the sick-of-each-other prisoners of Beatlemania, but also the magic of the group’s camaraderie and humor. My favorite scene of Help features the Fab Four walking up to identical doors on a London street, and entering into a common apartment on the other side of the wall. The trailer reopens that door for another minute, where the band’s self-prophetic references spurred the shared myth of the Beatles into a reality greater than the sum of its parts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Elon Musk&#8217;s Boring Company received Wednesday the initial approval required to build a transportation system that would shuttle passengers in Tesla vehicles via a network of tunnels under Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The approval by Clark County officials of a special use permit and franchise agreement would allow the Boring Company to expand its Vegas Loop system beyond its current <a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/lvcc">1.7-mile footprint</a> that connects the Las Vegas Convention Center campus to a 29-mile route with 51 stations that would include stops at casinos along the Las Vegas Strip, the city&#8217;s football stadium and UNLV. It would eventually reach the McCarran International Airport. The <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/traffic/underground-travel-in-strip-stadium-areas-moves-closer-to-reality-2463119/">Las Vegas Review-Journal</a> was the first to report on the approval.</p>
<p>The Boring Company has said it will <a href="https://clark.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&amp;ID=9881971&amp;GUID=91AE5C45-D364-4688-A7F6-E5E1FF41FDA5">pay for the tunnels</a>, a point that Clark County officials reiterated Wednesday. According to the agreement with Clark county, the franchise agreement would last for 50 years.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221399" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Vegas Loop is expanding &#8211; 29 miles and 51 stations! <br />Thanks to the Clark County team for the great partnership and to the Commissioners for unanimous approval. <a href="https://t.co/KrfF5SUsxq">https://t.co/KrfF5SUsxq</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>While the project has passed an important milestone, it is not a done deal just yet. This special use permit lets The Boring Company apply for the land use and building permits for each station and the tunnels. The Boring Company will also have to get a separate franchise agreement approved by the city of Las Vegas.</p>

<p>Through the pandemic, a trove of attention has been paid to new market structures and activity that are deemed short term, risky or speculative. Whether they are and what net outcomes they yield for various stakeholders are useful questions.</p>
<p>But the noise has muted analysis and coverage of other highly ambitious technology ventures — ones that aim to uplift and correct financial markets by encouraging longevity, community and empowerment.</p>
<h2>Longevity: More choices to go and stay public</h2>
<p>The volume of special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) IPOs we have seen through the pandemic is astounding in historical terms.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220779" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220779" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2220779" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-1.49.44-PM.png" alt="Number of SPAC IPOs from 2003-2021" width="1024" height="651" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-1.49.44-PM.png 1410w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-1.49.44-PM.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-1.49.44-PM.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-1.49.44-PM.png?resize=768,488 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-1.49.44-PM.png?resize=680,432 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-07-at-1.49.44-PM.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220779" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1178249/spac-ipo-usa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statista <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Leaving out the sponsors, private market investors and participating startups, reactions to SPACs have been largely negative. The binary views are reminiscent of those we saw during the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/05/ico-companies-become-investors/">ICO frenzy in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>Debates on whether the pandemic’s cohort of SPACs or their status as a liquidity structure are net positives or negatives have overshadowed other ambitious initiatives that aim to encourage more long-term planning and participation in markets. One example is the <a href="https://ltse.com/">Long-Term Stock Exchange</a> (LTSE).</p>
<p>This August, Eric Ries’ LTSE listed its first two companies, <a href="https://asana.com/">Asana</a> and <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a>. Companies that list on the exchange must adhere to its five principles, which aim to maximize diversity and inclusion, environmental and social impact, employee welfare and long-term conviction.</p>
<p>The LTSE emphasizes a focus on transparency — for instance, when an LTSE user searches for information on Asana, they’ll first find information about the company’s values, long-term principles and growth metrics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla said Wednesday it will use iron-based batteries for its standard Model 3 and Model Y models across global markets. The update, provided in the company&#8217;s <a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/TWPKBV_TSLA_Q3_2021_Quarterly_Update_SI1AKE.pdf?xseo=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q3-2021-Quarterly-Update.pdf%22">third-quarter earnings report</a>, confirmed hints that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been dropping for months about the cheaper battery chemistry&#8217;s growing role in the company&#8217;s product line-up.</p>
<p>Lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries use an older, cheaper battery chemistry and are popular in China. Outside of China, EV batteries are predominately nickel-based — either nickel-manganese-cobalt or nickel-cobalt-aluminum. But beyond cost savings, LFP battery cells are attractive because they are not dependent on ultra-scarce raw materials like cobalt and nickel. Notably, Tesla CFO Zach Kirkhorn confirmed during an investor call Wednesday that the company has seen pricing impacts to nickel and aluminum.</p>
<p>One major reason why LFP batteries are not seen much outside of China relates to a series of key LFP patents, which have allowed the country to dominate the LFP market.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221401" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But those patents will soon be expiring, and it seems that Tesla has its eye on that timeframe, with executives suggesting that the company intends to bring LFP battery production to the same locations where it manufactures its vehicles.</p>

<p>“Our goal is to localize all key parts of the vehicles on the continent &#8212; at least the continent, if not closer, to where the vehicles are produced,” Drew Baglino, SVP of Powertrain and Energy Engineering at Tesla, told investors. “That is our goal. We&#8217;re working internally with our suppliers to accomplish that goal, and not just at the end assembly level but as far upstream as possible.”</p>
<p>The company also provided a very brief, and slightly hedging, update on its 4680 battery pack, a custom cell design it created in-house. Tesla has said that the 4680 battery will be capable of greater energy density and range. Baglino said the 4680 is on track to be delivered in vehicles at the beginning of next year, with structural testing and validation all on schedule. But while the company is happy with the timeline, “this is a new architecture and unknown unknowns may exist still,” Baglino added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“From a cell perspective, we are comfortable with the design maturity and manufacturing readiness matching the pack timeline I just mentioned,” he added.</p>

<p>Look, we don&#8217;t get it either.</p>
<p>Taking some time as a group to sit around and chat through <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/paypal-said-to-be-exploring-potential-acquisition-of-pinterest/">the possibly impending PayPal-Pinterest deal</a>, Natasha and Alex didn&#8217;t wind up cracking the story. Which makes some sense, as investors sent PayPal stock down 5% on the news, implying that <em>they</em> didn&#8217;t really get it either.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2221356" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Recall that PayPal has made a few other deals in recent years, including buying Honey ($4 billion) and Paidy (less than $4 billion).</p>
<p>Regardless, the transaction &#8212; worth potentially <em>dozens</em> of billions &#8212; could scoot the social giant into the welcoming arms of PayPal, an American consumer and business fintech giant. Here&#8217;s what we tried to sort out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does Pinterest have a big enough e-commerce story to make the deal line up with our first expectations?</li>
<li>We talked about Pinterest&#8217;s historical stock performance, as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/19/human-capital-ex-pinterest-employees-who-alleged-discrimination-say-no-progress-has-been-made/">a number of culture controversies</a> it has been embroiled in.</li>
<li>Why doesn&#8217;t PayPal just buy Etsy instead? Here we dug into why a shop-able, searchable mood board may satisfy customer demands, thus Pinterest&#8217;s lag on fintech infrastructure — in comparison to Etsy — has been somewhat surprising.</li>
<li>And if technology is all bundling and unbundling, does it make some sort of sense for PayPal to join forces with a more e-commerce <em>content</em> focused business, now more than a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/30/ebay-paypal-split/">half-decade removed from its eBay divorce?</a></li>
<li>We ended with jokes about fintech&#8217;s expected (and unexpected) consolidation, and we want your best guesses for <a href="https://twitter.com/EquityPod">what&#8217;s next on Twitter. </a></li>
</ul>
<p>Frankly we had a good time. Mary Ann was going to join up but was thwarted by Apple&#8217;s iPhone headphone design, while Danny was slightly busy trying to figure out why his spouse beat him at Settlers of Catan, his favorite board game. We are back Friday with our regularly scheduled programming!</p>
