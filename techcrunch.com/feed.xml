										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is testing a new feature that will notify users when the platform is experiencing an outage or technical issue. The notification will appear directly in users’ activity feeds. Instagram notes that it won’t send a notification every single time there is an outage, but if it sees that users “are confused and looking for answers,” it will determine if a notification would make things clearer.</p>
<p>The announcement comes as Facebook and its properties were hit with a lengthy outage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-messenger-instagram-whatsapp-are-all-down/">last week on Monday</a> and again briefly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/08/facebook-and-instagram-went-down-again-this-afternoon/">on Friday</a>. The company explained that both outages were caused by configuration changes but were unrelated.</p>
<p>“Through conversations with our community and extensive research, we know how confusing it can be when temporary issues happen on Instagram. When they impact engagement or distribution, we also know that it can lead people to think that the problems are unique to them, based on what they post. That lack of clarity can be frustrating, which is why we want it to be easier to understand what&#8217;s going on, directly from us,” Instagram said in a <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagram-outages-and-account-status">blog post.</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216806" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new feature is a welcome addition to the app, as users will no longer have to wonder if the app isn’t loading because of an error on their end. Instagram is running the new test in the U.S. for the next few months. The company says it wants to start small with the feature and then expand it to more users if it makes sense to do so.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216810" style="width: 571px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216810" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2216810" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-technical-issue-notification.jpeg" alt="" width="561" height="519" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-technical-issue-notification.jpeg 2474w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-technical-issue-notification.jpeg?resize=150,139 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-technical-issue-notification.jpeg?resize=300,277 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-technical-issue-notification.jpeg?resize=768,710 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-technical-issue-notification.jpeg?resize=680,629 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-technical-issue-notification.jpeg?resize=1536,1421 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-technical-issue-notification.jpeg?resize=2048,1894 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/instagram-technical-issue-notification.jpeg?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216810" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>Instagram also announced that it’s launching a new feature called ‘Account Status’ that will make it easier for people to know whether their account is at risk of being disabled. Instagram says the new tool will be a “one-stop shop to see what’s going with your account.” If users think Instagram has made a mistake with a post of theirs that was removed, they can appeal by selecting the “Request a Review” option directly within the tool.</p>
<p>The company plans to add more information to this tool to give users a better sense of how their content is being distributed and recommended across different parts of the app. Instagram says it will share more information about these two new features over time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://atomic.financial/">Atomic</a> announced this morning that it has closed a $22 million Series A. <a href="http://corevc.com/">Core Innovation Capital</a> led the round, which saw participation from preceding investors. The company has raised just under $39 million to date.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s API-delivered product, which focuses on payroll data, helps power a number of fintech startups that we track &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/30/upstart-banking-company-dave-is-now-worth-1-billion-as-norwest-puts-in-50-million/">Dave</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/who-needs-a-baas-partner-anyway/">Bond</a>, among others &#8212; making it an interesting company to dig into.</p>
<p>Atomic&#8217;s APIs allow consumers to connect their income to different services, helping them set up direct deposit at a neobank, for example. Other use cases include income and employment verification that is simpler for workers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216403" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s head of markets, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsay-crusan-davis/">Lindsay Davis,</a> told TechCrunch in an interview that her company wants to &#8220;unlock the power of the paycheck.&#8221;</p>
<p>Notably, the company does not currently compete with Plaid, perhaps the best-known provider of financial APIs, according to Davis.</p>
<p>Plaid&#8217;s products are used for linking consumer banking accounts to financial services and products. In contrast, Atomic focuses on income streams, allowing them to be partially or completely diverted to new financial buckets, or simply made observable to other parties with user permission for verification purposes.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Atomic charges corporate customers for income and employment verification services on a usage basis, and for its direct deposit product in a more SaaS-like manner. Davis added that some customers bundle the two services together, underscoring that Atomic&#8217;s business model is a blend of both on-demand and subscription pricing.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RqwQHyRr9I"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/10/baas-served-three-ways-a-closer-look-at-a-rapidly-evolving-market/">BaaS served three ways: A closer look at a rapidly evolving market</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;BaaS served three ways: A closer look at a rapidly evolving market&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/10/baas-served-three-ways-a-closer-look-at-a-rapidly-evolving-market/embed/#?secret=RqwQHyRr9I" data-secret="RqwQHyRr9I" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Thinking broadly, a cohort of fintech startups are building business products that may provide consumers with more control over their money. Businesses are willing to pay for their services as they can lessen friction to bring new funds onto their own platforms. That neobanks and other financial services that compete with traditional banking companies are paying up to help end-users make provider choices is not a surprise. The result of that work is fintech making &#8212; to a degree &#8212; the financial world a bit more amenable to consumer control.</p>
<h2>Money</h2>
<p>TechCrunch asked the company why it decided to raise its Series A now &#8212; a question that we&#8217;ve added to our regular arsenal thanks to increased round pre-emption by investors; gone are the days when startups were expected to reach a certain revenue threshold to raise one round type or another.</p>
<p>Davis said that, in her view, companies are ready to raise a Series A when they have both have a product in market and customer traction, so it made sense for Atomic to raise this particular round now.</p>
<p>She added that her company was offered more capital last year, but that it wasn&#8217;t ready to take on the funds. But with market demand demonstrated for Atomic&#8217;s direct deposit product, she explained, and a few preemptive term sheets, the startup decided that now was the right time.</p>
<p>Atomic has around 55 staffers today, a figure that it is looking to rapidly expand. The company has 20 open roles, Davis noted.</p>
<p>The company has lots of white space around its current business to expand into. With income verification, TechCrunch will be curious to see whether Atomic eventually digs into the credit scoring market. Credit scores in the United States <a href="https://medium.com/commonfuture/why-credit-scores-are-racist-da109fcfb300">are a mess</a>, to be polite. And we&#8217;re looking for the startup that will take on the traditional agencies in charge of deciding how worthy you are of loans and other financial products.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see if that winds up being Atomic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As the Apple v. Epic Games <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-appeals-last-weeks-ruling-in-antitrust-battle-with-apple/">lawsuit</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/">goes under appeal,</a> Google on Monday afternoon filed an answer and counterclaim in the Epic Games&#8217; antitrust litigation against the company. The tech giant and Android maker denies Epic&#8217;s allegations of antitrust behavior and instead says that it&#8217;s owed relief, as Epic Games breached the Google Play Developer Distribution Agreement (DDA) by allowing Fortnite players who download the app through Google Play to use Epic&#8217;s own payment processing technology.</p>
<p>This situation is similar to what took place on the App Store, where Epic Games updated its app to workaround App Store policies, and then facilitated payments through its own payments system, in violation of its legal contract with Apple. The court&#8217;s decision in Apple&#8217;s case was that Epic owed financial relief to Apple, to the tune <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-pays-apple-6-million/">of $6 million dollars</a>.</p>
<p>Epic Games did much of the same thing on Google Play, the counterclaim alleges. Last year, Epic submitted a build of Fortnite to Google Play which used Epic&#8217;s own direct payments system and not Google Play Billing. This submission was immediately rejected for failing to comply with Google&#8217;s policies. Epic then submitted a compliant version in April 2020, which Google now describes as &#8220;an act of deception designed to provoke litigation.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216771" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new version had concealed Epic&#8217;s payment system in an update that was sent to both Apple and Google&#8217;s app stores. This would allow Epic to switch over to its own payment system by applying a server-side configuration change, or &#8220;hotfix,&#8221; without Google&#8217;s knowledge.</p>
<p>That switched was flipped on August 13, 2020. It allowed Fortnite users to choose between Google Play Billing and Epic&#8217;s own direct payments system. This move was meant to trigger the game&#8217;s rejection from the app stores, paying the way for Epic to pursue its planned litigation. Google said it notified Epic Games on the same day the hotfix was applied that it was in violation of the DDA, Google&#8217;s Malicious Behavior Policy, and the Google Play Billing Policy, and removed Fortnite from Google Play. However, it did not disable Epic&#8217;s account so the game maker could resubmit a compliant version.</p>
<p>However, Android users who had downloaded the game from Google Play could still use Epic&#8217;s own payments system even after the app was pulled down, allowing Epic to evade its contractually obligated service fee to Google, the counterclaim states. Google is asking the court to award restitution of this loss of feeds, in addition to other damages, attorney&#8217;s fees, interest, and any other relief the court deems necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Epic, a multibillion-dollar company backed by two of the world’s largest video game developers, has profited immensely from the safe, secure platform provided by Google Play, a platform for which it pays a fee equivalent or less than that charged by other major platform providers,&#8221; the counterclaim states. &#8220;Not satisfied with those immense profits, it entered into a legal agreement with Google with which it never intended to comply, deceiving Google and concealing its true intentions to provoke a legal and public relations confrontation that continues to this day. Its actions have put its own users at risk, have harmed Google, and are deserving of relief from this Court,&#8221; it says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Epic Games has no further comment on the new filing.</p>
<p>However, Epic&#8217;s position has been that Apple and Google&#8217;s requirement to use their own in-app payment systems exclusively is a monopolistic practice that disadvantages developers. In Apple&#8217;s case, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">the court agreed</a> that Apple should not block developers from sharing a link to other payment methods inside their own app or communicating to customers. It did not declare Apple a monopoly.</p>
<p>But Google&#8217;s situation is a bit different as Android already allows for sideloading apps &#8212; that means there&#8217;s another method of reaching Android users outside Google Play, making an antitrust claim more difficult.</p>
<p>Google has also filed its answer with the state&#8217;s attorney general, developer, and consumer cases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-bike manufacturer <a href="https://www.vanmoof.com">VanMoof</a> recently raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/vanmoof-raises-128-million-to-become-the-worlds-leading-e-bike-brand/">$128 million funding round</a>. And the company is already using some of that cash to develop a brand new product — the <a href="https://www.vanmoof.com/en-FR/vanmoof-v">VanMoof V</a>. This is a new product in the VanMoof lineup, a high-speed bike.</p>
<p>The VanMoof V isn’t available just yet. Instead, the company teased the new bike in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7ymwpXFxtg">live YouTube video</a>. The company plans to release the VanMoof V by the end of 2022. It should cost approximately <a href="https://www.vanmoof.com/en-US/vanmoof-v">$3,598</a>, <a href="https://www.vanmoof.com/en-FR/vanmoof-v">€3,498</a> or <a href="https://www.vanmoof.com/en-GB/vanmoof-v">£2,998</a> according to the landing pages on VanMoof’s website.</p>
<p>What you get for that price is an electric bike with two motors — one in the front wheel and one in the rear wheel. There are two suspension systems at the front and at the back of the vehicle to help you with uneven streets. The VanMoof V also features thick tires for increased safety.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216791" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>According to the YouTube video, the bike can reach a top speed of 60 km/h (37 mph). But if you have an e-bike already, you know that there are regulations when it comes to motor assistance for bikes. In Europe, an e-bike cannot travel faster than 25 km/h (15.5 mph). In the U.S., that limitation depends on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_bicycle_laws">each state</a> but is still lower than the VanMoof V top speed.</p>
<p>It doesn’t mean that you can’t ride faster than that. It means that the motor will stop assisting you if you reach the top speed of your jurisdiction. The company is already saying that the VanMoof V won’t help you break the law.</p>
<p>“When we first started imagining what the V could become, we very soon agreed it’s about a whole new approach to how we use the roads. The VanMoof V will have integrated speed settings to match your country’s regulations. However, this bike has the technology and capacity to hit speeds up to 60 kilometers per hour or 37 miles per hour. As it stands, local regulations across the world cap the top speed of this category. But in the long term, we need much bigger thinking,” VanMoof co-founder and CEO Ties Carlier said during the announcement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“In our vision, current policy is limiting the adoption of this type of transportation. We’re calling for policies designed for people instead of cars. That’s why we will work with city governments to explore geofencing and push for modernized speed regulations,” he added.</p>
<p>In other words, the VanMoof V should be considered as a concept bike to share VanMoof’s vision, as well as a lobbying vehicle for policymakers around the world. The company had to share its plans in advance because you don’t need a two-wheel drive to reach 25 km/h.</p>
<p>Having said that, VanMoof is sending invitations to a group of VanMoof customers and crowdfunders. These invitations let you reserve a VanMoof V with a $20 reservation deposit. Reservations start today with a potential release date of late 2022.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Japanese technology giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/technology-giant-olympus-hit-by-blackmatter-ransomware/">Olympus</a> has confirmed it was hit by a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cyberattack/">cyberattack</a> over the weekend that forced it to shut down its IT systems in the U.S., Canada and Latin America.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.olympus-global.com/news/2021/nr02217.html">a statement on its website</a>, Olympus said it is “investigating a potential cybersecurity incident detected October 10” and is “currently working with the highest priority to resolve this issue.”</p>
<p>“As part of the investigation and containment, we have suspended affected systems and have informed the relevant external partners. The current results of our investigation indicate the incident was contained to the Americas with no known impact to other regions.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216777" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We are working with appropriate third parties on this situation and will continue to take all necessary measures to serve our customers and business partners in a secure way. Protecting our customers and partners and maintaining their trust in us is our highest priority. Our investigation is ongoing and we are committed to transparent disclosure and will continue to provide updates as new information becomes available.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s near-identical to a statement put out by Olympus last month following a cyberattack <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/12/technology-giant-olympus-hit-by-blackmatter-ransomware/">on its European, Middle East and Africa network</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of the attack, Olympus also said it was “investigating a potential cybersecurity incident.&#8221; A person with knowledge of the incident told TechCrunch that Olympus was recovering from a ransomware attack. A ransom note left behind on infected systems was also linked to the BlackMatter ransomware-as-a-service group.</p>
<p>Brett Callow, a ransomware expert and threat analyst at Emsisoft, told TechCrunch that given this latest incident occurred at the weekend — often when gangs often deploy ransomware, including holidays — increases the likelihood of a repeat attack. &#8220;And if it is ransomware, whether it’s BlackMatter again is impossible to say. It certainly could be, or the affiliate responsible for the attack on the EMEA operations could have chosen to deploy different ransomware this time,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>When reached, Olympus spokesperson Susan Scerbo did not have any immediate comment. We&#8217;ll update as we learn more about Olympus&#8217; security incident.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Password sharing in the workplace and at home is a common practice, but doing so securely can be tricky. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/1-password-8-mac-early-access-120012791.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">1Password</a> aims to address that with its new feature that gives you a way to share log-in credentials in a secure way even with people who don&#8217;t have an account with the service. It&#8217;s called <a href="https://blog.1password.com/psst-item-sharing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">Psst!</a>, which is short for Password Secure Sharing Tool, and it&#8217;s apparently one of the company&#8217;s most requested features.</p>
<p>Based on a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/report-mismanaging-secrets-costs-companies-1-2m-annually-301317447.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">research</a> the company conducted, most workers reuse corporate credentials. Of those people, 36 percent admitted to sharing log-ins with other workers and clients via insecure channels, including emails, chat apps, spreadsheets, documents and texts. In another <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/report-40-of-parents-give-preschoolers-a-head-start-in-password-education-301194976.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">survey</a>, 1Password found that most families share passwords between members and also use insecure methods, such as writing them down and messaging them to each other.</p>
<p>Psst! allows you to share credentials with anybody by generating a link with the information that other people can access, even if they don&#8217;t have a 1Password account. You can choose how long the link remains valid, from an hour to 30 days, after which it will automatically expire. You can also choose to share the credentials with anybody who has the link or with specific people only. If you choose the latter, the service will require the recipient to confirm their identity by verifying their email addresses before giving them access.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216769" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The service has launched this new feature alongside its announcement that it now has over 100,000 business customers and that it&#8217;s growing its employee headcount to 500. Jeff Shiner, CEO of 1Password, said in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Having the ability to share passwords and other credentials outside of a business or family has been one of our most highly-requested features, and I’m very excited by today’s launch of Psst! as it helps keep everyone, not just 1Password customers, safe online. Crossing the 100,000 business customers mark is a clear indication that businesses understand the need to safeguard their passwords and other sensitive information online.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Exchange is digging into the Chinese venture capital market this week, but getting folks to chat about business and China on the record is turning out to be slightly harder than we anticipated. More on that later this week.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</strong></em></p>
<hr />
<p>While our dives into the Chinese and Indian startup markets are underway, let&#8217;s talk about indigestion, namely venture capital indigestion. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">executed its initial look into the Q3 venture capital market</a>, but it&#8217;s still a struggle to get our minds around just how much capital has poured into startups this year.</p>
<p>Global venture capital fundraising is at an all-time high, with many countries seeing record results. Q3 2021 saw more than double the dollars that were invested Q3 2020 across thousands of more deals, <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q3-2021/">per corporate data provider CB Insights</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995210 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-blu.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>All that capital is leading to more and more unicorns around the world. Which, in turn, boosts the scale of unexited private-market value that will eventually need to exit. And with some U.S. tech giants limiting acquisitions as a way of playing defense against antitrust concerns, there is an implicit expectation that the IPO market will eventually have to make room for a stampede of unicorn debuts.</p>
<p>That impending debit grows larger every quarter, and at an increasingly rapid clip; the second derivative is positive, in other words.</p>
<p>The Exchange has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/future-tech-exits-have-a-lot-to-live-up-to/">noted the rising unicorn backlog from time to time</a>, but new data makes it clearer than ever that the venture capital world is investing as if there is a future exit wave coming that will put prior IPO cycles to shame in its intensity and length.</p>
<p>Turning back to CB Insights&#8217; Q3 data set, which we&#8217;ll mine over the next few weeks, observe the following chart detailing the pace at which capital is being disbursed into the global startup market:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishal-punwani-md">Vishal Punwani</a>, the CEO and co-founder of SoWork, is building a business based off of a feeling that he stumbled upon by accident.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sowork.com/">SoWork,</a> a virtual co-working startup, began after Punwani and his co-founders decided to build a machine learning edtech company. While building, Punwani’s team, who ironically met while playing World of Warcraft just 17 years ago, needed a better way to communicate. So, combining their love for building and gaming, the group put together an internal communication product inspired by virtual worlds.</p>
<p>The team’s internal communication tooling began growing faster than their external edtech one. The startup eventually rebranded and pivoted to Sophya, a company based on the feeling that every employer will eventually feel the pressure to invest in a virtual work experience for employees to repair culture and combat climate change.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216738" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The feeling was enough to convince investors to back the early-stage startup. SoWork announced today that it has raised a $15 million seed round led by <a href="https://www.taliscapital.com/">Talis Capital</a>, a U.K.-based firm that routinely cuts early-stage checks. Beyond hiring and R&amp;D capital, SoWork has also added one big customer to its 100-company private beta: Tinder.</p>
<p>By bringing on a virtual space, Tinder is trying to show new and old distributed employees what its work culture is like, from collaboration rooms to company-wide virtual events such as hackathons. Still, while delayed office reopening plans may have triggered Tinder’s interest in a virtual space, the company appears to think the technology will be key going forward.</p>

<p>“It’s been incredibly important to find more permanent ways to extend Tinder’s culture into a hybrid physical and virtual space as we think about the future of how our employees will be working,” said Nicole Senior, VP of Culture and DE&amp;I at Tinder, in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Permanence is the elephant in the room for any virtual HQ. SoWork is joining a string of virtual HQ platforms like <a href="https://www.teamflowhq.com/">Teamflow</a>, <a href="https://with.so/">With</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/sequoia-capital-puts-millions-of-dollars-into-gather-a-virtual-hq-platform/">Gather</a>. One of the biggest challenges for any virtual HQ business is if it&#8217;s realistic to expect employers, especially those in the growth stage, to transfer their growing teams to the metaverse, when in-person offices do the trick. And as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/slacks-new-video-and-voice-tools-are-nod-to-changing-face-of-work/">Slack invests more to bring spontaneity and huddles </a>to its already well-ingrained service, startups need to prove that its customers, even the ones that didn&#8217;t grow up gaming, want to live and work in an online universe.</p>
<p>“If they&#8217;re not feeling the problem, that’s fine. But eventually, there&#8217;ll be so many companies that have built up a base in whether it&#8217;s SoWork or something else, that the benefits of being on those other platforms will start to build up. And then all of a sudden, there are benefits there that [employers] can&#8217;t get elsewhere,” Punwani said. “It’s like Twitter. In the beginning, [no company] was like ‘oh we must have Twitter.’ But as it became the place where all of the random noise happened, then they said, ‘we want to go there because we want to stay relevant.’”</p>

<p>Sophya has a number of functionalities that add to its experience, from proximity-based audio and high-quality video, self-expression of avatars, customizable offices and visualization of who is around you. It is also building ways for employees to venture outside of their offices into the broader SoWork ecosystem to network with folks at other companies and to attend community events &#8212; all within the platform. Punwani estimates that teams spend between 25-40 hours per week working out of their virtual offices, for both asynchronous catch-ups and synchronous meetings.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216744" style="width: 899px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216744" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2216744" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOutside.png" alt="" width="889" height="467" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOutside.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOutside.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOutside.png?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOutside.png?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOutside.png?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOutside.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 889px) 100vw, 889px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216744" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SoWork</p></div></p>
<p>Still, the startup’s biggest differentiation may be the team’s mindset on climate change. Unlike many virtual HQs on the market, SoWork is loud about its mission to combat climate change by giving employers a way to grow their companies virtually, instead of through offices. The startup plans to showcase estimates of how much carbon emissions and commute times have been saved for companies that live in SoWork rather than IRL. It also chose a bank for its Canadian entity that is 100% divested from fossil fuels, and is doing the same for its U.S. corporation, per the co-founder.</p>
<p>“Climate is the number one thing that we’re trying to deal with, it’s why our tagline is moving workplaces from the earth to the cloud,” Punwani said. “Imagine what that does to climate impact, right? [It limits] carbon footprint, commuting, small business travel, [and the] building [of] pointless fucking buildings and parking lots.”</p>
<p>The diversity of the team is also striking in comparison to its competitors. Punwani is joined by two co-founders, Emma Giles and Mark Liu, and five of SoWork’s six main teams in ops, marketing, growth, product and research, are led by women.</p>
<p>SoWork is opening up its private beta to the public in the first week of November. There are already over 1,000 people on the waitlist.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Paris-based cryptocurrency broker <a href="https://www.sheeldmarket.com">SheeldMarket</a> has raised a $10 million Series A funding round led by Atomico. As a EU-registered broker, the company wants to help institutional investors buy and sell crypto assets in a regulated way.</p>
<p>Most cryptocurrency products designed for institutional investors focus on American or Asian investors. SheeldMarket thinks it can convince institutional investors in Europe by complying with local regulation and offering a product that works better for European investors.</p>
<p>In addition to Atomico, Semantic also participated in today’s funding round. Several angel investors also participated, such as Pascal Gauthier (CEO of Ledger) and Alexis Bonillo (co-founder of Zenly).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216741" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If you want to start investing in cryptocurrencies as an institutional investor, you have to deal with several products and services, such as exchanges, custodians and over-the-counter providers. Customers using SheeldMarket can get started more easily.</p>
<p>When you start working with SheeldMarket, you can deposit your funds directly with SheeldMarket. After that, the startup lets you process market orders through multiple crypto exchanges and over-the-counter platforms. SheeldMarket automatically routes your order to the platform that offers the best exchange rate and/or enough liquidity. The average order size on the platform is $150,000.</p>
<p>“We appreciate SheeldMarket&#8217;s advanced platform because it allows us to execute very large trades across multiple global crypto exchanges, in a regulated way, using advanced algorithms. This has been a gamechanger for us when it comes to saving time, manpower and trading costs compared to trying to execute the same volume of trades manually,” Wave Financial’s Benjamin Tsai said in a statement.</p>
<p>In addition to improving its current product offering, SheeldMarket also wants to integrate with decentralized finance protocols (DeFi). This way, it could open up high-yield opportunities to financial investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And this is key to understanding the potential of these prime brokers. Institutional investors aren’t just looking for ways to expose part of their portfolio to crypto price changes. DeFi opens up a ton of possibilities with new, sophisticated financial products. And institutional investors always like to be able to access more markets and more products.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerging markets fintech financier <a href="https://www.lendable.io/">Lendable</a> is targeting to raise a $100 million fund to invest in African and Asian fintech companies, the firm said in an emailed statement today</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, the firm said it planned to raise funds between $120 million to $180 million to give new loans to fintechs so they could</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> then provide credit, asset finance, payments and remittances to individual customers and businesses in emerging markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is unclear if the fund announced today continues that discussion as there&#8217;s no reference in this recent statement. But what is clear is Lendable stating that this is its fourth fund.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216735" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubbed the MSME Fintech Credit Fund, Lendable says it will provide credit to African and Asian fintech companies so they can offer credit facilities and financial services for more than 150,000 small businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the fintech lender has closed $49 million from impact investors such as DFC, EMIIF (DFAT), Calvert Impact Capital, Ceniarth, BIO, FMO and FSD Africa. It expects to close another $20 million this fourth quarter before a final hard close in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first close takes Lendable&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overall</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> committed capital to more than $200 million, although it has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">managed a pipeline of over $400 million since launching in 2016, per the firm&#8217;s statement. The lender has also disbursed $180 million in that timeline</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-goldfarb-17211728"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel Goldfarb</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/dylan-fried-024b825b"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dylan Fried,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lendable has provided more than 1.4 million consumer and small business loans, over 80,000 productive asset loans and more than 105,000 solar home systems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Lendable says it has delivered an annualized net return of 14.32% to its investors.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have had an amazing response to this Fund and have brought on board an impressive slate of leading impact investors and DFIs who back our approach,&#8221; Goldfarb said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Through our fintech investments, we are providing essential working capital for MSMEs that enables off-grid customers to buy energy products and opens the door to innovative digital banking services to consumers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Lendable has provided debt financing to several fintechs from nine emerging markets. Some include Tugende, Carbon, Uploan, KoinWorks, Planet42, FairMoney, Trella, Payjoy, Solar Panda and MFS Africa. The fintech financier said its debt facilities range between $2 million to $15 million, with a payback duration between three to four years. So far, Lendable has a default rate of about 0.01%, said a company&#8217;s spokesperson in an interview with TechCrunch this year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[On the heels of World Mental Health Day, an app called MentalHappy is launching with the goal of making mental health care accessible, affordable and stigma-free. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been on both sides of the spectrum where I can afford the $175 an hour for therapy, and where I couldn&#8217;t afford it,&#8221; said founder and CEO Tamar [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of World Mental Health Day, an app called <a href="https://www.mentalhappy.com/">MentalHappy</a> is launching with the goal of making mental health care accessible, affordable and stigma-free.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been on both sides of the spectrum where I can afford the $175 an hour for therapy, and where I couldn&#8217;t afford it,&#8221; said founder and CEO Tamar Blue. &#8220;We all need help navigating the life events that we go through, but how do we do that with an expert, not pay a fortune for it, be accessible, and do that collectively with other people in a positive way?&#8221;</p>
<p>MentalHappy&#8217;s approach to solving this problem is to develop low-cost peer support groups on its app, with qualified professionals facilitating each group. These groups start at $10 per month, spanning topics like Black mental health, life after divorce and coping with anxiety. Some groups are more intimate, while others can have upwards of 100 members, functioning as a message board with the ability to join video meetings with the group leader. Blue told TechCrunch that she expects the app to have over 1000 support group leaders by the end of the year, facilitating discussions about over 47 different types of life events. So far, MentalHappy is working with psychologists, general practitioners (MD), acupuncturists, and certified life coaches. Currently, the app is operating in the United States, but Blue plans to explore other countries and languages in the future.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216003" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Security is top of mind for everyone,&#8221; Blue said. While some groups can be fully anonymous, others use screen names to identify participants. &#8220;A lot of the groups have privacy control mechanisms, so the user would have to submit some type of authentication to let the group leader know who they are and why they want to join, just to make sure it&#8217;s a great fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>MentalHappy also offers a revenue stream for qualified health and wellness professionals &#8212; the company takes 5% of their monthly earnings on the app. The professionals set their own price for access to their groups. But for larger groups, content moderation might pose a challenge. While MentalHappy has automated systems to identify trigger words or bullying, a group leader is expected to moderate their own group. Blue said sometimes leaders will bring in an assistant or an associate therapist to help them manage the group.</p>
<p>&#8220;MentalHappy is a marketplace,&#8221; Blue said. &#8220;Similar to Airbnb hosts or Patreon creators, support group leaders are marketplace participants operating independently.&#8221;</p>

<p>An app like MentalHappy needs both facilitators and group members to work, and scaling the app at a sustainable rate could pose a challenge &#8212; what if there are too many people seeking help, but not enough professionals to provide it? Right now, MentalHappy is focusing on onboarding group leaders, some of whom have existing client bases that they bring with them to the platform.</p>
<p>The cost of therapy often prohibits people from seeking mental health care, but Blue thinks that a remote, digital experience can also help people who might not physically be able to access specialized care in their area. Plus, the United States is experiencing a shortage in therapists &#8212; according to the American Psychological Association (APA), there are only <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2020/01/datapoint-states">31.3 licensed psychologists</a> per 100,000 people. Many therapists and psychologists have <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/how-to-get-help-when-theres-a-waitlist-to-see-a-therapist-5116341">long waitlists</a>, making it harder for new patients to start treatment. Though one-on-one treatment can be essential for some people, MentalHappy&#8217;s peer support groups can help make care more accessible and immediate in the interim.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we don&#8217;t realize is nearly 180 million people live in rural areas in the United States, where they just simply aren&#8217;t in driving distance to any type of mental health facility or office,&#8221; Blue told TechCrunch. &#8220;So, meeting other people online is a perfect way to get that help.&#8221;</p>
<p>MentalHappy also operates with a strong focus on diversity, working to develop support groups for people of various identities.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a Black woman in tech here in San Francisco, so I definitely know what it feels like to not really be able to identify with professionals, or colleagues, or people who look like you,&#8221; Blue said. &#8220;That&#8217;s something we really focus on. We do have Black and Brown health professionals on the platform that lead groups, because we know that provider fit is definitely very critical.&#8221; In a recent launch event, for example, NFL Hall of Famer Terrell Owens was part of a support group specifically for Black men, seeking to shed light on the particular stigmas that Black men face in seeking mental health care.</p>
<p>But over the last five years, mental health care startups have been scrutinized for how they navigate the murky line between making money and providing quality support to users in need. The anonymous mental health app Talkspace struggled with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/toddessig/2016/08/18/talkspace-reveals-clients-email-violating-clinical-confidentiality/?sh=5e6cb71a4652">violating clinical confidentiality</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/19/14004442/talkspace-therapy-app-reviews-patient-safety-privacy-liability-online">preventing therapists</a> from reporting dangerous situations due to the patients&#8217; anonymity.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will facilitate case by case management of the identities of people in dangerous situations,&#8221; Blue said. &#8220;We carefully vet the support group leaders and review their background. We provide best practices to ensure they are safeguarded as well as members on the platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>So far, the second-time founder has raised <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/briefing-4-29-21/">$1.1 million in seed funding</a> from Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures (Blue&#8217;s first company <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/canustart2day">CanUStart</a>, which was acquired, helped efficiently match job seekers with employers). At first, MentalHappy was a wellness product for large corporations, working with clients like the UCSF Benioff Children&#8217;s Hospital and Boston Scientific. When an employee at these companies experienced a significant life event, MentalHappy provided <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/mentalhappy-helps-companies-send-custom-care-packages-to-employees-going-through-a-rough-time/">wellness kits</a> for support. But Blue wanted to expand MentalHappy&#8217;s reach by creating a consumer product for the general public to access mental health support. Blue was part of the summer 2018 Y Combinator class, where she redeveloped MentalHappy into the app it is today, available on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mentalhappy/id1574363583">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mentalhappy.app">Android</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy now, pay later (BNPL) has been making headlines all over the place this year &#8212; from </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/square-to-buy-buy-now-pay-later-giant-afterpay-in-29b-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Square’s planned acquisition of Afterpay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/wall-street-hugs-affirm-as-it-starts-life-as-a-public-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affirm going public</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Latin America remains an under-penetrated market in the increasingly crowded space.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nelo.mx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup founded by former Uber international growth team leads, began offering buy now, pay later services to Mexico earlier this year. Its ultimate goal is to expand to all of Latin America. And it has just raised $20 million in an effort to help it advance on that goal. The Mexico City-based company already is live with over 100 merchants, including Steve Madden and Ben &amp; Frank. Using Nelo’s app, customers can make purchases from merchants such as Amazon, Mercado Libre, Telcel, Netflix and Spotify.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215725" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to enable digital commerce throughout LatAm, and BNPL in Mexico is our first step towards that vision,” said CEO and co-founder Kyle Miller.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York-based Two Sigma Ventures led the round, with existing backers such as Homebrew, Susa Ventures, Crossbeam and angel investor and popular podcast host <a href="https://twitter.com/APompliano" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anthony Pompliano</a> also participating. New investors include angels like Gokul Rajaram and Emilie Choi, founders and employees from Wealthsimple, Orum, Alloy, Chime, Square and funds/syndicates in addition to Primer Capital, Gaingels and Moving Capital. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the latest Series A financing, Nelo has raised a total of $25.6 million since its 2019 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be clear, Nelo is not the only player in the Mexican market. A number of others, including Alchemy and Addi, have also outlined plans for buy now, pay later offerings in the region. But what differentiates Nelo from its competitors, according to Miller, is that it claims to be the only BNPL company in the region that has a consumer mobile app in addition to an embedded checkout experience for merchants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our mobile app allows customers to buy now and pay later at over 75 merchants, and very soon, any</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">merchant,” Miller said, “ultimately becoming the destination for any consumer that wants to buy online. This captive consumer base is crucial to building the network that is Nelo.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelo issued its first product in Mexico in January 2020, similar to a debit card offering from a neobank. In the middle of the year, the company launched credit installment loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then in March of 2021, Nelo launched its first product via an Android app. Customers can use its offering like a credit card, connecting directly with merchants such as Netflix and Spotify. Many users started out by paying for things like utility bills and cell phone bills, turning them from prepaid to postpay.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why global investors are flocking to back Latin American startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/why-global-investors-are-flocking-to-back-latin-american-startups/embed/#?secret=8JVvOzCnob" data-secret="8JVvOzCnob" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the startup has apps on both Android and iOS and its revenue and GMV is growing by 50% month over month, according to Miller. It is currently seeing over 100,000 new purchases/transactions per month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelo is planning to use its new capital to grow its consumer and merchant base, and to continue to build out its team. The company has hubs in Mexico City, New York City and remote employees. It currently has 23 employees, up from 12 in January. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Nelo is focused 100% on Mexico, where Miller notes, e-commerce is “exploding&#8221; and is home to &#8220;the fastest growing market in the world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This has greatly impacted our business,” he told TechCrunch. “Right now is the perfect time for this business and product.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two Sigma Ventures Partner Frances Schwiep believes that Nelo has the potential to emerge as the leading financing option for consumers in LatAm, starting with BNPL.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her view, the case for BNPL in LatAm, and particularly Mexico, is even stronger than for BNPL in the many regions where it has already exploded in popularity such as the United States, Europe and Australia. She points out that in Mexico, there is an “extreme” lack of access to credit with less than 15% of the population in Mexico having a credit card. Also, there is existing behavior around paying in installments in Mexico that has been around for several decades, called “meses sin interes,” but via “difficult-to-access” cash vouchers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, e-commerce spend in Mexico is increasing much faster than access to credit, Schwiep noted, in addition to open fintech regulation in the country making it all easier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The relatively young population in Mexico is also more aligned with the target demographic for BNPL businesses,” she said. “On top of this, the accelerating adoption of banking and mobile e-commerce in LatAm has created an environment for a breakout company in the space today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a personal level, having lived in Mexico over the past year (and previously having lived in LatAm in 2011), Schwiep told me that it has been “wild” to witness the market for digital commerce essentially transforming overnight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe Nelo has built the team, product, data moat and go to market playbook that is best positioned to capitalize on this incredible market opportunity,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that Nelo started by offering installment payments for everyday essentials, such as utility and phone bills, before evolving into retail, gives the startup some advantages, Schwiep added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First, Nelo owns a direct and deep, recurring relationship with the consumer,” she said. “Nelo is the only BNPL company in the region building the trust and brand loyalty with the consumer in this way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, the multiple touch points per month with consumers translates into a “tremendously valuable longitudinal data asset for Nelo,” according to Schwiep. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are amassing valuable repayment history on their platform that incumbents like Affirm and Afterpay and even local credit bureaus do not have on consumers in the region,” she said.</span></p>

<p>In addition to its work with music artists and labels, Spotify has been working to embrace the podcast creator community with its acquisition of podcast-related companies over the years, including various studios and creation tools, like Anchor. It has also been working to help creators better monetize their efforts with the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-spotify-audience-network-an-audio-ad-marketplace/">new advertising products</a>, paid <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/spotifys-podcasts-subscriptions-service-is-now-open-to-all-u-s-creators/">subscriptions</a>, engagement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/spotify-rolls-out-podcast-polls-and-qas-to-creators-and-users-worldwide/">tools</a>, and <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-27/spotify-ushers-in-new-era-of-podcast-monetization-with-new-tools-for-all-creators/">integrations</a> that would allow creators to connect their existing subscriber base to Spotify&#8217;s platform. It also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">launched</a> a social audio app, Spotify Greenroom, where it will host live content.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Mic Check&#8221; will expand on Spotify&#8217;s creator commitments by offering a selection of conversations with both musicians and podcasters alike. The show will include exclusive recordings and personal stories from this group of global creators, all of which will remain exclusive to Spotify.</p>
<p>The company is also bringing back its flagship show, &#8220;For the Record&#8221; for a third season on October 26. This show will continue to offer Spotify&#8217;s commentary on product and financial news, like its earnings reports, product launches and other business updates.</p>
<p>However, this season, the company will make &#8220;For the Record&#8221; even more of an area for breaking news, saying that it will be the only place where it will share certain business updates.</p>
<p>“From the start, Spotify has always had a unique story to tell and an ambition to tell it our own way,&#8221; said Spotify’s Head of Global Communications, Dustee Jenkins, in a statement. &#8220;The &#8216;Spotify: For the Record&#8217; podcast was launched last year and served as an important step in building our broader audio communications channels. Now we are excited to share that we’re expanding and launching two additional shows that will allow us to speak to each of Spotify’s audiences more directly – about the topics they care most about,&#8221; she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the years, applications have gotten bigger and bigger. Even a small company could be dealing with large libraries of open source code, making it time-consuming to pull the various pieces of a project together, package them up and compile them into a single program. This often creates a bottleneck for developers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engflow.com/">EngFlow</a>, an early stage startup coming out of the <a href="https://www.alchemistaccelerator.com/">Alchemist Accelerator</a> this month, wants to help fix that by distributing the compiling part over as many machines as needed in the cloud, pushing out compiled projects faster. In fact, they claim to take a process that used to take hours and distill it down to minutes or even seconds, depending on the size of the build.</p>
<p>Today the company announced a $3.7 million seed investment led by Andreessen Horowitz with participation from First Minute Capital, Alchemist Accelerator and various angels.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216676" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company founders, CEO Helen Altshuler and CTO Ulf Adams met several years ago while both were working at Google where they were experiencing the build bottleneck directly. They found that as software became increasingly complex, it was taking longer and longer to compile &#8212; and this was in spite of computers becoming ever faster.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re doing is we&#8217;re basically breaking up the build process into smaller steps, and then we&#8217;re distributing those steps across multiple machines so instead of running it on your laptop, we can run it in a data center [in the cloud]. So if it&#8217;s not moving quickly enough for you, you can just add a couple more machines and make it faster,&#8221; Adams explained.</p>
<p>While he was at Google building the company&#8217;s developer infrastructure, Adams also built some software called <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> to deal with the compiling bottleneck that the company would later contribute to open source. Altshuler managed Bazel adoption at Google, so the two of them have been working closely for some time before launching EngFlow at the beginning of 2020.</p>
<p>As EngFlow develops, Altshuler says that they want to help developers who don&#8217;t necessarily want to download Bazel and figure out how to distribute the workloads themselves. But even though they see Bazel as a key build system, they don&#8217;t want to confine themselves to that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We provide the SaaS services, a distributed compute and build acceleration service. Some of our customers even refer to our product as a build accelerator. It works with Bazel, but we are not exclusive to Bazel, which is interesting, [given that we are] the team that built Bazel,&#8221; she said. They also work currently with Android and Chromium and are looking to support other build systems in the future.</p>
<p>In terms of diversity, Altshuler says that she doesn&#8217;t necessarily define her identity as being a woman in tech. &#8220;It&#8217;s an interesting thing because I didn&#8217;t know I was a woman in technology until 10 years into my career when I was invited to speak on a women in technology panel. I thought we were all people here,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>That said, she says that so far her company has grown diverse organically, first by virtue of the diverse background of the two founders, and she believes that it just builds on itself. &#8220;It just sort of happened because of the fact that our network is wide. It also means, yes, more naturally people, not just women, but more women will reach out to me, then perhaps other other managers, [which has allowed us to] be more balanced without being deliberate,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Their startup idea is gaining traction with several paying customers already including Snap, Brave and Mighty Technologies. By taking the approach that they are going to be more than the commercial version of Bazel, they believe they can be a much larger company. The startup expects to remain remote as it grows. As a matter of fact, the two founders have not met in person since launching last year.</p>

The automaker has <a href="https://investor.gm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/general-motors-lg-electronics-reach-agreement-bolt-ev-recall" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">reached a deal</a> that will have LG pay nearly all the costs associated with recalling the Chevy Bolt EV and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevys-2022-bolt-ev-redesign-comes-with-an-entirely-new-model-210004893.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">EUV</a>, with GM estimating that LG will &#8220;offset&#8221; $1.9 billion of the $2 billion in expenses. GM will recognize that financial recovery in its third-quarter earnings.</p>
<p>The brand said it was happy to land an agreement with a &#8220;valued and respected supplier.&#8221; With that said, there&#8217;s little doubt GM is using the deal to redirect blame — it stressed that the recall was prompted by &#8220;manufacturing defects&#8221; in LG batteries. LG spotted anode and cathode-anode separator issues that, combined, could increase the chance of battery fires.</p>
<p>LG has since addressed the battery issues and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-restarts-production-of-bolt-ev-batteries-following-model-wide-recall-194412215.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">restarted production</a>. The immediate costs of the recall may be secondary, however. Both companies have taken a hit to their relatively fragile reputations in the electric vehicle space — it doesn&#8217;t look good for GM in particular when its two main EVs have to be taken off the road, if only briefly.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nearly a year after <a href="https://ridedott.com">Dott</a> originally announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/dott-to-expand-beyond-e-scooters-with-bike-sharing-service/">plans</a> to launch a bike-sharing service, the new offering is going live in Paris. Dott is better known for its scooter-sharing service across dozens of European cities. It is adding electric bikes to complement its service.</p>
<p>In addition to Dott, Lime and Tier also have scooters currently available in Paris. These three companies have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/lime-dott-and-tier-win-paris-scooter-permits-delivering-bird-a-loss-in-a-key-market/">won permits</a> to operate scooter-sharing services with 5,000 scooters each. In addition to Paris, Dott operates in major European cities in Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Poland, Spain and the U.K.</p>
<p>Dott originally planned to launch bike-sharing with its own custom-designed bike in March 2021. That plan is taking longer than expected but the company still expects to manufacture its own bikes in Europe. In the meantime, Dott is partnering with its existing scooter manufacturer <a href="https://okai.co">Okai</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216686" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Bikes are already live in the app in Paris. You can see scooters and bikes nearby, or you can filter the map view to focus on bikes or scooters specifically. Dott expects to provide 3,000 e-bikes in Paris by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Renting a Dott e-bike costs as much as renting a scooter. Prices differ depending on the city. In Paris, for example, it costs €1 to unlock a bike (or a scooter) and €0.23 per minute. There are also multiple passes that let you get unlimited rides for a certain time or waive unlock fees. These passes work with both scooters and e-bikes.</p>
<p>In Paris, Dott’s bike-sharing service competes with Lime, which acquired Jump’s e-bikes as part of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/uber-leads-170-million-lime-investment-offloads-jump-to-lime/">complicated investment deal</a> with Uber. It costs €1 to unlock a Lime e-bike and €0.20 per minute. <a href="https://getapony.com/fr">Pony</a> also offers free-floating bikes for a third of Lime’s rate.</p>
<p>And yet, Dott’s biggest competitor will be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A9lib%27">Vélib’</a>, the dock-based bike-sharing service subsidized by the city of Paris. There are <a href="https://www.paris.fr/pages/velib-franchit-la-barre-des-400-000-abonnes-9062">hundreds of thousands</a> of Vélib’ subscribers in Paris. Even with a free V-Libre account, users pay €3 for an e-bike ride of 45 minutes or less. As a comparison, riding a Dott e-bike for 20 minutes costs €5.60.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But price is just one thing as I already saw someone happily riding a Dott bike. For instance, some users will install Dott to unlock scooters and end up using bikes in addition to scooters. The startup also plans to launch its bike-sharing service in Rome, Milan, Brussels and London. These bikes feature a swappable battery and the fleet will be operated by the same in-house logistics teams.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Between <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-messenger-instagram-whatsapp-are-all-down/">Facebook outages</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/twitch-streamers-respond-after-huge-leak-of-creator-payout-data/">Twitch data breaches</a>, last week was bumpy for social platforms and the creators who build businesses on them. As internet creators look to diversify their income streams and retain ownership over their audiences, membership software maker Memberful is launching a newsletter feature today to add to its subscription membership services.</p>
<p>While competitor Substack takes 10% of creator revenue, Memberful charges 4.9%, plus a monthly rate of either $25 or $100, depending on the pricing plan. For those with a large enough audience, retaining that extra 5.1% of revenue can make a difference, even with the added monthly fee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our focus for the last eight years of building a product has been to be great at membership, and then provide you the ability to plug-in to a Mailchimp, or a Discord, or a WordPress,&#8221; Memberful founder and CEO Drew Strojny told TechCrunch. &#8220;But we noticed, having done this for so long, that communication &#8212; and specifically communication with email &#8212; is so fundamental to the digital membership model that we felt like this is something we have to do. When you&#8217;re building a membership, it&#8217;s almost guaranteed that you&#8217;re going to want to email your members.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216078" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Strojny said that even without its own newsletter feature, Memberful has been attracting former Substack users. Since Memberful offers white-label membership plans, creators can use the service to have more agency over how their branding and their newsletter appear. Like Substack, Memberful allows users to retain ownership over their email lists.</p>
<p>Patreon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/08/patronage-empire/">bought Memberful</a> in 2018, but instead of absorbing the independent brand, Memberful now functions as a subsidiary of Patreon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of it as more of a decentralized Patreon,&#8221; Strojny said. &#8220;When consumers use Memberful, they probably don&#8217;t even know they&#8217;re using Memberful, they just think, &#8216;Oh, I&#8217;m on this site and I&#8217;m signing up for a membership.'&#8221;</p>
<p>When creators offer subscriptions on Patreon, it&#8217;s housed under the company&#8217;s domain &#8212; but Memberful lets creators embed subscription tools on their own websites. (See, for example, the YouTube series <a href="https://www.mythicalsociety.com/#become-a-member">Good Mythical Morning&#8217;s website</a> or podcast network <a href="https://www.relay.fm/membership">Relay FM&#8217;s membership page</a>, which use Memberful). While Patreon charges a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/pricing">percentage</a> of creator earnings (between 5% and 12%, depending on the plan), Memberful charges <a href="https://memberful.com/pricing/">a set rate plus a transaction fee</a> (10% for the $0 starter plan, or $4.9% for the $25 pro plan and $100 premium plan). The premium plan is a white-label offering, removing the Memberful branding altogether.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At launch, the newsletter feature will function like a members-only blog and email list. Users need to log in to view content on the web, but in the future, Strojny says that creators will be able to make public posts that are available to anyone online, subscriber or not. Memberful customers will be able to schedule emails and send messages to targeted subscriber groups, like members on different monthly tiers. This feature will appear on Memberful customers&#8217; dashboard alongside conversion analytics, branding, checkout and content hosting tools.</p>
<p>As a subsidiary of Patreon, Memberful&#8217;s content moderation policies take after its parent. Patreon <a href="https://www.patreon.com/policy/guidelines">bans</a> bullying, harassment, and hate speech, while Substack <a href="https://substack.com/content">also prohibits</a> writers who &#8220;publish content or fund initiatives that call for violence, exclusion, or segregation.&#8221; But Substack has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/11/business/media/substack-newsletter-competition.html">criticized</a> for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/substack-explains-its-hands-off-approach-to-content-moderation/">lax enforcement</a> of its content moderation policies, which it has referred to as &#8220;<a href="https://on.substack.com/p/substacks-view-of-content-moderation">hands-off</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t feel like we have to reinvent the wheel when it comes to content moderation because, being a Patreon company, we have the resources in place to handle that,&#8221; Strojny said. &#8220;It makes us feel really good about having a lot of that already established.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://alviere.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alviere</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an embedded finance startup that aims to help any brand deliver financial products and services to its customers and employees, announced today it has closed $70 million of new funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, New York-based Alviere closed a $20 million Series A led by Viola Ventures and Viola Fintech, with the participation of CommerzVentures, Mitsubishi Capital Corporation, Wix.com Capital, Draper Triangle Ventures, Cross River Bank Capital, CERCA Partners and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, just six months later, the startup is announcing an additional $50 million in Series B investment. Unnamed institutional fintech investors led the latest financing, which included participation from existing backers Viola Ventures, Viola Fintech and CommerzVentures, as well as Cleveland-based North Coast Ventures. Opera Tech Ventures, the VC arm of BNP Paribas, also put money in the round. Alviere has now raised a total of $90 million since its 2017 inception.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216333" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embedded finance is a hot topic these days and it feels like we’re seeing a growing number of rounds in the space. Just last week, TechCrunch reported that Productfy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a banking-as-a-service (BaaS) company that aims to build “DeFi for traditional finance,” </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/08/productfy-raises-16m-to-build-the-shopify-of-embedded-finance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $16 million in a Series A round of funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by CM Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuval Brisker, CEO and co-founder of Alviere, started the company with Pedro Silva a few years after having </span><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/oracle-buys-toa-technologies-pull-170015173.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sold his previous company, TOA Technologies, to Oracle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a deal rumored to have valued it at over $500 million. (TOA was a Cleveland, Ohio, cloud-based enterprise software company.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is loathe, though, to slap the BaaS label on his newest startup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re doing embedded finance, which is as big or bigger than BaaS,” Brisker told TechCrunch.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever you want to call it, the market for embedded finance is massive and expected to grow worldwide to become a $7.2 trillion market by 2030, according to a forecast from</span><a href="https://www.simon-torrance.com/blog/EmbeddedFinance1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Simon Torrance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Last year, the banking-as-a-service market alone was valued at $356 billion, according to</span><a href="https://www.verifiedmarketresearch.com/product/banking-as-a-service-baas-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Verified Market Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The foundations of Alviere were born out of an attempt to build a payment app to exchange money without exchanging personal information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We quickly learned that was not an easy undertaking,” he recalls. “But what we built for ourselves, we realized we could white label and sell to others.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But instead of building a consumer app, the team decided to package the solution &#8212; dubbed The HIVE &#8212; to businesses or brands to be able to launch any financial service on their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how is this different from BaaS?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I look at BaaS offerings, it is usually selling technology to tech mavens who can use it to actually either accelerate the ability to build financial products or embed those products in their software or technology,” Brisker said. “That’s not what we’re doing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, he added, Alviere is going more mainstream and after brands that don’t currently offer any financial technology and don’t know how to do it but might have an existing loyal customer base. By using Alviere, those customers would be able to go to customers, he said, and say, “Hey, we now offer a bank account.” And rather than a partnering bank owning the customers, the actual brand would own the customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brisker doesn’t see Alviere’s offering as a threat to banks. His argument is that by removing the “pain” of having to deal with customers, banks can actually improve profitability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you take away a lot of the customer service components you&#8217;re going to have a much more efficient operation, and they&#8217;ll still be able to have the deposits and the lender loans,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alviere plans to use its new capital in part to expand beyond North America (it is licensed in &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">almost&#8221; all 50 U.S. states) to Europe and Latin America. The goal is to provide financial services to a new cohort of users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortune 500 companies are Alviere’s target, and so far, it has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">closed deals with two unnamed brands that each have more than 10 million household subscribers or customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The startup’s business model relies on its customers&#8217; success, according to Brisker. Basically, it shares the revenue it makes with its customers, which will make money each time on interchange fees each time a branded credit card is swiped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re deeply embedded in their business on multiple levels,” Brisker said. “Embedded finance technology is taking the decentralization of financial services to the next level. Now any brand with an existing customer base &#8212; be it a telco, a retailer, a shoe company, an automobile company, a marketplace &#8212; will be able to deliver financial products and services to its customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims that by using its software, brands can start lucrative lines of businesses that can allow them to deliver “everything personal finance” to their customers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial services that Alviere’s HIVE enables brands to embed in their business include direct deposit FDIC Insured checking and savings accounts; credit, debit, prepaid and gift cards; payment services; domestic and international money transfers; loyalty programs and cash pick up and deposits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omry Ben David, general partner at Viola Ventures, said his firm had been proactively looking to make a play in the embedded finance space for “quite some time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As legacy fintech investors for the past 20 years, we believe consumer financial services are undergoing a tectonic shift and that the next consumer banking revolution will be for established brands to offer bespoke, well-crafted financial services to their existing, and new, loyal audiences,” he wrote via e-mail. “Be it a checking/savings account, branded credit card, loyalty or gift cards, BNPL loans, digital payments services, remittance, etc. – all ‘programmed’ and inter-connected to suit a specific consumer segment, geography and/or need. No more &#8216;one size fits all.&#8217; ”</span></p>
