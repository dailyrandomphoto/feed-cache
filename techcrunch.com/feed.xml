										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://homebase.com.vn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homebase</a>, a Ho Chi Minh City-based proptech startup that helps people buy homes, announced today it has raised $30 million in equity and debt (the ratio was undisclosed). The company’s business model is similar to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/divvy-homes-secures-110m-series-c-to-help-renters-become-homeowners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Divvy Homes</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/zero-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZeroDown</a> in the United States and, in fact, Divvy Homes co-founder and former CEO Brian Ma and Zerodown chief operating officer Troy Steckenrider III are investors in Homebase.</p>
<p>Participants in this round were Y Combinator (Homebase <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/yc-backed-homebase-is-an-alternative-to-traditional-mortgages-for-home-buyers-in-vietnam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took part in the accelerator program earlier this year</a>), Partech Partners, Goodwater Capital, Ace and Company, Emies Advisors and Foundamental. It also included Y Combinator CEO Michael Seibel, and operators and executives from companies like SoFi, Opendoor, Republic, Microsoft, Instacart, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Binance and others.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s existing investors include Ma, Steckenrider, VinaCapital Ventures, and Darius Cheung, the founder and CEO of 99.co, one of the largest property portals in Singapore and Indonesia.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233869" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;YC-backed Homebase is an alternative to traditional mortgages for home buyers in Vietnam&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/yc-backed-homebase-is-an-alternative-to-traditional-mortgages-for-home-buyers-in-vietnam/embed/#?secret=FUAs0dr4ng" data-secret="FUAs0dr4ng" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Homebase works by acting as a co-investor, buying property with clients who put in a 20% deposit. Then clients pay back a fixed amount to Homebase each month, or can decide to buy out the company&#8217;s entire share. They can also chose to walk away from the deal and cash out their savings.</p>
<p>Clients have full usage rights to the home, so they can live in it or rent it. Contracts range from one to 10 years and An says people who buy homes to live in often chose 10 year contracts, while investors usually go for about three years, so they can see how the market appreciates before selling the property.</p>
<p>Homebase will use its new funding to continue developing its proprietary technology, form more partnerships with real estate developers and hiring. The company says it has doubled its headcount over the past year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In terms of its technology, co-founder and COO Phillip An told TechCrunch, “a lot of it is how do we improve the customer experience and make it more customer-centric? Right now in Vietnam, buying property is really painful. It’s like 100 steps, you have to sign in blue ink on paper, at the bottom of every page. We’re thinking of how do you make the experience of buying a home or investing a one-stop shop where you can do everything digitally.”</p>

<p>He added Homebase is also thinking about developing asset valuation tools to help homeowners and passive investors gauge the value of their properties.</p>
<p>An said Homebase’s client base is split 50/50 between people who want a home and investors, including foreign buyers who can’t travel to Vietnam because of the pandemic and rely on Homebase to perform transactions for them.</p>
<p>“The concept of owning your own home is quite important culturally and if you look at the economy, real estate is one of the most popular types of investment,” said An. “People are investing more and more in crypto and stocks, especially during COVID, but I would say real estate still makes a really big portion of what people put their money in. And if you look at the historical track record of real estate in Vietnam, it’s really good.”</p>
<p>Homebase cites research from real estate consultancy <a href="https://www.cbrevietnam.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBRE</a> that showed that increases in average landed property prices grew from 3% to 17% year-over-year, even during Vietnam’s COVID-19 lockdowns during the third quarter. This is good news for people who already own property, but means it is increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to secure mortgages.</p>
<p>Homebase works with agents and developers as a value-add service that helps them close more deals. “For a lot of agents, among the biggest hurdle for them is that clients cannot qualify for a mortgage right away because of the barriers. After COVID, I would say banks became even more strict in terms of criteria. Sometimes they require a 40% to 50% down payment.”</p>
<p>Having Homebase to buy property on behalf of a client makes the process more efficient and as a result, agents sometimes offer buyers a discount if use the startup’s services, An said.</p>

<p>The company will continue focusing on Vietnam over the next few months by expanding into more cities (it currently operates in Ho Chi Minh City, Saigon, Hanoi and Danang). It is also exploring other Southeast Asian countries like Thailand and the Philippines.</p>
<p>“Investors, even customers have reached out to us on social media and asked if we’re available in their country, so I think there is a lot of customer demand for these types of services that help make affording a home more accessible,” An said.</p>
<p>In a statement about his investment in Homebase, Siebel said, “We’ve seen many innovative proptech companies at YC from around the world, and Homebase is among those leading towards a significantly better and more customer-centric solution versus current options, and radically transforms accessibility for aspiring homeowners.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://mimica.ai">Mimica</a>, which (perhaps oddly enough) <em>automates</em> Robotic Process Automation, has raised a $6 million Series A funding from Khosla Ventures. The company will use the funds to establish a sales team in the US and build out its product. Previous Seed investors included the UK’s Entrepreneur First accelerator and the Episode 1 VC.</p>
<p>Mimica’s first product, Mapper, operates in the realm of “process discovery”, which “learns patterns from employee clicks and keystrokes” thus generating process maps normally take business analysts months to produce via manual effort. In other words, it automates the process of automation.</p>
<p>Mimica has RPA teams who build software bots that complete repetitive tasks such as data entry, form completion, and claim and ticket processing – a market estimated to be worth $107 billion by 2027. However, the company argues that RPA giants like UiPath are hard to implement in practice, and its own software would speed this up.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233447" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2233466" style="width: 661px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233466" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mimica-2-.jpg" alt="Mimica team" width="651" height="380" class="size-full wp-image-2233466" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mimica-2-.jpg 651w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mimica-2-.jpg?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mimica-2-.jpg?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mimica-2-.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233466" class="wp-caption-text">Mimica team</p></div></p>
<p>Mimica says its AI removes these bottlenecks by automatically discovering opportunities for automation and generating process maps for bots that can accelerate development.</p>
<p>CEO Tuhin Chakraborty and CTO Raphael Holca-Lamarre co-founded Mimica in 2017. Holca-Lamarre did a PhD in computational neuroscience and machine learning. Chakraborty studied machine learning at Stanford and earned a patent for a supervised learning model he developed at LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Since launching in 2020, Mimica has worked with Dell, AT&amp;T, Hexaware, Experis and Ironbridge.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Chakraborty said: “RPA is the perfect beachhead for our tech because buyers experience so much pain after their purchases. It’s torture, digging for automation opportunities and building process maps by hand, and it’s unnecessary.”</p>
<p>Vinod Khosla, founder of Khosla Ventures, said: “We invested in Mimica because the founding team has a terrific combination of deep technical expertise in building AI systems, and a thorough understanding of the challenges faced by an enterprise when managing processes.”</p>
<p>Mimica competes with FortressIQ and Skan &#8212; both US companies. Other players like UiPath and Celonis are building competing solutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The last 20 months of living in the midst of Covid-19, with all its unexpected developments, have been a challenge for many organizations when it comes to planning for the future. But that has also presented an opportunity for tech: build tools to make planning and forecasting, even in the midst of a pandemic, easier and more effective. To that end, <a href="https://www.gopigment.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pigment</a> &#8212; a Paris startup that has built a platform to help organizations better visualize data and use it to power better business planning and forecasting &#8212; has been seeing a surge of business, and today it is announcing a Series B of $73 million to fuel its growth, both in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
<p>Its mission, CEO and co-founder Eléonore Crespo said in an interview, is not just to make it easier to use big datasets in more strategic ways, but to use its intuitive approach to take on the behemoth of Excel &#8212; estimated at over 1 billion users &#8212; and other generic spreadsheet programs, to become the go-to planning and forecasting platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eighty percent of use cases are still done in Excel,&#8221; Crespo said. &#8220;We have built the most powerful engine in market, providing simplicity in what is a complex process.&#8221; The approach is about replacing the ubiquitous spreadsheet interface with drag and drop elements to manipulate business data so that anyone, including non-technical people, could use it, she added, &#8220;a little like Lego.&#8221; Starting first in finance and revenue, the plan will be to build modeling and forecasting templates that can be used in a variety of business departments, including HR, sales and marketing.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233861" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The round is being led by Greenoaks, with previous backers FirstMark Capital and Blossom Capital also participating. Blossom led Pigment&#8217;s $26 million Series A in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/taking-on-the-business-scenario-planning-giants-pigment-raises-a-25-9m-series-a-led-by-blossom-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 2020</a>.</p>
<p>Pigment is not disclosing its valuation with this round, but for some context, it was valued at $112 million in its Series A, per <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/435866-68/company/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook</a> data.</p>
<p>With customer traction, Pigment&#8217;s sweet spot up to now has been working with fast-scaling businesses with a strong play specifically in the world of tech, where its customers include Algolia, Gong, Melio, Deliveroo, Spendesk, Blablacar, and Cheerz &#8212; precisely the kind of organizations that are both amassing large amounts of data about how the business is running, and in strong need of tools to help make better sense of that data, to use it to have a better idea of what the future might hold.</p>
<p>Indeed, one of the reasons Pigment plays so squarely into that use case is because that was some of the impetus behind why it was founded in the first place. Crespo previously was an investor at Index Ventures (and before that a data analyst at Google) and her co-founder Romain Niccoli was previously the CTO and co-founder of adtech giant Criteo.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At Criteo, she said, Niccoli&#8217;s &#8220;biggest nightmare&#8221; was that technical, sales and other departments were tapping into very powerful tools to handle data modeling and forecasting, but in areas like revenue and finance, &#8220;They were still using Excel for super strategic data.&#8221; That posed a huge problem since Excel was never originally designed to be used in that way, and it hadn&#8217;t evolved to meet that demand and heavy use.</p>
<p>Crespo found the same, she said, both at Index when trying to evaluate information, and at Index&#8217;s portfolio companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;All these companies that were fast-growing, preparing for IPOs, and we&#8217;d see them running strategic cases on spreadsheets,&#8221; she recalled. &#8220;It just didn’t work. Excel would just break. It wasn&#8217;t secure. I thought there should be a better way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pigment does this by first of all providing a wide range of connectors to integrate data from a variety of other platforms, including Snowflake, Netsuite, Looker, Workday, Salesforce, Google Sheets and &#8220;dozens&#8221; of others, Crespo said. It then provides a set of tools so that teams and partners can view, collaborate and provide feedback on data. For those that already use Excel, they can work on data in Pigment using &#8220;Excel syntax&#8221; to show trends in the data. It also provides a range of big data analytics tools behind the scenes so that users can then run multiple &#8220;what-if&#8221; scenarios on the data to compare different financial outcomes when and if conditions change.</p>
<p>There are, of course, a number of different companies, both old and new, that have been tackling the world of business planning with software to make it easier to do this. They include the likes of Anaplan, DataRails, Workday (related to the specific area of HR), Oracle, IBM, Looker, and even newer players in the more general spreadsheet landscape like Airtable. Interestingly, two of Pigment&#8217;s angel investors, Paul Melchiorre and David Clarke, respectively come from two of those competitors, Anaplan and Workday. (Melchiorre had been the CEO of Anaplan, and Clarke is the former CTO of Workday.)</p>
<p>“I’ve been in the enterprise planning business since my time at SAP in the early 1990s. I recently led the largest player in the space, and I can honestly say that Pigment’s platform is the most flexible and comprehensive,&#8221; Melchiorre said in a statement. &#8220;Pigment will be transformative for the start-up ecosystem because it will be at the core of successful and sustainable growth strategies, tailor made for the next generation of leaders. It will allow them to deliver on high expectations set by increasing levels of funding, and plan for uncertain scenarios while being socially and environmentally mindful.”</p>
<p>That endorsement, and the startup&#8217;s growth, are behind this latest round.</p>
<p>“Financial planning &amp; analysis is a critical business function.  But today, most companies rely on software that hasn&#8217;t evolved in years — either outdated spreadsheets that are inflexible and don&#8217;t scale, or expensive and overly-complex FP&amp;A suites that require an industry of consultants to support them. Today&#8217;s businesses demand agile and intelligent tools that will help them make better decisions more quickly,&#8221; said Neil Shah, at Greenoaks Capital, in a statement. &#8220;We believe that the company will rapidly become the market’s clear leader in planning software, building faster and for broader use cases than any competitor, and delighting their customers along the way.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Philippines-based <a href="https://plentina.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plentina</a>, a buy now, pay later startup focused on emerging markets, announced today it has raised $2.2 million. This brings the fintech’s total funding since it was founded in 2019, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/philippines-buy-now-pay-later-startup-plentina-raises-2-2m-seed-round/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a seed round announced in April</a>, to $5.7 million. The latest funding was led by TMV, with participation from Global Founders Capital and returning investors AV Ventures, Techstars and Unpopular Ventures.</p>
<p>The new capital will be used to speed-track Plentina’s growth in the Philippines, expand its product and start exploring launches in other countries, including Vietnam. The company is targeting a Series A raise next year and will hire senior talent before then.</p>
<p>In addition to its BNPL platform, Plentina also plans to focus on other data-driven financial services (its co-founders, Kevin Gabayan and Earl Valencia, are data scientists whose combined work experience include positions at Google and Charles Schwab). The two note that the Philippines has a population of more than 100 million people, but less than 5% of access to credit cards.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233865" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>The company says that in 2021, Plentina’s Android app downloads have increased by 500%, growing from 30,000 users to over 150,000. It plans to launch an iOS app early next year.</p>
<p>When Plentina launched in the Philippines last October, it initially focused on daily needs, signing partnerships with vendors like 7-Eleven and telecom Smart Communications. Since then, it has added more than 20 brands to its platform and more categories. These include necessities like food, groceries and education supplies, but also things like airline tickets, gaming and e-commerce.</p>
<p>Its merchants include e-commerce platforms and offline retailers, like Isetann Supermarket, Lazada, Zalora, Shopee, Agoda, McDonald’s, Philippine Airlines, Razer E-Pins and National Bookstores. The company says it has a waitlist of more than 20 brands waiting to onboard to its platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Plentina also added new loan terms. When TechCrunch last covered the company in April, its required repayment within 14 days. Now Plentina has extended its BNPL offers to three months, since it has options for larger-value items, like airline tickets and e-commerce purchases.</p>
<p>The company will start its international expansion next year. “We are guided by our mission to democratize financial services to emerging markets, so we are planning to expand to Vietnam in 2022,” Valencia told TechCrunch. “We will apply lessons in launching and scaling in our first market of the Philippines.” He added that Plentina has already recruited a leadership team in Vietnam to launch operations.</p>
<p>In a statement, TMV founder and general partner Soraya Darabi said, “Kevin and Earl are precisely the entrepreneurs we look to back as investors. They have the domain discipline to be focused on this audacious opportunity, the tenacity to see it through to success. We are enthusiastically partnering with them to bring robust financial services to the Philippines and beyond.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M9siTmbnUcI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>My favorite show right now is Succession, the fictionalization of the Murdoch family and its media empire. It’s relentlessly funny, as the patriarch and children vie for being the most reprehensible. It’s a big tie; each of the principals vacillates between nervous self-doubt and over the top belief that they are somehow close to omnipotent in the struggle for control of the family business. Characters from last season who seemed somewhat exaggerated are this year normalized in their interactions with the others. My favorite is one of the Culkins, who uses the Culkin look to explain how he interchangeably got the part. It reminds me of Bogart, who history remembers a star because there’s no way of prying his strength as an actor apart from the cumulative roles he played. Of all the gin joints&#8230;.</p>
<p>These were the early catchphrases, before Bill Cosby and his Noah routine with God, and Bob Newhart’s phone conversations with himself. Buy the setup, buy the bit. Kubrick further compressed this in Dr. Strangelove with Peter Sellers&#8217; “precious bodily fluids.” Then George Harrison in Hard Days Night: &#8220;She’s a drag, a well known drag&#8230;&#8221; George Martin had produced live albums with the Goons, and Richard Lester when he and Sellers directed the Goons’ short film. Now it was the two first Beatle films. Hard Days Night was black and white, the feel of the French New Wave with lightweight cameras and location photography seamlessly intertwined with Kubrick’s 2001 Space Opera. Each method informed the other. The onboard computer HAL in 2001 used the same laconic detached attitude (I’m sorry, Dave. I can’t do that) to reject his captive astronaut, that George Harrison did when threatened with losing the part he was ostensibly up for (I don’t care.) Each was a role reversal, as the Beatle took over from the arrogant adman whose office he’d wandered into, and the computer took over from his ostensible human boss. HAL is not sorry, and George really doesn’t care.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233808" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Forgive me if I’m wrong, but the other shoe dropped as Clubhouse released Replay. It doesn’t let you record private sessions, or even sessions visible only to those you’ve followed. Makes sense for promoting the people (called creators) who think their work should be preserved or post-produced as we do to add music and titles. I do care about these things, and suspect there are lots of others who do too. Catchphrases stick because the combination of rhythm and resignation (I don&#8217;t care) produces a calming effect. Many enjoy podcasts, but I prefer the serendipity of conversation to the mountain made out of a molehill. Streaming may replace podcasts as the government deems broadband an inalienable right. What&#8217;s left to determine is the economic model that incentivizes production.</p>
<p>By default, Clubhouse record is enabled if the session is public. Upon completion, each speaker&#8217;s profile adds a link to the room. If you are the host of the room, you can download an MP4 and post produce it, but my favorite is to share a link to a notification stream like Twitter or a newsletter. By clicking on the Listen To button, you can listen to the session and skip forward from speaker to speaker. So, three steps: start a room, share the conversation, and follow the thread as it forks over the social networking landscape. Low friction, ubiquitous tools and broadband, and the economic model of establishing trust in the fruits of collaboration. Not bad for a few good minutes in the gig/creator economy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hi friends! Greg here. You might remember me from such hits as &#8220;Greg takes over Lucas&#8217; newsletter while he&#8217;s on vacation.&#8221; Now we&#8217;re back with &#8220;Greg takes over Lucas&#8217; newsletter while he&#8217;s on vacation, part II&#8221; the straight-to-DVD sequel that no one really acknowledges. The animation is worse and half the cast didn&#8217;t return, but maybe we&#8217;ll introduce a talking dog or something. Who knows!</p>
<p><em>(Editor&#8217;s note: there will be no talking dog.)</em></p>
<p>Before we dive in, a heads up: Brian Heater&#8217;s really-really-really good robotics column, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/actuator/">Actuator</a>, is becoming a newsletter as of December 2. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here!</a> And while you&#8217;re at it, sign up for the Week in Review so you never miss an update.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233733" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Let&#8217;s recap the big news this week.</p>
<h2>The big thing</h2>
<p>This week Unity announced a <em>massive</em> acquisition. Its biggest by far, in fact.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/unity-is-buying-peter-jacksons-weta-digital-for-over-1-6b/">plans to spend $1.6+ billion to acquire the tech side of New Zealand&#8217;s Weta Digital</a>, the legendary VFX studio co-founded by Peter Jackson. Unity will be taking on the engineering teams, digital assets and responsibility of the ridiculously deep catalog of custom tools that Weta Digital has spent the last 20 years building. The visual effects artists, meanwhile, will rebrand into a new thing called Weta FX, who will in turn license the tools back from Unity.</p>
<p>If your first reaction is &#8220;Wait what?&#8221;, you&#8217;re not alone! The news was surprising enough that I was actually blown away that it didn&#8217;t leak.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I&#8217;m told the 275-or-so engineers joining Unity from Weta Digital will stay in New Zealand. Unity has thousands of employees spread out across offices all over the world, so a distributed workforce isn&#8217;t anything too new for them.</p>
<p>So why Weta Digital?</p>
<p>Unity SVP Marc Whitten tells me that, basically, he sees a need to make building in 3D easier over the next few years. The word &#8220;metaverse&#8221; was dropped a few times in our conversation. Weta Digital has spent the last few decades building the things that <em>build the things</em>, so they&#8217;ve probably spent more time on these problems than anyone else.</p>
<p>Whitten is also a big fan of the way Weta&#8217;s tools all work together in harmony through the magic of the cloud:</p>
<p>“What [Weta Digital’s] tools are … is really this pipeline,” says Whitten. “Each individual tool is individually powerful, but in conjunction together across this pipeline they all work really effortlessly. If you make a change in one particular tool, it shows up in the right way when you go to do the lighting, or compositing, in any other particular tool. Groups of people can work really, really easily together.”</p>
<p>“What we’ll do then,” he continues “is make sure that these cloud capabilities plug directly in where artists are and where they’re trying to do their work — inside of Maya, or inside of Houdini, or inside of Unity.”</p>
<p>Plus, eventually opening up these tools will pique the curiosity of just about everyone in TV/film, and I&#8217;m sure Unity wouldn&#8217;t mind snagging the next &#8220;Mandalorian&#8221; or &#8220;Westworld&#8221; that might&#8217;ve otherwise been built with Unreal.</p>
<h2>Other things</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/youtube-is-removing-the-dislike-count-on-all-videos-across-its-platform/">Youtube will hide the dislike count on all videos:</a></strong> The headline says it all, really. The company says it&#8217;s to put an end to &#8220;dislike attacks&#8221; wherein groups of users work together to pile on the dislikes. As you might expect when it comes to changing a feature that has worked a certain way for years, the user reaction is … heated, with many pointing out that two of the top 10 most disliked videos are from YouTube&#8217;s own account.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/discord-nfts-crypto-jason-citron/">Discord clarifies a cryptic crypto tweet:</a></strong> After Discord CEO Jason Citron tweeted out an image of what appeared to hint at a possible crypto wallet integration on the popular chat platform, much of the user base responded with a hearty &#8220;oh hell no&#8221;… in the form of encouraging others to cancel their optional paid subscriptions to the service. Citron later clarified that Discord didn&#8217;t currently have plans to ship the concept, with the company telling TechCrunch the screenshot was from an internal hackathon project.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/robinhood-data-breach/">Robinhood gets breached:</a></strong> An attacker was able to social engineer their way into Robinhood&#8217;s customer support system, managing to make off with millions of customer email addresses and names, plus a few hundred dates of birth. While that&#8217;s not exactly the most sensitive info a company like Robinhood deals with, it&#8217;s not a good thing — as Zack Whittaker points out, &#8220;it’s precisely that kind of information that malicious hackers can use to facilitate further attacks against victims, like targeted phishing emails.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Added things</h2>
<p>While the very vast majority of the content on our site is free, a slice of it lives in a premium section we call <a href="https://techcrunch.com/techcrunchplus/">TechCrunch+</a> — and that slice is all really, really good! Here&#8217;s some of the top stuff this week:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/airbnb-ceo-brian-chesky-discusses-the-future-of-work-and-the-one-thing-hed-do-over/">Airbnb&#8217;s Brian Chesky on the one thing he&#8217;d do over:</a></strong> No one knew what the hell was happening going into this pandemic. But, looking back on the last two years, what might Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky have done differently given the chance? Jordan Crook asks just that in an interview covering everything from Airbnb&#8217;s return-to-office plans to what the company is working on next.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/demand-curve-how-zapier-acquires-customers-via-its-homepage/">How Zapier&#8217;s homepage converts customers:</a></strong> You only get so much time and screen real estate to convince a visitor to become a customer. Why do successful startups do the things they do with their homepage? Demand Curve&#8217;s Joey Noble breaks down some of the things Zapier does right, element by element.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/expensify-david-barrett-ipo-day/">Expensify&#8217;s CEO on why/how the company is going public now:</a></strong> The wonderful Ryan Lawler sat down with Expensify founder/CEO David Barrett to &#8220;discuss why the company decided to go public now, why it chose a traditional listing as opposed to a SPAC or direct listing and how it sees the expense management category shaping up as corporate travel begins to pick up post-COVID.&#8221;</p>

<p>On September 29-30, in a converted steel mill in Pittsburgh now serving as a startup accelerator, three top Biden cabinet members and two top EU officials huddled to launch the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC). The TTC — if it takes root — could be a Euro-Atlantic answer to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrilateral_Security_Dialogue">Quad in the Indo-Pacific</a>: an embryonic tech alliance and a building block for a new democratic tech arrangement.</p>
<p>When looking at the tech-foreign policy nexus in political Washington, all eyes seem to be on the Indo-Pacific — particularly China. But in data, software and hardware, the U.S.-EU relationship remains an equally if not more important tech corridor. For a sense of proportion, Euro-Atlantic data <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2021/698037/EPRS_BRI(2021)698037_EN.pdf">transfers</a> are 55% greater than those between the U.S. and Asia.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232506" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With the TTC, the Euro-Atlantic partnership now has a strategic venue to take advantage of this massive democratic, digital corridor, particularly in light of the global geotech race in which the U.S., China and the EU are the three primary actors.</p>

The 17-page Pittsburgh TTC statement outlines a roadmap for future work and a phalanx of working groups tackling critical issues like technical standards, secure supply chains, data governance, foreign direct investment (FDI) screening, green technology, misuse of technology in human rights abuses and open economies. While the word China does not appear once, the joint statement is riddled with language about “non-market economies,” “civil-military fusion” and use of “social scoring” by &#8220;authoritarian governments,&#8221; all of which are code for China.</p>
<p>Three immediate areas stand out. First, the U.S. and EU are rethinking their approach to technical standards. A saying that has been kicking around in China holds that “third-tier companies make products, second-tier companies make technology, first-tier companies make standards.” In September, the Chinese government released its Standards Strategy focused on greater internationalization of Chinese technical standards, acceleration of standards adoption and more private sector effort in standard development.</p>
<p>The U.S. and EU have both taken note of how standards can be instrumentalized for geopolitical purposes. The U.S. and EU increasingly recognize that their model of letting the private sector set standards has meant losing ground as companies adjacent to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) colonized standard-setting bodies like the International Standards Organization (ISO) and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). In light of China’s aggressive moves internationally, the two sides have revived dialogue between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the U.S. agency in charge of technical standards, and its EU counterparts. Both want to use the TTC to coordinate their standard-setting strategies, including how they work with the private sector.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Second, COVID disruptions and U.S.-China tech tensions demonstrated the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/23/decoupling-tech-supply-chains-would-do-more-harm-than-good/">vulnerability</a> of Euro-Atlantic tech supply chains, particularly in semiconductors given the use of Entity List restrictions and the precarious situation of Taiwan’s chip champion, TSMC. The U.S. <a href="https://www.digitaleurope.org/resources/ten-priorities-for-the-eu-us-trade-and-technology-council-a-partnership-that-can-deliver/">share</a> of global chip manufacturing has shrunk from 37% in 1990 to 12% in 2020. The EU has experienced an even more dramatic decline, from 44% in 1990 to 8% today. Both Washington and Brussels are committed to reversing that trend. Congress recently passed the $52 billion CHIPS Act in the United States and the coming European Chips Act could draw on the €93 billion Horizon Europe fund, the EU’s €750 billion post-COVID recovery fund and coordinated national semiconductor industrial efforts.</p>
<p>But while in the past this might have drawn fears of competing industrial policies, both European Commission Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager and U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo highlighted in Pittsburgh the desire to “avoid a subsidy race” in technology. Indeed, the TTC’s “dedicated track on semiconductors“ in the “mid to long term” provides a runway for a more ambitious joint agenda to work together on high-end semiconductor production. All indications are that they should coordinate and the Pittsburgh statement emphasized that it should be “balanced and of equal interest for both sides.” It is easy to imagine a transatlantic consortium with a “Mega-Fab” project — the largest green field project in Europe — at its heart.</p>
<p>Third, in the wake of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/30/huaweis-terrible-week/">restrictions</a> on Huawei 5G equipment, new revelations about Xiaomi phone censorship in Lithuania and buying sprees of companies like Tencent across Europe, both sides are taking a hard look at how they manage foreign flows of critical technology. Levers like export controls, FDI screening and trustworthy vendors are all on the table. In the past, the EU and U.S. have implemented dual-use export controls along traditional bases: nuclear, chemical and biological but also increasingly on cyber.</p>
<p>But recent developments have created new challenges in governing digital spaces, particularly around investment screening and trustworthy vendors. Regulators are also worrying about how to preserve democratic data spaces and protect research and IP in areas like AI, semiconductors, 5G, gaming, AR/VR technology and perhaps even digital services and smartphones. It will be increasingly important for American agencies like the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) to create channels for intelligence sharing with their European counterparts as EU member states expand screening and market access restriction capabilities.</p>
<p>If it works, the TTC could be the apparatus through which the U.S. and EU write the global rule book governing technology companies. In recent years, the EU has felt compelled to go it alone regulating digital technology, taking the lead in areas like data protection, content moderation and the market power of online platforms.</p>
<p>While some in Washington appreciate Europe’s efforts in the absence of meaningful U.S. regulation (Washington has been perceived as wholly absent from tech foreign policy in the Trump years and captured by Big Tech in the Obama years), this so-called “Brussels Effect” has also created tension, particularly on data flows and the future of digital antitrust.</p>
<p>Free data flows between the Atlantic hang in limbo after a 2020 GDPR-based court ruling invalidated the Privacy Shield, the primary “passport” for European personal data into the United States. On the antitrust side, major players like Meta (Facebook), Amazon, Google and Apple are fighting hard to water down the EU’s signature law against the market dominance of online platforms. The Biden administration itself has not yet settled on a clear position.</p>
<p>More broadly, many Europeans remain skeptical about the U.S. as a partner. The Snowden affair (which revealed widespread NSA hacking of European leaders), Trump’s 2016 election, the Cambridge Analytica scandal and most recently the Facebook Papers have led to not only a geopolitical — but also a digital — estrangement in the Euro-Atlantic relationship. In a recent German Council on Foreign Relations <a href="https://dgap.org/en/research/publications/europes-capacity-act-global-tech-race">Survey</a>, 92.7% of Europeans believe that Europe is overly dependent on U.S. companies for cloud computing, 79.8% on AI and 54.1% on high performance computing. 54% of European stakeholders say they would like to remain independent in a tech confrontation between the U.S. and China, whereas 46% would like to move closer to the U.S.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there is a question of whether Europe’s two key powers, France and Germany, are invested in the TTC. Both France and Germany’s support for the idea of “technological sovereignty” in recent years poses a question of how invested Europe’s biggest powers really are in the TTC’s success.</p>
<p>The transatlantic relationship was built in the industrial era of coal and steel; now, in the digital age of semiconductors and AI, the TTC is a bridge to ensuring the Euro-Atlantic alliance can confront the rise of techno-authoritarianism around the world. Both sides get it. Perhaps that’s what worries them the most.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">In February 2010, The Economist published a report called “<a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2010/02/27/data-data-everywhere">Data, data everywhere</a>.” Little did we know then just how simple the data landscape actually was. That is, comparatively speaking, when you consider the data realities we’re facing as we look to 2022.</p>
<p>In that Economist report, I spoke about society entering an “Industrial Revolution of Data,” which kicked off with the excitement around Big Data and continues into our current era of data-driven AI. Many in the field expected this revolution to bring standardization, with more signal and less noise. Instead, we have <em>more</em> noise, but a more <em>powerful signal. </em>That is to say, we have harder data problems with bigger potential business outcomes.</p>
<p>And, we’ve also seen big advances in artificial intelligence. What does that mean for our data world now? Let’s take a look back at where we were.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232324" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At the time of that Economist article, I was on leave from UC Berkeley to run a lab for Intel Research in collaboration with the campus. We were focused all the way back then on what we now call the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
<p>At that time, we were talking about networks of tiny interconnected sensors being embedded in everything — buildings, nature, the paint in the walls. The vision was that we could measure the physical world and capture its reality as data, and we were exploring theories and building devices and systems toward that vision.</p>
<p>We were looking forward. But at that time, most of the popular excitement about data revolved around the rise of the web and search engines. Everybody was talking about the accessibility of masses of digital information in the form of “documents” — human-generated content intended for human consumption.</p>
<p>What we saw over the horizon was an even bigger wave of machine-generated data. That&#8217;s one aspect of what I meant by the “industrialization of data” &#8212; since data would be stamped out by machines, the volume would go up enormously. And that certainly happened.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The second aspect of the “Industrial Revolution of Data” that I expected was the emergence of standardization. Simply put, if machines are generating things, they&#8217;ll generate things in the same form every time, so we should have a much easier time understanding and combining data from myriad sources.</p>
<p>The precedents for standardization were in the classical Industrial Revolution, where there was an incentive for all parties to standardize on shared resources like transportation and shipping as well as on product specifications. It seemed like that should hold for the new Industrial Revolution of Data as well, and economics and other forces would drive standardization of data.</p>
<p>That did not happen at all.</p>
<p>In fact, the opposite happened. We got an enormous increase in “data exhaust” — byproducts of exponentially growing computation in the form of log files — but only a modest increase in standardized data.</p>
<p>And so, instead of having uniform, machine-oriented data, we got a massive increase in the variety of data and data types and a decrease in data governance.</p>
<p>In addition to data exhaust and machine-generated data, we started to have adversarial uses of data. This occurred because the people involved with data had many different incentives for its use.</p>
<p>Consider social media data and the recent conversations around “fake news.” The early 21st century has been a giant experiment in what makes digital information viral, not only for individuals but for brands or political interests looking to reach the masses.</p>
<p>Today, much of that content is in fact machine-generated, but it&#8217;s machine-generated for human consumption and human behavioral patterns. This is in contrast to the wide-eyed “by people, for people” web of years ago.</p>
<p>In short, today’s data production industry is incredibly high volume, but it is not tuned for standard data representations, not in the sense I expected at the time of those predictions over a decade ago.</p>
<h2>The state of innovation: AI versus human input</h2>
<p>One thing that has clearly advanced substantially in the past decade or so is artificial intelligence. This sheer volume of data we are able to access, process and feed into models has changed AI from science fiction into reality in a few short years.</p>
<p>But AI is not as helpful in the business data processing domain as we might expect &#8212; at least not yet. There is still a surprising disconnect between AI technology like natural language processing and structured data. Even though we&#8217;ve had some progress, for the most part, you can’t talk to your data and expect much back. There are some situations where you can Google for a quantitative question and get back a little table or chart, but that’s only if you ask just the right questions.</p>
<p>For the most part, AI advances are still pretty divorced from stuff like spreadsheets and log files and all these other more quantitative, structured data — including IoT data. It turns out the traditional kinds of data, the kinds of data we&#8217;ve always put in databases, has been much harder to crack with AI than consumer applications like image search or simple natural language question answering.</p>
<p>Case in point: I encourage you to try asking Alexa or Siri to clean your data! It’s funny, but not very helpful.</p>
<p>Popular applications of AI haven&#8217;t projected back yet to the traditional data industry, but it&#8217;s not for lack of trying. Lots of smart people at both universities and companies haven&#8217;t been able to crack the nut of traditional record-oriented data integration problems.</p>
<p>Yet, full automation evades the industry. Part of that is because it&#8217;s hard for humans to specify what they want out of data upfront. If you could actually say, “Here&#8217;s precisely what I’d like you to do with these 700 tables,” and follow up with clear goals, maybe an algorithm could do the task for you. But that&#8217;s not actually what happens. Instead, people see 700 tables, wonder what’s in there and start poking around. Only after a <em>lot</em> of poking do they have any clue what they might want to happen to those tables.</p>
<p>The poking around remains creative work because the space of ways to use the data is just so big and the metrics of what success looks like are so varied. You can&#8217;t just give the data to optimization algorithms to find the best choice of outcome.</p>
<p>Rather than waiting for full automation from AI, humans should get as much help as they can from AI, but actually retain some agency and identify what is or isn’t useful, then steer the next steps in a certain direction. That requires visualization and a bunch of feedback from the AI.</p>
<h2>Understanding the impact of data and controlling data spread</h2>
<p>One place AI has really shined, though, is in content recommendation. It turns out that computers are frighteningly effective at targeting and disseminating content. And oh boy, did we underestimate the incentives and impacts around that aspect of data and AI.</p>
<p>Back then, the ethical concerns we had around data and its uses in AI were mostly around privacy. I remember big debates about whether the public library should have digital records of the books you reserve. Similarly, there were controversies over grocery loyalty card programs. Shoppers didn’t want grocery chains to keep track of what food they bought when and target them for accompanying items.</p>
<p>That mentality has largely changed. Today, teenagers share more radically more personal information on social media than the brand of food they purchase.</p>
<p>While I wouldn’t say that digital privacy is in a good state, it is arguably not the worst of our data problems today. There are issues such as state-funded actors trying to introduce mayhem into our social discourse — using data. Twenty years ago, very few people saw this stuff coming our way. I don’t think there was a great sense of the ethical questions of what could go wrong.</p>
<p>This leads to what’s next, and even currently in process, in the evolution of our uses of data. What becomes the role of governments and of well-meaning legislation? Without predicting all the ways tools will be used, it&#8217;s hard to know how to govern and restrict them intelligently. Today, we are in a state where it seems like we need to figure out the controls or incentives around data and the way it is promulgated, but the tech is shifting faster than society is able to figure out risks and protections. It’s unsettling, to say the least.</p>
<p>So, were the predictions spot-on?</p>
<p>As a professor, I’d award it a passing grade, but not an A. There is substantially more data available to us with more uses than we probably ever could have imagined. That’s led to incredible advances in AI and machine learning along with analytics, but on many tasks, we’re still just scratching the surface, while on others we’re reaping the whirlwind. I am fascinated to see what the next 10 to 20 years will bring and look back on these issues again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s no surprise that Katie Haun is a major proponent of NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. The former federal prosecutor who today co-leads the powerful crypto practice of Andreessen Horowitz, has been a student of the technology since at least 2018, when a16z first backed Dapper Labs, which is now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/nba-top-shot-creator-dapper-labs-raises-another-250-million/">quite valuable</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, Vancouver-based Dapper Labs was known for a collectible digital cat game called <a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/">CryptoKitties</a> that baffled those outside the crypto community. This year, Dapper broke out thanks to another offering on its blockchain called <a href="https://nbatopshot.com/">NBA Top Shot</a> that allows sports fans to buy and sell collectible highlight clips &#8212; yet even that is a use case that will seem minor in the grand scheme of things, Haun suggested Thursday night at a San Francisco <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/145636603@N06/albums/72157720136032014">event</a> hosted by this editor.</p>
<p>During our wide-ranging sit-down, she explained why she thinks NFTs&#8217; somewhat concentrated user base is about to explode, and she shot down the idea that a relatively small number of creators who turn to NFTs for income will benefit from them. She also explained an innovation that a16z introduced that allows the heavyweight firm to nab a 20% discount on the tokens that now make up 75% of its crypto bets, and she discussed with us whether all venture firms will or should become registered investment advisors as a16z did in 2019. Excerpts from that conversation follow, edited for length. You can also check out the full interview below.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233794" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><strong>On what a16z tells its investors about its various bets on NFTs, and what the unifying thread is:</strong></p>
<p>I think fundamentally NFTs are going to dramatically change the business model for the internet for consumers and content creators . .  Why is it important for consumers? [For example] right now, if you buy a &#8220;Fortnite&#8221; skin, what if the game goes under?  . . . [Now consider that] you&#8217;re a gamer and you can take your good to another platform; you can use it anywhere. That&#8217;s really powerful for consumers. It&#8217;s putting power directly back in [their] hands . . .</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also great for content creators because they can program these tokens, these digitally scarce goods, to get financial upside in all future transactions [and cut out middlemen who take 30% today in the process]. Imagine what that does for the creator economy. [People are focused today on digital art but] I think next year at this time, we&#8217;ll be talking about music and what barriers can come down in the music world.</p>
<p><strong>Haun went on to say that she&#8217;s actually quite focused on music-related NFTs right now and used singer-songwriter Billie Eilish to highlight what could be possible (and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/m-i-a-new-song-babylon-nft-auction-1257244/">is already happening</a>, in some cases) with musicians and NFTs:</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>[Eilish] was kind of discovered on the internet by a group of fans. Yet did those early adopters, her really true fans who made her famous, did they share in her stardom? Not a bit. In fact, not only did they not share in her stardom, their experience was worse as she blew up. Ticket prices went up. The lines got longer at stadiums, and concert venues are sold out for her. Now imagine if the people who discovered her and made her what she was in the early days . . .what if through an NFT or a smart contract they could have held something that related to Billie Eilish&#8217;s success? [It could] be that she records a song to Spotify but then creates a companion smart contract NFT that entitles fans to special access to shows forever, or to tour with her, or perhaps entitles them to future portions of her royalty streams. Now all of a sudden, these fans share in the economic upside, instead of just record labels and lawyers and middlemen.</p>
<p><strong>On whether the economics will ultimately look much the same for creators as today, with a small number reaping most of the financial rewards as has happened, for example, with Twitch, where a data leak showed that 1% of streamers see <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitch-streamer-earnings-increase-for-top-gamers-data-from-hack-shows-11633802185">half of all revenue</a>:</strong></p>

<p><em>Katie Haun, speaking at a StrictlyVC event on November 11, 2021.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s still very early days for these business models. . . .[But] one thing about crypto architecture distributed systems is that you can make a living, and we&#8217;ve seen this with NFT&#8217;s already. You don&#8217;t have to be Beeple and get really rich to make a living.  I own a couple of NFTs [including by a] female artist who quit her job and who programs digital art that I bought on OpenSea. She has programmed a smart contract that if I sell [these NFTs] to you, she would get a portion of that sale, and if you then turned around and sold them to an audience member and maybe they appreciated it in price, she would get royalties off that sale, whereas right now she gets nothing if it&#8217;s physical art.</p>
<p><strong>We talked about the widespread perception that NFTs are taking off fueled by a small subset of moneyed buyers with cash to burn, even as most Americans struggle to pay their bills. On this front Haun said that she understands why people might view NFTs as an indulgence for the rich but noted that it&#8217;s early days for the technology. </strong></p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s really important with NFTs not to judge the current state of innovation by the end state of innovation. I completely understand what you&#8217;re saying. I&#8217;ve seen it myself. Yet I also see [parallels], in terms of status symbols, in the physical world, where many Americans are struggling, [while] others can afford luxury vehicles and Rolexes, so I think the digital world is no different. And like there are luxury physical goods, there are also basic goods that people want to own in the real world that aren&#8217;t ostentatious, [and] I think you&#8217;ll start to see more of those [more basic goods] developed digitally.</p>
<p><strong>At some point, we switched gears to discuss a16z&#8217;s deal flow. Here, Haun suggested that two of her board seats, with Coinbase and OpenSea, enable her to see a lot of what, and who, is on the rise in the crypto world.</strong></p>
<p>I think we&#8217;re very privileged to sit right at the center; we have a front row seat in the ecosystem and that&#8217;s because both Chris Dixon and myself have been on the board of Coinbase for many years now . . and they have Coinbase Ventures . . . and there are few crypto projects out there that don&#8217;t pitch Coinbase Ventures. OpenSea is another board that I&#8217;m on right now and they&#8217;ve done these record volumes and they&#8217;re the largest NFT marketplace in the world and they&#8217;re also doing venture investing, so right there, just through our connections to these kind of giants in the space, we have deal flow because they&#8217;re seeing deals [and] we&#8217;re seeing deals.</p>
<p>Of course, crypto is very global [and at this point] we are truly global. I would say at least 50% of our investments in this last crypto fund have been international, so we have to not sit back and rest on our laurels of &#8216;Oh, we&#8217;re on the board of Coinbase and OpenSea.&#8217; We have to be really open-minded about different projects in different countries . . .[where many founders have] never heard of Andreessen Horowitz. I think we take that for granted just being here, but [elsewhere in the world] they&#8217;ve never heard of [us]. They don&#8217;t know our value.</p>
<p>It requires us to go get on a plane [in some cases]. [We&#8217;ve also] pioneered a delegate program where we delegate our proof-of-stake systems to participants worldwide, whether that&#8217;s NGOs like Kiva and Mercy Corps, [or] companies like Deutsche Telekom, or whether it&#8217;s universities like Stanford and Berkeley and many other universities around the world [including] Technion University in Israel . . .we&#8217;re not resting on our laurels [in the expectation that] because we&#8217;ve had great deal flow, it will continue. The marketplace for crypto investors is widening for sure.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O9hcWgL3k7k?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>We also talked about why the firm is investing so much in tokens, including directly over the counter. We wondered if a16z gets any kind of preferred status in those deals. We also wondered what has driven the firm&#8217;s shift away from more traditional equity deals like Coinbase and OpenSea, and whether it was crypto founders themselves who began pushing back against these arrangements. Said Haun (who, by the way, noted that equity deals have not gone away entirely but that they&#8217;ve escalated in price as more VCs have begun to compete for them):</strong></p>
<p>If you know an over-the-counter desk that will give me preferred rates, let me know because I haven&#8217;t found one. [No,] with over the counter, we&#8217;re just buying it spot; we get no special treatment. If anything . . . we&#8217;re very conscious of not moving the market where it&#8217;s a true over-the-counter [investment] and the founder of a protocol might not even know we&#8217;re an investor.</p>
<p>In other cases, sometimes protocols will want a particular venture capital investor, although that is changing rapidly and we need to be nimble and account for that. But what we&#8217;ve done in some of those cases, where a protocol founder really wanted us to be involved is, early on, call it three years ago in the token environment, they would give us a discount. But that became very unpopular in the crypto ecosystem. [People wondered] why should VC investors get a discount over the community?</p>
<p>One of the things we did [to address that concern] is [say], &#8216;Give us a lock up then. We&#8217;re 7- to 10-year patient investors; we&#8217;re not running a crypto hedge fund. So if we want to lower price &#8212; call it a 20% discount  &#8212; in exchange, we can be locked up for four years or, in some cases for years, even longer and sometimes shorter. That&#8217;s one innovation that we brought to different token deals. So we <em>have</em> received discounts sometimes, but the thing is that we&#8217;ve also done a lot of work for some of those protocols where we received a discount in exchange for lockup. . .</p>
<p><strong>Though Haun has been asked this before, we also inquired about her seats on the both the boards of OpenSea and Coinbase, two companies that appear to be a collision course, given that OpenSea is an NFT marketplace and Coinbase, the cryptocurrency exchange, more recently announced plans to also create a kind of NFT marketplace. </strong><strong>In fact, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said during an earnings call last week that he thinks the market for NFTs could <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-10/-big-or-bigger-than-crypto-trading-coinbase-bets-large-on-nfts?sref=gni836kR">rival or even be larger</a> than Coinbase&#8217;s cryptocurrency business.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>We wondered how she navigated this tricky terrain, and even whether Coinbase might acquire OpenSea. She dismissed the last question with a head shake. As for the two colliding, she had this to say:</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2233797 size-large alignleft" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676155345_85e4140986_k.jpg?w=453" alt="" width="453" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676155345_85e4140986_k.jpg 1365w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676155345_85e4140986_k.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676155345_85e4140986_k.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676155345_85e4140986_k.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676155345_85e4140986_k.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676155345_85e4140986_k.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676155345_85e4140986_k.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s a pessimistic view. I actually don&#8217;t agree that they&#8217;re on a collision course. First of all, I&#8217;ll say that what Coinbase&#8217;s plans are they haven&#8217;t even announced yet. They only announced that they&#8217;re exploring doing something in the NFT space, but we don&#8217;t even know what yet it will be.</p>
<p>One thing that I remember Brian Armstrong said years ago, when we started seeing competitors come into the exchange space . . . he said &#8216;This is actually great.&#8217; And I thought to myself, What am I missing? And he said, &#8216;This just means the pie is growing. This just validates our whole thesis. This is a huge opportunity, and others see it.&#8217;</p>
<p>[Similarly] the NFT space is so massive that I think there&#8217;s absolutely room for many players and I feel very fortunate to be on the boards of two really-cutting edge companies that will play in this space. I don&#8217;t agree that they&#8217;re on a collision course. Certainly, if it played out that way, if the ecosystem evolves that way, that will be something I&#8217;d have to address, as a former federal prosecutor.</p>
<p><strong>As for whether more venture firms may need to become registered investment advisors if they want to be taken seriously by crypto founders, Haun declined to say so outright but she suggested it would make sense.</strong></p>
<p>Look, every single crypto dedicated fund is is registered as an RIA. There are now many of them out there, and they&#8217;ve all registered as RIAs. It seems like a prudent thing to do where the regulatory status is so uncertain if you want to hold tokens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hiring is harder than ever for basically every startup. The rush of investment into tech companies in recent years has created more demand for skilled workers than humans can currently meet.</p>
<p>But you can still get the talent you need if you get the details right. Especially if you know how to take advantage of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/distributed-work-not-remote-work/">new trends in distributed work</a>.</p>
<p>From a compelling vision, to global compensation plans, to custom “offer decks” for key candidates, top tech recruiters shared what they’re doing to help companies land the people they need at TechCrunch Disrupt this year. Here’s a closer look at what I heard from the panelists, who included: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaimebott/">Jaime Bott</a>, talent partner at <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/people/jaime-bott/">Sequoia</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tawnicranz/">Tawni Nazario-Cranz</a>, operating partner at <a href="https://signalfire.com/profiles/tawni-cranz/">Signalfire</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/doristong/">Doris Tong</a>, founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/eq-talent-strategy/about/">EQ Talent Group</a>.</p>
<p>They also talked about how they work with startups from early to later-stage funding and provided fresh stats on what they’re seeing in their portfolios. Which is where we’ll begin.</p>
<h2>The state of distributed recruiting</h2>
<p>Only part of the startup world is taking the plunge into fully distributed work, from what the panelists are seeing.</p>
<p>But all startups are having to think about hiring by Zoom instead of the traditional in-person interview marathons that defined recruiting in previous years. And most companies are going to be offering distributed-work options long term.</p>
<p>In a recent survey of Sequoia portfolio startups, “roughly 60% are going to be a hybrid model” of in-office and distributed, said <strong>Jaime Bott</strong>, “roughly 20% will be fully remote and roughly 20% are planning on having everyone back to the office five days a week.”</p>
<p>This last group is “having a harder time recruiting, because people are really looking for more flexibility now,” she noted.</p>

<p>Quantum information science has long languished in an academic corner of the tech sector. But recent advances mean that the sector has taken on geopolitical significance. With several nations rushing to develop their own quantum systems, the quantum competition has started to resemble a new “<a href="https://uknqt.ukri.org/files/qipl2020prospects/">space race</a>.”</p>
<p>With the U.S. and China leading the way, European countries are feeling the pressure to step up their game, and several countries, as well as the European Union itself, have made a big push to invest in this space. But are European efforts too late and too fragmented to compete with the two tech giants?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232358" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>U.S.-China: A race to the quantum advantage and beyond</h2>
<p>Quantum computing seeks to exploit the counter-intuitive properties of quantum physics (that is to say, physics at the atomic or subatomic scale), such as entanglement and superposition. To do so, a quantum computer manipulates the states of particles (ions, electrons, photons) using lasers or electric and magnetic fields.<br />

<p>The United States and China have the most advanced quantum capabilities, with both claiming to have reached “quantum supremacy,” i.e., the ability to solve mathematical problems that would take a classical computer millions of years.</p>
<p>China’s efforts have been ongoing since around 2015, when the Edward Snowden revelations prompted anxiety over the extent of U.S. intelligence activities. Anxious about American capabilities, Beijing intensified its focus on quantum communications. Estimates of China’s spending on quantum research <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/china-is-pulling-ahead-in-global-quantum-race-new-studies-suggest/">vary</a>, but the country is the leading holder of patents in quantum communication and cryptography hardware and software. Chinese efforts in quantum computers are more recent, but Beijing has been moving fast. In December 2020 and again in June 2021, researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) made credible claims to have achieved “quantum supremacy.”</p>
<p>Washington woke up to the possibility of China’s lead in quantum technologies when Beijing demonstrated its capacity in satellite-based quantum communications in 2016. In response, then-President Donald Trump launched a $1.2 billion National Quantum Initiative in 2018. Meanwhile — and perhaps most importantly — big technology firms started pouring huge sums into their own quantum research. IBM, which introduced the first two-qubit computer in the 1990s, is now exporting its Quantum System One machine. Though newer to the field, Google claimed to have achieved quantum supremacy in 2019 with a 53-qubit quantum processor based on superconductors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Technologies with geopolitical implications</h2>
<p>Driving China, the U.S. and other countries is a fear that lagging behind in quantum computing will pose cybersecurity, technological and economic risks.</p>
<p>First, a fully functioning quantum computer could allow an adversary to break any public encryption key currently in use. While it would take a classical computer 300 trillion years to crack a 2,048-bit RSA encryption key (used to secure online payments), a quantum computer with 4,000 stable qubits <a href="https://www.hudson.org/research/16993-q-day-is-coming-sooner-than-we-think">could in theory</a> do the same in just 10 seconds. Such technology could be less than a decade away.</p>
<p>Second, European governments fear the consequences of becoming caught between American and Chinese quantum competition. Chief among those is quantum tech becoming subject to export restrictions. These should be coordinated among allied countries. Europeans remember how the U.S. embargoed the export of state-of-the-art computer equipment to France during the Cold War for fear that the technology could fall into Soviet hands. This motivated France to develop and support a national supercomputer industry.</p>
<p>Today, America’s European partners are <a href="https://ecfr.eu/publication/defending_europe_economic_sovereignty_new_ways_to_resist_economic_coercion/">concerned</a> that in a tech cold war, they may struggle to access critical technologies or trade technologies with third countries. In addition to expanding its list of controlled items, the U.S. is adding more and more Chinese organizations to the “Entity List” (e.g., Chinese supercomputing centers in April 2021), thereby blocking technology exports — including from non-U.S. companies — to those entities. And as the list of restricted technologies grows, European companies feel the financial consequences in their international value chains. In the near future, some enabling technologies needed to make quantum computers work — such as cryostats — <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tech-china-exclusive-idUSKBN1YL1B8">could be placed under control too</a>.</p>
<p>But there are concerns about China as well. China has posed <a href="https://sciencebusiness.net/technology-strategy-board/news/eu-rewrites-rulebook-science-and-technology-cooperation-rest-world">other types of risks</a> to countries’ technological development, including challenging intellectual property rights and academic freedom, and it is well versed in economic coercion.</p>
<p>A final risk is economic. A disruptive technology like quantum computing will have massive industrial implications. While demonstrating “quantum supremacy” may constitute a scientific show of force, most governments, research labs and startups are in fact seeking to harness the “quantum <em>advantage</em>” — i.e., an acceleration of computing power sufficient to provide an advantage compared to classical machines for practical applications.</p>
<p>Considering its many use cases in complex simulation, optimization and deep learning, quantum computing will likely become a thriving business in the decades to come. Some quantum startups are already starting to go public in what is becoming a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/08/quantum_computing_startups/">quantum investment frenzy</a>. Europeans fear losing out on what stands to be a significant part of the 21st century economy.</p>
<h2>Is Europe up to the task?</h2>
<p>Unlike in most other digital technologies, Europe is well positioned in the global quantum race.</p>
<p>The U.K., Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland all have significant quantum research capacities and flourishing startup ecosystems. Their governments, as well as the European Union, are making significant investments in quantum computing hardware and software and in quantum cryptography. In fact, the U.K. launched its National Quantum Technologies Program in 2013, well before the U.S. and China. As of 2021, Germany and France are just behind the U.S. in terms of public investment in quantum research and development, with approximately €2 billion and €1.8 billion, respectively.  Amazon is even <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fr/blogs/quantum-computing/designing-a-fault-tolerant-quantum-computer-with-cat-qubits/">developing a quantum computer</a> based on a self-correcting quantum bit (qubit) technology discovered by the French hardware startup Alice &amp; Bob.</p>
<p>So, what stands in Europe’s way to become a serious challenger to the U.S. and China?</p>
<p>For one, <a href="https://www.ifri.org/en/publications/etudes-de-lifri/strategic-calculation-high-performance-computing-and-quantum-computing">the challenge for Europe</a> is less fostering the emergence of startups but keeping them. Most promising European startups have a tendency not to grow on the continent due to inadequate venture capital. Europe’s AI successes are a cautionary tale; many recall how Google (Alphabet) acquired DeepMind, one of the most promising British startups. The story is repeating itself with PsiQuantum, a leading British startup, which settled in California <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/afc27836-9383-11e9-aea1-2b1d33ac3271">in search of capital</a>.</p>
<p>To counter that risk, European governments and the European Union have launched several initiatives in emerging and disruptive technologies with the goal of building European “technological sovereignty.” But then, does Europe even adopt its own technologies? EU procurement rules do not necessarily favor European suppliers in contrast to the U.S. “Buy American Act.” Today, EU member states are reluctant to favor European technology providers when more advanced or cheaper foreign options exist, as Germany recently <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/ibm-unveils-first-quantum-computer-in-germany/a-57909494">did</a> with its acquisition of an IBM machine. This may change with the International Procurement Instrument, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-response-joe-biden-buy-american-us/">a new piece of legislation currently being negotiated in Brussels</a>, which would introduce a principle of reciprocity in the openness of public procurement markets.</p>
<p>Alongside the government, private companies will play a key role in shaping the future quantum industry through their choices of investments, partnerships and adoption of technologies. The choice to opt for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1985/02/17/ibm-wins-dominance-in-european-computer-market/bdcb9e21-8107-4dad-88d7-713f2709a8d8/">IBM systems</a> in the 1960s and 1970s has had a lasting effect in structuring the global computing market. Similar choices in quantum computing have the potential to shape the field for decades to come.</p>
<p>The dissatisfaction in Europe today about the scarcity of world-leading European tech firms only underscores the significance that early choices in the support for and adoption of technologies can have. If Europe is to be competitive in quantum with the U.S. and China in the years to come, it must not just maintain its current momentum but increase it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>subscribe here.</em></a></p>
<p>I have a theory. The debate around accreditation in education often focuses on two extremes: the people who don’t believe in the necessity of a four-year degree and the people who think accreditation, and an Ivy-laden stamp of approval, is the only way to succeed. But, nearly two years into covering edtech, I’ve realized that grouping these cohorts into two very separate buckets may be an oversimplification. In fact, as I spoke <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/12/tigers-den-of-due-diligence/">about on Equity this week</a>, there is more of an overlap than you’d imagine when it comes to how entrepreneurs are viewing the future of education.</p>
<p>Let me explain. When it comes to fundraising or types of capital, optionality has been the term du jour in the current tech environment. And the same goes when we’re talking about the types of education pathways that a student should have access to.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233706" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For example, Woolf founder Joshua Broggi thinks that many tech bootcamps, or newer colleges, will eventually need to provide an accredited option in order to continue attracting customers. He raised millions to prove how important accreditation as a service will be to future educators. Meanwhile, Strive School, led by Tobia De Angelis, was launched in response to the outdated STEM course material taught in European industries. Even though a majority of universities in Europe are low cost or free to attend, he argued that accessibility doesn’t equate to effectiveness. He raised millions of dollars <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/strive-school-wants-to-increase-the-number-of-job-ready-software-engineers-in-europe/">to prove why an alternative is needed</a>.</p>
<p>The similarity between these two entrepreneurs is that they think students need a high-quality education that is actually effective; they just differ in the strategies on how to get there. Ethos-wise, both camps agree that it’s important to offer students a variety of resources, because traditional, one-size-fits-all learning isn’t effective.</p>
<p>For my full take on this topic, check out my TechCrunch+ column: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/13/woolf-accrediting-as-a-service-and-the-future-of-alternative-degrees/">Accrediting as a service and the future of alternative degrees.</a> We’ll go down a whole slew of rabbit holes, including income-share agreements, the nuances of accessibility and why collaboration may be the boring answer to innovation.</p>

<p>Off the heels of a $150 million Series B fundraise, New York-based investing platform Republic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/republic-acquires-crowdfunding-media-agency-arora-project-in-multi-million-dollar-deal/">has acquired Arora Project</a>, an equity crowdfunding media agency that helps startups create and launch campaigns (or in other words, serves as a management consultant).</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>Republic has always been a more curated platform due to its focus, but Arora Project and future acquisitions could help it find better ways to answer some of these questions — either by introducing a new cohort of investors to its platform or by helping more startups launch campaigns that balance transparency with ambition. Still, given last week’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/06/all-things-in-moderation-including-moderation/">deep dive into the future of moderation</a>, it’s noteworthy that Arora boasts a rigorous vetting process about the upstarts it works with and accepts less than 10% of applications that it receives every month.</p>

<p>Evergrow! Fresh out of stealth and a $7 million seed raise, the climate fintech startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/evergrow-climate-fintech-7m-seed-round-from-xyz-capital-congruent-capital-firstround/">announced its plans</a> to be the “world’s first dedicated carbon offtake company” reports <a href="https://twitter.com/NeeshaTambe">Neesha Tambe</a>. The business is going to fund climate developer projects, and then create long-term offtake agreements for those same budding business plans.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> The startup’s differentiator is its sheer willingness to operate in such a thorny environment. Climate projects often have to show offtake contracts, a guarantee purchase of carbon credits created by the project, to banks before they underwrite any financing. It’s not exactly how venture capital speed works, forcing companies to learn how to balance their cap table with insurance, debt investors and other developers.</p>

<p>Since Coinbase is perhaps the largest, and most known, player in the crypto space, its Q3 financial results came with a certain weight. So, we did an emergency Equity shot on Friday to talk about the numbers<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/13/wall-street-still-doesnt-get-crypto/"> and Wall Street’s confusing reaction.</a></p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> Navigating a volatile market, even if you know it is volatile, is scary for Wall Street, which sent Coinbase’s share price plummeting after a not-super-bright earnings report. It’s a reminder that even amid the hype and certainty that crypto isn’t disappearing overnight, the asset class still has a lot of work to do on education.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233084" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<h3><strong>Apple lost its request to delay App Store changes</strong></h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2031365" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2031365" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2031365" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/fortnite-epic-GettyImages-957063528.jpg?w=680" alt="Epic Games Inc.

<p>A federal judge <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/apple-ordered-to-comply-with-courts-decision-in-epic-games-case-over-in-app-payments/">ruled this week</a> that Apple can’t push back the deadline to update its App Store policies, as previously ordered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">in the court’s decision</a> on California’s Epic Games v. Apple lawsuit. Though Apple largely won that case when the judge declared that Apple was not acting as a monopolist (as Epic Games had alleged), the court sided with the Fortnite maker on the matter of Apple’s anti-steering policies regarding restrictions on in-app purchases.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The original ruling stated that Apple would no longer be allowed to prohibit developers from pointing to other means of payment besides Apple’s own payment systems. But Apple wanted that decision put on hold until its appeals case was decided — a delay that would have effectively pushed back the App Store changes by a matter of years.</p>
<p>The judge heard Apple&#8217;s requests for a stay on the injunction that was ordered, which would have pushed back the December 9 deadline which forces Apple to start allowing links to alternative payment options inside apps.</p>
<p>The question is now whether or not Apple will actually comply (in the way developers are imagining) and if so, how exactly it will interpret the ruling. In South Korea, Apple was ordered to do something similar but <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorea-targets-apple-over-new-app-store-regulation-2021-10-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said it believed it was already in compliance</a> due to how the law was written, leading to further discussions between it and regulators. Meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/google-play-to-support-alternative-billing-systems-in-south-korea-following-new-law/">Google complied with the South Korean law</a> but noted it still requires commissions for third-party payments, just at a reduced rate. While it&#8217;s a major step to see any of these app stores open up at all, these moves indicate that the language used to direct changes across the app store has to be precise, or else the companies will find a loophole.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Apple says it intends to ask the Ninth Circuit for a stay as it believes &#8220;no additional business changes should be required to take effect until all appeals in this case are resolved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1458311586456670208" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed out</a> the judge&#8217;s ruling was good for developers, not necessarily good for Epic itself, as Apple plans to block Fortnite from the App Store throughout the appeal process.</p>
<h3><strong>2022 Mobile Forecast</strong></h3>
<p>App Annie <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/6-mobile-forecasts-to-help-you-succeed-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> its annual mobile forecast, this time predicting six major trends to keep your eyes on for the year ahead. Its key takeaways?</p>

<h3><strong>Platforms: Apple</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/apple-says-app-store-wont-close-to-developers-over-holidays-as-in-previous-years/">to keep App Store Connect open</a> over the holidays.</strong> In a change from previous years, Apple said it will keep the App Store open to developer submissions over the 2021 holidays. However, it cautioned that during the dates of November 24 to 28 and from December 23 to 27, submissions may take longer &#8212; signaling it&#8217;s running with a reduced staff.</li>
<li><strong>Apple releases iOS 15.2 into beta.</strong> The standout addition in this release is <strong>Apple&#8217;s <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/apple-safety-feature-messages/">new safety feature</a></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><strong> for kids</strong> in iMessage, which allows parents to block potentially sensitive photos in iMessage that may contain nudity, and alert parents if kids decide to view the messages anyway.

The Apple TV app also got a visual refresh on iPad.</span></li>
<li><strong>Apple <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=yeyd5xuh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reminded developers</a></strong><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"><strong> that a COVID-era deferral on in-app purchases related to virtual group events is nearing its end.</strong> In 2020, Apple temporarily deferred the requirement to offer paid online group event services (one-to-few and one-to-many real-time services) through its in-app purchase system. This included businesses like online tutoring, medical consultations, real estate tours, virtual fitness and more. As COVID raged on, Apple deferred that deadline twice more, to June 2021 and then to December 2021, with the goal of supporting businesses impacted by the pandemic. But it now says the deadline will not be pushed again and apps will have to implement IAP by December 31, 2021, or they won&#8217;t be approved.</span></li>

<li><strong>TikTok (including Douyin) remained the most-download app worldwide in October 2021 in the non-games category with more than 57 million installs, </strong>per <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/top-apps-worldwide-october-2021-by-downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sensor Tower data</a>.

<li><strong>Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/instagram-tests-take-a-break-reminders-on-an-opt-in-basis/">announced</a> the company is testing a new feature called “Take a Break,”</strong> which will allow users to remind themselves to take a break from using the app after either 10, 20 or 30 minutes, depending on their preferences. As an opt-in feature, however, the reminders may have a limited impact, as users would have to be motivated to set up the new control for themselves.</li>

In another challenge to TikTok, Instagram added text-to-speech and voice effects tools to Reels</span></span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/instagram-adds-tiktok-like-text-to-speech-and-voice-effects-tools-to-reels/">as well</a>.</span></li>
<li><strong>Instagram looks ready to launch creator subscriptions.</strong> On November 1, the company added new in-app purchases to its U.S. app, which are labeled &#8220;Instagram Subscriptions&#8221; and range in price from $0.99 to $4.99. <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/instagrams-creator-subscriptions-nearing-launch-app-store-listing-reveals/">When we asked what was up</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, the company said it had nothing to share at this time.</span></li>

<li><strong>Netflix <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/netflix-to-launch-a-short-form-video-feature-for-its-kids-profiles-on-ios/">added a short-form video feature</a> to Kids&#8217; profiles in its iOS app.</strong> The company said it&#8217;s testing a new feature that would introduce kids to its content library by way of short, auto-playing clips. The new addition has some resemblance to the TikTok-inspired Fast Laughs feature for adult profiles, except that these videos are horizontal, not vertical, and a timer counts down how many clips are left to watch.</li>
<li><strong>YouTube expanded its test that launches mobile users directly into its TikTok-like product, YouTube Shorts,</strong> if that was the area of the app users had last visited. The feature is being tested globally on iOS and is now expanding to Android, <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/youtube-to-expand-test-that-reopens-mobile-app-directly-in-its-tiktok-rival-shorts/">TechCrunch confirmed</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.</span></li>

The feature is notable as most video apps block any sort of sharing and even make screenshots come out all black.</span></li>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>daily TechCrunch+ column</em></a><em> where it gets its name. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Hello and happy weekend! Today we’re talking insurtech, SPACs and how well direct listings can manage the IPO pricing question. But first, crypto.</p>
<p>The crypto beat was busy this week, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/crypto-volatility-continues-to-flummox-wall-street/">Coinbase earnings</a> giving us a good look into just how busy trading activity was for the asset class in the third quarter. If you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/robinhoods-nasty-quarter-shows-the-ups-downs-of-trading-incomes/">recall Robinhood’s earnings</a>, what Coinbase had on offer won’t prove a surprise. After the American equity investment platform’s crypto revenues fell sharply, Coinbase also posted declines in its aggregate trading volumes and revenues compared to the second quarter of the year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233669" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In related news, FTX’s U.S. operations <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ftx-us-reports-third-quarter-2021-trading-results-and-provides-operational-update-301422005.html">disclosed some of its own performance data</a>, indicating that growth is still possible in the crypto trading market despite a general downward trend in the three-month period wrapping up this September.</p>
<p>All that’s to say that the crypto market continues to evolve — molt? — rapidly. From one quarter to the next, activity surrounding major chains and smaller coins can fluctuate rather sharply. For companies like Coinbase, this means variable revenues and profits.</p>
<p>But as Coinbase is cash rich, near-term ups and downs aren’t that big of a deal, so long as the long-term trajectory of crypto activity remains positive.</p>
<p>Another set of companies betting on a long-term upward trend are crypto-<em>gaming</em> companies. And they have been very busy in recent months. For example, Patron <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/patron-a-new-fund-from-former-riot-games-colleagues-locks-down-90-million/">raised a $90 million fund</a> to invest in crypto-based games; Mythical Games <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/09/mythical-games-raises-75m-to-build-an-nft-game-engine/">raised $75 million this summer</a> to build crypto games; a trading card game called Parallel <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/nft-sci-fi-card-game-parallel-raises-at-500m-valuation-from-paradigm/">raised at a $500 million valuation</a>; and Axie Infinity <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/axie-infinity">raised a round earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>This week, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/12/big-money-apes-into-blockchain-gaming-with-725m-raise-for-forte/">Forte raised $725 million for its crypto-gaming infrastructure</a>. This leads to me to wonder just how much capital the blockchain games can absorb in the near term. After all, games have historically proven to be poor venture capital investments, at least per traditional venture capital thinking. Why? Because games can prove rather hits-based, with certain titles performing well but fading in revenue terms after their launch.</p>
<p>Investors like strong, predictable, growing incomes. And investors like much less uneven revenues and uncertainty. The type of uncertainty that can come with new titles having the chance to flop.</p>
<p>And yet, slathered with crypto, gaming companies are hot? Are the economics and social risks that games have long demonstrated — the very things that made them less attractive venture wagers — improved when they are built with a blockchain backbone? I don’t see <em>why</em> that would be the case. But investors are putting capital into them as if they have. Let’s see how the various wagers pay out, or don’t, in time.</p>
<h2>Insurtech, SPACs and data</h2>
<p>We’re getting through earnings season at the moment, with all the majors behind us and smaller companies occupying much of our time and energy. From a number of calls this week, the following observations:</p>
<p><strong>Insurtech is hard:</strong> On the heels of news <a href="https://ir.metromile.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lemonade-acquire-metromile">that Metromile was selling itself to Lemonade</a>, you would be forgiven for wondering about the fate of public insurtech companies broadly. However, <a href="https://ir.joinroot.com/news-releases/news-release-details/root-inc-announces-2021-third-quarter-results">Root’s earnings this week</a> gave its share price a huge boost, after investors liked what they saw from the auto-focused insurance company.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean that it’s all clear sailing ahead for Root, even as one of its rivals finds a new corporate home. Talking with Root CEO Alex Timm this week, The Exchange got a view into how complicated it can be to time growth in the insurance space.</p>
<p>The CEO explained that Root has dialed back its near-term growth goals given market uncertainty regarding how to price coverage, a problem that many auto insurance companies are dealing with at the moment; this is not a Root issue, I mean to say. It turns out that inflation pressures on the cost of cars and labor are making it difficult to determine the cost of insurance, leading to more caution from the various players in the market when it comes to attracting new policies.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that Root is in any long-term trouble, but it does indicate how macro conditions can make life tough even for tech and tech-enabled businesses. Root is a bet data and smart software can better price insurance over time. But the company, right after it went public, is running into a shift in the underlying economics of its business that is effectively unprecedented, per Timm. Perhaps that complication is partially why Metromile buckled and sold its operations so quickly after its public debut.</p>
<p><strong>SPACs can be ok:</strong> This week NextDoor began to trade as a public company (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/nextdoors-spac-investor-deck-paints-a-picture-of-sizable-scale-and-sticky-users/">original notes here</a>). The Exchange caught up with its CEO, Sarah Friar, on its first day of trading to chat about her choice of listing vehicle.</p>
<p>According to the executive, NextDoor had to leave some of its product plans on the cutting room floor in late 2020, giving the company a general desire to raise more capital. And as NextDoor was able to get public-market ready and raise a chunk of money via its SPAC partner at a prearranged price, the deal made sense for her company.</p>
<p>That’s a somewhat standard perspective, and one that details why SPACs were popular earlier in 2021. But things have changed since, with many SPAC-led combinations seeing some of their backers pulling their capital out after they announced takeover targets and moved to consummate the deals.</p>
<p>NextDoor showed that the redemption issue is not endemic. After stating in its first release that its SPAC partner would bring $416 million in cash to its business, the final tally was $404 million. That’s a super-low ratio of lost capital. And NextDoor shares are trading nicely in the wake of its combination. A SPAC-led debut, it appears, can still work well in certain cases.</p>
<p><strong>Direct listings aren’t a pricing panacea: </strong>Amplitude <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/what-amplitudes-choice-to-direct-list-says-about-its-products-growth-and-value/">debuted via a direct listing recently</a> and reported its first set of earnings this week as a public company. The company has traded well since it listed, closing the week worth $73.86 per share, far above its $35 reference price.</p>
<p>Per Yahoo Finance, the company is worth just over $8 billion today. Given that the company chose a direct listing over a traditional IPO to avoid being mispriced, The Exchange was curious if the company was irked that it had raised at <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/amplitude-series-f--92399aff">roughly a $4 billion valuation earlier this year</a>, ahead of its direct listing. After all, it direct listed to avoid pricing issues, raising from private investors beforehand, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/the-roblox-gambit/">similar to what Roblox executed</a>.</p>
<p>Amplitude CEO Spenser Skates said that he felt good about the direct listing, arguing that a traditional IPO would have led to even greater price distortions. To which we say, <em>maybe</em>. But seeing private-market investors get a quick double on their money appears to be a similar cash-left-on-the-table moment as a mispriced IPO would generate, just with a different cohort of rich folks getting the lucre.</p>
<p>And, friends, with that, back to the weekend!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Indian government “strongly feels” that advertisements by cryptocurrency exchanges that promise customers wild profits and are not transparent about the volatile nature of such trading must be prohibited, according to a memo outlining the summary of a meeting between the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and several stakeholders on Saturday.</p>
<p>A consensus has been reached by several stakeholders including New Delhi that irresponsible advertisements are misleading youths in the nation and must be stopped, according to the memo, which was shared with reporters.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, leading cryptocurrency exchanges including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/a16z-coinbase-coinswitch-kuber-first-india-investment/">Andreessen Horowitz-backed CoinSwitch Kuber</a> and B Capital Group-backed CoinDCX have launched ads that many individuals have deemed highly irresponsible.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233778" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Lawmakers in India, where currently there isn&#8217;t an official framework to oversee cryptocurrency and their trading, have held conversations with several stakeholders in recent quarters to formulate a path forward for the industry.</p>
<p>The move comes as an increasingly growing number of Indians are beginning to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for the first time in their lives. Several Bollywood stars including legendary Amitabh Bachchan and Ranveer Singh, who has starred in several of the country&#8217;s biggest blockbusters, have promoted cryptocurrency trading in recent weeks.</p>
<p>On their part, CoinSwitch Kuber and CoinDCX have started podcasts and other collaborations with industry players to offer content that help youngsters make informed investment decisions.</p>
<p>Lawmakers in India have also expressed concerns around potential misuse of using crypto trading vehicle for laundering money and financing terrorism efforts.</p>
<p>To curb this, the government officials have indicated that they may require crypto exchanges to perform a full KYC of their customers. Most cryptocurrency exchanges have preemptively complied with this suggestion and some have prohibited users from moving their tokens and coins to private wallets or other exchanges.</p>
<p>But that might be the extent to which the Indian government plans to get involved with cryptocurrency at least in the immediate future.</p>
<p>One high-profile politician indicated to an industry executive earlier this month that the country will come up with laws that welcome innovation around blockchain technology and is open to foreign investment into local projects, a person directly familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The government&#8217;s conviction about such a potential move has grown stronger in the wake of the Chinese government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/24/china-says-all-cryptocurrency-related-transactions-are-illegal/">cracking down on cryptocurrency transactions</a>, the person said, requesting anonymity as the matter is private.</p>
<p>In the Saturday memo, it was relayed that the government is &#8220;cognizant of the fact that [blockchain] is an evolving technology hence the government will keep a close watch and take proactive steps.&#8221;</p>

		Daniel Cossío is the regional director at <a href="https://vilcap.com/about-us/regions/latin-america">Village Capital Latin America</a> and cares about building a more equitable future for the region.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Latin American farms and fields produce a lot of food, but 47 million people still <a href="https://iris.paho.org/bitstream/handle/10665.2/53263/faopahoregionaloverviewfood_eng.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">remain hungry</a>.</p>
<p>The region <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/CA4076EN/CA4076EN_Chapter2_Latin_American_Agriculture.pdf">accounts</a> for about a quarter of global exports in agricultural and fisheries products, including fruits and vegetables, salmon, maize, sugar and coffee. The agricultural sector is crucial for Latin American livelihoods, <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/CA4076EN/CA4076EN_Chapter2_Latin_American_Agriculture.pdf">contributing</a> to an average of 4.7% of GDP and employing at least 14% of the region’s population.</p>
<p>But paradoxically, the number of undernourished people in the region keeps growing year after year, <a href="https://iris.paho.org/bitstream/handle/10665.2/53263/faopahoregionaloverviewfood_eng.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">increasing</a> by around 13 million people over the past five years. The Pan American Health Organization estimates that by 2030, “hunger will affect 67 million people in the region, a figure that does not take into account repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230609" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>One major culprit: food waste. More than a third of the food produced each year around the globe <a href="http://www.fao.org/americas/noticias/ver/en/c/239392/">is lost or wasted</a>, and Latin America and the Caribbean are no exception. With a different and enhanced distribution chain, that amount of wasted food could be enough to nourish up to 2 billion people globally.</p>
<p>Here’s the rub: If we want to successfully address malnutrition in Latin America, agritech and food tech solutions need to come from within. Not just because Latin America <a href="http://www.fao.org/americas/priorities/seguridad-alimentaria/en/">has enormous natural wealth</a>, but because almost every Latin American has experienced food insecurity in one way or another, and someone who understands the problem is best suited to build a suitable solution.</p>
<p>Ady Beitler, chief executive officer at Nilus, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/bespoke/follow-the-food/the-reason-we-are-running-out-of-farmers/">puts it well</a>: “There’s more food out there than what’s needed to eradicate hunger. That’s for sure. What doesn’t exist is a distribution system that can get that food to those who most need it.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, Latin America is also a crib of creative minds that are crafting agritech and food tech solutions to better distribute food, increase agricultural efficiency and prevent people from being hungry. Entrepreneurs are helping farmers access tools that can better support them, reduce food waste and develop plant-based products. These solutions tackle the different parts of the food production system, from fields to plates.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One category of innovation that can reduce food waste: tools to help farmers improve field productivity. For example, <a href="https://sensix.ag">Sensix</a> from Minas Gerais, Brazil, uses drones and machine learning to map lands’ fertility. <a href="https://cienciapura.cl">Ciencia Pura</a>, a Chilean startup, implements software that illuminates plants throughout their different growth stages when natural light is unavailable.</p>
<p>A related category: innovation that helps reduce food loss through pest control. Typically, farmers control pests with a fungicide that creates health risks for both consumers and farmers. Plus, farmers normally detect pests too late and crops are lost.</p>
<p>Costa Rican startup <a href="https://www.clearleaf.cr">ClearLeaf</a> created a nontoxic, natural fungicide that enhances plant growth. And Brazilian startup <a href="https://www.sensaiotech.com">SensaIoTech</a> operates a platform that monitors crops and collects information to identify and detect pests on time.</p>
<p>The supply chain represents another important window to prevent food waste and, as a consequence, reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Food that’s thrown away in one neighborhood for being “<a href="https://newsandviews.vilcap.com/posts/world-without-hunger-philip-behn">imperfect</a>” is still healthy and consumable for another one where people are starving. That’s why Argentinian startups are revolutionizing logistics: <a href="https://nilus.online/">Nilus</a> recovers food that is perfectly safe to eat but would otherwise be thrown out and delivers it to low-income neighbors at discounted prices. <a href="https://www.savetic.com/en/home/">Savetic</a> develops software that traces products, analyzes data and predicts consumer trends to decrease food waste in supermarkets.</p>
<p>Another category to reduce food waste: agricultural waste reuse. Chilean startup <a href="https://fotortec.com">Fotortec</a> transforms agricultural waste into mushrooms that can be used as a flavor and protein enhancer. Peruvian startup <a href="https://bionatsolutions.com/#home">Bio Natural Solutions</a> reuses tropical fruit waste to develop a natural and nontoxic protection for fruits and vegetables that doubles their shelf life.</p>
<p>Lastly, entrepreneurs are finding plant-based products that provide protein and nutrition in an environmentally friendly way. <a href="https://plantsquad.com.mx/en/home">Plant Squad</a> from Mexico City develops alternative plant-based protein products that are nutrient dense and environmentally conscious. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/faba.oficial/">Faba</a>, from São Leopoldo, Brazil, sustainably extracts proteins from chickpeas.</p>
<p>The food system in Latin America is large and complex and won’t change in one day. But these startups (and many more) are leading the way in creating a collective response and building awareness around the financial support that these entrepreneurs need.</p>
<p>The agritech and food tech sectors are generating interest from international and regional investors and other ecosystem builders. If entrepreneurs received even more support from these important ecosystem players, the exorbitant amount of food waste could be reduced and entrepreneurs would build a fair and sustainable food system in Latin America.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, a podcast about the business of startups where we unpack the numbers and nuance behind the headlines!</span></p>
<p>Friday afternoon the Equity team took to a Twitter Space to hit on a topic that we had to cut from our regular end-of-week show, namely crypto earnings and how Wall Street is digesting the results. And to bring in extra mental horsepower, <a href="http://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> lassoed new TechCruncher <a href="https://twitter.com/AnitaRamaswamy">Anita Ramaswamy</a> to help.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2233501" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We touched on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/crypto-volatility-continues-to-flummox-wall-street/">Coinbase&#8217;s Q3 financial results</a> and what they tell us about trading incomes, and the company itself. Robinhood&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/robinhoods-nasty-quarter-shows-the-ups-downs-of-trading-incomes/">own Q3 results</a> were part of the chat as well, as they showed a similar pattern to what Coinbase disclosed.</p>
<p>More companies than just those two, newly-public entities are reporting crypto trading declines. Square did as well, after its bitcoin revenues slipped in Q3. Simply put, consumers traded less crypto in Q3 than they did in Q2, and a number of companies that were recently riding high on that particular volatility cycle had to deal with a down-cycle period.</p>
<p>We talked about what the results mean for the noisy world of crypto startups, many of which are looking to the highly-visible Coinbase as an indicator of what they can expect as they attempt to scale in a volatile market.</p>
<p>Equity is back Monday!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[When it comes to fundraising or types of capital, optionality has been the term du jour in the current tech environment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Joshua Broggi believes that three new colleges need to be created every single day, for the next decade, in order to adequately meet demand from students. So, he is building <a href="https://woolf.university/">Woolf,</a> what he claims is the first software platform that can launch and manage an accredited digital college.</p>
<p>Woolf wants to take off “the sophisticated burden” of accreditation, or recognition that an institution fits certain criteria and standards, from younger institutions or programs &#8212; ranging from tech bootcamps to an entirely virtual business school. Similar to how the University of California (UC) system brings together a group of prestigious universities under one brand, Woolf wants to be the “UC” for lesser-known institutions that want to level up their curricula and offer credits at the same time. So far, Woolf is working with seven pilot customers across seven countries.</p>
<p>Broggi’s vision of accreditation as a service, and this early traction, helped the startup land a $7.5 million seed round led by Todd Jackson at First Round Capital, with participation from investors such as Connect Ventures’ Sitar Teli, IOVC’s Shuonan Chen, All Access Fund’s Shaan Puri and Tribe Capital’s Jonathan Hsu.</p>
<p>The debate around accreditation often focuses on two extremes: the people who don’t believe in the power of a four-year degree and the people who think accreditation is the only way to succeed. I think that is an oversimplification; there is more of an overlap that you’d imagine when it comes to how entrepreneurs are viewing the future of education.</p>
<p>Case in point: Woolf University isn’t competing with the cadre of startups offering non-accredited alternatives to education. Instead, Woolf wants to make them future customers.</p>
<p>When it comes to fundraising or types of capital, optionality has been the term du jour in the current tech environment. And the same goes when we’re talking about the types of education pathways that a student should have access to. Broggi’s key argument here is that many tech bootcamps, or newer colleges, will eventually need to provide an accredited option in order to continue attracting customers.</p>
<p>Ethos-wise, it seems like both camps agree that it’s important to offer students a variety of resources because traditional, one-size-fits-all learning isn’t effective. Strive School, led by Tobia De Angelis, was launched in response to the outdated STEM course material taught in European industries. Even though a majority of universities in Europe are low cost or free to attend, he argued that accessibility doesn’t equate to effectiveness. He raised millions of dollars <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/strive-school-wants-to-increase-the-number-of-job-ready-software-engineers-in-europe/">to prove why more options are needed</a>.</p>

<p>Criminals have a long history of conducting cyber espionage on China’s behalf. Protected from prosecution by their affiliation with China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS), criminals turned government hackers conduct many of China’s espionage operations. Alarming as it may sound, this is not a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/26/technology/china-hackers.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">new phenomenon</a>. An <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1295981/download">indictment</a> issued by the U.S. Department of Justice last year, for example, indicated that the simultaneous criminal-espionage activity of two Chinese hackers went back as far as 2009. In another case, FireEye, a cybersecurity company, <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/08/apt41-dual-espionage-and-cyber-crime-operation.html">alleges</a> that APT41, a separate cohort of MSS hackers, began as a criminal outfit in 2012 and transitioned to concurrently conducting state espionage from 2014 onward. But there’s reason to believe that since then, China has been laying the groundwork for change.</p>

The CCP’s first effort in 2015 was to standardize university cybersecurity degrees by taking inspiration from the United States’ National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education — a NIST framework for improving the U.S. talent pipeline. One year later, China announced the construction of a new <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/chinas-national-cybersecurity-center/">National Cybersecurity Talent and Innovation Base</a> in Wuhan. Including all of the <a href="https://ncc-map.cset.tech/">Base’s components</a>, it is capable of training and certifying 70,000 people a year in cybersecurity.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2230313" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Along similar lines, in 2017, the Central Cyberspace Administration of China announced an award for <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/chinas-cyberai-talent-pipeline/">World-Class Cybersecurity Schools</a>; a program that currently certifies eleven schools in the same way some U.S. government agencies certify universities as Centers of Academic Excellence in cyber defense or operations. But having a new pool of talent untainted by criminal activity is not reason enough to change China’s operational approach.</p>
<p>Efforts to professionalize state hacking teams are also directly linked to President Xi&#8217;s political goal of reducing corruption. <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2021/03/01/chinas-domestic-security-agencies-are-undergoing-a-massive-purge">Xi’s recent purge</a> of China’s state security services demonstrates the risk officials run by enriching themselves using government resources. Patronage relationships between contract hackers and their handlers are precisely the type of profiteering behavior that Xi has targeted in his <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/04/947943087/how-chinas-massive-corruption-crackdown-snares-entrepreneurs-across-the-country">sweeping anti-corruption campaign</a>.</p>
<p>In an increasingly cutthroat environment, officers running operations that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-allies-accuse-china-global-cyber-hacking-campaign-2021-07-19/">draw international ire</a> or foreign criminal indictments are vulnerable to being turned in by rivals. Officials targeted by internal investigators may find themselves locked up in “<a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2021/06/12/the-anti-graft-unit-of-chinas-communist-party-has-grown-in-power">black jails</a>.” China’s security services will shed their relationship with underground hackers as they weed out corrupt officials and directly hire hackers.</p>
<p>The implications of these measures suggest that the Chinese hackers that the world’s companies and intelligence services are accustomed to defending against will be far more professional by the end of the decade.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A more capable China will behave differently than the China we see today. Given its reliance on illicit hackers to hide its criminal and espionage activities, the Ministry of Public Security has tolerated some cyber criminals’ Chinese operations, despite the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannaren-ransomware-author-contacts-security-firm-to-share-decryption-key/">problems</a> they cause. Once criminal activity is no longer the norm, China’s security services will find that they can move these operations in-house, since government spying is an accepted behavior in international relations. As a result, China’s Ministry of Public Security may conduct more <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/winnti-trend-micro-china-gambling/">operations</a> against cyber criminals. Analysts should be on the lookout for a rise in these internally focused, anti-crime operations, which would be a good indicator of a change in operational tactics.</p>
<p>This shift in Chinese cyber capabilities will be felt abroad as the list of targeted countries and entities grow. Espionage priorities that long languished near the bottom of the list are likely to  receive renewed attention as the roster of state hackers swells. These campaigns will not be more “sophisticated” than past operations, since China’s hacking teams are already on par with the best. But they will become more frequent.</p>
<p>As China’s security-backed hacking steadily sheds its veneer of criminality, we can expect to see a slowdown over the next decade in cybercrime conducted by contract hackers and others connected to the state. But this trend away from thuggery will be paired with a rise in espionage and intellectual property theft. In hindsight, China’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/26/technology/china-hackers.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">reliance</a> on criminal hackers will seem like a vestige of the old MSS — corrupt and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/10/1020596/how-chinas-attack-on-microsoft-escalated-into-a-reckless-hacking-spree/">even amateurish</a>.</p>
<p>While this shift will be gradual, we can expect certain indicators, like rumors of crackdowns within the security services or reports of disappearing or indicted criminal groups. Over time, we can expect to see the gradual separation of technical indicators between known criminal and espionage hacking teams.</p>
<p>But since spying isn’t against the rules, U.S. policymakers will need to continue prioritizing cybersecurity across government agencies, the defense industrial base and critical infrastructure operators. The White House is already moving in this direction; in August 2021 the administration rallied NATO allies on cyber policy and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/08/25/remarks-by-president-biden-on-collectively-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">identified</a> 500,000 unfilled cybersecurity jobs. For its part, the NSA launched the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/21/nsa-is-surging-its-collaboration-with-private-sector/">Cybersecurity Collaboration Center</a> earlier this year to increase systemwide cybersecurity.  The United States already uses competitions like <a href="https://www.uscyberpatriot.org/">CyberPatriot</a> to push students into the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice">well-developed</a> cybersecurity <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/resources/students-educators/centers-academic-excellence/">talent pipeline</a>. Creating new programs aimed at encouraging job retraining through community colleges <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/resources/students-educators/centers-academic-excellence/">certified in cyber defense</a> would leverage existing resources but may attract new students who missed the K-12 pipeline the first time around.</p>
<p>Above all, policymakers should remain vigilant. A decline in China’s use of criminals doesn&#8217;t mean the threat has disappeared, only changed. The U.S. government should be prepared to seriously consider the full range of options to meet the challenge of China’s next generation of hackers.</p>
