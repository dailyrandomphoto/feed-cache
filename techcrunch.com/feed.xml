										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Patreon CEO and co-founder Jack Conte and Chief Product Officer Julian Gutman spoke on a panel at The Information&#8217;s <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/events/creator-2021">2021 Creator Economy Summit</a> yesterday, where they were asked about the membership platform&#8217;s plans for crypto.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s clearly enormous innovation happening in the crypto and NFT space,&#8221; Gutman said. &#8220;Obviously there&#8217;s the art market and precious goods market that we&#8217;re seeing, with crazy pricing, evolve. It&#8217;s unclear if that is sustainable across the entire creator economy, but there&#8217;s some fundamental technological components to NFTs as a way to sell value to your audience and sort of continue to gain value from that from secondary sales as what you do becomes more and more important to the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month, Patreon <a href="https://blog.patreon.com/fall-2021-creator-policy-engagement-update">floated the idea</a> of creator coins to its creator community in advance of a quarterly<a href="https://blog.patreon.com/announcing-our-new-creator-policy-engagement-program"> Creator Policy Engagement Program</a> livestream, which allows creators to weigh in on platform policy changes. But the concept was proposed alongside a more pressing crisis related to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/patreon-to-roll-out-tools-to-help-its-adult-creators-meet-mastercards-new-standards/">Mastercard&#8217;s new standards</a> for adult content which prevented the company from engaging in a more in-depth conversation with creators about the topic.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226001" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re right now not talking about creating any type of initial coin offering, which is specifically not allowed under Patreon&#8217;s current guidelines,&#8221; Laurent Crenshaw, Patreon&#8217;s Head of Policy, had said on the Patreon Connect livestream. &#8220;But we&#8217;ve heard from a number of creators who have been interested in the opportunity to offer exclusive memberships and benefits to their patrons through a coin or token, a digital item that they can hold onto that shows that they are part of your fan club. And so we thought that at the very least, we could explore the opportunity of making that type of offering allowable under our guidelines.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Patreon allows creators to share personal investment stories or advice, its guidelines currently prohibit coins for the purpose of the direct financial benefit for a creator or patron, coins offered as part of an investment scheme, or any explicit incentives to purchase or obtain cryptocurrency. But if creators were to express interest in offering creator coins, Patreon would consider changing these policies.</p>
<p>A creator coin is a kind of crypto-based social currency &#8212; companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/crypto-social-network-bitclout-arrives-with-a-bevy-of-high-profile-investors-and-skeptics/">BitClout</a>, <a href="https://tryroll.com/">Roll</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/rally-raises-17m-to-expand-a-platform-that-lets-you-invest-in-but-not-buy-collectibles/">Rally</a> have worked on creating individual tokens, which essentially allow fans to invest in creators&#8217; success. So, if you buy a creator&#8217;s token early, and then they become a superstar, you reap benefits too.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing that I think Patreon has always been committed to at its core is making sure that we&#8217;re creating a sustainable, long-term path for creators, right? It&#8217;s not just a burst of monetization,&#8221; Gutman said at The Information&#8217;s summit. &#8220;So I think we&#8217;re certainly interested in evaluating and understanding how NFTs or some of the underlying technologies help us create that sustainable long-term earnings for creators. But I think when it comes to the hype around sales of individual assets and what not&#8230; not that we wouldn&#8217;t offer that if we felt it was really valuable to creators, as part of the broader portfolio of what they can offer&#8230; but I think for us, really thinking through how we&#8217;re continuing to ensure we&#8217;re creating a sustainable recurring future for creators is why we&#8217;re evaluating the crypto space more broadly.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Some crypto initiatives are focused on offering more ownership to creators over their work &#8212; for instance, an artist will continue to earn royalties on an NFT every time it is sold, while the same usually isn&#8217;t true for more conventional fine artists.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I will say about crypto and NFTs in general is I really love the idea of creators owning their media and owning their content. I love the idea of creators having leverage and control. I love the idea of creators owning their audience data instead of platforms. I love the idea of a lot of this underlying infrastructure empowering creators for independence. I love the idea of shifting power away from institutions and toward individual creative people,&#8221; Conte said during yesterday&#8217;s event. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s what a lot of this technology is getting at, and what I think is really deeply exciting about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, many creators winced at the idea of Patreon adding the ability for creators to dabble in crypto when it was proposed last month, mostly due to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/21/the-debate-about-cryptocurrency-and-energy-consumption/">environmental cost</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea of adding crypto worries me, because the reputation of crypto in artist communities is absolutely destroyed, even if it is beneficial at face value. I worry I would lose patrons due to them not agreeing with Patreon&#8217;s use of adding crypto to the platform,&#8221; a creator wrote in a public chat on the livestream.</p>
<p>The Information&#8217;s Laura Mandaro, who moderated the panel, asked Conte if Patreon has any full-time employees working on crypto.</p>
<p>&#8220;No comment is what I will say about that, but we&#8217;re thinking about it,&#8221; Conte said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Europol and its law enforcement partners have disrupted a network of organized cybercriminals behind a string of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> attacks that has claimed more than 1,800 victims across 71 countries since 2019.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s police agency <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/12-targeted-for-involvement-in-ransomware-attacks-against-critical-infrastructure">said on Friday</a> that 12 individuals had been “targeted” in raids in Ukraine and Switzerland this week following a two-year investigation. The agency didn’t say whether these individuals had been arrested or charged, and has yet to respond to our request for more information.</p>
<p>The unnamed individuals were “known for specifically targeting large corporations, effectively bringing their business to a standstill,” Europol said. One of the ransomware strains the group used was LockerGoga, the same strain used in the attack against Norwegian aluminum processor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/19/norsk-hydro-ransomware/">Norsk Hydro</a> in March 2019. The cyberattack forced the company’s plants across two continents to stop production for almost a week and cost Norsk Hydro more than $50 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226308" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In <a href="https://www.politiet.no/nn/aktuelt-tall-og-fakta/aktuelt/nyheter/2021/10/29/kripos-del-av-stor-aksjon-mot-organiserte-digitale-kriminelle/">a separate press release</a>, Norway’s National Criminal Investigation Service, commonly known as Kripos, confirmed that the targeted individuals were responsible for the Norsk Hydro attack.</p>
<p>Europol said the hackers also deployed the ransomware MegaCortex and Dharma, as well as malware like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/12/trickbot-spam-millions-emails/">TrickBot</a> and post-exploitation tools including Cobalt Strike and PowerShell Empire, to stay undetected and gain further access. &#8220;The criminals would then lay undetected in the compromised systems, sometimes for months, probing for more weaknesses in the IT networks before moving on to monetizing the infection by deploying a ransomware,&#8221; Europol said.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how much money the criminals made through their attacks, though Europol said it seized $52,000 in cash and five luxury vehicles.</p>
<p>“Most of these suspects are considered high-value targets because they are being investigated in multiple high-profile cases in different jurisdictions,” Europol said. “The targeted suspects all had different roles in these professional, highly organized criminal organizations.”</p>
<p>Europol added that a number of the individuals are suspected of being in charge of laundering the ransom payments: “They would funnel the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> ransom payments through mixing services, before cashing out the ill-gotten gains,” Europol said.</p>
<p>Europol said law enforcement agencies from Norway, France, the U.K., Switzerland, Germany, Ukraine, the Netherlands, and the U.S. participated in this week’s operation, with more than 50 foreign investigators deployed to Ukraine on October 26 to target the cybercriminals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spot works hard and plays hard. In its latest video, Boston Dynamics’ quadrupedal workhorse invokes the Jagger swagger in tribute to the 40th anniversary of The Rolling Stones’ Tattoo You. “Spot Me Up” find a quartet of Spot robots doing their best to mimic the 1981 “Start Me Up” music video.</p>
<p>Viral videos have, of course, have been an important marketing tool for Boston Dynamics for years now – and the feats have only become more impressive as the robots have grown more sophisticated. The Stones, too, have had their dalliances with tech marketing. In fact, the band licensed “Start Me Up” for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0AJM6HMYjM">a well-known Windows 95 campaign</a> in the mid-90s, when selling songs to corporate commercials wasn’t the ubiquitous activity it is these days.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XnZH4izf_rI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226309" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The split screen finds the robots doing their thing as the video plays, with the Stones at peak spandex form (RIP Charlie Watts always the best dressed of the bunch). The track “Start Me Up” reportedly took The Stones six hours to record &#8212; no word on how long it took to choreograph the Rolling Spots, though as we’ve seen,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/atlas-slugged/"> a lot goes into a minute and a half video</a>, moves like Jagger or no.</p>
<p>The video drops during a team of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/guns-on-robots/">increased scrutiny of autonomous robotic systems</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.hellosalted.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Salted</a>, a Los Angeles-based startup creating digitally native quick-service restaurant brands, brought in a new round of $16 million in Series A funding to continue its nationwide expansion.</p>
<p>The company was founded seven years ago by CEO Jeff Applebaum, but a focus on providing healthy QSR brands and going after the <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/food-delivery-app-profits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$325 billion food delivery space</a> came about three years ago. Applebaum told TechCrunch that he aims to be “the Yum! Brands for the digital age.”</p>
<p>Salted has created six brands so far, including moonbowls, Califlower Pizza and lulubowls, and serves food from Chinese takeout to pizza to salads.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225919" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Our technology and Salted Analytics product helps us grow at the rate we want to and still maintain customer experience,” Applebaum said. “We don’t consider ourselves a ghost kitchen, but a builder of budding brands that are going to be around for a hundred years. The great value is going to be in the brand layer, similar to Domino’s and Panda Express, which are scaling brands that people love.”</p>
<p>Creadev led the Series A that also included Proof Ventures and B. Riley Financial. The new investment joins with a $4 million seed round raised in May. At that time, Applebaum was using the funds for growth, and that strategy will continue with this new funding toward his goal of “building the next Chipotle,” he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has over 200 employees, including kitchen staff, and recently opened its 19th location. It is serving food in seven states, including California, Illinois and Ohio, and each location operates four to six brands. Applebaum expects to have over 50 locations by next year.</p>
<p>The locations are already collectively showing profitably and are generating between $1 million and $2.5 million in annual sales, he added.</p>
<p>Adrien Lejal, investment director at Creadev, said he was attracted to Salted because the company “doesn’t take shortcuts in the healthier food options and stands true to its mission, which speaks to the values of the team.”</p>
<p>He has been following the company for about 18 months and decided to jump in when the company started raising its A round. The QSR space isn’t one Creadev typically invests in, but Lejal said it does invest across the food chain and in companies that have “huge scalability potential,” and Salted was an interesting example, he added.</p>
<p>“The company as it is now was founded in 2018 and is already operating in seven states and combines scalability with execution, quality and speed,” Lejal said. “We also definitely invest in people first and Jeff’s leadership and management style is very impressive in the way he is reaching milestones in a short period of time.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Social Chat was founded on the premise that social commerce should be the standard for every store, and it may very well be soon.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When brands sell through social media and other third-parties, they often spend millions of dollars to advertise on those platforms, yet have little or no knowledge of who their customers actually are. Social commerce startup <a href="https://socialchat.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social Chat</a> is out to change that.</p>
<p>Frost Li, the former head of growth at Wish, founded the company in May to create software that leverages machine learning and artificial intelligence for personalization, recommendations and live customer service — all to enable brands to convert lost social engagement into revenue and customer acquisition without having to rely on a big engineering team.</p>
<p>“While at Wish, we learned that to offer the right shopping experience, you had to do absolute personalization,” Li told TechCrunch. “That was done with machine learning engineers, but when I left Wish and was advising brands, I found that what we had at Wish was rare. People were doing things manually and could not do personalization as much as a result.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225898" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>She aims to mimic the customer experience you might receive in-store working with a favorite salesperson, but in the digital world, and allow consumers to purchase and transact during the social events, she added.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9vOP1dYkGG"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-acquisitions/">Can social and e-commerce transform the future of the open web?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Can social and e-commerce transform the future of the open web?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/automattic-tc1-acquisitions/embed/#?secret=9vOP1dYkGG" data-secret="9vOP1dYkGG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Li believes that social commerce should be the standard for every store, and it may very well be soon. Earlier this year, Grand View Research reported that the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/social-commerce-market-size-worth-3-369-8-billion-by-2028--cagr-28-4-grand-view-research-inc-301207167.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global social commerce market</a> was forecasted to reach $3.4 trillion by 2028 from growing annually by over 28% between now and then.</p>
<p>“Online shopping is very transactional right now, but we help construct, over time, a long-term relationship through social interaction with customers,” she added.</p>
<p>As it launches its e-commerce customer engagement and revenue software, Social Chat also announced a $6 million seed round co-led by Race Capital and Gradient Ventures and that included Kevin Lin, co-founder of Twitch; Tony Zhao, founder of Agora.io; Ran Makavy, former chief product officer at Lyft; Alanna Gregory, global head of engagement at AfterPay; and Jack Xie, vice president of engineering at Wish.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2225908" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2225908" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2225908 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Social-Chat-Team.png?w=680" alt="Social Chat" width="680" height="396" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Social-Chat-Team.png 1178w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Social-Chat-Team.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Social-Chat-Team.png?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Social-Chat-Team.png?resize=768,447 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Social-Chat-Team.png?resize=680,396 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Social-Chat-Team.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2225908" class="wp-caption-text">Social Chat team, from left, Richard Lin, Pearl Tsang, Frost Li and Michael Chen. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Social Chat</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Edith Yeung, partner at Race Capital, says the future of shopping will be social — children are watching less television and more TikTok, so brands need to take control of their data so they don’t lose their audience to another platform.</p>
<p>“What Frost is doing is giving power back to the brands so that they can shift customers back to their own websites to convert them to sales, that is why Shopify is doing so well,” she added. “Facebook is trying to get people to trust them again, but companies are still at their mercy to keep paying millions, but they don’t know who their customers are.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Social Chat previously raised $200,000 and will use the new funding to hire more AI and ML engineers to expand its product offerings.</p>
<p>Though it is a fairly new company and too early to see concrete growth metrics, Social Chat is already working with customers like HTC and 10 other brands and seeing some early traction.</p>
<p>As Li watches the social commerce market grow into a multitrillion-dollar market and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/the-demise-of-browser-cookies-could-create-a-golden-age-of-digital-marketing/">technical part of tracking going away</a>, it will provide the company an opportunity to scale and solve problems for its users.</p>
<p>“We are differentiating ourselves with the AI play so that you can see value, but don’t have to keep paying Facebook to keep your users,” she said. “When Google gets rid of the cookies, it is going to be crazy: you will have to really own the first-party data to communicate with users, or you will lose visibility.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google and top Indian telecom network Jio Platforms said on Friday that their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/google-and-jio-platforms-announce-worlds-cheapest-smartphone-jiophone-next/">much-anticipated budget smartphone, JioPhone Next,</a> will go on sale in the world&#8217;s second largest smartphone market on November 4 (coinciding with the big Indian festival of Diwali.) The firms said the JioPhone Next will cost 6,499 Indian rupees ($87), and can also be purchased in multiple instalments with an entry price as low as $27.</p>
<p>The smartphone runs Pragati OS, which is powered by an &#8220;extremely optimized&#8221; Android mobile operating system with a range of customized features such as Read Aloud and Translate Now that will work with any text on the phone screen, including web pages, apps, messages and even photos as well as support for 10 Indian languages.</p>
<p>&#8220;Among the many rich features of JioPhone Next, the one that has impressed me the most — and one that will empower common Indians the most and take their digital journeys to the next level — is its contribution to India’s linguistic integration. India’s unique strength is our linguistic diversity. Those Indians who might not be able to read content in English or in their language can get it translated, and even read out, in their own language on this smart device,&#8221; said Mukesh Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director of Reliance Industries, which operates Jio Platforms.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226279" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The two firms also revealed the specifications of the JioPhone Next. The smartphone features a 5.45-inch HD+ display with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection. It is powered by Qualcomm&#8217;s quad-core QM-215 chipset that clocks up to 1.3GHz, coupled with 2GB of RAM and 32GB internal storage, which is expandable. The dual-SIM capable JioPhone Next, which houses a 3,500 mAh battery, features a 13-megapixel rear camera with support for HDR and an 8-megapixel selfie sensor.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2226303" style="width: 4298px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226303" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2226303 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-631026204.jpg" alt="" width="4288" height="2848" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-631026204.jpg 4288w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-631026204.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-631026204.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-631026204.jpg?resize=768,510 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-631026204.jpg?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-631026204.jpg?resize=1536,1020 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-631026204.jpg?resize=2048,1360 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-631026204.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4288px) 100vw, 4288px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2226303" class="wp-caption-text">Google CEO Sundar Pichai interacts with students at IIT Kharagpur campus on January 5, 2017 in Kharagpur, India. His firm has grown extremely bullish in India in recent years. Last year, the company announced it will invest $10 billion in India over the course of next five to seven years.

<p>The JioPhone Next is Google&#8217;s latest attempt at reaching the masses in developing markets. The Android-maker has launched several programs over the past decade including Android One to deliver budget smartphones with improved user experience. At an event in India in 2017, Google chief executive Sundar Pichai noted that many markets such as India need phones at a price point of $30 for mass adoption.</p>
<p>&#8220;The JioPhone Next is an affordable smartphone designed for India, inspired by the belief that everyone in India should benefit from the opportunities the internet creates. To build it, our teams had to work together to solve complex engineering and design challenges, and I’m excited to see how millions of people will use these devices to better their lives and communities,&#8221; he said in a statement Friday.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Analysts have said in recent months that the JioPhone Next could disrupt the Indian smartphone market — the world’s second largest — and help the telecom network, which has amassed over 400 million subscribers and last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">raised over $20 billion from a range of marquee investors including Google and Facebook</a>, further solidify its dominance in the country.</p>
<p>The JioPhone Next &#8212; which was originally scheduled to launch in the second week of September, but the two firms had to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/jiophone-next-launch-delayed-november-google-reliance-india/">delay the sale citing global chip shortage</a> &#8212; is aimed at helping roughly 300 million users in India who are still on a 2G network upgrade their gadget to access faster networks, Ambani said at an event earlier this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am delighted that Google and Jio teams have succeeded in bringing this breakthrough device to Indian consumers in time for the festival season, inspite of the current global supply chain challenges caused by the Covid pandemic. I have always been a firm believer in the power of the Digital Revolution to enrich, enable and empower the lives of 1.35 billion Indians. We have done it in the past with connectivity. Now we are enabling it again with a smartphone device,&#8221; he said in a statement Friday.</p>

App developer Steve Moser found the image inside the company&#8217;s app used to control its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-smart-glasses-ar-160006477.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">Ray-Ban Stories</a> AR sunglasses, hinting that it could also be used to control the watch in the future.</p>

<p>In addition to having rounded corners and a camera, the smartwatch appears to have a stainless steel casing and detachable straps.

<p>According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Meta is hoping to launch a smartwatch as early as 2022, but nothing has been finalized yet.

It&#8217;s not clear if the device shown in the image is one of those, or if it will even be released at all. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526266/facebook-smartwatch-two-cameras-heart-rate-monitor" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1"><em>The Verge</em></a> also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-smartwatch-camera-detachable-heart-rate-monitor-184825648.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">reported</a> earlier this year, though, that Facebook is working on a smartwatch with a front-facing and a 1080p rear camera with autofocus. It could have a heart rate monitor and LTE connectivity, as well, though those features could be distributed across the three different models.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Kurly has reviewed its listing in the U.S. but changed the plan to a Korean IPO.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">South Korean authorities have eased IPO requirements for Korea-based startups to attract them to get listed on the domestic bourse after Korean e-commerce company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/coupang-follows-roblox-to-a-strong-first-day-of-trading/">Coupang listed</a> on the New York Stock Exchange early this year.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Beta Finance, a decentralized finance protocol that has developed a one-click solution for lending, borrowing and shorting of any crypto asset, said on Friday it has raised $5.75 million across its private and public launchpad investments rounds.</p>
<p>The private investment round was led by Sequoia Capital India. ParaFi Capital, DeFiance Capital, Spartan Group, GSR, Delphi Digital, and Multicoin Capital also participated in it.</p>
<p>The startup, founded by Allen Lee, is attempting to make it easier for users to short a crypto coin to fight the price volatility and also give them another avenue to hedge their risk.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226238" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Existing DeFi protocols only support the borrowing and shorting of a very limited selection of mature crypto assets &#8212; leaving the vast majority of such tokens inaccessible from users.</p>
<p><a href="https:/www.betafinance.org">Beta Finance</a>, which is built atop the Etherium blockchain, says it is filling this inefficiency by creating what it calls the first user-friendly protocol that offers a wider choice and functionality.</p>
<p>Its one-click solution enables traders without technical know-how to manage and update their short positions on any token with all relevant token information directly available on the interface to guide their decision. &#8220;Users can short many of the most volatile assets neglected by existing money markets, which helps offset volatility, hedge risk and gain healthier returns,&#8221; the startup said.</p>
<p>“We see short selling as a critical piece of financial infrastructure that has been missing from the DeFi protocol,” said Lee in an interview with TechCrunch. “For DeFi to replace traditional finance, we believe that it’s necessary to build tools such as short selling.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Beta Finance, whose coin BETA trades on Binance, &#8220;has the potential to be a category-defining protocol,&#8221; said Pieter Kemps, Principal at Sequoia India, in a statement.</p>
<p>The startup says within the first month of its platform&#8217;s launch, it had processed over 10,000 deposits, 1,000 borrows, and 500 short positions for over 10,000 unique addresses. The protocol had an average total value locked of over $195 million, the startup said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition to being the pioneer for one-click shorting, Beta has already proven its ability to accommodate a diverse range of assets (including volatile ones) while remaining secure by becoming the very first protocol to short an NFT when it enabled short-selling for the $NFD token, just a week after launching the protocol. We are very optimistic that Beta will become a key stakeholder for the DeFi ecosystem going forward,&#8221; said Kemps.</p>
<p>Beta FInance will deploy the fresh capital to broaden its product offerings and hire more talent, Lee said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">German technology and parts supplier Robert Bosch GmbH will invest another 400 million euros ($467 million) to expand its chip manufacturing facilities in response to the ongoing semiconductor shortage that has wreaked havoc on the production of everything from vehicles and appliances to personal computers and power tools.</p>
<p>The boosted expenditure, which is earmarked for 2022, will go toward expanding operations at the company’s wafer fabrication plants in Dresden and Reutlingen, Germany, and its semiconductor component facility in Penang, Malaysia. The majority of the funds will be used to increase manufacturing capacity at the Dresden site, which the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/bosch-opens-1-2-billion-chip-plant-in-germany/">opened in June</a> at a cost of €1 billion ($1.2 billion), the single largest investment in its history. That facility produces 300-millimeter wafers, a larger size that yields more individual chips per wafer.</p>
<p>Around 50 million euros will be spent in Reutlingen in both 2022 and 2023, where the company has been making semiconductor components since 1970. There, Bosch will expand its &#8220;cleanroom&#8221; – a specially engineered environment where the silicon wafers are made into semiconductor chips – by more than 4,000 square meters (about 43,000 square feet), to a total of 14,500 square meters (156,000 sq feet). The expansion will also create 150 new jobs, according to Bosch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225855" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In Penang, Bosch will construct a new semiconductor test center, which will enter operations in 2023. The test center will take up around 14,000 square meters (150,696 sq feet) initially. However, the company has the space — more than 100,000 square meters — on the Penang strip, and plans to eventually develop all of it.</p>
<p>The huge investment comes during a protracted semiconductor shortage that automotive executives and industry analysts forecast will extend into next year. Executives from both Ford Motor Company and General Motors told investors in their respective third quarter earnings calls this week that they foresee the shortages persisting into 2022, and possibly even 2023.</p>
<p>It’s a sensible move for the company, which not only supplies automakers and other companies, but also uses its chips in-house for products such as Bosch power tools. It’s also good news for the European Union, which aims to increase domestic supply chain resilience by boosting the production of semiconductors in the EU to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/europes-digital-decade-digital-targets-2030_en">one-fifth of the world’s supply</a> by 2030.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Facebook is working on a new high-end VR headset codenamed Project Cambria. The company teased the device during its recent Connect conference on Thursday. It plans to release the headset sometime next year. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said it will be a separate &#8220;high-end&#8221; product from the company&#8217;s $299 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">Quest 2 headset</a>. It will also cost more than that device.</p>
<p>Cambria will include capabilities that currently aren&#8217;t possible on other VR headsets. New sensors in the device will allow your virtual avatar to maintain eye contact and reflect your facial expressions. The company says that&#8217;s something that will allow people you&#8217;re interacting with virtually to get a better sense of how you&#8217;re feeling. Another focus of the headset will be mixed-reality experiences. With the help of new sensors and reconstruction algorithms, Facebook claims Cambria will have the capability to represent objects in the physical world with a sense of depth and perspective.</p>
<p>Cambria will also feature new optics that the company said will increase visual fidelity. Facebook promised to share more details about the headset next year. In the meantime, it mentioned that third-party developers are already working on experiences for the device.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226147" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>The 4D system includes 31 speakers, six of which create the 3D effect from above. Another four &#8220;near-ear&#8221; speakers sit in the front seats, and all four seats have two sound transducers (aka exciters) each. Throw in 1750W of total power (including an 18.5-liter subwoofer) and you&#8217;ll likely be happy regardless of the audio processing.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for October 28, 2021. With our SaaS event now behind us — a big thanks to the TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/pages/about-techcrunch/">events and sales teams</a> who keep crushing it for the publication — we can pivot our focus back to, well, the metaverse? — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/"><strong>Facebook goes Meta</strong></a><strong>: </strong>By creating a brand above its preceding corporate domicile, Facebook has created a meta-entity to include its various projects. And one of those is the metaverse. Thus, the new name for the company — Meta — makes pretty good sense. Most folks don’t seem to like it much, but it’s hard to weed the General Facebook Snark from the Actually About The Name Snark, if that makes sense. More in our Big Tech section down below.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/nerdwallets-ipo-proves-you-can-write-your-way-to-a-unicorn-valuation/"><strong>NerdWallet writes its way to unicorn valuation:</strong></a><strong> </strong>As online finance content empire NerdWallet approaches the public markets, the writing-centric company will garner a valuation north of $1 billion, per its latest IPO filings. TechCrunch, a words-first publication, had thoughts on the matter.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/mark-zuckerberg-takes-thinly-veiled-shots-at-apple-for-stifling-innovation-via-its-platform-policies/"><strong>Facebook is cross with Apple:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Facebook — Meta, I suppose — took a few potshots at Apple during its big event today. They are worth considering apart from the larger branding and VR efforts that the company announced. Apple’s changing privacy rules have taken a toll on Facebook, and the social giant is not pleased about it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we get into the startup news, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/allbirds-flotation-should-help-the-market-sort-the-value-of-tech-enabled-ipos/">former startup Allbirds is going public, and TechCrunch has the details on just what it is worth</a>. And, in the wake of Rent the Runway, we are starting to see a valuation band created for tech-enabled IPOs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226002" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/atlys-raises-4-25m-to-make-visa-applications-faster-and-easier/"><strong>Atlys wants to make visa applications quicker:</strong></a><strong> </strong>And it just raised $4.25 million for its work. Sure, fewer of us than normal are flying overseas, but eventually we’ll get back on planes and go places. And when we do, well, the paperwork will beckon. Perhaps Atlys can take some of the sting out of stapling photos of yourself to a packet that you then mail to the black hole of an embassy.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/cover-a-modular-home-builder-thats-modeled-in-ways-after-tesla-has-raised-a-60-million-series-b/"><strong>Soon we shall all live in pods:</strong></a> Prefab pods, if Cover gets its way. The startup creates walls and other similar home components in its factory. Those bits are then shipped to building sites and set up sans a crane. Frankly, let’s hope this works? We have a housing crisis in the United States, and any movement toward alleviating it is welcome. The company also just raised $60 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/tim-berners-lee-startup-inrupt-funding/"><strong>Inrupt’s plans to reclaim internet privacy raising capital:</strong></a><strong> </strong>The deal isn’t done yet, but TechCrunch broke news today that Tim Berners-Lee’s Inrupt startup, a company that wants to build “a platform that gives users control of their data” online, is looking to raise between $30 million and $40 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/oneroof-raises-1-25m-to-build-a-hyper-localized-nextdoor/"><strong>What if Nextdoor was even more insular?</strong></a><strong> </strong>Well, that’s what OneRoof is building, an even more hyperlocal Nextdoor, the social network known to bring neighbors together so that they can argue and throw racist invective at one another. Now you will be able to do so in even tighter-knit circles. The company just raised $1.25 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/tiger-coatue-double-down-on-hinge-health-with-new-400m-infusion/"><strong>Healthcare remains a lucrative market:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s our takeaway from Hinge Health raising $400 million in a new round. The company is focused on chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions, which encompass things like aching backs and knees. Given how large the American healthcare market is, the company’s $6.2 billion valuation may make a mote more sense than you are mentally giving it credit for.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/aws-for-blockchain-alchemy-boost-valuation-to-3-5b-with-250m-raise/"><strong>Alchemy raises $250M in competitive round:</strong></a> Every venture investor is in awe of Amazon’s AWS group, because it eats growth and shits operating profit. It’s worth a zillion dollars. So it’s perhaps not surprising that the competition to put capital into Alchemy was more than hot. The firm provides basic infra to other crypto companies, and a grip of crypto companies that you know of are already Alchemy customers.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/yugabyte-stores-up-188m-more-for-its-open-source-distributed-sql-database-model-now-valued-at-1-3b/"><strong>Yugabyte raises yuge venture round at yuger valuation:</strong></a> Yugabyte is now a unicorn, which feels like a very 2021 sentence. The database company just added $188 million to its own financial database at a valuation of $1.3 billion.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/dragos-series-d-unicorn/"><strong>Dragos raises $200M, soars to $1.7B valuation, sadly isn’t about dragons:</strong></a> Dragos works in industrial cybersecurity, which matters. Keeping IRL infra safe is a pretty big deal. But when I read the company&#8217;s name I was frankly hoping for mythical beasts. Alas.</li>
<li>And to close out our startup notes, <a href="https://twitter.com/NeeshaTambe">TechCrunch’s Neesha Tambe</a> has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/sequoia-provides-founders-with-key-insights-on-launching-building-and-fundraising/">notes from a chat with Sequoia</a> concerning fundraising tips for today’s startups.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Credit card and payments companies compete for a slice of the growing BNPL market</h2>
<p>Giving consumers the convenience of deferring payment for a product is not a new idea, but now that upstarts like Klarna, Afterpay and Affirm have taken the concept to the next level, legacy credit card companies and payment firms are taking notice.</p>
<p>Mary Ann Azevedo and Ryan Lawler have identified a &#8220;slow emergence&#8221; in the BNPL space &#8220;of a symbiotic relationship between traditional financial institutions, payments upstarts and leading companies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Visa announced yesterday that many companies are using its technology to power point-of-sale BNPL solutions; last month, its rival rolled out Mastercard Installments, its bespoke offering.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s not really a surprise that these credit card companies are stepping it up when it comes to BNPL,&#8221; reported Ryan and Mary Ann. &#8220;If anything, it’s a wonder that it took them this long.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Before we get to our Facebook News Roundup, Twitter also made a bit of noise today. Users <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/twitter-launches-spaces-recording-feature-to-testers-on-ios-global-launch-to-follow/">will now be able to record Spaces</a>, its audio chat rooms.

<h3>The rest of what Facebook announced:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-teases-polar-a-mobile-app-for-creating-ar-filters/">Facebook teases Polar, a mobile app for creating AR filters</a></li>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-errr-meta-unceremoniously-kills-off-oculus-brand/">Company formerly known as Facebook unceremoniously kills off ‘Oculus’ brand</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>And from the rest of Big Tech:</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/everyone-loves-bnpl/"><strong>Digging into majors attacking the BNPL market:</strong></a> While Affirm is best known as an early BNPL startup that made it to the public markets, Big Finance is not going to let tech have all the fun. Mary Ann and Ryan investigate.</li>
<li>And in news that is sure to make other companies as happy as the privacy changes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/apples-app-privacy-report-launches-into-beta-to-show-you-what-your-apps-are-up-to/">Apple’s “App Privacy Report” is now in beta</a>. Do note, please, that the more Apple pisses off other companies regarding data privacy, the better off consumers may be — but also that Apple is only doing this for its own results, not because it likes us.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Terran Orbital, a leading manufacturer of small satellites, is going public in a merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Tailwind Two Acquisition Corp. The deal has a post-transaction enterprise value of $1.58 billion and will furnish the company with around $470 million.</p>
<p>Of those funds, $345 million will come from Tailwind Two’s contribution, plus $50 million PIPE provided by AE Industrial Partners, Beach Point Capital, Daniel Staton, Lockheed Martin and Fuel Venture Capital. An additional $75 million has been committed by Francisco Partners and Beach Point Capital, and the company may have access to up to $125 million in debt commitments from Francisco Partners and Lockheed Martin at the close of the transaction.</p>
<p>Terran’s announcement is a reflection that space startups are still looking to SPAC mergers as a way to raise cash and go public. Deals with blank-check firms have become a popular route to the public markets in the space industry; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/virgin-orbit-to-go-public-via-3-2b-spac-deal/">Virgin Orbit</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/satellite-operator-planet-to-go-public-in-2-8b-spac-merger/">Planet</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/acquisition-happy-space-infrastructure-company-redwire-set-to-go-public-via-spac/">Redwire</a>, BlackSky, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/satellite-constellation-operator-spire-global-to-go-public-via-1-6-billion-spac/">Spire Global</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/satellite-imagery-startup-satellogic-to-go-public-via-spac-valuing-the-company-at-850m/">Satellogic</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/rocket-lab-to-go-public-via-spac-at-valuation-of-4-1-billion/">Rocket Lab</a>, Momentus and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/rocket-startup-astra-is-going-public-vis-spac/">Astra</a> are among the space companies that have raised billions through this financial vehicle.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226090" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Terran Orbital is a contract manufacturer, designing, building and engineering satellites primarily for the U.S. government. Around 95% of Terran’s work is related to NASA and the Department of Defense, CEO Marc Bell told TechCrunch in an interview earlier this year.</p>
<p>The company will be opening <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/terran-orbital-to-open-a-300m-satellite-manufacturing-and-component-facility-on-floridas-space-coast/">the world’s largest space vehicle manufacturing facility</a> on Florida’s Space Coast at an investment of $300 million, it announced in September. The 660,000-square-foot facility will have the capacity to manufacture 1,000 complete satellites and over 1 million satellite components per year — a volume unheard of in the space industry.</p>
<p>In addition to manufacturing satellites, Terran Orbital also aims to operate its own earth observation constellation and deliver satellite imagery as a service. In a statement, Bell called it the new SaaS: “satellites as a service.”</p>
<p>The transaction, which has already received unanimous approval by both Terran Orbital and and Tailwind Two’s boards of directors, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s very hard to feel poorly for a company worth around $1.75 trillion, so we won&#8217;t. But shareholders of Amazon stock are taking on a bit of water in after-hours trading this afternoon. Amazon reported its <a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2021/Amazon.com-Announces-Third-Quarter-Results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q3 2021 results</a> today after the bell, detailing its recent performance that included a top-and-bottom miss on revenues and profits.</p>
<p>In the three months concluding September 30, 2021, the e-commerce and cloud computing giant reported $110.8 billion in revenues, up 15% compared to the year-ago period. Amazon also reported net income of $3.2 billion in the period, or $6.12 per share.</p>
<p>Analysts <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/analysis?p=AMZN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had expected</a> the company to post revenues of $111.6 billion, and per-share earnings of $8.92. The company&#8217;s net income dipped by some 49% on a year-over-year basis.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226030" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Shares of Amazon are off just over 5% as we write to you this afternoon.</p>
<p>But while Amazon&#8217;s Q3 performance missed the mark &#8212; the company&#8217;s AWS unit did report accelerating revenue growth on a year-over-year basis, providing something for the company&#8217;s fans to crow about &#8212; its Q4 notes may overshadow its trailing results. The company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/3-analysts-weigh-in-what-are-andy-jassys-top-priorities-as-amazons-new-ceo/">new CEO, Andrew Jassy</a>, said the following in the company&#8217;s earnings digest:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In the fourth quarter, we expect to incur several billion dollars of additional costs in our Consumer business as we manage through labor supply shortages, increased wage costs, global supply chain issues, and increased freight and shipping costs—all while doing whatever it takes to minimize the impact on customers and selling partners this holiday season. </span></p></blockquote>
<p>The executive framed the impending costs as customer-forward, arguing that taking near-term hits for longer-term results is reasonable. Investors were not sufficiently content with the promise of future cash flows to avoid reducing the company&#8217;s market cap by a few dozen billion.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But, as we noted, it&#8217;s hard to feel that bad for the firm given that Amazon reported net income north of $1 billion per month in Q3.</p>

<p>Cloud revenues are the element of Amazon earnings that we at TechCrunch pay the most attention to, so let&#8217;s peek at the data. First, here&#8217;s how the company&#8217;s AWS division performed in revenue and operating income terms:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2226046 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.41.14-PM.png" alt="" width="559" height="69" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.41.14-PM.png 559w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.41.14-PM.png?resize=150,19 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.41.14-PM.png?resize=300,37 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.41.14-PM.png?resize=50,6 50w" sizes="(max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px" /></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2226045" style="width: 566px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226045" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2226045 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.39.59-PM.png" alt="" width="556" height="72" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.39.59-PM.png 556w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.39.59-PM.png?resize=150,19 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.39.59-PM.png?resize=300,39 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.39.59-PM.png?resize=50,6 50w" sizes="(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2226045" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>So about $4.5 billion in new year-over-year revenues, and around $1.5 billion in new operating income. For those of you curious, both AWS and revenue and operating expenses grew by around 39% in the year-over-year window. Now let&#8217;s take a closer peek at pure growth metrics:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2226046 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.41.14-PM.png" alt="" width="559" height="69" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.41.14-PM.png 559w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.41.14-PM.png?resize=150,19 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.41.14-PM.png?resize=300,37 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.41.14-PM.png?resize=50,6 50w" sizes="(max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px" /></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2226044" style="width: 567px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226044" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2226044 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.40.21-PM.png" alt="" width="557" height="201" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.40.21-PM.png 557w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.40.21-PM.png?resize=150,54 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.40.21-PM.png?resize=300,108 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-28-at-4.40.21-PM.png?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 557px) 100vw, 557px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2226044" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>This set of data is notable because AWS is the fastest growing segment at Amazon. While the company is mostly in the headlines thanks to its e-commerce operations it is now being growth-led by its quieter cloud group. How long until investors demand that the company be split in two to unlock value?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Audi has rolled out a new software update to its 2019 model year e-tron electric SUV that will add up to 12 miles of range to the battery.</p>
<p>While the improvement might not seem significant — it is, after all, only 12 miles — it does show how automakers are using software to improve older electric vehicles. In this case, Audi used software to unlock more capacity in the existing battery, essentially improving its efficiency. The automaker also said the software updates have improved the efficiency of the front electric motor and the battery&#8217;s thermal management system.</p>
<p>The 2019 Audi e-tron 55 quattro is equipped with a 95 kilowatt-hour battery and will now use 86 kWh of capacity. That will push its range from the original 411 kilometers to about 441 km (274 miles) under the WLTP standard. (EPA standard is considered more conservative; the original EPA estimates for the 2019 was 204 miles.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225986" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The software update is available to all Audi e-tron 55 quattro production vehicles built between mid-September 2018 (model year 2019) and the end of November 2019 (model year 2020). Unlike Tesla, which lets owners launch software updates over-the-air, meaning anywhere they can access Wi-Fi, Audi requires a visit to one of its service centers.</p>
<p>This will help the older model keep apace of the newer 2020 and 2021 Sportback and e-tron SUV, which have improved software and hardware.</p>
<p>One might wonder why Audi didn&#8217;t just use that capacity to begin with. Audi and other automakers entering into the EV game initially limited the usable capacity of its battery out of an abundance of caution to avoid any degradation.</p>
<p>Other automakers are beginning to use over-the-air software updates, following Tesla&#8217;s lead, to improve or add features. In February, Volvo launched its first OTA software update on its all-electric XC40 Recharge in Europe. Volvo released an OTA this month that increased driving range through improvements to the battery management system and pre-conditioning timer. The company also launched a <a href="https://www.media.volvocars.com/us/en-us/media/pressreleases/289321/optimise-the-range-of-your-fully-electric-volvo-with-new-range-assistant-app-in-latest-over-the-air" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Range Assistant app</a> to help drivers get the most range out of their batteries.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">With Grab’s announcement of its imminent <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Startups/Grab-says-on-track-to-close-SPAC-deal-by-end-of-2021">Nasdaq listing</a> and GoJek merging with Tokopedia to form tech giant <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/indonesias-goto-set-wrap-up-2-bln-funding-round-eyes-ipo-2022-sources-2021-08-19/">GoTo</a>, casual international observers could be forgiven for believing that Southeast Asia’s tech universe only comprises similar companies. However, these companies only represent the highlights of what is a blossoming startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>Southeast Asia is hitting a sweet spot. It remains at a relatively nascent phase expansion in the technology industry but is at the same time developed enough to have a 400-million-strong internet user base. By late 2021, approximately 80% of the Southeast Asian population (aged 15 and above) will be digital consumers, according to a report by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/southeast-asia-the-home-for-digital-transformation">Facebook and Bain &amp; Company</a>.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, tech startup growth is booming as well. More than 35 tech startups across e-commerce, fintech and SaaS have achieved unicorn status in Southeast Asia, which has over 200 significant startups. As per Jungle Ventures’ calculations, the total value of the region’s digital companies is around $340 billion today and is estimated to grow to $1 trillion by 2025.</p>
<p>Further, Southeast Asian companies are breaking IPO records. Both Grab and GoTo’s valuations hover around the $35 billion to $40 billion mark. Sea is the 65<sup>th</sup> most valuable company in the world with a market cap of $187 billion, while Bukalapak was Indonesia’s largest-ever IPO at $1.5 billion at a market cap of $8 billion. There are many more waiting in the pipeline hoping to join this illustrious club of Southeast Asian tech decacorns.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Despite strong e-wallet adoption, over 70% of adults in Southeast Asia remain either underbanked or unbanked due to various cost and geographical limitations.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Vertical e-commerce is climbing the vine</h2>
<p>E-commerce will continue to accelerate in Southeast Asia — the sector is projected to grow 80% year on year and double in five years to $254 billion from $132 billion in 2021, according to the Facebook and Bain report. Shopee, Lazada, GoTo and Bukalapak are testament to the phenomenal growth opportunities available, and they are still growing.</p>
<p>While initial e-commerce success came from retail-focused companies such as Shopee and Lazada, the next value creation wave is emerging through vertical e-commerce.</p>
<p>Carro, which achieved unicorn status this year, offers an automotive marketplace in addition to supplementary products such as financing and insurance. Others like Livspace, Pomelo, Zalora and Sociolla are serving the home goods, fashion and personal care industries, respectively, and raising millions of dollars in funding. Their success is underpinned by the fact that at a product category level, Southeast Asia is still in the early stages of online retail penetration.</p>
<p>Based on the chart below, just &#8220;catching up&#8221; to the same level of penetration as China in verticalized segments increases the e-commerce opportunity by four to five times across the region.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is testing a new in-app tipping feature on its platform that would allow creators to accept money from fans outside of TikTok LIVE streams, where gifting is already supported. The company confirmed the feature is part of a limited test for the time being and is not yet broadly available.</p>
<p>TikTok creator <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jera.bean/video/7023876662139866415?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;lang=en">Jera Bean</a> first spotted the feature and posted a video showcasing the new option, which was then highlighted by social media consultant <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1453506329872670722">Matt Navarra</a> on Twitter.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">TikTok is rolling out a Tips feature to some creators </p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226023" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>h/t jera.bean <a href="https://t.co/fmrfuxdkrG">https://t.co/fmrfuxdkrG</a> <a href="https://t.co/hufl2qopk2">pic.twitter.com/hufl2qopk2</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1453506329872670722?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Her video shows the new feature in her TikTok account&#8217;s settings and the screen where TikTok details the requirements.</p>
<p>Creators who are part of the limited test can apply for the feature if they have at least 100,000 followers and are in good standing, the screen explains. Once creators submit an application to activate the feature, they’ll be notified when their account is approved. Creators that have been approved will be given a Tips button on their profiles, which their followers will be able to use to send them direct payments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Tips page also notes that the money received by creators will go directly to them and that TikTok will not be taking a cut. It’s unknown if TikTok plans to take a cut from creator Tips in the future if the feature progresses past the testing stage, but that seems likely.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re always thinking about new ways to bring value to our community and enrich the TikTok experience,&#8221; a TikTok spokesperson told TechCrunch, when reached for comment.</p>
<p>The feature is TikTok’s latest push toward monetization and helping creators earn a living through its platform. Last year, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tiktok-creator-fund-200-million-us/">introduced</a> a $200 million fund aimed at helping creators in the U.S. supplement their earnings. TikTok also helps creators sign brand partnerships and sponsorship deals and also provides monetization for livestreams. Considering TikTok&#8217;s focus on monetization efforts, it’s no surprise that the company is experimenting with a way for creators to directly receive money from their followers.</p>
<p>TikTok also isn’t the only social media platform looking to offer creators more ways to make money, as the new Tips option is similar to Twitter’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/twitter-tip-jar-lets-you-pay-people-for-good-tweetin/">&#8220;Tip Jar&#8221;</a> feature that launched earlier this year. Similar to TikTok’s approach, Tip Jar is available to a select group of users including nonprofits, journalists, experts and creators.</p>
<p>TikTok and Twitter&#8217;s direct tipping features appear to be a way for the companies to compete with other digital platforms like Instagram and YouTube, which offer lucrative ways for creators to make money.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At the company&#8217;s AR/VR-focused Connect event this morning, Mark Zuckerberg announced that despite a name change, <del>Facebook</del> Meta&#8217;s mission will remain the same and that its existing brands wouldn&#8217;t be changing.</p>
<p>“To reflect who we are and what we hope to build, I am proud to announce that starting today, our company is now Meta. Our mission remains the same — it’s still about bringing people together. Our apps and our brands — they’re not changing either,” Zuckerberg said.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out that&#8217;s not so true. In a lengthy <a href="https://www.facebook.com/boz/posts/10114026973983491">Facebook post</a>, CTO-in-waiting Andrew Bosworth detailed about 15 minutes later following the completion of the keynote that as part of the new rebrand, they will be killing off the Oculus brand.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225989" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Oculus phrasing was conspicuously absent from the presentations today and features like the Oculus Store were consistently referred to as the Quest Store. In his post, Bosworth details that starting early next year the process to rename the Oculus app to the Meta app and the Oculus Quest to the Meta Quest will begin.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all have a strong attachment to the Oculus brand, and this was a very difficult decision to make. While we’re retiring the name, I can assure you that the original Oculus vision remains deeply embedded in how Meta will continue to drive mass adoption for VR today,&#8221; Bosworth wrote.</p>
<p>Facebook bought Oculus VR back in 2014.</p>
