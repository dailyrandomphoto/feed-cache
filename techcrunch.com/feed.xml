										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Based in Hong Kong,<a href="https://www.finverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Finverse</a>’s ambitious goal is to enable open banking throughout the Asia-Pacific region. The startup recently came out of stealth mode with $1.8 million in seed funding, and is now live in four markets (Hong Kong, the Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam) with connections to 30 banks. Founder and chief executive officer Stephane Lesaffre told TechCrunch that Finverse plans to launch in one new market per quarter, with the goal of covering about 75% of consumer and SMEs banks in each place.</p>
<p>Participants in Finverse’s seed round included Febe Ventures, Golden Gate Ventures, SixThirty, Venturra and angel investors.</p>
<p>Finverse is among a crop of fintechs developing APIs that allow easier sharing of financial data. The most prominent examples include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/plaid-raises-425m-series-d-from-altimeter-as-it-charts-a-post-visa-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plaid</a> in the United States and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/swedens-tink-raises-103m-as-its-open-banking-platform-grows-to-3400-banks-and-250m-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tink</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/truelayer-70m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Truelayer</a> in Europe (Finverse’s seed funding included angel investment from Truelayer employees).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224666" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Before starting Finverse in 2020, Lesaffre was senior product manager of financial data integrations at NerdWallet, working with account aggregation APIs like Plaid and legacy player Yodlee.</p>
<p>Plaid won the U.S. market because it was reliable and developer-friendly, Lesaffre said. It did not offer as much data coverage as Yodlee, but “what it did do is a very narrowly-focused set of data very well, and very easy to build. My ultimate learning from NerdWallet is that bad data is really worse than no data.”</p>
<p>Finverse wants to do the same thing for the Asia-Pacific region by building dependable APIs and data integrations. “At the core, we are a basically a consent-based data pipe where a consumer allows Finverse to connect to their account and share it with another fintech or financial institution,” said Lesaffre.</p>
<p>This can include information about accounts, balances, transaction histories and bank statements. Accessing this data gives financial institutions a sense of the consumer’s assets and liabilities, and can be used to perform things like income estimates, credit checks and gauge ability to repay.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Brankas wants to bring Southeast Asia&#8217;s banks and e-commerce into the digital era&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/07/brankas/embed/#?secret=pmA9W2gjQI" data-secret="pmA9W2gjQI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lesaffre said that Finverse’s early adopters are mostly fintech startups, including a mix of SME lending providers and buy now, pay later services.</p>
<p>Finverse’s APIs can be used for a wide range of use cases, but most of its current potential clients are focused on consumer or SME lending. Many of them want to transition from a heavily manual process that requires applicants to upload documents, to a digitized credit decision that can take as little as one minute.</p>
<p>Finverse is currently focused on banked consumers, or people who have traditional bank accounts and credit histories, but over time it also plans to add digital wallets, neobanks and other less traditional institutions. Future use cases include financial tracking as more people in Asia start using e-wallets, investment apps and online bank accounts.</p>
<p>“If you are a smaller digital bank, you know that a lot of your customers will have another primary account at a larger bank, so a lot of smaller banks are quite keen to be able to get a full perspective on their consumers,” said Lesaffre. “One way to do that is to let consumers track all their accounts in one place.”</p>
<p>Another use case for Finverse’s APIs is cross-border payments verification, compliance and KYC.</p>
<p>Other open banking startups focused on Southeast Asia include Brankas and Finantier. Lesaffre said Finverse’s approach is different because it is targeting the entire Asia-Pacific region, instead of focusing on specific markets. Its new funding will be used to grow its engineering and business development teams.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Growing reliance on SaaS has opened the door to shadow IT: SaaS applications bought by individual employees without the knowledge or approval of their organization’s IT department.</p>
<p>While shadow IT can be an <a href="https://www.i-cio.com/innovation/consumerization/item/how-cios-start-to-view-shadow-it-as-a-catalyst-for-innovation">opportunity for innovation</a>, if left unaddressed, it can lead to risks like duplicate subscriptions, wasted IT spend, a lack of compliance and greater risk of a data breach.</p>
<p>By leveraging SaaS management and taking some steps, businesses can more effectively manage shadow IT, gain a competitive edge, reduce unnecessary costs and empower a distributed workforce.</p>
<p>To avoid the negative consequences associated with shadow IT, you need to give IT teams visibility into your organization’s entire SaaS portfolio. Once IT has a line of sight into all applications in use and how they are used, they are positioned to optimize investments. Maximize your SaaS investments with these tips:</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Implementing self-service SaaS at your organization is easier than you may think.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Discover all SaaS applications and spending</h2>
<p>Some organizations take a spreadsheet-based approach to managing their SaaS applications. Others turn to web browser plugins, single sign-on tools and cloud access security brokers. But these discovery processes can be time-consuming and involve piecing together SaaS inventories from disparate sources, often resulting in records that are out of date before they’re even completed.</p>
<p>Even the most detailed, frequently updated spreadsheet is not always the most effective way to manage SaaS, especially when you consider that organizations manage over <a href="https://zylo.com/blog/zylo-2020-saas-management-benchmarks/">650 SaaS applications</a> on average, and they underestimate the number of SaaS applications within their ecosystem by two to three times. If you don’t know a SaaS application exists, how can you manage and budget for it?</p>
<p>To optimize your SaaS portfolio, you have to start with gaining complete visibility. Tools like SaaS management platforms with machine learning capabilities that detect SaaS purchases enable continuous discovery of software. These solutions can also integrate with your financial management systems to discover purchases.</p>
<p>It’s critical for this strategy to happen in real time so you have a picture of your tech ecosystem that’s always complete, accurate and up to date.</p>
<h2>Optimize and rightsize licenses and features</h2>
<p>Do you have as many active users as you accounted for or could you downgrade your plan? Perhaps an employee left, but their accounts were never deactivated. In practice, you may not need all the premium features or seats you’ve paid for, which means there could be opportunities to reduce your SaaS spend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zolve, a neobanking startup that aims to help <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/zolve-raises-15-million-for-its-cross-border-neobank-aimed-at-global-citizens/">immigrants in the U.S. gain access to financial services</a>, said on Wednesday it has raised $40 million in a new financing round as it begins to roll out its offerings.</p>
<p>Partners of DST Global led the Bangalore-headquartered startup’s Series A financing round. The round, which values the 10-month-old startup at $210 million and brings its all-time raise to $65 million, also saw participation from Tiger Global and Alkeon Capital and existing investors Lightspeed Venture Partners and Accel.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of students and working professionals leave India for the U.S. each year to pursue higher education and for work. Even after spending months in a new country, they struggle to get a credit card from local banks, and end up paying a premium to access a range of other financial services.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224559" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Raghunandan G, a high-profile Indian entrepreneur who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/02/olaforsure/">sold his previous startup to ride-hailing giant Ola</a>, set out to solve this problem for Indians earlier this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://zolve.com">Zolve</a> rolled out its credit card to 2,000 customers (and amassed a waiting list that has surpassed 70,000) last month and immediately identified two insights, he said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Not only were the customers extensively using Zolve’s services and paying on time, he said, but the startup had also organically attracted demands from individuals who had immigrated from other nations such as Australia, United Kingdom, Canada and Germany.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2224598 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zolve-products.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="523" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zolve-products.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zolve-products.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zolve-products.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zolve-products.jpg?resize=768,402 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zolve-products.jpg?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zolve-products.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our basic value proposition is a credit card. Other than a credit card, you also get a local bank account and a debit card. We never expected our customers to deposit money to their bank accounts. And we thought even if someone deposits money, it would probably be a few hundred or thousand dollars. What we saw is that people are depositing tens of thousands of dollars and using this account as their primary bank account,” he said. “We are currently sitting on a deposit of $2 million.”</p>
<p>The logical result of this early traction is that Zolve now plans to expand its offerings to immigrants from several nations early next year, he said.</p>
<p>Zolve currently works with banks in the U.S. and India to provide consumers access to financial products seamlessly — without paying any premium or coughing up any security deposit. It underwrites the risks, which has enabled banks in foreign countries to extend their services to Zolve customers.</p>
<p>Working with banks in India has helped Zolve gain clarity on the individuals and do the underwriting. The startup now plans to replicate this model for customers from other nations.</p>
<p>Raghunandan said the startup was fortunate enough to identify and bring on-board the investors it wanted. He pointed out that many of the partners at DST Global are immigrants themselves and the three new investors have backed several startups that operate in similar spaces.</p>
<p>“Access to tailored and fair financial products has a direct and meaningful impact on people&#8217;s lives. We&#8217;re incredibly excited to have invested in Zolve, and to support Raghu&#8217;s vision of bringing world-class financial services products and experiences to immigrants in the US and other markets,” said Bejul Somaia, partner at Lightspeed, in a statement.</p>
<p>“The company&#8217;s rapid acceleration, especially around customer acquisition and usage, is a reflection of the team&#8217;s execution capability and significant unmet needs of Zolve&#8217;s target customer base. We&#8217;re excited for what the future holds and have high confidence in Zolve&#8217;s future success.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zolve also said it plans to aggressively expand its team. The startup’s headcount was just five earlier this year. It has since grown to 100, and now the startup is looking to hire 150 people across several roles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Smart Eye, a supplier of driver monitoring systems for automakers, has agreed to acquire human behavior software company iMotions for $46.6 million just five months after it snapped up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/emotion-detection-software-startup-affectiva-acquired-for-73-5m/">emotion-detection software startup Affectiva</a>.</p>
<p>Smart Eye, a publicly traded Swedish company, said Tuesday this is a <a href="http://www.corp.smarteye.se/sv/press/pressmeddelanden/press-detail/?slug=smart-eye-ingar-avtal-att-forvarva-imotions-och-avser-att-anskaffa-kapital-genom-en-riktad-nyemission">cash-and-stock deal</a>. Smart Eye will provide $23.2 million (200 million Swedish kroner) in shares and the remaining amount will be paid in cash. iMotions, which employs 63 people, will operate as a standalone company within the Smart Eye Group. The company&#8217;s structure and management team will remain in place, according to Smart Eye.</p>
<p>The acquisition is notable because it signals growing consolidation within the driver monitoring systems segment, a trend that Smart Eye CEO and founder Martin Krantz confirmed in comments to TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224343" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We expect to see continued consolidation of DMS vendors due to increased demand for DMS and interior sensing, which is already ramping up amongst OEMs,&#8221; Krantz told TechCrunch in an email. &#8220;With regulatory requirements in Europe — that are sure to follow in other regions of the world — we believe that nearly all global OEMs will procure their first or second generation DMS during the next couple of years. By joining forces with Affectiva, and now with iMotions, we are perfectly positioned for this development.&#8221;</p>
<p>Attention on DMS has increased as automakers roll out so-called Level 2 advanced driver assistance systems. There are five levels of automation under standards created by SAE International. Level 2 means two primary functions &#8212; like adaptive cruise and lane keeping &#8212; are automated and still have a human driver in the loop at all times. Level 2 is not considered full self-driving. These are advanced driver assistance systems that require a human being to be engaged and ready to take over.</p>
<p>The DMS typically involves a camera that watches the driver to ensure they&#8217;re paying attention and not abusing or stretching the capabilities of the system. GM and Ford use DMS to allow for hands-free driving. For years, Tesla has not had a camera, or in the case of the Model 3 and Y, used it to monitor the attentiveness of drivers using its Autopilot system. Instead, Tesla has relied on a sensor to gauge whether the driver&#8217;s hands were on the wheel.</p>
<p>While Tesla now equips Model X and Model S vehicles produced in 2021 or later with a camera, the feature is currently only available for Model 3 and Y vehicles equipped with Tesla Vision. That has been a sore spot for safety advocates in the United States, who have called on Tesla to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/ntsb-chair-elon-musk-change-tesla-autopilot/">change the system design of Autopilot</a> to ensure it not being misused.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regulators in Europe have already weighed in on what vehicles must be equipped with, opening up an opportunity for Smart Eye and other competitors.</p>
<p>While Affectiva and iMotion are related, Smart Eye contends that they offer different and complementing capabilities that can be folded into its own AI-based eye-tracking technology. The two companies actually used to work together, according to Smart Eye.</p>
<p>Affectiva, which spun out of the MIT Media Lab in 2009, uses computer vision, speech analytics and software to study facial expressions and analyze human emotion and cognitive states. Meanwhile, iMotion developed a software layer that brings together data coming in from multiple sensors and provides analytics that can then be used to improve driver safety and the driving (or riding) experience.</p>
<p>Affectiva and iMotions&#8217; tech could help its new parent company establish market share in &#8220;interior sensing,&#8221; in which software and hardware are combined to monitor the entire cabin of a vehicle and deliver services in response to the occupant&#8217;s emotional state.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Representatives from TikTok, Snapchat and YouTube <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-snap-youtube-hearing-congress/">testified</a> before the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security today to discuss how to protect kids online. This hearing follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen</a>&#8216;s document leaks to the Wall Street Journal, which &#8212; among many things &#8212; exposed Facebook&#8217;s knowledge that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">Instagram is toxic</a> for teenage girls. According to Facebook&#8217;s own research, 32% of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse.</p>
<p>But as the Senate tries to hold Facebook accountable for its influence on teen girls, lawmakers understand that this problem doesn&#8217;t begin and end with Mark Zuckerberg. Though the companies that testified today each have policies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/tiktok-expands-mental-health-resources-as-negative-reports-of-instagrams-effect-on-teens-leak/">prohibiting content</a> that promotes eating disorders, Senators cited evidence from constituents about teenagers on these platforms who have still suffered from illnesses like anorexia and bulimia.</p>
<p>&#8220;On YouTube, my office created an account as a teenager. We watched a few videos about extreme dieting and eating disorders. They were easy to find,&#8221; Senator Blumenthal (D-CT), the committee chair, said in his opening statement. He said that then, the account was fed related eating disorder content in its recommendations. &#8220;There&#8217;s no way out of this rabbit hole.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224346" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Blumenthal&#8217;s staff also found troubling content on TikTok. The Wall Street Journal conducted <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-algorithm-sex-drugs-minors-11631052944?mod=e2tw">an investigation</a> like this into the platform, creating 31 bot accounts &#8212; registered as users &#8212; between the ages of 13 and 15. The publication reported that while content glorifying eating disorders is banned on TikTok, the accounts in its investigation were still served several such videos.</p>
<p>Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) confronted Michael Beckerman, TikTok&#8217;s head of Public Policy for the Americas, asking if TikTok has stopped promoting content that glorifies eating disorders, drugs and violence to teens.</p>
<p>Beckerman noted that he doesn&#8217;t agree with the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s methodology for that experiment &#8212; the users were bots programmed to search for and linger on certain content &#8212; but affirmed that TikTok has made improvements to the way users can control the algorithm and see age-appropriate content on TikTok.</p>
<p>Beckerman said that content related to drugs violates community guidelines and that 97% of content violating policies about minor safety is removed proactively. These numbers track with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/tiktok-removed-81-million-videos-for-violations-in-q2-representing-1-of-uploads/">recently released</a> transparency report, outlining information about how content was removed on the platform between April and June 2021. Per the report, 97.6% of content violating minor safety policies were removed proactively before being reported by users, and 93.9% of those videos were removed at zero views. In the category of &#8220;suicide, self-harm and dangerous acts&#8221; &#8212; which is inclusive of content glorifying eating disorders &#8212; 94.2% were removed proactively, and 81.8% of videos had zero views.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Senator Klobuchar continued by asking Beckerman if TikTok has conducted any research about how the platform might push content promoting eating disorders to teens, and if Beckerman personally had asked for any internal studies on eating disorders before testifying. He said no to both questions, but reaffirmed that TikTok works with outside experts on these issues.</p>
<p>Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) asked each company to outline the steps each company is taking to remove &#8220;content that promotes unhealthy body image and eating disorders and direct users to supportive resources instead.&#8221; In particular, Baldwin&#8217;s question was geared toward how these companies are focusing on these issues among younger users.</p>
<p>Beckerman reiterated that TikTok &#8220;aggressively&#8221; removes content that promotes eating disorders and works with outside organizations to support users who might need help. He may have been referring to TikTok&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/tiktok-expands-mental-health-resources-as-negative-reports-of-instagrams-effect-on-teens-leak/">recent expansion</a> of its mental health resources. Right after Instagram was blasted for its harm to teen girls, TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/tiktok-expands-mental-health-resources-as-negative-reports-of-instagrams-effect-on-teens-leak/">rolled out</a> a brief memo about the impact of eating disorders in its Safety Center, developed in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1631712835680000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH_6fZatFLr2KphvOIMd5SIVjFDvQ">National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA)</a>. NEDA has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/20/over-a-year-after-new-content-policies-self-harm-social-media-still-thrives/">long track record</a> of collaborating with social media platforms and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/pinterest-updates-policy-to-prohibit-ads-promoting-weight-loss/">worked with Pinterest</a> to prohibit ads promoting weight loss this year.</p>
<p>Beckerman added that TikTok doesn&#8217;t allow ads that target people based on weight loss. The app <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/coming-together-to-support-body-positivity-on-tiktok">updated its policies</a> in September 2020 to ban ads for fasting apps and weight loss supplements, and increase restrictions on ads that promote a negative body image. This update came soon after Rolling Stone reported that TikTok was <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/what-is-intermittent-fasting-tiktok-ads-1031931/">advertising fasting apps</a> to teenage girls. Still, TikTok allows weight management product ads for users above the age of 18.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;YouTube and Snapchat were asked to defend their apps&#8217; age ratings in Senate hearing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/youtube-and-snapchat-were-asked-to-defend-their-apps-age-ratings-in-senate-hearing/embed/#?secret=3noWvgiAWa" data-secret="3noWvgiAWa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Snapchat’s Vice President of Global Public Policy Jennifer Stout answered Klobuchar&#8217;s question by saying that content promoting eating disorders violates community guidelines. Snapchat directs users who search terms like &#8220;anorexia&#8221; or &#8220;eating disorder&#8221; to expert resources that might be able to help them.</p>
<p>Per Snap&#8217;s <a href="https://snap.com/en-US/ad-policies">ad policies</a>, diet and weight loss ads aren&#8217;t banned, but certain content in that realm is. Ads can&#8217;t promote weight loss supplements, contain exaggerated or unrealistic claims, or show &#8220;before and after&#8221; pictures related to weight loss.</p>
<p>Leslie Miller, YouTube’s vice president of Government Affairs and Public Policy, also said that YouTube prohibits content glorifying eating disorders. YouTube&#8217;s ad policy says that it <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/10249050?hl=en">allows ads for weight loss</a> as long as the imagery isn&#8217;t disturbing.</p>
<p>But TikTok and YouTube&#8217;s representatives both pointed out how some users can find solace on social media, for instance, in a video about how someone overcame an eating disorder. This content can be uplifting and help teens know that they&#8217;re not alone in what they&#8217;re experiencing.</p>
<p>Miller claimed that when users search for eating disorder content, its algorithms &#8220;raise up&#8221; content that might offer positive support to someone who is struggling with an eating disorder. She said more than 90% of content that violates guidelines is spotted through technology, but human moderators contribute as well.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;In hearing with Snap, TikTok and YouTube, lawmakers tout new rules to protect kids online&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-snap-youtube-hearing-congress/embed/#?secret=pBiwZR3dLE" data-secret="pBiwZR3dLE" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Toward the end of the hearing, Senator Blumenthal circled back to the points he made in his opening statement &#8212; his office made fake TikTok accounts for teenage girls and was quickly able to find content that is supposedly banned from the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you explain to parents why TikTok is inundating their kids with these kinds of videos of suicide, self-injury and eating disorders?&#8221; Senator Blumenthal asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t speak to what the examples were from your staff, but I can assure you that&#8217;s not the normal experience that teens or people that use TikTok would get,&#8221; Beckerman said.</p>
<p>Though the representatives from TikTok, Snapchat and YouTube used their ad policy and content moderation guidelines as evidence that their companies are moving in the right direction, Senators still seemed hesitant about how cooperative the platforms would be in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-snap-youtube-hearing-congress/">passing legislation</a> to make social media safer for children.</p>
<p>As the hearing closed, Senator Blumenthal observed that he wouldn&#8217;t be taking the day&#8217;s testimony at face value. &#8220;The time for platitudes and bromides is over,&#8221; Blumenthal said.</p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/sequoia-dramatically-revamps-its-fund-structure-as-it-looks-to-rethink-venture-capital-model/"><strong>Sequoia rebuilds itself for the future of venture capital:</strong></a><strong> </strong>With capital now a commodity and nearly every VC focused on offering services, standing out is hard in the venture game. As are the harsh realities of startups staying private longer and restrictions on how venture capitalists can invest. Sequoia thinks that it has the solution.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/jessica-rosenworcel-becomes-the-first-woman-to-chair-the-fcc-and-gigi-sohn-is-nominated-for-5th-spot/">Jessica Rosenworcel to lead FCC:</a> </strong>Rosenworcel will be the first woman to ever lead the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, which is at once good news and an indictment of my nation’s governmental diversity through the years. Also, Gigi Sohn, whom TechCrunch called an “FCC veteran and tireless policy advocate,” was nominated to the group. Sohn is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/05/top-fcc-lawyer-agency-will-win-inevitable-legal-fight-over-net-neutrality/">well known for her work on net neutrality</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/heavily-vc-backed-salad-chain-sweetgreen-heads-toward-public-markets/">Inside the Sweetgreen IPO filing:</a></strong> Heavily VC-backed fast-casual food chain Sweetgreen is going public, so TechCrunch spent time mucking about in its numbers. Our takeaway is that the company has identified a notable portion of the economy where it can plug a need, but that it loses too much money.</li>
<li><em>By the time this newsletter reaches your inbox, Rent the Runway should have priced its IPO. Our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/what-rent-the-runways-ipo-filing-says-about-the-business-of-loaner-garments/">initial notes concerning its business are here</a>; more in the a.m.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>We have a <em>lot</em> of startup news to chat about today, but first, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/from-the-american-heartland-a-startup-boom/">TechCrunch dug into the American Midwest yet again this morning</a>, this time asking CEOs and investors in the region what impact the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">fundraising boom</a> and increasingly flat global talent and capital market are having on area startups.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/dehaat-raises-115-million-in-the-largest-agritech-round-in-india/"><strong>Indian AgTech accelerates:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Sure, it seems that every day another Indian startup raises a nine-figure round. But this time it’s DeHaat, which focuses on agriculture, catching my eye. Per TechCrunch, the company built “an online platform that offers full-stack agricultural services to farmers in India.” Given how many farmers its market includes, DeHaat should not lack for TAM.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/gusto-buys-remoteteam-com-in-bid-to-support-more-international-hiring/"><strong>Gusto buys RemoteTeam:</strong></a> U.S. HR and payroll-focused startup Gusto bought another company, it announced this morning. With an eye on supporting more international hiring, it picked up RemoteTeam. The increasingly global and distributed tech talent pool likely helped pull Gusto in this particular direction.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiger-and-falcon-look-to-double-down-on-indian-social-commerce-startup-dealshare/"><strong>DealShare set to raise more capital:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Returning to India, TechCrunch can report from several sources that “Tiger Global and Falcon Edge Capital are looking to double down on their bets on DealShare,” perhaps putting more than $225 million into the company at a unicorn valuation. DealShare exists in the social commerce space, in case you were wondering.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/logicbroker-taps-into-135m-to-advance-cloud-based-drop-ship-software/"><strong>How often do we get to talk about startups from Connecticut?</strong></a><strong> </strong>Not very often. But today was a nice exception with LogicBroker raising $135 million in a single go. The startup builds software for the shipping world (think e-commerce and drop-shipping) and now certainly has as much capital as it could have dreamed about at its fingertips. Good on the Nutmeg State.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/piiano-raises-9m-to-help-businesses-protect-their-pii/"><strong>Piiano raises $9M to help keep PII safe:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Get it? <em>PII</em>-ano wants to help you keep PII, or <em>personally identifying information</em>, safe. The company likely competes with Skyflow, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/skyflows-data-privacy-api-business-raises-45m-series-b/">raised a bunch of money just the other week</a>. The market for data protection services is hot and potentially lucrative given that there is lots of data in the world, and that leaking it is bad. (Note that this is not Piano, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/piano-raises-88m-for-analytics-subscription-and-personalization-tools-for-publishers-adds-linkedin-as-investor/">the subscription media software startup</a>.)</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/softbank-bets-big-on-pipefy-which-just-raised-75m-for-its-low-code-workflow-management-tool/"><strong>SoftBank backs Pipefy:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Gone are the days when SoftBank would drop a flat trilly on a dog-walking startup or zero-gravity pinball maker. Instead, the Japanese telco, conglomerate and frenetic technology investor has put $75 million into a low-code workflow management startup. How very pedestrian!</li>
</ul>
<p>And there was so much more. Fabric <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/fabric-200-million-robotics-fulfillment-e-commerce/">raised $200 million</a> so that robots can help with e-commerce order fulfillment. Indian busing startup Chalo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/chalo-acquires-amazon-backed-bus-aggregator-shuttl/">bought another bus-focused startup</a>. Jay-Z’s venture capital firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/marcy-venture-partners-cofounded-by-jay-z-just-closed-its-second-fund-with-325-million/">just closed its second fund</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/market-demand-for-cybsersecurity-products-helps-devo-raises-250m-at-unicorn-valuation/">Devo raised $250 million</a> on the back of rising global cybersecurity spend.</p>
<p>To close us out, TechCrunch has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/inside-realms-of-ruin-ya-novelists-failed-nft-project/">great story on what happens when you mix fiction, community, NFTs and copyright questions</a>.</p>

<p>Keeping a company’s security measures up to the mark while getting all stakeholders to implement safe security practices is a tall order, complicated by the fact that many CISOs aren’t inside the executive decision-making loop.</p>
<p>According to Sean McDermott, founder and CEO of RedMonocle, CISOs should meet executives where they are.</p>
<p>“You already know why cybersecurity investment is essential to your role. Now step into your leadership’s shoes to explain why it’s crucial to theirs,” he writes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Land Rover plans to add an all-electric Range Rover to its lineup in 2024, the brand said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The announcement was made alongside its reveal of the 2022 Range Rover, the redesigned fifth generation of its luxury SUV that is loaded with tech, features an electrical architecture to support over-the-air software updates and sits on a new flexible architecture that will be the basis of the brand&#8217;s future models, including plug-in hybrid and electric variants.</p>
<p>Land Rover didn&#8217;t disclose many details about this upcoming EV. Although a close watcher of its parent company, Jaguar Land Rover might have seen this coming. JLR said<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/every-jaguar-and-land-rover-vehicle-from-2020-on-will-have-an-electric-option/"> back in 2017</a> that all new vehicles in both the Jaguar and Land Rover brands would offer an electric or hybrid option from 2020 on.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224393" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The 2022 Range Rover will be offered in a mild hybrid variant and a plug-in hybrid version of the new Range Rover is coming in 2023, according to Land Rover.</p>
<p>The extended-range plug-in hybrid set for 2023 will be outfitted with an inline six-cylinder engine with 48-volt mild hybrid technology, a 105 kW electric motor and a 38.2 kWh lithium-ion battery that has a usable capacity of 31.8 kWh. This combo will provide up to 62 miles of pure EV range and have 434 horsepower.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2224463" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Range-Rover-plug-in-hybrid-electric-SUV-2023.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2224463" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2224463 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Range-Rover-plug-in-hybrid-electric-SUV-2023.jpg" alt="Range Rover plug in hybrid electric SUV 2023" width="2000" height="1373" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Range-Rover-plug-in-hybrid-electric-SUV-2023.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Range-Rover-plug-in-hybrid-electric-SUV-2023.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Range-Rover-plug-in-hybrid-electric-SUV-2023.jpg?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Range-Rover-plug-in-hybrid-electric-SUV-2023.jpg?resize=768,527 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Range-Rover-plug-in-hybrid-electric-SUV-2023.jpg?resize=680,467 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Range-Rover-plug-in-hybrid-electric-SUV-2023.jpg?resize=1536,1054 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Range-Rover-plug-in-hybrid-electric-SUV-2023.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2224463" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Land Rover</p></div></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As for the 2022 Range Rover, the new SUV will be offered in an array of variants with standard and long wheelbase body designs, six- and eight-cylinder powertrains and seating options.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It all starts with the Range Rover P400 SE, a mild hybrid with a 3.0L turbocharged engine that produces 395 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque and has a base price of $104,000, not including taxes or the $1,350 destination fee. The 2022 Range Rover lineup tops out with the P530 First Edition, a long wheelbase body design with a 4.4L twin turbocharged V8 that produces 523 hp and 553 lb-ft of torque and starts at $163,500 (again not including taxes and fees).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Other notable techy type highlights in the 2022 Range Rover include a new electrical vehicle architecture, called internally EVA 2.0, that will allow the company to communicate wirelessly with more than 70 electronic modules, according to Land Rover. What this means is that Land Rover should be able to add features such as a new app or make improvements to existing functions on the vehicle&#8217;s infotainment system through a software update. That&#8217;s an important feature for any automaker hoping to keep up with these tech-centric times.</p>
<p>The 2022 Range Rover will come with Amazon Alexa as the integrated voice assistant that can provide news updates, access the driver&#8217;s calendar, control some vehicle functions as well as turn on lights at home and connect with other Alexa-enabled devices.</p>
<p>Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, the in-car platform that brings the look and functions of a smartphone to the vehicle’s central screen, will also be offered in the vehicle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple News is <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-news-expands-local-news-offerings/">expanding</a> its local news coverage to Charlotte, Miami and Washington, D.C. Local news coverage will give users access to numerous publications such as Axios Charlotte, the Charlotte Observer, Eater Miami, the Miami Herald, DCist, Washingtonian, the Washington Post and more.</p>
<p>Each local news experience is curated by Apple News editors and features coverage about topics ranging from restaurant openings and real estate trends to big policy decisions.</p>
<p>Apple News first launched curated local news experiences for the Bay Area, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco last year. Earlier this year, Apple expanded the local news feature to additional U.S. cities, including Sacramento, San Antonio, and San Diego.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224410" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Apple says it plans to expand its local news feature to more cities in the future. It&#8217;s clear that the tech giant is looking to further compete with other news aggregator services such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/flipboard-local-1000/">Flipboard</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/03/smartnews-local-news-feature-now-covers-more-than-6000-u-s-cities/">SmartNews</a>, which offer local news coverage in thousands of U.S. cities.</p>
<p>The Apple News local coverage expansion comes as Apple is expanding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/apple-launches-fitness-group-workouts-powered-by-shareplay/">Fitness+</a> and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/apple-ones-premier-subscription-tier-is-rolling-out-in-17-new-countries-on-november-3/">Apple One Premier</a> subscription bundle to 17 more countries on November 3rd. The countries include Austria, Brazil, Colombia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The two companies put up solid growth numbers, made a zillion dollars between them and spent a collected $23.5 million on shareholder-friendly activities. It's a good time to be a tech giant.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Helping power the global boom in startup investment is a huge &#8212; and growing &#8212; demand for digital products and services. The same tailwinds that are bolstering smaller tech companies, it turns out, are also powering the giants.</p>
<p>On the heels of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/facebooks-next-chapter-just-might-make-sense/">weak Q4 growth forecast from social giant Snap</a> and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/facebook-reports-revenue-miss-plans-to-break-out-ar-vr-top-lines/">revenue miss from social titan Facebook</a>, you would have been forgiven if you had low expectations for other Big Tech firms.</p>
<p>Today, however, pushing back against what could have been construed as a budding narrative, both Microsoft and Alphabet &#8212; Google&#8217;s parent company &#8212; smashed revenue expectations.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224369" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Here are the numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft revenue expectation: $43.97 billion (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT/analysis?p=MSFT">Yahoo Finance</a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2022-q1/press-release-webcast">Actual Microsoft revenues</a>: $45.32 billion, +22% year over year.</li>
<li>Alphabet revenue expectation: $63.45 billion (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/analysis?p=GOOG">Yahoo Finance</a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2021Q3_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=f1ba3f6">Actual Alphabet revenues</a>: $65.12 billion, +41% year over year.</li>
</ul>
<p>In after-hours trading, shares of Microsoft are up 1%, while shares of Alphabet are down a fraction.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s much more to each report, of course. Alphabet and Microsoft are more akin to corporate empires than mere companies. Let&#8217;s take a quick look at each for more context.</p>
<h2>Microsoft&#8217;s Q1 fiscal 2022</h2>
<p>The key number from Microsoft&#8217;s blizzard of metrics is the growth of its public cloud business, Azure. That revenue source grew 50% on a year-over-year basis, or 48% in constant-currency terms. More simply, Azure got a modest lift from currency fluctuations that boosted its growth rate by a hair.</p>
<p>Regardless of that nuance, Azure growth has stuck around the 50% mark for some time now, which implies pretty big numbers being added to Microsoft&#8217;s aggregate top line from the product.</p>
<p>Other numbers that stood out to us in our perusal of Microsoft&#8217;s earnings were search and news advertising revenues rising 40% on a year-over-year basis. That figure is adjusted to remove traffic acquisition costs, something that Alphabet also does and is a pretty fair adjustment. In less good news, Surface revenues fell 17%, though with new hardware on the way, that could be set for a turnaround.</p>
<p>From the subscription side of things, the Microsoft picture is somewhat mixed. Business revenues for Office 365 grew by 23% on a year-over-year basis, while consumer incomes from the same product line were up a smaller 10%. Finally, LinkedIn revenues rose 42%, which feels pretty strong for the Microsoft tuck-in.</p>
<h2>Alphabet&#8217;s Q3 2021</h2>
<p>Something nice about Alphabet is that its financial results are short enough to include here. Observe:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2224376" style="width: 697px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2224376" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2224376 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-26-at-4.27.00-PM.png" alt="" width="687" height="228" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-26-at-4.27.00-PM.png 687w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-26-at-4.27.00-PM.png?resize=150,50 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-26-at-4.27.00-PM.png?resize=300,100 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-26-at-4.27.00-PM.png?resize=680,226 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-26-at-4.27.00-PM.png?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2224376" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Alphabet earnings release</p></div></p>
<p>YouTube&#8217;s revenue growth remains astounding, now that the company has broken out that particular line item. Recall that Google took more of a hit in 2020 than some tech giants as demand for search ads dipped when everyone suddenly stayed home due to the COVID-19 pandemic; Google was not alone in seeing that drop &#8212; other search products were impacted.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/26/alphabet-goog-earnings-q3-2021.html">CNBC&#8217;s collection of street estimates</a>, Google Cloud missed growth targets in the quarter: $5.07 billion was expected, meaning that despite its growth rate, Mountain View&#8217;s cloud bucket was smaller at the end of Q3 than investors had anticipated.</p>
<p>Other Bets putting up a small revenue gain is nice to see, though the group&#8217;s operating losses scaled during the quarter. The skunkworks collective posted an operating loss of $1.29 billion, up from $1.10 billion in the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>Avoiding showering you in 1,000 more words of financial nuance, the two Big Tech companies put up solid growth numbers, made a zillion dollars between them and spent a collected $23.5 million on shareholder-friendly activities including share buybacks and dividends. It&#8217;s a good time to be a tech giant.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Healthcare spending accounts for almost 18% of U.S. GDP, so it’s no surprise that digital health is attracting record levels of investment. This year, VCs have flowed $14.7 billion to health tech startups, compared to $14.6 billion in all of 2020.</p>
<p>Given the high cost of care in the United States compared to other nations, pairing fintech with health tech is just good business.</p>
<p>Simon Wu, an investment director with Cathay Innovation, says <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/fintechs-growing-role-in-the-healthcare-revolution/">he’s paying particularly close attention to these areas of convergence</a>:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224203" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>Data and the transition to value-based care.</li>
<li>Gamifying consumer wellness to stave off chronic illnesses.</li>
<li>Fintech for affordability and reducing friction.</li>

<p>Since the U.S. Congress passed a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package this year that increased funding for affordable healthcare, Wu says opportunities are expanding for startups in this space.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re only in the early innings of a digital-first revolution in healthcare, but the convergence of health and fintech will be an important catalyst to address some of the most pressing issues facing healthcare today,&#8221; according to Wu.</p>
<p>&#8220;A modern financial consumer experience can help build relationships and trust between patients, providers and payers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rising tide of venture capital that has lifted startups around the world also splashed over America&#8217;s Midwest this year.</p>
<p>Regions like Denver and Chicago &#8220;are crushing their 2020 venture capital tallies, results that were at times already at or near record highs,&#8221; report Anna Heim and Alex Wilhelm in today&#8217;s edition of The Exchange.</p>

<p>Soon after the pandemic hit, the U.S. residential housing market became feverish as well.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Overbidding and speedy closings became the norm, often facilitated by the speed and convenience offered by proptech companies that helped sellers cash out quickly so they could get into their next homes.</p>
<p>But shares in Zillow fell 10% last week after the company said it would pause buying houses for the rest of the year. Not long after, one of its chief rivals clapped back by announcing that &#8220;OpenDoor is open for business and continues to scale and grow,” reports Ryan Lawler.</p>
<p>He interviewed OpenDoor CTO Ian Wong and Chief Customer Officer Megan Meyer Toolson to learn more about their plans to grow in a market that&#8217;s facing acute labor and supply constraints.</p>
<p>“The last 18 months have been a very dynamic time for the housing market, to say the very least. So we’ve had to be very competitive since things are so dynamic and price appreciation has been very strong,” Wong said.</p>

<p>On a good day, most people forget the chief information security officer even exists. But if something should go wrong, everyone will demand answers.</p>
<p>Keeping a company&#8217;s security measures up to the mark while getting all stakeholders to implement safe security practices is a tall order, complicated by the fact that many CISOs aren&#8217;t inside the executive decision-making loop.</p>
<p>According to Sean McDermott, founder and CEO of RedMonocle, CISOs should meet executives where they are.</p>
<p>&#8220;You already know why cybersecurity investment is essential to your role. Now step into your leadership’s shoes to explain why it’s crucial to theirs,&#8221; he writes.</p>

<p>When Lunchclub, a social platform that helps people find new connections in specific industries, launched its fireside chats service last year, it immediately found itself the subject of a lot of interest.</p>
<p>So much so, Lightspeed Ventures handed the startup a term sheet even though its founders weren&#8217;t looking to raise.</p>
<p>In the latest TechCrunch Live episode, Lunchclub co-founder Vlad Novakovski and Lightspeed’s Nicole Quinn broke down its Series A deck, Lightspeed&#8217;s investment thesis and how having a strong investor network makes the difference between a successful raise and a dud.</p>
<p>“Consumer feedback is everything to us,” said Quinn. “It is the number one most important thing that I’m looking for in a slide deck and a conversation. I want to know, do customers love this?”</p>

<p>Snap Inc.&#8217;s Q3 results last week sent its stock tumbling, but it wasn&#8217;t alone: Apple&#8217;s iOS 15 privacy implementation disrupted ad tracking and measurement for social media and advertising platforms across the board.</p>
<p>This potential volatility in ad revenue might have something to do with Facebook&#8217;s metaverse focus, notes Alex Wilhelm. Is Zuckerberg planning to shore up losses with a leap into VR?</p>
<p>&#8220;Something <em>else</em> will have to fill the void,&#8221; writes Alex. &#8220;The company’s rebrand fits neatly into that sort of push.&#8221;</p>

<p>While it was not a unicorn when it last raised capital, NYC-based customer engagement software startup Braze may just crash through the $1 billion valuation mark when it finally goes public.</p>
<p>As per Alex Wilhelm&#8217;s initial read of the startup&#8217;s fresh, new S-1 filing, Braze seems to have a decent business with growing revenue (albeit with costs rising faster than profits), good retention with a focus on larger clients and a strong subscription business.</p>
<p>&#8220;To sum up: Braze is growing nicely at scale with modest net losses and no smokescreen-y, fake profit numbers on display,&#8221; Alex writes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube and Snapchat were asked by lawmakers to defend whether or not their respective social media apps were appropriately rated on the U.S. app stores, given the nature of the content they hosted. In a line of questioning led by Senator Mike Lee (R-UT), Snap was given specific examples of the types of content found on its app that seemed to be inappropriate for younger teens. Both companies were also asked to explain why their app would be rated for different age groups on the different app stores.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.youtube&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">YouTube app on the Google Play Store</a> is rated &#8220;<a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/6209544?p=appgame_ratings&amp;visit_id=637708704885448608-3284839682&amp;rd=1#zippy=%2Cnorth-south-america">Teen</a>,&#8221; meaning its content is appropriate for ages 13 and up, while the same <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/youtube-watch-listen-stream/id544007664">app on Apple&#8217;s App Store</a> is rated &#8220;17+,&#8221; meaning the content is only appropriate for users ages 17 and up, the senator pointed out.</p>
<p>Leslie Miller, YouTube&#8217;s Vice President of Government Affairs and Public Policy, who attended the hearing on behalf of YouTube, responded that she was &#8220;unfamiliar with the differences&#8221; the senator had just outlined with his question.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224288" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Snapchat&#8217;s Vice President of Global Public Policy Jennifer Stout, also wasn&#8217;t sure about the discrepancy when asked the same question.</p>
<p>In Snapchat&#8217;s case, the app is rated 12 and up on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snapchat/id447188370">Apple App Store</a> but is rated &#8220;Teen&#8221; (13 and up) <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.snapchat.android&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">on the Google Play Store</a>. She said she believed it was because Snapchat&#8217;s content was deemed &#8220;appropriate for an age group of 13 and above.&#8221;</p>
<p>The inconsistency with app ratings can make it hard for a parent to decide if an app is, in fact, appropriate for their kids, based on how strict their own household rules are on this sort of thing. But the issue ultimately comes down to each platform having <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/06/29/heres-how-iphone-app-store-ratings-work-hint-they-dont/">different</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/28/google-play-gets-more-family-friendly-with-content-ratings-filtering-by-age-and-interest/">policies</a> around app ratings. And because the app stores&#8217; ratings aren&#8217;t necessarily consistent with similar ratings across other industries, like film and TV, parents today will often look to third-party resources, like <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/">Common Sense Media</a>, <a href="https://coronadotimes.com/news/2021/10/26/youre-not-alone-practical-tips-on-managing-your-childs-social-media-usage/">news articles</a>, <a href="https://www.internetmatters.org/resources/apps-guide/">online guides</a>, or even anecdotal advice, when deciding whether or not to let their kids use a certain app.</p>
<p>Lee pushed on this point with Snapchat, in particular. He said his staff entered a name, birth date, and email to create a test account for a 15-year old child. They didn&#8217;t add any further content preferences for the account.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;When they opened the Discover page on Snapchat with its default settings, they were immediately bombarded with content that I can most politely describe as wildly inappropriate for a child, including recommendations for, among other things, an invite to play an online sexualized video game that&#8217;s marketed itself to people who are 18 and up; tips on quote, &#8216;why you shouldn&#8217;t go to bars alone;&#8217; notices for video games that are rated for ages 17 and up; and articles about porn stars,&#8221; said Lee.</p>
<p>He wanted to know how Snap determined this content was appropriate for younger teens, as per the app&#8217;s rating on the app stores.</p>
<p>Stout responded by saying that Snapchat&#8217;s Discover section was a closed platform where the company chooses the publishers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do select &#8212; and hand-select &#8212; partners that we work with. And that kind of content is designed to appear on Discover and resonate with an audience that is 13 and above,&#8221; she explained. Stout also seemed surprised that Discover would include the sort of inappropriate content the senator described. &#8220;I want to make clear that content and community guidelines suggest that any online sexual video games should be age-gated to 18 and above,&#8221; Stout said, adding that she was &#8220;unclear&#8221; why they would display by default for a younger user by default.</p>
<p>She went on to note that Snap&#8217;s publisher guidelines indicate the content must be accurate and fact-checked.</p>
<p>Lee&#8217;s response indicated he thought she was missing the point.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure the articles about the porn stars were accurate and fact-checked,&#8221; he barked back. &#8220;And I&#8217;m sure that the tips on why you shouldn&#8217;t go to bars alone are accurate and fact-checked, but that&#8217;s not my question. It&#8217;s about whether it&#8217;s appropriate for children ages 13 and up as you certified,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The senator&#8217;s questions harken back to the ongoing <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/anxious-parents-creating-moral-panic-over-social-media-602tfmxx0">moral panics from parents</a> over teens&#8217; use of social media &#8212; panics that have particularly impacted Snapchat <a href="https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/06/disruptions-indiscreet-photos-glimpsed-then-gone/">with its ephemerality primed for teenage sexting</a>.</p>
<p>However, the backlash over inappropriate Discover content actually spurred Snapchat to take action in the past &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/snap-overtakes-its-ipo-debut-price/">ahead of its IPO</a>, of course.</p>
<p>The company in 2017 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/technology/snapchat-discover-takes-a-hard-line-on-misleading-and-explicit-images.html">said it would begin to take a harder line</a> on the sort of risqué and misleading images that had overrun the Discover section by implementing an updated set of publisher guidelines, which Stout also referenced during the hearing. But user reviews of the app in the years that followed have pointed out that Snapchat&#8217;s news section is filled with, as some young people described it: <a href="https://studybreaks.com/tvfilm/snapchat-discover-page/">&#8220;cringe-worthy content&#8221; and &#8220;nonsense,&#8221;</a> or &#8220;<a href="https://www.breezejmu.org/opinion/opinion-snapchat-s-discover-page-is-terrible/article_02c9733c-3a44-11eb-ace9-7bff7041b6fa.html">gossip, sex, and drugs</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The page is driven by clickbait, reality television news, and influencer fodder, with a smattering of TV networks and reputable news publishers, including ESPN, the Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal,&#8221; <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22519100/snapchat-spotlight-forgotten-gen-z">a Vox report stated</a> in June 2021. &#8220;Users complain that they’re frequently served tabloid-like content about influencers they don’t care about, or nonsensical clickbait that is best described as &#8216;internet garbage,'&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>This is likely the sort of content the senator&#8217;s team stumbled upon, too.</p>
<p>Of course, Snap has the right to curate whatever sort of publisher content it wants to &#8212; but there is a question here as to how well it&#8217;s actually curating and age-gating the content when it comes to its younger teenage users and whether that&#8217;s something that should be better regulated by law, not just left to the companies themselves to police.</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of oversight do you conduct on this?,&#8221; Lee wanted to know about Snap&#8217;s curation of Discover.</p>
<p>&#8220;We use a variety of human review as well as automated review,&#8221; said Stout, adding that Snap would be interested in talking to his staff to find out what sort of content they saw that violated its guidelines.</p>
<p>(As an aside, reporters know well how this is often the response a big tech company will give when confronted with a direct example of something that contradicts their guidelines. They want the journalists to do the moderation work for them by itemizing the specific issues. They&#8217;ll then follow through and block or remove the violating pieces in question while downplaying the examples as a one-off they just missed by accident &#8212; instead of acknowledging this could be an example of a systemic problem. That&#8217;s not to say this is the situation with Snap, per se, but the tactic of acting shocked and surprised then demanding to know the examples is a familiar one.)</p>
<p>&#8220;While I would agree with you tastes vary when it comes to the kind of content that is promoted on Discover, there is no content there that is illegal. There is no content there that is hurtful,&#8221; Stout stated.</p>
<p>But Lee, whose questions mirror those from parents who believe age-inappropriate content is, in fact, hurtful, would likely disagree with that assessment.</p>
<p>&#8220;These app ratings are inappropriate,&#8221; Lee concluded. &#8220;We all know there&#8217;s content on Snapchat and on YouTube, among many other places, that&#8217;s not appropriate for children ages 12 or 13 and up.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a separate line of questing led by Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Snap was also pressed on whether or not advertisers in Snapchat Discover understood what sort of content they&#8217;re being placed next to.</p>
<p>Stout said they did.</p>
<p>TikTok was not questioned by Lee on the nature of its content or app store age rating, but later in the hearing did note, in response to Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), that its content for younger users was curated with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/">help from Common Sense Networks</a> and is &#8220;an age-appropriate experience.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AI and big data are an important part of most enterprise-scale companies now, but that very scale can make it difficult to employ them safely and ethically. Kathy Baxter at Salesforce and Nashlie Sephus at AWS have made ethical AI and data collection their business over the last few years, both sounding the alarm on machine bias and prescribing solutions for it. They&#8217;ll discuss the growing need for work like theirs at the highest levels of business tech at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-saas-2021/?utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=saas2021&amp;utm_content=kathyandamazonpost&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=kathyandamazonpost&amp;display=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TC Sessions: SaaS</a> on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dr. Sephus, applied science manager for Amazon Artificial Intelligence, focuses on fairness and the detection of biases in data and machine learning models. She worked her way up through the company after it acquired the startup she worked at — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/09/08/partpic-makes-it-easier-to-find-repair-parts-for-your-whozits-whatsits-and-more/">Battlefield alumnus Partpic</a>. Now in addition to acting as an ethics evangelist and working with various teams to ensure AI models and databases are being deployed right, she leads The Bean Path, a non-profit in her native Jackson, Mississippi where she helps the new generation of tech workers get the training they need to compete.</p>
<p>Baxter came to Salesforce by way of Google, eBay and Oracle, where she worked for years in user experience research. Once at the enterprise giant she was among the earliest to recognize the risks of systematic bias in a company preparing to integrate AI at a fundamental level. She sought and got buy-in from CEO and founder Marc Benioff to lead an Ethical AI Practice team, performing in both a research and advisory role on matters of fair and equitable use of data and machine learning models. (If you want a top-level primer, check out the <a href="https://einstein.ai/static/ethics/EthicalAIMaturityModel.pdf">Maturity Model</a> linked <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/salesforce-debuts-ai-ethics-model-how-ethical-practices-further-responsible-artificial-intelligence/">at the bottom of this post</a>.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223613" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The two experts will be discussing why and how companies should develop ethical AI practices and the ways in which the enterprise and AI worlds are learning to embrace and internalize them. If your company is thinking of putting AI to work in a big way — and what company isn&#8217;t? — you owe it to yourself to hear what they have to say.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the day to hear from these amazing speakers!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Speech recognition has gone from convenient to crucial over the last few years as smart speakers and driving assist modes have taken off — but not everyone&#8217;s voice is recognized equally well. Speechmatics claims to have the most inclusive and accurate model out there, beating Amazon, Google and others when it comes to speech outside of the most common American accents.</p>
<p>The company explained that it was guided toward the question of accuracy by a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/14/7684">2019 Stanford study entitled &#8220;Racial Disparities on Speech Recognition,&#8221;</a> which found exactly that. Speech engines from Amazon, Apple, Google, IBM and Microsoft &#8220;exhibited substantial racial disparities, with an average word error rate (WER) of 0.35 for black speakers compared with 0.19 for white speakers.&#8221; Not great!</p>
<p>The source of this disparity may be partly attributed to a lack of diversity in the datasets used to train these systems. After all, if there are few black speakers in the data, the model will not learn those speech patterns as well. The same may be said for speakers with other accents, dialects, and so on — America (let alone the U.K.) is full of accents and any company claiming to make services for &#8220;everyone&#8221; should be aware of that.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224265" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At any rate, U.K.-based Speechmatics made accuracy in transcribing accented English a priority for its latest model, and it claims to have blown the others out of the water. Based on the same data sets used in the Stanford study (but using the latest versions of the speech software), &#8220;Speechmatics recorded an overall accuracy of 82.8% for African American voices compared to Google (68.7%) and Amazon (68.6%),&#8221; <a href="https://www.speechmatics.com/news/breakthrough-ai-bias-inclusion/">the company wrote in its press release</a>.</p>
<p>The company credits this success to a relatively new approach to creating a speech recognition model. Traditionally, the machine learning system is provided with labeled data — think an audio file of speech with an accompanying metadata or text file that has what&#8217;s being said, usually transcribed and checked by humans. For a cat detection algorithm you&#8217;d have images and data saying which ones contain cats, where the cat is in each picture, and so on. This is <em>supervised</em> learning, where a model learns correlations between two forms of prepared data.</p>
<p>Speechmatics used <em>self-supervised </em>learning, a method that&#8217;s gained steam in recent years as datasets, learning efficiency, and computational power have grown. In addition to labeled data, it uses raw, unlabeled data and much more of it, building its own &#8220;understanding&#8221; of speech with far less guidance.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Computer vision inches toward &#8216;common sense&#8217; with Facebook&#8217;s latest research&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/computer-vision-inches-towards-common-sense-with-facebooks-latest-research/embed/#?secret=v6u3Kozxsa" data-secret="v6u3Kozxsa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In this case the model was based on about 30,000 hours of labeled data to get a sort of base level of understanding, then was fed 1.1 million hours of publicly available audio sourced from YouTube, podcasts and other content. This type of collection is a bit of a grey area, since no one explicitly consented to have their podcast used to train someone&#8217;s commercial speech recognition engine. But it&#8217;s being used that way by many, just as &#8220;the entire internet&#8221; was used to train OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-3, probably including thousands of my own articles. (Though it has yet to master my unique voice.)</p>
<p>In addition to improving accuracy for Black American speakers, the Speechmatics model claims better transcription for children (about 92% accurate versus about 83% in Google and Deepgram) and small but significant improvements in English with accents from around the world: Indian, Filipino, Southern African and many others — even Scottish.</p>
<p>They support dozens of other languages and are competitive in many of them, as well; this isn&#8217;t just an English recognition model, but given the language&#8217;s use as a lingua franca (a hilariously inapt idiom nowadays), accents are especially important to it.</p>
<p>Speechmatics may be ahead in the metrics it cites, but the AI world moves at an incredibly rapid clip and I would not be surprised to see further leapfrogging over the next year. Google, for instance, is hard at work on making sure its engines work for people with impaired speech. Inclusion is an important part of all AI work these days and it&#8217;s good to see companies trying to outdo each other in it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fallout from revelations around <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-wsj-teen-girls/">teen mental health on Instagram</a> continues — and not just for Facebook. On Tuesday, policy reps from YouTube, Snap and TikTok faced Congress to talk about kids and online safety, marking the first time the latter two companies appeared in a major tech hearing.</p>
<p>The hearing, held by the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security, managed to stay on topic about half of the time. The committee’s Republican members were keen to steer their rare time with a TikTok executive toward questions about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-dodges-questions-about-biometric-data-collection-in-senate-hearing/">privacy concerns</a> over the company’s relationship with the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Diversions notwithstanding, a few of the hearing’s more useful moments saw the three policy leads pressed to answer yes/no questions about specific policy proposals crawling through Congress. The hearing featured testimony from Snap VP of Global Public Policy Jennifer Stout, TikTok’s VP and Head of Public Policy Michael Beckerman and Leslie Miller, who leads government affairs and public policy at YouTube.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224314" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Both YouTube and TikTok called for the U.S. to create comprehensive laws around online privacy, with Beckerman deeming a legal framework for national privacy laws “overdue.” All three companies agreed that parents should have the ability to erase all online data for their children or teens, with Stout pointing out that Snapchat data disappears by design. Still, Snapchat’s own privacy page mentions that the company retains location data for “different lengths of time based on how precise it is and which services you use.”</p>
<p>Senator Ed Markey (D-MA), himself an unlikely TikTok sensation, pushed for what he calls a kids’ “privacy bill of rights for the 21st century” during the hearing. Markey pointed to his proposed changes to the <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-and-cassidy-propose-bipartisan-bill-to-update-childrens-online-privacy-rules">Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</a> that would bolster protections for young social media users. That legislation would ban tech companies from collecting the data of users between 13 and 15-years-old without explicit consent, implement an “eraser button” that would make it easy to delete minors’ personal data and more broadly restrict the kind of information that social media platforms can collect to begin with.</p>
<p>Markey pressed each company rep on if they would support the COPPA changes. Speaking for TikTok, Beckerman said the company does support the proposal but views a standard method for platforms to verify the age of their users as just as essential, if not more so.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is what drives us crazy. Big Tech always says, “we want to talk, we want to talk, we want to talk.” Meanwhile they continue to profit from preying on kids and teens. This is a crisis. We need strong children’s privacy legislation NOW. <a href="https://t.co/PI92ba8kjX">pic.twitter.com/PI92ba8kjX</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Ed Markey (@SenMarkey) <a href="https://twitter.com/SenMarkey/status/1453056248807673861?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 26, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Snap wouldn’t commit to the COPPA proposal, and Markey derided Stout for playing “the old game” of tech companies refusing to commit to specifics. YouTube, which was slammed with a historic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/09/youtube-asks-the-ftc-to-clarify-how-video-creators-should-comply-with-coppa-ruling/">$170 million FTC fine for COPPA violations in the past</a>, didn’t explicitly commit to anything but pointed to “constructive” talks the company has had with Markey’s staff.</p>
<p>In the hearing, Markey and Blumenthal also highlighted their<a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senators-markey-and-blumenthal-rep-castor-reintroduce-legislation-to-protect-children-and-teens-from-online-manipulation-and-harm"> reintroduction of the KIDS (Kids Internet Design and Safety) Act</a> last month. That bill would protect online users under 16 from engagement-juicing features like autoplay, push alerts and like buttons. It would also ban influencer marketing to kids under 16 and force platforms to create a reporting system for the instances in which they serve harmful content to young users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In its first-ever Congressional hearing, TikTok successfully dodged questions about what it plans to do with the biometric data <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/tiktok-just-gave-itself-permission-to-collect-biometric-data-on-u-s-users-including-faceprints-and-voiceprints/">its privacy policy permits it to collect</a> on the app&#8217;s U.S. users. In an update to the company&#8217;s U.S. privacy policy in June, TikTok added a new section that noted the app &#8220;may collect biometric identifiers and biometric information&#8221; from its users’ content, including things like &#8220;faceprints and voiceprints.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company was questioned by multiple lawmakers on this matter today during a hearing conducted by the <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security. The hearing was meant to be focused on social media&#8217;s detrimental impacts on children and teens, but often expanded into broader areas of concern, as the lawmakers dug into the business models, internal research, and policies being made at Snap, TikTok and YouTube. </span></p>
<p>Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) asked specifically why TikTok needed to collect a wide variety of biometric data, &#8220;such as faceprints, voiceprints, geolocation information, browsing and search history,&#8221; as well as &#8220;keystroke patterns and rhythms.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224091" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Instead of directly answering the question, TikTok’s VP and Head of Public Policy Michael Beckerman responded by pointing out that many outside researchers and experts have looked at its policy and found that TikTok actually collects less data than many of its social media peers. (He also later clarified in another round of questioning that keystroke patterns were collected in order to prevent spam bots from infiltrating the service.)</p>
<p>Blackburn pressed on to ask if TikTok was putting together a comprehensive profile &#8212; or &#8220;virtual dossier&#8221; &#8212; on each of its users, including younger kids and teens, which included their biometric data combined with their interests and search history.</p>
<p>Beckerman deferred answering this question as well, saying that: &#8220;TikTok is an entertainment platform where people watch and enjoy and create short-form videos. It&#8217;s about uplifting, entertaining content.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the senator&#8217;s line of questioning was a bit confusing at times &#8212; she once referred to this dossier as a &#8220;virtual you,&#8221; for example &#8212; it&#8217;s worth noting that we don&#8217;t have a full picture today as to what TikTok is doing with the data it collects from its users outside of what&#8217;s outlined in its privacy policy and, per <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/how-tiktok-recommends-videos-for-you">TikTok&#8217;s 2020 blog post</a>, how some of that data plays a role <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/tiktok-explains-how-the-recommendation-system-behind-its-for-you-feed-works/">in its recommendation algorithms.</a> And given the chance to set the record straight over its plans to collect biometric data with regard to minor users, TikTok&#8217;s policy head skirted the questions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a line of follow-ups on its data collection practices led by Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Beckerman was asked if this sort of &#8220;mass data collection&#8221; was necessary to deliver a high-quality experience to TikTok&#8217;s users. She noted the company&#8217;s policy allowed for the collection of the person&#8217;s location, device model of their phone, browsing history outside and inside TikTok, all the messages sent on TikTok, IP address, and biometric data.</p>
<p>In response, Beckerman said &#8220;some of those items that you listed off are things that we&#8217;re not currently collecting.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also said that the privacy policy states TikTok would get user consent if it were to begin collecting those items in the future.</p>
<p>Though not immediately clear, his statements were likely in reference to the clause about biometric data collection. In June, TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/tiktok-just-gave-itself-permission-to-collect-biometric-data-on-u-s-users-including-faceprints-and-voiceprints/">declined</a> to detail the product developments that necessitated the addition of biometric data to its list of disclosures about the information it automatically collects from users. But at the time, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/tiktok-just-gave-itself-permission-to-collect-biometric-data-on-u-s-users-including-faceprints-and-voiceprints/">company told TechCrunch</a> it would ask for user consent in the case such data collection practices began.</p>
<p>The senator said the committee would follow up with TikTok on this question.</p>
<p>Both senators were concerned about TikTok&#8217;s connection to China, given its parent company is Beijing-based ByteDance. But the issue of over-collection of user data &#8212; particularly with regard to children and minors &#8212; isn&#8217;t just a geopolitical concern or, as Trump believed, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/trump-ban-tiktok/">national security threat.</a> It&#8217;s a matter of transparency.</p>
<p>Privacy and security experts <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/07/privacy-policies-give-companies-lots-of-room-to-collect-share-data.html">generally think</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/state-of-privacy-laws-in-us/">that users should</a> understand why a company needs the data it collects, what is done with it, and they should have the right to refuse to share that data. Today, users can somewhat limit data collection by disallowing access to their smartphone&#8217;s sensors and other features. Apple, for example, implements opt-outs as part of its mobile operating system, iOS, which pops up consent boxes when an app wants to access your location, your microphone, your camera, or your contacts.</p>
<p>But there is much more data that apps can track, even when these items are blocked.</p>
<p>Following the questions about data collection practices, Lummis also wanted to know if TikTok had been built with the goal of keeping users engaged for as long as possible. After all, having a treasure trove of user data could greatly boost this sort of metric.</p>
<p>In reply, Beckerman pointed to the app&#8217;s &#8220;take a break&#8221; reminders and parental controls for screen time management.</p>
<p>Lummis clarified that she wanted to know if &#8220;length of engagement&#8221; was a metric the company used in order to define success.</p>
<p>Again, Beckerman skirted the question, noting &#8220;there&#8217;s multiple definitions of success&#8221; and that &#8220;it&#8217;s not just based on how much time somebody&#8217;s spending [on the app],&#8221;</p>
<p>Lummis then restated the question a couple more times as Beckerman continued to dodge answering directly, saying only that &#8220;overall engagement is more important than the amount of time that&#8217;s being spent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But is it one of the metrics?,&#8221; Lummis pushed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a metric that I think many platforms check on how much time people are spending on the app,&#8221; Beckerman said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">DeHaat, an online platform that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/18/prosus-ventures-leads-30-million-investment-in-indian-agritech-startup-dehaat/">offers full-stack agricultural services to farmers in India</a>, has raised $115 million in what is the largest funding round for an agritech startup in India, where farm produce yields two-thirds of the country’s $1 trillion in annual retail spending.</p>
<p>Sofina and Lightrock co-led the 10-year-old startup’s Series D financing round. Temasek and existing investors Prosus Ventures, RTP Global, Sequoia Capital India and FMO also participated in the new round, which brings its to-date raise to $161 million ($157 million of that has arrived in the last 30 months).</p>
<p><a href="https://agrevolution.in" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeHaat</a>, which is Hindi for village, is addressing three of the biggest challenges farmers face in India (and elsewhere): working capital, securing agri-input items such as seeds and fertilizers, and finding buyers after producing the yields. Only about a third of the yield Indian farmers produce reaches the big markets.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224267" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Gurgaon and Patna-headquartered startup has brought to one platform brands that sell agri-input products, institutional financers and buyers. It also works with microentrepreneurs &#8212; more than 3,000 of them &#8212; to provide last-mile aggregation and delivery.</p>
<p>The startup, which runs a helpline to engage with farmers, also operates an eponymous Android app that is accessible in multiple languages.</p>
<p>“The uniqueness of its full-stack approach combined with the &#8216;phygital&#8217; go-to-market strategy further reaffirmed our view that the company is on track to become a significant player in the farming industry in India,” said Yana Kachurina, principal at Sofina, in a statement.</p>
<p>DeHaat said it serves over 650,000 farmers in Bihar, UP, Jharkhand and Odisha. On its platform, it offers more than 850 unique agribusinesses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Shashank Kumar, co-founder and chief executive of the startup, told TechCrunch in an interview that the startup will deploy the fresh funds to expand to “all major agriculture clusters of India.”</p>
<p>DeHaat has grown 5x in the past seven months, he said.</p>
<p>Once an overlooked sector, scores of startups and tech giants are exploring how to tap the world’s largest annual harvest of fruit and vegetables after China’s. India’s agri-tech industry has the potential to reach about $24 billion in revenue by 2025, according to EY.</p>
<p>Amazon recently began offering real-time advice and information to farmers to help them inform their decisions on crops. Microsoft is working with 100 villages to deploy AI and build a platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our team has grown to a brigade of 850+ professionals with deep expertise of growth and strategy, supply chain, technology and agricultural science,&#8221; Kumar said, adding that the startup is also looking to hire more talent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sequoia Capital is debuting a big shift in strategy as they look to boost their returns amid increased competition in the market for startup financing.</p>
<p>The storied venture capital firm announced in a <a href="https://medium.com/sequoia-capital/the-sequoia-fund-patient-capital-for-building-enduring-companies-9ed7bcd6c7da" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> today that they&#8217;re breaking with tradition, abandoning the traditional fund structure and their artificial timelines for returning LP capital. The firm&#8217;s future investments will soon all flow through a &#8220;singular, permanent structure&#8221; called The Sequoia Fund, the post from long-time GP Roelof Botha details:</p>
<blockquote><p>Moving forward, our LPs will invest into The Sequoia Fund, an open-ended liquid portfolio made up of public positions in a selection of our enduring companies. The Sequoia Fund will in turn allocate capital to a series of closed-end sub funds for venture investments at every stage from inception to IPO.</p></blockquote><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224193" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>These changes will notably only apply to Sequoia&#8217;s U.S. and Europe-focused funds; the India and China-centric funds won&#8217;t adopt this structure.</p>
<p>Gone are the 10-year return cycles, which often pushed investors to liquidate holdings in public companies based on set timelines rather than determinations of when investments had fully matured. Sequoia says that investments will no longer have &#8220;expiration dates;&#8221; instead, Sequoia will recycle returns from startup bets back into its central fund which it will redeploy into future investments &#8212; what the firm calls a &#8220;continuous feedback loop.&#8221; It&#8217;s a change that could greater align investor incentives with founders who will have less external pressure under this model to pursue premature exit opportunities:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once upon a time the 10-year fund cycle made sense. But the assumptions it’s based on no longer hold true, curtailing meaningful relationships prematurely and misaligning companies and their investment partners.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to the change to return timelines, this change will also give Sequoia much more flexibility to deploy funds from the central structure towards &#8220;Sub Funds&#8221; focused on a particular stage or sector. Sequoia says LPs will be given the option to move part of their allocation in The Sequoia Fund toward new Sub Funds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">As part of the announcement, Sequoia also announced that they have become a </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">registered financial advisors (RIA). </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">General Catalyst and Andreessen Horowitz both become RIAs in recent years, a change that allowed them more flexibility in backing non-traditional assets outside of private markets. For these firms, it&#8217;s a change that allows them to adjust to the fluidity of market trends, backing public companies during periods of rampant public debuts and seizing on upstart company capitalization trends like coin offerings.</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a significant change to the traditional venture capital model Sequoia has long pursued, and a major readjustment for the fund&#8217;s limited partners that smaller firms without Sequoia&#8217;s long-term reputation likely would not be able to pull off. It also showcases how much private equity powerhouses like Tiger have pushed storied VC firms to look inwards and adopt major changes to stay competitive.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The current driver shortage in the U.K. highlights the precarious and unpredictable nature of home delivery logistics in e-groceries. Although the market for e-groceries is bigger than ever, the shortage of drivers might trigger a new e-grocery megatrend in the U.K.</p>
<p>Costs of both first-mile and last-mile delivery are going to rise, but it’s the last mile where customers are going to see the biggest price pinch. Exactly by how much is hard to say, but depending on the scale of the impact, we could be seeing the start of a rebalancing of last-mile preferences for U.K. e-grocery consumers, with click-and-collect pickup playing a much larger role than ever before.</p>
<p>This is potentially good news for grocery retailers with a store network. They are the market players that can easily and &#8212; most importantly &#8212; profitably provide click-and-collect services at scale. A store network has often been considered more of a curse than a blessing in the e-grocery surge, but in this case, it might be one of the best assets.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224067" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The U.K. has historically been a majority home-delivery e-grocery market, with plenty of hyperlow delivery price options to tempt and retain customers. In addition, “quick commerce” has seen a big uptick in interest, with small orders delivered at lightning speed, sometimes within 15 minutes. Often backed by venture capital, they might be offering relatively low delivery costs or even running at an overall loss to gain market share.</p>
<p>But all home delivery customers, whether they’re weekly shoppers or just need a few items in a hurry, are dependent on the cost of the last mile being low enough for the service to remain economically viable in the long term.</p>
<p>The key question is this: At what price are today’s home-delivery customers going to reconsider their luxury service as unaffordable? That the market has significantly increased due to the pandemic inevitably means a greater percentage of more price-conscious customers.</p>
<p>Grocery retailers in the U.K. are already targeting these, for example, with yearly free delivery passes, but the driver shortage may make them reconsider the profitability of such offers. Just last month in the U.S., Amazon <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-says-its-adding-a-whole-foods-delivery-fee-to-avoid-raising-prices-on-merchandise-11632849441">increased</a> the price of its Whole Foods home delivery services, signifying the potential for a broader correction in the e-grocery home delivery market globally.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Internationally, home delivery of e-groceries is not as popular as it is in the U.K. In France, a country of equal size, drive-thru and at-store pickup are by far the most popular choices. In the U.S., click-and-collect overtook home delivery as the most popular last-mile choice in spring 2021.</p>
<p>One market that’s seen a similar trend is Sweden, where click-and-collect was more popular than home delivery by late 2020, but they have historically had to deal with extremely high labor costs, even without a driver shortage.</p>
<p>In-store supermarket associate costs start at £25 an hour in Sweden, and the price of labor in general is at the top of all global rankings. With their labor prices, even the tiniest cost increase could turn a small margin into a hefty loss.</p>
<p>What has Sweden done differently to cope with high labor costs? In terms of pickup or click-and-collect, the country appears to be an outlier in terms of its enthusiastic adoption of temperature-controlled grocery lockers — still a rarity in the U.K.</p>
<p>I believe the key driver of this trend is that they can be completely unmanned, with customers picking up their orders without any staff interaction. Smartphones using app-based age-verification systems could be integrated into these solutions, driving further efficiency gains.</p>
<p>But the key point is that they are leveraging their existing assets — their stores and staff — to provide these solutions.</p>
<p>If the U.K. is moving toward a larger click-and-collect pickup market, pure online players and e-grocery tech startups are going to struggle the most to serve these customers. However, because click-and-collect is less costly to provide, grocery retailers with a brick-and-mortar store network are in a prime position to capture market share at speed and scale and, consequently, turn a profit.</p>
<p>The increasing prices as a result of today’s driver shortage could, paradoxically, create a far more profitable e-grocery opportunity for British retailers by driving click-and-deliver customers to click-and-collect.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The FCC has its first-ever woman as chair of the agency, Jessica Rosenworcel, who has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/the-fcc-has-its-first-chairwoman-in-jessica-rosenworcel/">serving as acting chair</a> since the beginning of the year. President Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/26/president-biden-announces-key-nominations-8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially appointed her</a> to the position today, and nominated her for a new term — as well as FCC veteran and tireless policy advocate Gigi Sohn, who if confirmed would become the first openly LGBTQ+ commissioner in history.</p>
<p>The appointment has been a long time coming for Rosenworcel, who has worked at the FCC for nearly 20 years, and has been a commissioner for half that time, under three different presidents. She was among the authors and advocates for net neutrality and may yet succeed, despite the controversial binning of the policy under former Chairman Ajit Pai during the Trump administration.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not all, of course: Rosenworcel has consistently worked for telecommunication and broadcast policies that are equitable and important, such as accessibility services and the huge Emergency Connectivity Fund currently being distributed. And she&#8217;s fought tooth and nail against robocalls, unethical data sharing and attempts to make the FCC into, as she put it at the time, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/with-absurd-timing-fcc-announces-intention-to-revisit-section-230/">&#8220;the president&#8217;s speech police.&#8221;</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2224176" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;I am deeply humbled to be designated as Chair of the Federal Communications Commission by President Biden. It is an honor to work with my colleagues on the Commission and the agency’s talented staff to ensure that no matter who you are or where you live, everyone has the connections they need to live, work, and learn in the digital age,&#8221; she said in a statement.</p>
<p>As acting chair, Rosenworcel was fully empowered to do her duty, but there was some question as to whether she would receive the full-time offer. One of the five positions at the FCC has remained conspicuously empty for more than a year, though President Biden could have nominated someone to it at any time. It was therefore an open question whether the administration was waiting to find the right person (who may also serve as chair), avoiding an unfavorable nomination environment, or just dragging its feet. I suspect only time will tell, but whatever the case, the nomination today of Gigi Sohn is smart and portentous. (Funnily enough, I spoke with her earlier this year about, among other things, likely nominees. She did not, to my recollection, mention herself.)</p>
<p>Sohn, Georgetown Law fellow and co-founder of Public Knowledge, served as general counsel for Chairman Tom Wheeler back in 2013-2016. Some may recognize this era as the big net neutrality push.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DdF9eqZw8n"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/30/commission-impossible-how-and-why-the-fcc-created-net-neutrality/">Commission Impossible: How and why the FCC created net neutrality</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Commission Impossible: How and why the FCC created net neutrality&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/30/commission-impossible-how-and-why-the-fcc-created-net-neutrality/embed/#?secret=DdF9eqZw8n" data-secret="DdF9eqZw8n" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This is as big a hint as we&#8217;re likely to get that the FCC under Biden is winding up for a second shot at the popular policy, which prohibits companies from discriminating in their handling of different data streams. (For instance, Comcast couldn&#8217;t give priority on its broadband services to its own streaming apps.)</p>
<p>Having been taught a number of hard legal lessons and learned what is risky and what is merely politically charged, a new net neutrality policy would likely be leaner, smarter and more forward-thinking. Sohn, already a legal expert in these matters, has been making a study of the challenges faced during net neutrality&#8217;s extended court battle — so the new one, if and when it exists, will likely be very shrewdly and comprehensively justified legally.</p>
<p>As if her qualifications weren&#8217;t enough, Sohn would also if confirmed become the first LGBTQ+ commissioner, making this FCC extra historic.</p>
<p>Both will have to have their commissioner positions (though not Rosenworcel&#8217;s chairship) confirmed by the Senate, which that august body can hopefully find time for between negotiation sessions over Biden&#8217;s spending bill.</p>

<p>In these countries, Apple One Premier will include Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple Fitness+ and 2 TB of iCloud storage. The bundle can be shared among up to six family members.

With this upcoming expansion, Apple One Premier will be available in 21 countries in total.</p>
