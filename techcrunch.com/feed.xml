										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The era of cloud gaming hasn&#8217;t arrived with the intensity that may have seemed imminent a couple years ago when major tech platforms announced their plays. In 2021, the market is still pretty much non-existent despite established presences from nearly all of tech&#8217;s biggest players.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been slow to roll out its Xbox Cloud Gaming beta to its users widely across platforms, but that&#8217;s likely because they know that, unlike other upstart platforms, there&#8217;s not a huge advantage to them rushing out the gate first. This week, the company will begin rolling out the service on iOS and PC to Game Pass Ultimate users, sending out invited to a limited number of users and scaling it up over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;The limited beta is our time to test and learn; we’ll send out more invites on a continuous basis to players in all 22 supported countries, evaluate feedback, continue to improve the experience, and add support for more devices,&#8221; wrote Xbox&#8217;s Catherine Gluckstein in a<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/04/19/xbox-cloud-gaming-windows-pc-and-apple-limited-beta/"> blog post</a>. &#8220;Our plan is to iterate quickly and open up to all Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members in the coming months so more people have the opportunity to play Xbox in all-new ways.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The service has been available in beta for Android users since last year but it&#8217;s been a slow expansion to other platforms outside that world.</p>
<p>A big part of that slowdown has been the result of Apple playing hardball with cloud gaming platform providers, whose business models represent a major threat to App Store gaming revenues. Apple announced a carve-out provision for cloud-gaming platforms that would maintain dependency on the App Store and in-app purchase frameworks but none of the providers seemed very happy with Apple&#8217;s solution. As a result, Xbox Cloud Gaming will operate entirely through the web on iOS inside mobile Safari.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration is opening an investigation into a crash involving a Tesla that authorities say was operating with no one behind the wheel, which left two men dead on late Saturday evening outside of Houston.</p>
<p>The 2019 Tesla Model S went off the road after it failed to negotiate a slight curve, <a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/tesla-spring-crash-fire/285-c28a4993-5b5f-43f4-a924-e39638390647">local CBS-affiliate KHOU-TV reported</a>. Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman told local reporters that the accident was unprecedented.</p>
<p>“Our office has never experienced a crash scene like this,” he said. “Normally, when the fire dept arrives, they have a vehicle fire under control in minutes, but this went on for close to four hours.” The long burn time was reportedly due to the electric vehicle batteries repeatedly reigniting.</p>
<p>More than 30,000 gallons of water were used to put out the fire. One of the victims was in the front passenger seat and the other was in the backseat, “and at the time of the accident there was no one in the [driver’s] seat,” Herman said.</p>
<p>Earlier on the day of the crash, Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1383548841438236674">retweeted news</a> that the company released its first-quarter 2021 safety report. “Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle,” he said. Tesla describes its Autopilot as a “suite of driver assistance features” and states that it requires “active driver supervision.”</p>
<p>“NHTSA is aware of the tragic crash involving a Tesla vehicle outside of Houston, Texas,” an spokesperson told TechCrunch. “NHTSA has immediately launched a Special Crash Investigation team to investigate the crash. We are actively engaged with local law enforcement and Tesla to learn more about the details of the crash and will take appropriate steps when we have more information.”</p>
<p>TechCrunch reached out to Tesla for comment and will update the story if the company responds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse/">Clubhouse&#8217;s latest fundraise</a>, Reddit today <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/mu3f0x/lets_talk_get_a_sneak_preview_of_reddit_talk_and/">officially unveiled</a> its Clubhouse rival, Reddit Talk following a recent report from <a href="https://mashable.com/article/reddit-clubhouse-voice-chat/">Mashable that revealed</a> the company had been developing audio-based social networking features. Like many of the newly launched Clubhouse clones, Reddit&#8217;s voice chat experience hasn&#8217;t deviated much from Clubhouse&#8217;s overall design where speakers sit at the top of the screen in a stage area of sorts, and listeners appear below &#8212; all with rounded profile icons, plus tools to react or raise a hand to ask to speak.</p>
<p>In Reddit&#8217;s case, however, it&#8217;s repurposed this Clubhouse-style format for its own communities, known as subreddits. Initially, Reddit Talk will live within subreddits, which are individual forums focused on a given topic or theme. Those community&#8217;s moderators will be the only ones able to start a talk for the time being, as the audio feature is still being tested, Reddit says.</p>
<p>These moderators will be given tools that allow them invite users to join, mute participants, and remove speakers during the live sessions. They can also ban unwanted users from the talk entirely and stop them from being able to rejoin.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Although only the subreddit moderators can start talks, once they are underway, they can invite anyone they choose to join them to speak. The other users can listen the Reddit Talk sessions across both iOS and Android.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140464" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140464" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140464" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/91jj01hxg5u61.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="446" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/91jj01hxg5u61.png 2928w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/91jj01hxg5u61.png?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/91jj01hxg5u61.png?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/91jj01hxg5u61.png?resize=768,504 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/91jj01hxg5u61.png?resize=680,446 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/91jj01hxg5u61.png?resize=1536,1007 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/91jj01hxg5u61.png?resize=2048,1343 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/91jj01hxg5u61.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140464" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Reddit</p></div></p>
<p>While the overall style is very much Clubhouse-like, Reddit has added its own touches. For example, users can react to speakers using a different set of emojis than you might find on rival services. Reddit&#8217;s product images today showed reactions that included popular Reddit designs like a rocket ship, the Reddit alien, and the diamond emoji, among others. Reddit says it&#8217;s currently testing a way for moderators to customize the background colors and the emoji used in their own communities when they launch Reddit Talk. They&#8217;re also able to change their own avatar&#8217;s appearance to fit the talk, too.</p>
<p>Reddit suggests the new audio features will make sense for things like Q&amp;As, AMAs (Ask Me Anything), lectures, sports radio-style discussions, community feedback sessions or even just hangouts.</p>
<p>The company is currently developing other features designed specifically to support AMAs and other types of conversations, it also noted.</p>
<p>In the comments of the Reddit Talk announcement, Reddit responded to questions from users about why it&#8217;s doing this, and acknowledged the Clubhouse similarities.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140463" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140463" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2140463" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-19-at-12.58.21-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="451" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-19-at-12.58.21-PM.jpg 1346w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-19-at-12.58.21-PM.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-19-at-12.58.21-PM.jpg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-19-at-12.58.21-PM.jpg?resize=768,509 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-19-at-12.58.21-PM.jpg?resize=680,451 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-19-at-12.58.21-PM.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140463" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Reddit</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that there is more to offer here by letting users have real-time live voice discussions with others in their communities &#8212; maybe talking about a sporting event while it’s on TV or listening to a casual chat or AMA with field experts,&#8221; Reddit&#8217;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/signal/">Product Lead for creators </a>wrote. &#8220;Yes, there are a few different platforms diving into live audio right now. Our hope is that by announcing this early with a community-first design, we will see engaging conversations hosted first by moderators, who we’ll be working with closely to ensure we’re creating a unique, supportive, and positive user experience,&#8221; the comment read.</p>
<p>There are more than a &#8220;few&#8221; other platforms now building out Clubhouse clones at this point, of course. Facebook has several tools on the way, Twitter has Spaces, and there are audio platforms in various stages of development from Discord, Telegram, Spotify and even LinkedIn, in the works.</p>
<p>Reddit Talk is not publicly available as it&#8217;s in a test period. But community moderators can join a <a href="https://forms.gle/TAR6Ee51o8NzqpGE7">waitlist</a> to be alerted as to when they can try out the feature for themselves. After the test period, Reddit says it will work with moderators to allow other trusted users to host talks through the new feature, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A stunning first quarter in venture capital funding was not restricted to the United States; Europe also had one hell of a start to the year.</p>
<p>According to data from Dealroom and Crunchbase News, an investor, and an analyst from PitchBook, European startups put together an impressive fundraising haul. The venture capital world kicked off its 2021 European investing cycle with enough activity to set the continent on the path that would crush yearly records.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Inside the data, there’s lots to unpack, including which sectors of European startups stood out in terms of capital raised, rising seed and late-stage deals, and dollar volume. We’ll also need to discuss exits &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/what-to-make-of-deliveroos-rough-ipo-debut/">the Deliveroo IPO and its various woes</a> was not the only transaction from the period worth understanding.</p>

And we’ll keep in mind that all venture capital data lags reality somewhat, as many deals from a particular period are not disclosed or discovered until long after they actually occurred.</p>
<p>In this case, it makes the numbers all the more impressive. Let’s get into the data.</p>
<h2>The big numbers</h2>
<p>Dealroom was first out of the gate, <a href="https://twitter.com/dealroomco/status/1377575470565298179">reporting that</a> European startups had a record quarter in Q1 2021 back when April just got started. Its preliminary results for the first quarter indicated that startups on the continent raised €16.6 billion, or $19.9 billion at today’s exchange rates.</p>
<p>That total was not only a record, but what Dealroom described as double the results of Q1 2020. While we’ve become slightly inured in recent months to the venture capital market’s rapid pace and capital-rich environment, it’s worth considering for a moment, as the first quarter of last year ended, how few of us would have guessed that just a year later &#8212; as COVID-19 still harms public health and disrupts life and business &#8212; we’d see numbers like this.</p>
<p>The Dealroom data, however, was not all records. Round volume by the group’s estimates was down from the year-ago period, if slightly better than the last few quarters. The general move toward the later-stage and larger-round venture capital market is alive and well in Europe.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Regret — such an unfortunate and unnecessary emotion, is it not?

<p>We debuted TC Early Stage last year, and it was so well received that we doubled-down in 2021. Here’s what Ashley Barrington, the founder of MarketPearl, told us about her experience.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Early Stage 2020 was a great opportunity to hear seasoned startup founders talking about their experiences and how they dealt with many of the same challenges I faced then and am going through now. It’s like a mini-MBA session on early-stage companies.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Here are just two of the high-profile speakers lined up to share their knowledge in July at TC Early Stage 2021. We’re adding new speakers every week, so keep checking back.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon&#8217;s Project Kuiper satellite constellation is one step closer to actually making it to space: The company announced it has secured an agreement with the United Launch Alliance (ULA) to fly its satellites on nine Atlas V rocket launches. Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/amazons-project-kuiper-will-seek-multiple-launch-providers-to-carry-its-satellites-to-space/">intends to use multiple launch providers and spacecraft</a> to ultimately get the full complement of 3,236 Kuiper satellites into low Earth orbit (LEO), but ULA is the first launch provider that Amazon has signed or announced.</p>
<p>ULA&#8217;s Atlas V is a proven workhorse in the space launch industry, having flown 85 prior missions with a perfect track record. The spacecraft was used to launch NASA&#8217;s Perseverance rover, for example, as well as Lockheed Martin&#8217;s OSIRIS-REx robotic asteroid exploration craft. While Amazon and ULA detailed to total number of launch vehicles that the contract covers, they didn&#8217;t share a timeline about when we can expect the launches to take place.</p>

<p>Late last year, I spoke to Amazon SVP of Devices &amp; Services Dave Limp at our TC Sessions: Space events, and I asked him about timelines for launches. Limp said at the time that Amazon was about at the &#8220;middle of [its] design phase&#8221; for the Project Kuiper satellites, which indicates there&#8217;s still work to be done before they enter mass production, which would obviously precede launch.</p>
<p>Limp also pointed out that the clock is ticking for Amazon in terms of its FCC license to operate the constellation, so it essentially has to &#8220;have half [its] constellation up in about six years.&#8221; That will mean an aggressive launch schedule once the design phase is complete and its actually in the process of building its satellites.</p>
<p>Amazon has invested a lot of capital and time into Project Kuiper, with a commitment to back it with an initial $10 billion investment, and a dedicated staff on the project that now includes 500 people, as well as a dedicated office and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/amazon-will-establish-a-new-headquarters-for-its-kuiper-satellite-broadband-project/">research &amp; development facility in Redmond near its global HQ</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple will reinstate Parler on its App Store following its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/apple-suspend-parler-from-app-store/">multi-month ban,</a> according to a letter Apple has sent to Sen. Mike Lee and Rep. Ken Buck, which was made public this morning via <a href="https://twitter.com/RepKenBuck/status/1384159186209054721">a post</a> on Congressman Buck&#8217;s Twitter. TechCrunch also obtained the letter and confirmed with Apple directly. The lawmakers had earlier written to Apple on March 31, 2021 to ask for additional information about why the app, which is heavily favored by conservatives, had been removed from the App Store. Apple&#8217;s response explains how Parler violated its policies but said it [Apple] has engaged in extensive conversions with Parler&#8217;s team since the app&#8217;s removal. It also says Parler&#8217;s proposed updates to the app, its content and its moderation practices will allow it to be approved for reinstatement to the App Store immediately update its release.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Apple was one of several tech platforms that banned Parler following the Capitol riot, after it came to light how the app had been used by Trump supporters and other far-right users<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/01/06/trump-riot-twitter-parler-proud-boys-boogaloos-antifa-qanon/6570794002/"> to call for violence </a>and <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/trump-rioters-planned-online?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">organize their plans</a> to storm the Capitol. The insurrection left five people dead, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/police-union-says-140-officers-injured-in-capitol-riot/2021/01/27/60743642-60e2-11eb-9430-e7c77b5b0297_story.html">more than 140 police officers injured</a> and resulted in <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/capitol-riot-arrests-2021-04-16/">hundreds of arrests.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/parler-removed-from-google-play-store-as-apple-app-store-suspension-reportedly-looms/">Google</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/09/amazon-web-services-gives-parler-24-hour-notice-that-it-will-suspend-services-to-the-company/">Amazon</a> also quickly banned Parler from their respective platforms after the Capitol riot.</p>
<p>In Apple&#8217;s case, the company had first given Parler notice the app would be removed unless the company submitted a content moderation improvement plan. But Parler&#8217;s then-CEO John Matze posted to his own Parler account that he would not cave to Apple&#8217;s ultimatums and the app, having failed to meet Apple&#8217;s requirements, was banned. In the weeks that followed, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-parler-ceo/parler-ceo-john-matze-says-he-was-fired-by-board-idUSKBN2A33B0">Matze was fired</a> by Parler&#8217;s board, controlled by Republican Party donor Rebekah Mercer.</p>
<p>Parler has been working to obtain re-entry to the App Store since its removal, but those efforts continued to fall short. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-10/parler-cuts-ios-team-after-apple-blocks-return-to-app-store">Bloomberg reported</a> last month, for example, that Parler had submitted new guidelines in February that were insufficient to comply with the App Store rules due to issues with violating content. That letter, addressed to Parler&#8217;s chief policy officer on February 25, stated: &#8220;There is no place for hateful, racist, discriminatory content on the App Store.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to Apple&#8217;s new letter, released today, things have changed. It says that Apple has now informed Parler as of April 14, 2021 that its proposed moderation practices will qualify it for reinstatement. The letter, signed by Timothy Powderly, Apple&#8217;s senior director of Government Affairs in the Americas, says:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the period since Apple removed the Parler app from the App Store, Apple’s App Review Team has engaged in substantial conversations with Parler in an effort to bring the Parler app into compliance with the Guidelines and reinstate it in the App Store. As a result of those conversations, Parler has proposed updates to its app and the app’s content moderation practices, and the App Review Team has informed Parler as of April 14, 2021 that its proposed updated app will be approved for reinstatement to the App Store. Apple anticipates that the updated Parler app will become available immediately upon Parler releasing it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The letter also notes that it did not consult with Google or Amazon in respect to its original decision to remove Parler &#8212; a response meant to put to rest the false claims of a coordinated effort between tech giants to silence conservatives.</p>
<p>Apple did not detail what specific changes Parler had agreed to, but earlier this year, the app was still non-compliant with Apple&#8217;s guidelines for allowing user profile pictures that featured swastikas and white nationalist imagery, and because it had permitted usernames and posts that were misogynistic, homophobic and racist, Bloomberg said at the time.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s letter, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/19/tech/apple-parler-app-store/index.html">first reported this morning by CNN</a>, indicates Parler will be approved immediately when submitted.</p>
<p>Apple also told TechCrunch the app&#8217;s relaunch time frame will be up to Parler to decide, but offered no additional comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://alan.com">Alan</a> has raised a $220 million funding round at a $1.67 billion valuation (€185 million and €1.4 billion respectively). Coatue is leading the round with Dragoneer, Exor, and existing investors Index Ventures, Ribbit Capital and Temasek also participating.</p>
<p>Alan has been building health insurance products from scratch. When I first covered the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/24/alan-wants-to-turn-health-insurance-into-software-as-a-service/">back in 2016</a>, the startup had just managed to get approval from regulators to become an official health insurance company.</p>
<p>Since then, it’s been a not-so-slow and steady growth story as the company now covers 160,000 people. Overall, Alan generates over €100 million in annualized revenue. While most of that revenue is spent back on claims, it’s an impressive revenue trajectory.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Like other insurance companies, Alan has some capital requirements to comply with health insurance regulation. Alan has to raise more if it wants to insure more people. But that’s just part of the story as the startup still had enough cash on its bank account for the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
<p>“The context is that we managed to end the year 2020 very strong, finally — and I say finally because it’s been stressful until the last minute,” co-founder and CEO Jean-Charles Samuelian-Werve told me.</p>
<p>Alan managed to meet its goals and international expansion finally started to take off. Many startups try to raise when they’re in a strong position. You shouldn’t wait until you have your back against the wall and that’s exactly what’s happening here.</p>
<p>“We thought it was the right time and we had multiple term sheets. Even though valuation is really good we first looked at a partner that has a really long-term vision,” Samuelian-Werve said.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the company can iterate on its core product — health insurance — and everything that makes Alan a super app — a single app that lets you access several services. In France, employees are covered by both the national healthcare system and private insurance companies. Alan sells its products to other companies so that their employees are automatically covered by Alan contracts. It’s a sort of B2B2C play.</p>
<p>9,400 companies have opted for Alan in France, Belgium and Spain — the company’s home market remains its main market. Clients include WeWork, Deliveroo, JustEat, Vitaliance and Big Mamma. By 2023, Alan wants to reach 1 million members.</p>
<p>In order to gain more customers, Alan is betting on three pillars —&nbsp;product innovation, customer satisfaction through additional services, and expansions to new verticals and markets.</p>
<p>When it comes to product innovation, Alan has designed a modular insurance builder. Small companies can subscribe to Alan in a few clicks. Big companies can tweak every single parameter to build the right insurance package for them.</p>
<p>After that, the company tries to make it easy to manage your health insurance. You’ll soon be able to automatically manage sick leaves, change the employee affiliation status, etc. As for employees, the company has always promoted a transparent offering. For instance, you should know how much you’re going to pay out of pocket when you see a doctor. You can see a map of doctors around you and how much they charge on average. This way, there’s no surprise.</p>
<p>Alan also tries to reimburse you as quickly as possible. If it’s a straightforward claim, the startup tries to analyze and categorize your claim as quickly as possible and then issue an instant SEPA transfer. 75% of claims are reimbursed and available on your bank account in less than an hour.</p>
<p>These core product features definitely contributes to customer satisfaction. But Alan is expanding beyond insurance products with several additional services that should increase retention. For instance, you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/22/health-insurance-startup-alan-lets-you-chat-with-a-doctor/">chat with a doctor</a>, get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/health-insurance-startup-alan-launches-free-medical-app-alan-baby/">medical advice for your baby’s health</a>, get a free <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/17/health-insurance-startup-alan-covers-meditation-app-subscription/">meditation app subscription</a>, start a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/03/alan-partners-with-krys-livi-for-telemedicine-appointments/">telehealth appointment</a> via a partner, talk with someone about your mental health, etc.</p>
<p>Those services contribute to turning Alan into a super app for your health. Essentially, as soon as you’re insured by Alan, you become a member and can access all those services without additional charges.</p>
<p>Eventually, Alan plans to launch a personal care guidance service to help you contact the right healthcare professional based on your health issue. In Spain, Alan can already book appointments for you.</p>
<p>Finally, Alan plans to reach new customers through aggressive expansion goals. The company plans to hire 400 people within the next three years and expand to other industries with tailor-made insurance products, such as retail, wholesale and manufacturing.</p>
<p>While the company is still going to focus on France, Belgium and Spain in the near future, it is looking at opportunities across Europe. So let’s see where Alan is going to expand next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve all heard the phrase “passive income” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to describe how people can make money by owning rental properties. Many Americans would love to passively earn money, but the process of becoming a landlord can be intimidating and complicated. </span></p>
<p>I mean, how many people have looked back and wished they hadn&#8217;t sold a property after seeing its value rise years after selling it?</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And those who are already landlords can get overwhelmed by the complexities of managing properties.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One startup out of Boston, <a href="https://knoxfinancial.com">Knox Financial</a>, aims to help people identify and manage residential rentals with its algorithm-based platform, and it’s raised a $10 million Series A to help it further that goal. Boston-based <a href="https://www.g20vc.com">G20 Ventures</a> led the round, which included participation from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greycroft, Pillar VC, 2LVC, and Gaingels.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment brings Knox’s total raised since its inception in 2018 to $14.7 million. The company closed on a $3 million seed round in January 2020, led by Greycroft.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knox co-founder and CEO David Friedman is no stranger to startups. He founded Boston Logic – an integrated marketing platform and online marketing services for real estate offices and agents – in 2004. He sold that company (now under the name Propertybase) to Providence Equity for an undisclosed amount in 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knox launched its platform in March of 2019, with the goal of offering homeowners who are ready to move “a completely hands-off way” of converting a home they’re moving out of into an investment property. It also claims to help landlords more easily and efficiently manage their rentals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of its seed round early last year, the company was only operating in the Boston market and had 50 units on its platform. It’s now operating in seven states, has “hundreds” of investment properties on its platform and is overseeing a portfolio of more than $100 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how does it work? Once a property is enrolled on Knox’s “Frictionless Ownership Platform,” the company automates and oversees the property’s finances and taxes, insurance, leasing and legal, tenant and property care, banking and bill pay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knox also has developed a rental pricing and projection model for calculating the investment rate of return a property will produce over time.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2140393" style="width: 621px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2140393" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2140393" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Property-Wealth-Calculator-2.png?w=300" alt="" width="611" height="379" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Property-Wealth-Calculator-2.png 2100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Property-Wealth-Calculator-2.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Property-Wealth-Calculator-2.png?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Property-Wealth-Calculator-2.png?resize=768,477 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Property-Wealth-Calculator-2.png?resize=680,422 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Property-Wealth-Calculator-2.png?resize=1536,954 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Property-Wealth-Calculator-2.png?resize=2048,1272 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Property-Wealth-Calculator-2.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2140393" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Knox Financial</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We save investors a lot and almost always make their portfolios more profitable,” Friedman said. “If someone is moving or upsizing, we can turn properties into incredible ROI generators or cash flow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s revenue model is simple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When a dollar of rent moves through our system, we keep a dime,” Friedman told TechCrunch. “We align our interests with our customers. If there’s no rent coming in, we’re not making money. Or if a tenant doesn&#8217;t pay rent, we don’t make money.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knox plans to use its new capital to continue expanding geographically and getting the word out to more people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to become the de facto platform for real estate investment acquisition and ownership,” Friedman said. “And we have to be coast to coast to really do that for everybody. So, we’re still very early in our growth trajectory.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bob Hower, co-founder and partner of G20 Ventures, shared that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">weeks after his college graduation, he had bought a fixer upper with his mother’s help. A week after finishing renovations, he put the house on the market. Over the subsequent 5 months, he gradually reduced the price as the market softened, and eventually the property sold at a small profit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That house now is worth a multiple of what I paid for it,” Hower recalls. “In hindsight, the mistake I made was deciding to sell the house at all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That experience helped Hower appreciate what he describes as a “clarity of thinking” in Knox’s business model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Had Knox existed decades ago, I&#8217;d likely still have that fixer-upper I bought after college,” he said. “Investing platforms such as Betterment have collapsed multiple advising and optimization activities into a simple single-sign-on service, and Knox is the first company to apply this type model to residential real estate investing.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tyltgo wants to make it easier for restaurants and small businesses to compete with same-day delivery services offered by the likes of Amazon and HelloFresh. The Canadian company, which recently raised CAD $2.3 million (USD $1.8 million) in a seed round, is akin to a white label Uber Eats, providing businesses an on-demand delivery platform under their own branding that connects them to gig economy couriers.</p>
<p>“I think about us as a post-purchase experience company,” co-founder and CEO Jaden Pereira told TechCrunch. “The recipient goes directly onto the merchant’s platform and places orders through them, so it feels like they&#8217;re interacting with the brand they purchased from throughout the entire experience. Our messages, notifications, tracking pages and delivery are all customized under the merchant’s brand name, but it’s powered by Tyltgo.”</p>
<p>The necessity of having products delivered during the pandemic&#8217;s shelter-in-place orders combined with the massive reach of e-commerce giants like Amazon has created a society that expects same-day deliveries. Tyltgo recognized the exclusionary nature of that reality on smaller businesses with less time and fewer resources, and contrived to remedy the situation with some innovative tech and gig economy couriers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In July 2018, Pereira, 22, co-founded the company with fellow student and developer Aaron Paul while studying at the University of Waterloo. Pereira originally did deliveries himself as a side hustle, while building up a consumer-facing service on Shopify. In October 2019, Pereira and Paul shifted focus to B2B, identifying the real problem as merchants struggling to offer quality same-day delivery at an affordable price.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Starship Technologies CEO Lex Bayer on focus and opportunity in autonomous delivery&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/starship-technologies-ceo-lex-bayer-on-focus-and-opportunity-in-autonomous-delivery/embed/#?secret=ja8ucQyyx9" data-secret="ja8ucQyyx9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>From December 2019 to December 2020, Tyltgo’s revenue grew 2000%, says Pereira. The company started 2020 with two staff members and ended with nine, including former head of Uber Eats Canada’s marketplace operations, Joe Rhew, and former director of engineering at Goldman Sachs-acquired fintech company Financeit, Adnan Ali.</p>
<p>Aided by funding from VC firm TI Platform Management, Y Combinator and angel investor Charles Songhurst, Tyltgo projects another 1500% revenue growth for 2021. The company’s goal is to expand its team, develop an API and app-based platform, and add 100 more merchants across Ontario.</p>
<p>Pereira said Tyltgo originally focused on florists, and occasionally pharmacies, but demand from the restaurant industry led to the company’s new target &#8212; meal kit deliveries.</p>
<p>Meal kit services that provide the culinarily challenged with perfectly portioned ingredients and cooking instructions were already gaining popularity in the before times. When the pandemic hit, services like HelloFresh and Blue Apron saw even more growth. As restaurants struggled to keep their businesses open, many started to get in on the action, delivering restaurant-quality meals with instructions for heating and serving.</p>
<p>The global meal kit delivery services market is expected to reach almost $20 billion by 2027, with heat-and-eat options taking a large share of that market. Tyltgo is counting on the success of this industry. It has already secured partnerships with restaurants like General Assembly Pizza and Crafty Ramen, as well as with more traditional meal kit delivery services from grocery stores and organic farms.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9zUCRFW8cZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/7-top-mobility-vcs-discuss-covid-19-strategies-and-trends/">7 top mobility VCs discuss COVID-19 strategies and trends</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;7 top mobility VCs discuss COVID-19 strategies and trends&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/14/7-top-mobility-vcs-discuss-covid-19-strategies-and-trends/embed/#?secret=9zUCRFW8cZ" data-secret="9zUCRFW8cZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Pereira said working in the “quasi-perishable space” of flowers and meal kits is both a challenge and a differentiator for the company. Depending on the contents of the delivery, Tyltgo will determine its perishability window and make sure to match that window with a driver. It’s also got an advanced fleet management platform that assigns a number of deliveries to suit the size of a courier’s vehicle.</p>
<p>“In the earlier days, the hardest part was being able to match those perishability windows without causing damage to the products,” said Pereira. “We all know that in logistics, you have to account for traffic, weather conditions, all these other things, but you have an eight hour delivery window to get out 35 deliveries.”</p>
<p>Another challenge is ensuring the top quality service Tyltgo advertises while working in the gig economy. Selecting for reliable couriers has slowed the company down at points, but Tyltgo aims to grow capacity only if it can simultaneously maintain a low error threshold.</p>
<p>“We won’t bring on a merchant if we don’t think we have the capacity to handle their deliveries and meet those expectations,” said Pereira.</p>
<p>Whether or not Tyltgo’s meal kit focus will end up driving scalability in the long run, the platform itself has legs. Pereira’s goal is to see Tyltgo become a part of every post-purchase customer experience for all retail trade categories, and that includes expanding into customer service, branding and transactions on top of delivery.</p>
<p>“The main reason why we’re doing this is because a lot of these smaller, brick-and-mortar retailers don’t have the time and resources to be able to compete with the Amazons of the world,” said Pereira. “We want to be able to put that power in their hands.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-commerce is booming as retailers race to transform their brick-and-mortar footprints into online storefronts. By some counts, the market grew an astonishing 42% in 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/u-s-e-commerce-on-track-for-its-first-1-trillion-year-by-2022-due-to-lasting-pandemic-impacts/">estimates show that online spending in the U.S. will surpass $1 trillion by 2022</a>. It’s a bonanza, and everyone is figuring out this new terrain.</p>
<p>Consumers are likely familiar with the front-end brands for these storefronts — with companies like Amazon, Shopify, Square, and Stripe owning attention — but it’s the tooling behind the curtain that is increasingly determining the competitiveness of individual stores.</p>
<p><strong>Klaviyo</strong> may not be a household name to consumers (at least, not yet), but in many ways, this startup has become the standard by which email marketers are judged today, triangulating against veterans Mailchimp and Constant Contact and riding the e-commerce wave to new heights.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012, this Boston-based company helps marketers personalize and automate their email messaging to customers. By now, most people are intimately familiar with these kinds of emails; if you’ve ever given your email address to an online store, the entreaties to come back to your abandoned cart or browse the latest sale are Klaviyo’s bread and butter.</p>
<p>It may seem obvious in retrospect that email would grow to become a premier platform for marketing, but this wasn’t the case even a few years ago when social ads and search engine marketing were the dominant paradigm. Today, owned marketing and customer experience management are white-hot trends, and Klaviyo has surged from a lifestyle business to a multi-billion dollar behemoth in just a few short years. Its story is at the heart of the internet economy today, and the future.</p>
<p>TechCrunch’s writer and analyst for this EC-1 is <b>Chris Morrison</b>. Morrison, who previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/roblox-ec1/">wrote our EC-1 on Roblox</a>, has been a writer and independent game developer covering the video game industry and the marketing challenges that come with publishing. As an analyst and a potential user, he’s in a unique position to explain the Klaviyo story. The lead editor for this package was <b>Danny Crichton</b>, the assistant editor was <b>Ram Iyer</b>, the copy editor was <b>Richard Dal Porto</b> and illustrations were created by <b>Nigel Sussman</b>.</p>
<p><i>Klaviyo had no say in the content of this analysis and did not get advance access to it. Morrison has no financial ties to Klaviyo or other conflicts of interest to disclose.</i></p>
<p>The Klaviyo EC-1 comprises four main articles numbering 9,700 words and a reading time of 43 minutes. Let’s take a look:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Part 1: Origin story</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-origin/">How Klaviyo transformed from a lifestyle business into a $4.15B email titan</a>&#8221; (2,600 words/10 minutes) — Explores the rise of Klaviyo from a database for e-commerce data into a modern email powerhouse as it successively learned from customers and bootstrapped in the absence of funding from accelerators and early VCs.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Startups are stories of feverish dreams and obsessive fears. Short of hearing it from the source, a glimpse into the inbox of a founder would be the best way to experience the travails they endure on the way to building a business. A customer finally makes a purchase, a VC invests or walks away, an employee signs their offer letter — all of the major and minor milestones of a startup are communicated via that now-ancient medium of email.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Current Klaviyo users may be surprised to hear that email was not a part of the initial product.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Email’s ubiquity is only part of the story, though. It’s also a symbol of freedom: The last social platform that remains relatively open and free from the clutches of a single monopoly owner. It’s a market rife with entrenched incumbents, but one that simultaneously continues to invite founders to find some new take on this venerable communications channel and make it better for everyone.</p>
<p>That was the mission that Andrew Bialecki and Ed Hallen undertook when they founded <a href="https://www.klaviyo.com">Klaviyo</a> back in 2012. What they perhaps didn’t bank on was just how long of a route they were about to take — or how many rejections they might find in their own inboxes from accelerators and VCs who never thought a new generation of email service providers could make it.</p>
<p>So they bootstrapped, kept things lean. They debated canceling dinners to pay the bills when customers churned. And along the way, they built a special startup that is today valued at a whopping $4.15 billion. Klaviyo is the story of how two scrappy, inexperienced entrepreneurs set out to build a lifestyle business — and ended up creating an email titan.</p>
<h2>Racing to the starting line</h2>
<p>Klaviyo’s origin story sounds a bit like the generic advice given by every book on entrepreneurship. Andrew Bialecki — he goes by AB — had a need that no existing company filled. So, he started a company to address that need.</p>
<p>It began with what he calls a side hustle: a website devoted to cataloging the dates and locations of running races. Bialecki had the technical chops to build it, but the data wasn’t already available online and he needed race organizers to provide it. That, in turn, meant he needed to let them know his site existed and constantly follow up to make sure they were using it.</p>
<p>“I realized I&#8217;m on the phone with people and it&#8217;s never going to scale. After a while, I was working on that while I was at another startup, and I said I have two options here. Either I can go all-in on road races, or all-in on the problem: ‘How do we help these businesses connect with the people using their software or products?&#8217;” recalls Bialecki.</p>
<p>By then, he already had a co-founder in mind. Bialecki had been a student together with Ed Hallen at MIT, but the pair actually met while working at Applied Predictive Technologies (APT), a Washington, D.C. tech consultancy.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;d read all those books on, hey, when you&#8217;re looking for someone to start a business with, you want someone with similar values who&#8217;s also complementary,” says Bialecki. “I&#8217;d known he was kind of interested in starting a company, and we had really complementary skillsets. I loved the engineering and design and product, and he was a big product guy too, but was used to working with customers and clients.”</p>
<h2>An email company that didn’t (initially) do email</h2>
<p>Current Klaviyo users may be surprised to hear that email was not part of the product that emerged. Instead, Bialecki and Hallen built a database to collect all the e-commerce data that was falling through the cracks.</p>
<p>“Once we really talked to a lot of e-commerce people, it was clear there were long-standing problems,” says Hallen.</p>
<p>Bialecki adds, “There are facts you know, like their name, their email address, their favorite color or something they told you about their birthday. But some of the harder stuff was, jeez, how many times has this person visited my website, bought something from me, what products did they buy and how is that trending over time? Were they a really frequent customer that dropped off the face of the Earth?”</p>
<p>As they spoke to customers, the founders realized that handling customers&#8217; data and making it useful to them was going to be critical to Klaviyo’s success. It just so happened that gathering data matched well with their experiences working at APT.</p>
<p>“We had a ton of experience stitching together data sources,” says Hallen. “We took that expertise and put it as our foundation. What&#8217;s the most broken, largest market, and let&#8217;s really tie data to it, not as an afterthought.”</p>

<p>What that required, in practical terms, was spending the initial months building a custom database to store the disparate data types that come up during e-commerce transactions — events, documents and object data models. Conor O’Mahony, who joined the company in 2018 as chief product officer and departed this month to become an advisor, says that the company’s early time investment in its database laid the foundations for its later success in scaling up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Email is the communication medium that refuses to die.</p>
<p>“Eventually, every technology is trumped by something new and better. And I feel that email is ready to be trumped. But by what?” <a href="https://avc.com/2007/05/what_trumps_ema/">wrote the venture capitalist Fred Wilson in 2007</a>. Three years later, <a href="https://avc.com/2010/04/social-networking-vs-email/">he updated readers</a> that other forms of messaging had outgrown email. “It looks like email&#8217;s reign as the king of communication is ending and social networking is now supreme,” he said. (To be fair to Wilson, his view was nuanced enough to continue investing in email tech.)</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Despite the competition, Klaviyo didn’t just break into the market — it has also achieved an unusual level of excitement and loyalty among marketers despite its youthful history.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Investors weren’t alone — marketers have also spent years anticipating the next big thing.</p>
<p>“It was SMS, it was YouTube, it was Instagram. Before that it was Facebook, then it was Snapchat and TikTok. I kinda feel like individually all those things are fleeting. I think people found: You know what? Everyone still opens their emails every day,” says Darin Hager, a former sneaker entrepreneur who is now an email marketing manager at <a href="https://www.adjustmedia.co/">Adjust Media</a>.</p>
<p>Email has an estimated <a href="https://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Email-Statistics-Report-2019-2023-Executive-Summary.pdf">four billion users</a> today and continues to grow steadily even as mature social networks plateau. Estimates of the number of nonspam messages sent each day range from <a href="https://talosintelligence.com/reputation_center/email_rep">25 billion</a> to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/456500/daily-number-of-e-mails-worldwide/">over 300 billion</a>.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly for a marketing channel with so much volume, there’s voluminous competition to send and program those emails. Yet, despite the competition, Klaviyo didn’t just break into the market — it has also achieved an unusual level of excitement and loyalty among marketers despite its youthful history.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re not using Klaviyo and you&#8217;re in e-commerce, then it&#8217;s not very professional. If you see ‘Sent by Constant Contact or Mailchimp’ at the bottom of an email by a brand, it makes it look like they&#8217;re not really there yet,” Hager said.</p>
<p>How did Klaviyo become the standard solution among email marketers?</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-origin/">In Klaviyo’s origin story</a>, we delved into part of the answer: The company began life as an e-commerce analytics service. Once it matured to compete as an email service provider, Klaviyo benefited from the edge given by its deeper, more comprehensive focus on data.</p>
<p>However, that leaves several questions unanswered. Why is email so important to e-commerce? What are the substantive differences between Klaviyo’s feature set and those of its competitors? And why did several large, well-funded incumbents fail to capitalize on building an advantage in data first?</p>
<p>In this section, we’ll answer those questions — as well as laying out the significance of COVID-19 on the e-commerce market, and how newsletters and AI figure into the company’s future.</p>
<h2>A positive Outlook on email’s longevity</h2>
<p>Email is one of the oldest tech verticals: <a href="https://www.constantcontact.com/">Constant Contact</a>, one of the most venerable email service providers (ESPs), was founded in 1995, <a href="https://xconomy.com/boston/2007/10/03/constant-contact-completes-107-million-ipo-shares-up-10-out-of-the-gate/">went public in 2007</a> and <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2015/11/02/email-marketing-giant-constant-contact-acquired-for-1-billion/">was taken private in 2015 for $1 billion</a>. By the time Klaviyo started in 2012, the space was well served by numerous incumbents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brands are emotions made physical. The clothes we wear, the media we consume, the devices we use — all signal not only to others what we value and see in ourselves, they also are a way to construct our very identities. Experimenting to deepen that bond has been at the core of the marketing profession for a century; its origins rooted in Freudian psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>There had always been one critical limitation, though: Marketers had to appeal to the masses. Radio, television and print media allowed brands to deliver only one message to everyone, no matter if their product conferred luxury or smart cost-consciousness.</p>
<p>On the internet, the masses have been shattered into ever smaller shards, shifting that marketing calculus toward targeted audiences and social network interest groups. Today, niche brands, large corporations and every business in between are reaching ever-narrower audiences.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Marketers who become expert at personalization, especially for existing customers through owned marketing platforms like email, will hold an edge over their competitors.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Yet, advertising and social networks are competitive marketplaces. Over time, prices to reach niche audiences rise, and strategies that once worked become unviable. In 2021, these perpetual challenges are joined by two new factors: a fresh influx of new e-commerce brands and changing privacy policies on third-party platforms.</p>
<p>Klaviyo benefits from these secular trends. While the cost or difficulty of acquiring new customers may increase, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1-business/">we looked at in the second part of this EC-1</a>, the cost of emailing an existing one remains much the same. Marketers who become expert at personalization, especially for existing customers through owned marketing platforms like email, will hold an edge over their competitors. It’s no longer about marketing to narrow slices of audiences — it&#8217;s about building an emotional bond with an audience of one.</p>
<h2>To a booming economy, now ad inflation</h2>
<p>While 2020 was a banner year for e-commerce in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the early months of 2021 have brought about a new problem: Customer acquisition costs are rising, sometimes to a worrying degree. For instance, one company interviewed by TechCrunch that did not wish to be named said it has seen its return on investment for Facebook ads fall by nearly half in the first months of 2021. Such inflation has also been <a href="https://www.ecimediamanagement.com/eci-inflation-report-q1-2021/">predicted by firms like ECI Media Management</a>.</p>
<p>There are two possible reasons for this increase. First, an unprecedented number of companies are moving online, spurred by COVID-19 and worldwide lockdowns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many of the stories in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ec1">our EC-1 series</a> tell tales of startups in the wilderness hacking out green field opportunities. Klaviyo is a different breed of company: One that went into an established market and challenged powerful incumbents, ultimately finding success with a new, more data-oriented generation of email marketers.</p>
<p>As such, the lessons that it offers are, perhaps, more subtle; its insights bordering on common sense.</p>
<p>But as the saying goes, common sense to an uncommon degree becomes wisdom. Here are four pieces of wisdom I’ve gleaned from Klaviyo’s story:</p>

	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Lesson 1: Drama and quirk aren’t necessary for startup success</h2>
<p>Silicon Valley has become a showcase for oddity. Ironically, we all enjoy &#8220;Silicon Valley&#8221; (the show) or &#8220;The Social Network<i>.&#8221;</i> Unironically, we toss around phrases like “the hustle” and “sweat equity.” Hot companies often stand out with stories of intense struggle and failure, a larger-than-life founder or a chaotic (and often toxic) management structure.</p>
<p>Drama and sizzle help companies stand out, undoubtedly. But are they necessary for success? Klaviyo’s story suggests otherwise.</p>

<p>AutoX, whose backers include Alibaba, Shanghai Motors and MediaTek, has been at the forefront of AV deployment in China. It was the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/autox-removes-safety-drivers/">first company in China</a> to test AVs on public roads without safety drivers, in Shenzhen, one of the country’s largest cities and the location of the company’s headquarters. And it launched a self-driving taxi service, RoboTaxi, in Shanghai.</p>
<p>AutoX was also awarded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/autonomous-vehicle-startup-autox-lands-driverless-testing-permit-in-california/">a permit in California</a> to start driverless testing without a human safety driver, the third company after Waymo and Nuro to have landed such a permit.</p>
<p>The partnership was announced just weeks after Tel Aviv-based Arbe said it would go public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Industrial Tech Acquisitions, at an equity valuation of $722 million. The move was supported by a $100 million PIPE )private investment in public equity) from investors that include M&amp;G Investment Management, Varana Capital, Texas Ventures and Eyal Waldman.</p>
<p>Marenko estimated during the webcast that Arbe’s revenue will only be $7 million in 2021, so investors are clearly bullish on the company’s technology. To that point, Marenko said he expects to exceed $300 million in revenue in 2025 — a 4,185% increase in just four years.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Many emerging and mature organizations survive or die based on their ability to scale. Scale quicker. Scale cheaper. Scale right.</p>
<p>Typically the IT team bears that burden — on top of countless other demands. IT teams move mountains for their organizations while scaling the tech platform as fast as possible, putting out the latest infrastructure fire and responding to countless day-to-day requests.</p>
<p>The most helpful gift any chief information officer or chief technology officer can give their IT teams is more time. Many people think that means adding another team member. Maybe it does in some cases (if you can find a developer in this tough job market), but giving my team <a href="https://boomi.com/">Boomi</a>’s low-code integration platform was one of the best strategic moves for HealthBridge.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The best time to use low-code is when you need to add something to your organization that isn’t unique or doesn’t drive significant business value.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As the least skilled coder on the team, low-code let me develop and deliver four customer-centric self-service portals a year ahead of schedule while my team focused on building and scaling our revenue-driving, custom platform by hand-writing code.</p>
<p>Low-code is quickly becoming commonplace and a popular topic among IT decision-makers. Over the last few years, the market has exploded. Gartner expects it <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-02-15-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-low-code-development-technologies-market-to-grow-23-percent-in-2021">to total $13.8 billion in 2021</a>. That means low-code technology, which we’ve been hearing about for years, is ready for widespread adoption. Today, low-code enables you to streamline (and scale) everything from integration to artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>It’s a secret only some organizations are clued in on, but it’s a great way to scale fast, save on resources and give your team more time. Here’s how.</p>
<h2>When to use low-code and when to write code</h2>
<p>The best time to use low-code is when you need to add something to your organization that isn’t unique or doesn’t drive significant business value.</p>
<p>For instance, a customer portal is not unique; don’t waste time hand-coding it.</p>
<p>While it’s certainly an extremely helpful feature for our customers, it’s unlikely to drive significant shareholder or investor value. However, it’s key for scaling. Using low-code for a must-have but undifferentiated feature will allow your team to work on more important projects while scaling.</p>
<p>When we started working on the timeline for a customer portal project at HealthBridge, we estimated it would take several sprints per portal to develop, but more pressing development work kept pushing it down the list in our backlog. Waiting a year for a basic feature didn’t seem reasonable to me, so we looked for a workaround.</p>

<p>Mastercard certainly sees the rapid digital transformation that is happening in online commerce, a move that was accelerated by COVID. It&#8217;s a transformation that once started isn&#8217;t likely to change back to the old ways of doing business, even when we get past the pandemic.</p>
<p>With Ekata, the company gets a solution that can verify the online identity of a person making the transaction in real time using various signals that can indicate if this is fraudulent or true as they open an account or transact business. The company provides a score and other data that predicts the likelihood this person is who they say they are. It&#8217;s not unlike a credit risk score, except for identity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;There have never been more $100M+ fintech rounds than right now&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/there-have-never-been-more-100m-fintech-rounds-than-right-now/embed/#?secret=yYxPKcLBzm" data-secret="yYxPKcLBzm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That was one of the primary reasons Mastercard decided to acquire Ekata, according to Ajay Bhalla, president of cyber and intelligence solutions at the company. &#8220;With the addition of Ekata, we will advance our identity capabilities and create a safer, seamless way for consumers to prove who they say they are in the new digital economy,&#8221; Bhalla said in a statement.</p>
<p>The two companies believe that by combining Mastercard&#8217;s fraud detection solutions with Ekata&#8217;s scoring approach, they will help prevent bad actors from using online platforms to conduct business. &#8220;The acceleration of online transactions has thrust global digital identity verification to the forefront as one of the biggest opportunities to build digital trust and combat global fraud,” Rob Eleveld, CEO at Ekata said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company, which was previously known as White Page Pro, <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/06/12/1867525/0/en/Whitepages-Pro-Spins-Off-and-Becomes-Ekata.html#:~:text=Whitepages%20Pro%20will%20change%20its,reach%20%2420%20billion%20in%202022.">was spun out as Ekata</a> in June 2019. It has not raised any additional money, according to both Pitchbook and Crunchbase data. It would seem that $850 million represents a nice exit for a company that hasn&#8217;t raised a dollar, but it&#8217;s clearly more mature than your average startup with 2000 customers including Lyft, Stripe, Equifax, Checkout.com and Intuit.</p>
<p>It appears that Mastercard was willing to pay to get the company it wanted at a time when a solution like this is becoming more essential than ever. The acquisition is subject to standard regulatory approval, but remember regulators <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/visa-will-not-acquire-plaid-after-running-into-regulatory-wall/">quashed the Visa-Plaid</a> deal last year. If it passes muster, it should close some time in the next six months, according to the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cannabis financing company Bespoke Financial today announced it raised $8 million in a Series A financing round. Through this round, the company brought new, key investors into its corner as it fights to bring financing solutions to companies in the cannabis space.</p>
<p>Bespoke is a direct lender and provides several financing solutions to companies operating in cannabis. These short-term loans allow the companies to build credit with Bespoke, which then offers better terms on subsequent loans and products. The company says its loan origination volume has grown exponentially, outgrowing forecasts by 25% over the proceeding year. The company has deployed $120 million in gross merchandise volume over 2,000 cannabis license holders with zero defaults to date.</p>
<p>With this new round of capital, Bespoke intends to launch new financing structures and expand its financing options across various distribution channels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>CEO and Co-founder George Mancheil calls this round a pivotal moment for his company and stamp of validation on the direction and products offered by Bespoke Financial. As he tells TechCrunch, this round provides several key partners to the growing startup.</p>
<p>The financing round was co-led by Snoop Dogg&#8217;s Casa Verde Capital and Sweat Equity Ventures, along with Ceres Group Holdings, Greenhouse Capital Partners, DoubleLine Capital&#8217;s co-founder and former president Philip Barach, and Robert Stavis, an investor based in New York.</p>
<p>This is Sweat Equity Ventures&#8217; (SEV) first investment into a cannabis company. SEV, backed and funded by LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, is led by Dan Portillo and works differently from traditional venture funds. SEV works with founders to provide top engineering and business talent to its portfolio companies. In exchange for these services, SEV takes equity from the companies instead of just writing checks.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is our firm&#8217;s first investment in the cannabis industry, and we are excited to partner with Bespoke as more and more states legalize cannabis use, and the Federal government contemplates nationwide legalization. This partnership combines Bespoke&#8217;s finance and cannabis acumen with our team&#8217;s expertise scaling innovative tech companies, and will provide cannabis companies greater access to streamlined financing while benefiting investors with increased transparency and enhanced risk surveillance,&#8221; says Dan Portillo, Managing Partner of Sweat Equity Ventures, in a released statement.</p>
<p>Karan Wadhera, managing partner at Casa Verde Capital, says Bespoke Financial addresses real needs in a growing industry. Casa Verde Capital previously invested in Bespoke Capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/25/meet-bespoke-financial-a-lender-for-cannabis-companies-backed-by-snoop-doggs-casa-verde-capital/">including in a $7 million round in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Bespoke CEO Mancheil tells TechCrunch his company is focused on being more than just a lender; it wants to be a modern financing company that allows it to act as a true partner with the cannabis industry.</p>
<p>With this $8 million in financing, Bespoke Financial has raised $28 million to date. The company was founded in 2019 and, as of this announcement, has 12 employees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;re spent any time on TikTok lately, then you&#8217;ve probably seen a number of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@popl/video/6791976659705728262?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">Popl&#8217;s ads</a>. The <a href="https://popl.co/">startup</a> has been successfully leveraging social media to get its modern-day business card alternative in front a wider audience. Packaged as either a phone sticker, keychain or wristband, Popl uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-field_communication">NFC</a> technology to make sharing contact information as easy as using Apple Pay. To date, Popl has sold somewhere over 700,000 units and has generated $2.7 million in sales for its digital business card technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://popl.co/">Popl</a> co-founder and CEO Jason Alvarez-Cohen, a UCLA grad with a background in computer science, first realized the potential for NFC business cards through a different use case &#8212; a device he encountered in someone&#8217;s home while attending a party. But it sparked the idea to use NFC technology for sharing information person-to-person, which would be faster than alternatives, like AirDrop or manual entry. And so, Popl was born.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2139487" style="width: 554px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2139487" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2139487" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?w=544" alt="" width="544" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=120,150 120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=240,300 240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=768,960 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=544,680 544w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=1229,1536 1229w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=1638,2048 1638w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/deeevz-10.jpg?resize=40,50 40w" sizes="(max-width: 544px) 100vw, 544px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2139487" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Popl</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though startup history is littered with would-be &#8220;business card killers&#8221; that eventually died, what makes Popl different from early contenders is that it combines both an app with a physical product &#8212; the Popl accessory. This accessory can be purchased in a variety of form factors, including the popular Popl phone sticker that you can apply right to the back of your phone case (or even the top of your Popsocket), and customized with a photo of your choosing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew that, in the past, people would tap phones and share information like that. But I learned quickly that you can&#8217;t do this just phone-to-phone with pure software,&#8221; says Alvarez-Cohen. &#8220;So I was like, what&#8217;s the closest way we can get the phone tapping? And that&#8217;s how I came up with this back-of-the-phone product.&#8221;</p>
<p>Each Popl accessory is actually an NFC tag which enables the handoff of the user&#8217;s contact information. When the phones are close, the recipient will get a notification that alerts them to your shared Popl data.</p>
<p>There are, of course, other ways to quickly exchange contact information. You can easily enter in someone&#8217;s digits into your phone&#8217;s contacts app directly, for example, which may work better for more casual encounters &#8212; like meeting someone at a bar. But Popl lets you share a full business cards&#8217; worth of contact data with just a tap, which makes it better for professional encounters, or any other time you want to share more than just your phone number.</p>
<p>While the Popl tags make for a nice gimmick, the Popl mobile app is what makes the overall service useful. And to be clear, the app is <em>only</em> necessary for the Popl&#8217;s owner &#8212; the recipient doesn&#8217;t need the app installed for Popl to work. They will, however, need to have a phone that <a href="https://www.bluebite.com/nfc/iphone-nfc-compatibility">can read NFC tags</a>, which can leave out some older devices. Or, as a backup, they&#8217;ll need ability to scan the QR code the app provides as a workaround.</p>

<p>In the Popl app, you can customize which data you want to share with others &#8212; including your contact info, social profiles, website links, etc. &#8212; all via an easy-to-use interface. Like some business card apps in the past, you can flip in between a personal profile and a business profile in Popl in order to share the appropriate information when out networking. To actually make the exchange of contact information with another person, you simply hold up your phone to theirs and they&#8217;ll get a notification directing them to your Popl profile webpage. (The phones don&#8217;t have to physically touch or bump together, however. It&#8217;s more like Apple Pay, where they have to be near each other.)</p>
<p>From the Popl website that&#8217;s shared via the notification that pops up, the recipient can tap on the various options to connect with the sender &#8212; for example, adding them on a social network like LinkedIn or Instagram, grabbing their phone number to send a quick text, or even downloading a full contact card to their phone&#8217;s address book, among other things.</p>

<p>The app&#8217;s more clever feature, however, is something Popl calls &#8220;Direct.&#8221;</p>
<p>This patented feature won&#8217;t send over the Popl website where the recipient then has to choose how they want to connect. Instead, it opens up the destination app directly. For example, if you have LinkedIn Direct on, the recipient will be taken directly to your profile on LinkedIn when they tap the notification. Or if you put your Contact Card on Direct, it will just pop your address book entry onto the screen so the user can choose to save it to their phone.</p>
<p>For paid users, the app also lets you track your history of Popl connections on a map, so you can recall who you met, where and when, along with other analytics.</p>

<p>Work on Popl, which is co-founded by Alvarez-Cohen&#8217;s UCLA roommate, Nick Eischens, now Popl COO, began in late 2019. The startup then launched in February 2020 &#8212; just before the coronavirus lockdowns in the U.S. That could have been a disastrous time for a business designed to help people exchange information during in-person meetings when the world was now shifting to Zoom and remote work. But Alvarez-Cohen says they marketed Popl as a &#8220;contactless solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I have this, and I have to meet someone for my business, I don&#8217;t even have to tap it &#8212;  you can just hover, and it will still send that information,&#8221; Alvarez-Cohen says. &#8220;So I&#8217;m able to share my business card with you without handing you a business card, which is kind of safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>But what really helped to sell Popl were its video demos. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@popl/video/6791976659705728262?lang=en&amp;is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1">One TikTok ad</a>, which I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve seen if you use TikTok at all, features the co-founders&#8217; friend <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@endicci">Arev</a> sharing her TikTok profile with a new friend just as she&#8217;s leaving the gym.</p>
<p>In the video, the recipient &#8212; clearly dumbfounded by the technology after she taps his phone &#8212; responds <em>&#8220;what? what? Whoa! What? How&#8217;d you do that?!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s now been viewed over 80 million times.</p>

<p>Today, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@popl">Popl&#8217;s TikTok videos</a> get high tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and sometimes still millions of views per video. The company also has an active presence on other social media. For instance, Popl posts regularly to Instagram where it has <a href="https://www.instagram.com/popl/">over 100K followers</a>. Today, the startup&#8217;s growth now is about 60% driven by Facebook and Instagram marketing and 40% organic, Alvarez-Cohen says.</p>
<p>Now, the company is preparing new products for the post-pandemic era when in-person events return. Though it had before sold <a href="https://popl.co/pages/enterprise">Popl&#8217;s in bulk</a> for this purpose, it&#8217;s now readying an &#8220;event bracelet&#8221; that just slips on your wrist (and is reusable). The bracelet could be used at any big event &#8212; like music festivals or business conferences, where you&#8217;re meeting a lot of new people. And because Popl uses NFC, phones have to be close to make the contact info exchange &#8212; it won&#8217;t just randomly share your info with everyone you pass by them.</p>
<p>Popl is also fleshing out the business networking side of its app with integrations for Salesforce, Oracle and Hubspot, and CSV export, that come with its <a href="https://popl.co/pages/pro">Popl Pro subscription</a> ($4.99 per month). The in-app subscription is already at $320,000 in annual recurring revenue and growing 10% every week, as of early April.</p>
<p>A Y Combinator Winter 2021 participant, Popl is backed by Twitch co-founder Justin Kan (via Goat Capital), YC, Urban Innovation Fund, Cathexis Ventures, and others angels including Wish.com CEO Peter Szulczewski and Plangrid co-founder Ralph Gootee.</p>
<p>The app is available on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/popl/id1503939262">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nfc.popl">Android</a>, and the Popl accessories are sold on its <a href="https://popl.co/">website</a> and on <a href="https://www.target.com/s?searchTerm=popl">Target.com</a>.</p>
