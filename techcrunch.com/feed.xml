										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amid a <a href="https://aibusiness.com/author.asp?section_id=789&amp;doc_id=769626" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global semiconductor shortage</a>, an upstart in the world of AI chips is announcing a big round of funding to meet a boom in demand for its technology. <a href="https://hailo.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hailo</a>, which makes edge-device chips customized to work with AI workloads &#8212; typical implementations include smart cities, retail environments, industrial settings and next-generation automotive systems &#8212; has raised $136 million in a Series C round of funding, one of the biggest to date in the AI chip market. We&#8217;ve confirmed with sources close to Hailo that the investment values it at around $1 billion.</p>
<p class="p1">Poalim Equity and Gil Agmon co-led the round, with participation also from previous backers Hailo Chairman Zohar Zisapel, ABB Technology Ventures (ATV), Latitude Ventures, OurCrowd; and new investors Carasso Motors, Comasco, Shlomo Group, Talcar Corporation Ltd., and Automotive Equipment (AEV). The company has now raised some $224 million to date.</p>
<p>This latest round comes about 18 months after Hailo&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/hailo-raises-60m-series-b-for-its-ai-chips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series B of $60 million</a>, and about a year after the release of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/hailo-challenges-intel-and-google-with-its-new-ai-modules-for-edge-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company&#8217;s most recent AI modules</a> based on its Hailo 8 chip, intended to compete against the likes of Intel and Nvidia.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216569" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Orr Danon, the co-founder and CEO, said in an interview that in the interim the company has been seeing a huge surge of interest in the market &#8212; in the last quarter alone, he said Hailo doubled the number of projects it&#8217;s working on to 100 &#8212; so this latest round is about scaling to meet that demand, but also to continue customizing how and where its processors can be used.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are now in the market with the Hailo 8, and people are very excited because of its efficiency,&#8221; he said. One unique aspect of Hailo&#8217;s edge chips is that they are designed to adapt to existing resources to work with custom neural networks, so not only are they fast but need less energy to run than the equivalent amount of processing power that you might otherwise need in a data center computer to run a similar task. &#8220;However, we want to expand our offering. It&#8217;s not a one size fits all, so we are also investing in software.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">The funding is coming on the heels of a complicated year in the world of chips, where the pandemic has alternative driven strong demand in some areas (for example in consumer environments, where users have been kickstarting the renewal cycle for better devices at a time when other activity has been limited); big drops in activity among others (eg, ambitious projects in areas like autonomous vehicles); and a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/were-in-a-hurry-a-new-ceo-scrambles-to-cope-with-a-global-chip-crisis-11633701630?mod=djemalertNEWS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major slowdown</a> in production overall. For a company working in edge devices as Hailo is, that presents an opportunity to make the case for more efficient and cost effective systems, helped by the fact that it is able to integrate with users&#8217; own neural networks and preferred development frameworks such TensorFlow or ONNX.</p>
<p>Danon said that while Hailo has seen a softening in demand in some segments &#8212; for example, automotive &#8212; the diversity of its business has meant that demand overall has continued to rise. Even automotive is coming back after a particularly frothy period and some fallout as a result. So, for example, while the number of projects focused on fully-autonomous vehicles may have gone down, there are still a number of efforts working on semi-autonomous systems, which he said still translate into business for Hailo.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Companies are now starting to look for realistic deployments, and facing real challenges,&#8221; he said. &#8221; Okay, maybe we do not need our self-driving cars to drive on the Autobahn, but we still need to learn new tasks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside this, he said the company is seeing a lot of strong interest from industrial customers, those in the retail industry (where edge devices are used for computer vision applications, such as those you might have in a security system, or in an automated check-out service, or for analytics), and in smart cities, where transportation will also continue to be a major driver of business. It&#8217;s for the opportunity ahead as much as for the current business that investors are backing the company.</p>
<p>“In the coming years, AI will become the defining feature for creating new business value and reshaping user experience as we know it. The ability to bring AI-based features to market will increasingly be the deciding factor over whether companies succeed or fail,” said Mooly Eden, who recently left Intel, where he worked for nearly 40 years and was most recently president of its operations in Israel, and is now on the board of Hailo. “Hailo’s innovative and hyper-efficient processor architecture addresses the growing demand for a new kind of chip to handle these new types of workloads, challenging traditional computing solutions.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab is <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211012005509/en/Rocket-Lab-Acquires-Space-Software-Company-Advanced-Solutions-Inc">acquiring</a> a Colorado-based space software company called Advanced Solutions, Inc (ASI) for $40 million, with as much as $5.5 million in additional performance-based earnouts also available based on the company&#8217;s 2021 calendar year performance. ASI&#8217;s expertise lies in flight software for spacecraft, including guidance, navigation and control (GNC) offerings, as well as mission simulation and test software. It&#8217;s meant to help Rocket Lab build out its Space Systems division and round out its efforts to become a true &#8216;end-to-end&#8217; space company.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab&#8217;s primary business since founding has been launch, where its own expertise in building and flying its Electron light lift rockets has given it a unique position in the emerging commercial launch market. The company also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/16/rocket-lab-to-acquire-satellite-hardware-maker-sinclair-interplanetary/">acquired Sinclair Interplanetary last year</a>, which added key capabilities in terms of developing and producing spacecraft hardware components. ASI&#8217;s more than 20 years of experience in the field of space software, which has been used for multiple orbital and interplanetary missions, help Rocket Lab bolster that aspect of the service offerings it can make available to customers in terms of not only launching missions, but also planning, testing and operating them as well.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, the ASI team will remain in Colorado and continue to be run by the firm&#8217;s founder and CEO Jon Cuseo, and it will maintain its relationships with existing customers. This also allows Rocket Lab to set up shop and grow its team in the Colorado area, which is a hotbed of both public and private space industry activity.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216587" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has invested in Bangalore-based Open, becoming the latest high-profile investor to back a neobanking platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://bankopen.co">Open</a> said on Tuesday it has raised $100 million in a Series C financing round. Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund Temasek led the round, and Google and Japan&#8217;s SBI Investment (not to be confused with SoftBank or India&#8217;s SBI bank) as well as existing investors Tiger Global and 3one4 Capital participated in it.</p>
<p>The new round, which brings the four-year-old startup’s all-time raise to $137 million, values Open at $500 million, according to a source familiar with the matter. TechCrunch reported in June that Open was in talks with Temasek and Google among others to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/temasek-and-general-atlantic-in-talks-to-back-indian-neobank-open/">raise $100 million</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216570" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Another round is already in the works and investors such as Visa are likely to join, another source familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>Open <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/25/indias-open-neo-bank-raises-30-million-to-help-businesses-automate-their-finances/">operates a neo-bank</a> that offers small and medium-sized businesses as well as enterprises nearly all the features of the bank with additional tools to serve the needs of a business. Millions of small and medium sized businesses in India struggle with maintaining multiple bank accounts, bookkeeping of their daily spending, and bandying out payments to employees.</p>
<p>The startup, which has partnerships with over a dozen top banks in India, says more than 2 million businesses are using its platform.</p>
<p>In recent quarters, Open has expanded its offerings. The startup now provides its neobanking technology to banks in a white-label licensing arrangement, who then sell it to their customers, said Anish Achuthan, founder and chief executive of Open, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We are helping banks build their own new-age digital banking platforms,” he said. The startup is now also helping other fintech startups to build their embedded finance or other fintech solutions, he said.</p>
<p>“We realized that we have the infrastructure required to help other fintech businesses build their own card issuance and other digital bank services,” he said. Open calls this part of its business offering Zwitch.</p>

Data: RBI, Jefferies. Image credits: Jefferies</p></div></p>
<p>The growth of Open in recent years, which has led to several other startups expand to and innovate in this category, has dramatically changed the relationship between banks and fintechs. Just a few years ago, most banks in India were skeptical of neobanks and it was very difficult to persuade any of them for a partnership, fintech founders have told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neobanks are gaining prominence as platforms to digitise banking or bank-like services for millennials and SMEs. Top-4 global neobanks are worth $100 billion and Indian fintechs have made a start through likes of Open, RazorpayX, Fi, and Jupiter,” wrote analysts at Jefferies in a report last month.</p>
<p>“In fact, many Indian fintechs plan to expand from 1-2 platforms now to neobank over 3-5 years. Incumbent banks/NBFCs are partnering with them. Monetisation is some time away,” they added.</p>
<p>That last part is still a big question for the industry. At a virtual conference last year organized by Razorpay, Pine Labs chief executive Amrish Rau jokingly commented that between him and CRED founder Kunal Shah, they have backed every neobanking startup in the country in the hopes that these firms will figure out a way to make money in this category someday.</p>
<p>“The challenge here [for neobanks aimed at millennials] is that payment fees are negligible in India, BNPL is still small and mostly gets non-prime clients. Quality of relationship and leveraging of partnerships for cross-sell will drive success. On the other hand, SME-focussed neobanks are building engagement with business- clients through their ability to provide solutions like automated invoicing, collections/payments, accounting, inventory and sales mgt., taxes and in some cases interest on current deposits as well (banks can&#8217;t pay interest). This may help to ramp- up and upfront their monetisation prospects,” Jefferies analysts wrote.</p>
<p>Open, which employs about 500 people, said that it plans to deploy the capital to broaden its offerings and also expand to international markets such as Southeast Asia, Europe, and the U.S. The startup will begin its expansion with the Southeast Asian market, said Achuthan. “We have already partnered with one bank in Vietnam and one in the Philippines,” he said. “There the entry point is the enterprise business.”</p>
<p>The startup is also eyeing strategic merger and acquisitions opportunities in India and other markets and is looking to hire more talent, he said.</p>
<p>“The team at Open have combined deep domain expertise and product-focused rigor to deploy a full-stack solution that places SMEs at the center of a universe of innovation. This platform has set the standard for business banking and will take this full stack approach into new adjacencies and geographies. We are excited to continue our partnership as Open scales into a global fintech innovation engine,” said Pranav Pai, Founding Partner and CIO at 3one4 Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>Open is the latest of a series of investments by Google in India in the past one year. The company, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/">committed to invest $10 billion in the next couple of years</a>, has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">backed Indian startups Glance and DailyHunt</a>. YouTube <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/youtube-acquires-indian-social-commerce-startup-simsim/">acquired social commerce startup SimSim</a> in July this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/2150-launches-with-281m-fund-to-reduce-the-carbon-footprint-of-the-worlds-growing-cities/">in February</a> new European VC <a href="http://2150.vc">2150</a> launched the first $240 million close of its fund to back technologies reducing carbon emissions via the medium of cities, which pump out CO2 at a prodigious rate as they develop and grow.</p>
<p>This ‘Urban Sustainability Technology Fund’, as it’s dubbed, is now announcing the final close of its fund at $312 million, showing that LPs have an increasing appetite for this subject. Plus, the fund says it was 33% oversubscribed.</p>
<p>The new investors including Credit Suisse and a client advised by AIMS Imprint of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, the Norwegian sovereign climate investment company, Nysnø as well as the BMW Foundation and Woven Capital, the investment arm of Toyota&#8217;s Woven Planet Group.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216503" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Key to all this is 2150’s obsession with the built environment because the equation is simple: countries are not going to stop developing cities, even with the Climate Crisis now going at full throttle. So developing technologies that will mitigate or even draw down the resulting CO2 emissions, is key.</p>
<p>Thus, 2150 has made several investments since launching, in startups like CarbonCure Technologies, which lowers the CO2 footprint of concrete. It is these kinds of investments that have led the fund to claim that the total footprint of real estate developed, built, or managed by its investor base has more than tripled to 430 million square feet or 25 times the size of Canary Wharf in London.</p>
<p>Other investments include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/tracking-co2-emissions-for-supply-chains-leads-normative-to-a-e10m-fund-raise/">Normative</a>, which Tracks the full carbon footprint of supply chains and which this month raised €10 million in a round led partly by 2150.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Tracking CO2 emissions for supply chains leads Normative to a €10M fund raise&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/tracking-co2-emissions-for-supply-chains-leads-normative-to-a-e10m-fund-raise/embed/#?secret=VOp9MlN1fP" data-secret="VOp9MlN1fP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Another 2150 company is Aeroseal (which produces a gum that seals air ducts and building envelopes thereby significantly increases their energy efficiency), and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/nodes-links-raises-11m-to-maybe-save-billions-on-the-big-projects-the-world-needs-now/">Nodes &amp; Links</a> (which has a software platform to make infrastructure projects run to time, saving energy) which raised an $11 million Series A. They&#8217;ve also invested into <a href="https://www.ampd.energy/">Ampd Energy</a> which is a company that can decarbonize construction sites by powering cranes with a battery driven generator.</p>
<p>2150 claims this portfolio to date could mitigate over 1.6 Gigatonnes of CO2, or more than the annual emissions from Germany, UK, France combined. To put that in context, we are emitting 51 Gigatonnes of CO2 annually, so we need to save 18 to 32GT annually if we are to avoid 1.5 Degrees warming.</p>
<p>The theory is that if 2150 or any other number of VCs can scale their investments to achieve these kinds of numbers, then we may have enough moonshot projects to be able to alleviate the worst effects of Climate Change. Of course, that is not a given but it might just be possible.</p>
<p>If that’s the case then thinkers like George Monbiot may have to revise their theory that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/sep/29/green-growth-economic-activity-environment">Green Growth doesn’t exist</a>.<br />
 <br />
Christian Jølck, Partner and co-founder at 2150, said: “At 2150 we want to become a significant contributor to reaching The Paris Agreement and focus on the urban environment, which represents 70% of GHG emissions. We seek not only to be an investor, but also a facilitator of urban transformation through our platform with strategic investors.”</p>
<p>Over a call, 2150 Partner Christian Hernandez said about the raise: “We were targeting 200 million Euros which was already ambitious, and then, things took off in a good way. We raised one of the largest climate tech funds in Europe. And it came from, big money, like, Credit Suisse clients of Goldman Sachs, and some of the world&#8217;s largest sovereign funds.”</p>
<p>What does he think is attracting these large LPs?</p>
<p>“One is a platform that could absorb an institutional-sized check. And the fact that we are focused on this built world which is a vertical, but it&#8217;s a massive vertical. And as one LP said to me ‘You know we&#8217;ve done our energy funds, we&#8217;ve done our Foodtech funds we&#8217;ve been looking for an institutional-grade built-world Fund,” he said.</p>
<p>Hernandez added that the fund is now looking at heating and cooling: “Everybody focuses on heating but cooling consumes more energy and it&#8217;s going to grow as more people around the world need to stay cool just to survive, not to just to stay comfortable. We&#8217;re also looking at waste, both how to minimise waste but also how to decompose it. And, and we&#8217;re looking at new materials: how can you use nature or synthetic biology or other technologies to actually create more sustainable materials.”</p>
<p>He also made the point that Carbon Offsetting isn’t a solution right now as the price fluctuates wildly and is still fairly opaque. It, therefore, makes sense to tackle the CO2 problem not with offsetting but with the built environment.</p>
<p>The context of this 2150 raise is that climate is gradually out-pacing VC investment, even into AI. Despite representing 6% of the venture capital market, the amount invested in climate tech startups increased from $418m in 2013 to $16.3bn in 2019, according to a report from PwC last year. This was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/new-report-finds-vc-investment-into-climatetech-growing-five-times-faster-than-overall-vc/">three times the rate of increase</a> in investment in artificial intelligence over the same period.</p>
<p>Hernandez is also keen to ingrain the climate values into company and team behavior: “We do our own carbon accounting for the fund itself, we offset our own carbon footprint. We each have made individual commitments of what actions we&#8217;re going to take. Mine is to eat less meat, so I&#8217;m pretty much down to like once a week now &#8211; I can&#8217;t have a steak dinner anymore, my body&#8217;s not used to it. How were trying to take micro-actions as well as macro actions with the fund &#8211; I think both need to exist to be part of the culture of the team.”</p>
<p>2150 also announced that it had qualified for a Diversity VC ranking of ‘Level One’, the highest: “We are already a diverse team, and that&#8217;s going to continue, and it&#8217;s very much part of the type of team we want to build. So we&#8217;ll have some news later in the year of how we&#8217;re building out the team.”</p>
<p>2150 is anchored by Northern European real estate private equity platform NREP as well as anchored by Chr. Augustinus Fabrikker, Novo Holdings, and Denmark’s Green Future Fund in February of this year. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Virtual became the norm for physical gatherings at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, and now, as many jet back into in-person meetings, some believe that the online version, at least in some form, is here to stay &#8212; sometimes for the better, but sometimes for the worse. Today, a startup called <a href="https://hubilo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hubilo</a> that&#8217;s building what it believes is a more engaging take on the medium, is announcing a big funding round to double down on its ambitions. The startup has raised $125 million that it will use to continue expanding its platform and the company.</p>
<p>Alkeon Capital led the round, with participation from Lightspeed Venture Partners and Balderton Capital. This Series B is a huge financial leap for Hubilo. Prior to this, the company &#8212; headquartered in San Francisco, but grown out of India &#8212; had raised just $28 million in six years (with $23.5 million of that raised in a Series A only <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/hubilo-raises-ps17m-to-redefine-the-future-of-events-893451967.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven months ago</a>, also during the pandemic). It is not disclosing valuation.</p>
<p>Virtual events &#8212; be they large conferences, company meetings, one-on-one or small group conversations, or dinner parties and quiz nights &#8212; have been a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/video-conferencing-market-size-to-reach-9-95-billion-by-2028--remote-working-policies-adopted-due-to-the-covid-pandemic-to-act-as-key-driver-grand-view-research-inc-301308774.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">huge business in this period of Covid-19</a>, where they became a key way for people to connect when in-person meetings were impossible. In working world, they became a significant cornerstone for communication, with businesses sinking some <a href="https://insights.eventscouncil.org/Full-Article/ArtMID/398/ArticleID/1445/2018-Global-Economic-Significance-of-Business-Events">one trillion dollars</a> of direct spending on events, according to Guru Chahal, the partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners who invests in Hubilo. &#8220;These changes are permanent,&#8221; he added.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216280" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Videoconferencing brands like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/zoom-looks-beyond-video-conferencing-as-triple-digit-2020-growth-begins-to-slow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zoom</a>; those focused on virtual events like <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210805005315/en/Hopin-Raises-450-Million-to-Accelerate-Platform-Expansion-and-Continue-to-Build-the-Future-of-Experiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hopin</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/touchcast-raises-55m-to-grow-its-ar-based-virtual-event-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TouchCast</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/bizzabo-raises-138m-for-a-platform-that-helps-you-build-and-run-virtual-conferences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bizzabo</a>; and those building tech to improve how videoconferencing can be used like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/engageli-nabs-33m-more-for-its-collaborative-video-based-teaching-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Engageli</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/mmhmm-raises-100m-which-is-a-fun-thing-to-say-to-people-who-dont-follow-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mmhmm</a> all saw their stars rise. Even those you might not associate with virtual events but are aiming to do more in the space <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/linkedin-is-testing-a-new-paid-ticketed-events-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like LinkedIn</a> are now getting in on the act.</p>
<p>Hubilo has been among them. The company now has more than 800 customers, big names like Walmart, Blackboard, the United Nations, Roche Pharma, AB inBev, Verizon, Facebook and TikTok. Yes, that&#8217;s right. A communications giant, &#8216;the&#8217; social network and a massively popular video app sensation are all customers of this particular video product that has built and squared away another kind of engaging video experience.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s particular sweet spot has been helping these organizations plan and run internal and external meetings and events, whether they are private meetings for a few colleagues or external conferences for thousands, giving them the tools to create a customized design and architecture to the event (important when you have multiple tracks) and to tailor a wide set of interactive features to connect with those &#8220;visiting&#8221; the events, and for those visitors to connect with each other. And to do this easily and regularly.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a little like a Wix or WordPress for virtual events. Which is interesting because WordPress is also one of its customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s an epic pivot for a startup that was, in early 2020, staring into a deadpool. Founded originally to build engagement apps for in-person events, Hubilo really went to town on that concept as a boostrapped startup, with a dashboard that gave exhibition organizers more than 50 different engagement features such as leaderboards, quizzes, collaboration tools, messaging, &#8220;matchmaking&#8221; for networking and more. It was being used by events that had up to 10,000 attendees, where organizers leaned on these to keep people from being bored.</p>
<p>That business, however, completely dried up when people stopped going to such gatherings.</p>
<p>So in February 2020, Vaibhav Jain, the CEO and founder, went for the Hail Mary option. He gave his team just a small amount of time &#8212; 26 days &#8212; to try to come up with a new direction for the company, ideally one that didn&#8217;t require massive capital investment, since that was exactly what it didn&#8217;t have.</p>
<p>The solution was the first version of the Hubilo that you see today. Ironically, having so little cash on hand and a very short time frame to work in made the team very resourceful: the engagement tools that it had already built for physical experiences became the centerpiece of how Hubilo would build its own take on videoconferencing.</p>
<p>Jain told me in an interview that these are some of the features that he believes helps set Hubilo&#8217;s own contribution to the world of video meetings apart from the rest of the pack.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have strong engagement features built in the cloud, with a gamification model and analytics to give users insights about how sessions are being watched, we can give visitors certifications to watch a particular session [but not another],&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have gone deep into it. Exhibitors also get, basically, a mini CRM to build leads, their own set of leads, out of an event.&#8221; Organizers can also integrate with lots of other non-mini CRMs like Marketo, Salesforce and Hubspot to supercharge how they, and their interact with people and how people interact with each other, within their virtual events.</p>
<p>All of Hubilo&#8217;s initial focus on in-person events was not for naught, however. Now with many people shifting back into the office, back into lunch meetings, back into conferences in faraway cities and the rest, the company is building out a bigger &#8220;<a href="https://hubilo.com/hybrid-event-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hybrid</a>&#8221; set of features, which bring a lot of its earlier learnings back into the mix.</p>
<p>These now sit alongside the virtual tools to create both more dynamic in-person experiences, as well as a complementary virtual component for those who are not physically there. These include not just video streams of stages, but separate communication tools for those in both &#8220;places&#8221; to converge; virtual and on-stage conference tracks alongside each other, and more.</p>
<p>The opportunities for serving the market in a firmly hybrid environment with a platform that gives organizers a new kind of dynamic control over the experience is reminiscent of the technology that helped push the web into the busy and much-used platform that it is today: there are tools being put into the hands of publishers (in this case event organizers) helps to spur the next stages of what gets created and used. That, along with the strong list of customers, helped propel this round of funding, which Jain told me was oversubscribed.</p>
<p>“We believe strongly that the global distributed workforce is a megatrend that will impact all of us in the future. It is clear that the way we collaborate and connect will need to be rearchitected in order for any global player to succeed,” said Abhi Arun, Managing Partner at Alkeon Capital, in a statement. “In Hubilo, we saw a powerful technology capable of connecting the offline and online worlds, a strong CEO, and an amazing market opportunity that gave us the confidence to invest.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Depression and anxiety were taking a serious toll on peoples&#8217; well-being even before COVID-19, and the pandemic prompted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/mental-health-startups-are-raising-spirits-and-venture-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more interest (and venture capital) </a>in mental health startups. While many of the highest profile mental health startups, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/calm-raises-75m-more-at-2b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calm</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/headspace-and-ginger-are-merging-to-form-headspace-health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Headspace Health</a>, are based in the United States, more attention is also being paid to emotional wellness around the world. In Southeast Asia, for example, a <a href="https://biospectrumasia.com/opinion/30/18823/changing-face-of-mental-health-assistance-in-asia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growing list of startups</a> is increasing access to mental healthcare and support. One of them, <a href="https://www.thoughtfull.world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ThoughtFull</a>, announced today it has raised $1.1 million USD in seed funding, which it says one of the largest seed rounds raised by a digital mental health startup in Southeast Asia so far.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019, ThoughtFull’s ThoughtFullChat app connects users to mental health professionals for coaching sessions or therapy, and also has self-guided tools. The startup’s app for mental health professionals, called ThoughtFullCare Pro, enables them to manage and scale their online practices. ThoughtFullChat is available for download through the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/vn/app/thoughtfullchat-mental-health/id1511373922" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=world.thoughtfull.user" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>, or through insurers and employee benefit programs.</p>
<p>Investors in its seed round include The Hive SEA, Boston-based Flybridge and Vulpes Investment Management, along with family offices and angel investors in the Asia Pacific region.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216559" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Before launching ThoughtFull, founder and chief executive officer Joan Low was an investment banker, including six years at J.P. Morgan in Hong Kong. Low told TechCrunch in an email that she felt compelled to leave finance after observing how difficult it was to access mental healthcare in Southeast Asia, compared to “the breakneck speed of digital mental health innovations happening places such as the U.S. and Europe where I have spent time living, working and studying.”</p>
<p>ThoughtFull’s main operating markets are Singapore and Malaysia, but it now has users in 43 countries. Its app, which launched in 2020, is available in five languages: English, Bahasa Malaysia, Bahasa Indonesia, Mandarin and Cantonese, along with coaches who are also fluent in Tamil, Thai, Vietnamese and Tagalog.</p>
<p>Low said ThoughtFull works closely with local healthcare systems to ensure that its services are tailored to each market. For example, it will partner with The Hive Southeast Asia and Penjana Capital, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance, to digitize the country’s mental health ecosystem after the pandemic made access to care, including in-person consultations, more difficult.</p>
<p>“Healthcare systems are inherently complex given the various stakeholders, structures and outcomes that are involved. That said, healthcare in Asia is particularly intricate because of the diversity in not just culture, but also systems—from care delivery to payor and research models,” said Low. “This is why you see less of the foreign players coming into Asian healthcare in a big way as barriers to entry are high.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The latest round was led by Hana Financial Investment, along with Nice Investment. Returning backers Smilegate Investment, KT Investment, Shinhan Capital and Korea Development Bank also participated.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Series C brings its total funding to about $58.5 million, and the company’s valuation is now estimated at $209 billion, CEO Youngbeen Kim told TechCrunch. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215994" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company will continue to invest in its technology development for the next three years, about an additional $85 million (100 billion won), Kim added.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Founded in November 2015 by Kim, Fount launched its first beta robo-advisor service in February 2016. The following month, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jim-rogers-6">Jim Rogers</a>, an advisor of Fount, invested in the company. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">After gaining regulatory approvals for advising investment in November 2017, Fount launched its mobile app in June 2018. </span></p>
<p>The pandemic spurred the trend that people set up an emergency fund or create an investment portfolio to grow their wealth and save for retirement through contactless investment services such as robo-advisers. South Korea&#8217;s three robo-adviser startups, including Fount, exceeded a total of $1 billion in assets under management in January 2021, up 402.9% year on year, based on a local media <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20210117000248">report</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fount surpassed $730 million assets under management as of March 2021. As per its press release, its core market is people aged 20-49, including about 66.8% of millennials. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Its AI-powered platform invests on users’ behalf by using algorithms and data for people who know they need to invest money to grow their wealth but don’t know much about investing. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Fount’s AI-based BlueWhale product analyzes more than 52,000 cases of global economic data and market indices and automatically proposes a customized and diversified portfolio that it can later rebalance as necessary. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company offers its robo-advisor service to approximately 20 South Korea-based B2B clients, including the lead investor Hana Financial investment, Samsung Life Insurance, MetLife and Hyundai Motor Securities. The company is in talks with additional financial companies for having partnerships. It also claims that it has 260,000 registered users as of June 2021. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Global robo-advisors assets under management are projected to increase to $2.8 trillion in 2025 from $1.37 trillion in 2021, based on its statement citing <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/fintech/digital-investment/robo-advisors/worldwide?currency=usd">Statista report</a>. South Korean robo-advisors’ assets under management are expected to grow up to $25 billion in 2025 from $8.36 billion in 2021. </span></p>
<p>When asked about overseas expansions, Kim said it focuses on the home market now and does not have a concrete plan for global penetration.</p>

<h2>Relativity Space completes Stage 1 testing of Terran 1 rocket</h2>
<p>Relativity Space said Friday it had completed Stage 1 testing of the Terran 1 rocket, including hydro proof testing, cryogenic proof testing and flight pressure testing. From here, the company needs to complete post-integration testing, which will take place at Cape Canaveral in Florida.</p>
<p>Relativity is aiming to launch the world&#8217;s first entirely 3D-printed rocket to orbit in early 2022. Watch Relativity engineers lift Stage 1 onto the test stand here:</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/william-shatner-to-fly-on-blue-origins-next-human-spaceflight-on-october-12/">Yes, you read that right.</a> The 90-year-old actor, known for having played Captain James T. Kirk on “Star Trek,” will be joining Chris Boshuizen and Glen de Vries on a launch that is scheduled to fly on October 12. If all goes to plan, he will best Wally Funk as the oldest person to go to space. (Funk, of course, hitched a ride to orbit also with Blue Origin.)</p>
<p>Blue Origin’s own Audrey Powers, who serves as the company’s vice president of New Shepard Mission &amp; Flight Operations, will round out the four-person crew.</p>
<div class="article-content">
<p>The next launch of Blue Origin&#8217;s New Shepard rocket comes as the company faces a torrent of scrutiny after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/chief-blue-origin-complaint-author-disputes-cause-of-termination-while-the-space-companys-ceo-does-damage-control/">21 current and former employees went public</a> with accusations of safety concerns and sexual harassment at the company. The FAA said it was “reviewing the information” detailed in the essay, but so far there&#8217;s no signs of anything interrupting the launch schedule.</p>
<h2>NASA will be smashing a spacecraft into a satellite</h2>

<p>File this one under, <em>God, I love science</em>. NASA has now set a date for what it&#8217;s calling <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/nasas-armageddon-style-asteroid-deflection-mission-takes-off-in-november/">DART, the Double Asteroid Redirection Test</a>, a mission that feels like it&#8217;s ripped straight from a Hollywood script. Here&#8217;s how it&#8217;s going to go down: NASA will launch two satellites to a relatively nearby pair of planetoids &#8212; a large asteroid and a &#8220;moonlet&#8221; in its orbit. The moonlet is small, exactly the kind of space body that poses a threat to Earth, so NASA will be testing the possibility of intercepting one by smashing into it at nearly 15,000 miles per hour.</p>
<p>DART is scheduled to launch from Vandenberg in Southern California at 10:20 PM on November 23, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9, after being delayed this summer.</p>
<h2>The UAE wants to send a probe to the asteroid belt in 2028</h2>
<p>Speaking of asteroids, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/the-uae-aims-to-launch-a-probe-to-the-asteroid-belt-between-mars-and-jupiter-in-2028/">United Arab Emirates Space Agency is planning its most ambitious mission yet</a>. The agency, which was only formed in 2014, wants to send a spacecraft to the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter in 2028. While the exact scientific goals of the mission have not yet been announced, any data the spacecraft collects could help deepen our understanding of the origins of the universe. That’s because asteroids are thought by some scientists to be celestial leftovers from when the solar system was formed.</p>
<p>After launching, the spacecraft will have a long and winding journey: It will travel 3.6 billion kilometers over five years, boomeranging around both Venus and Earth to build enough velocity to eventually arrive at the asteroid belt beyond Mars in 2030. The UAE aims to land the spacecraft on an asteroid in 2033.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for October 11, 2021! It’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/equity-monday-i-hear-this-fintech-thing-is-going-to-be-big/">Monday, y’all</a>, and that means we’re all strapping back into work mode. Looking ahead, we’re expecting two public debuts this week (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/inside-gitlabs-ipo-filing/">GitLab and AvidXchange</a>), and we’re just heading into earnings season. Get hype! – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/apple-appeals-the-epic-games-ruling-and-asks-to-put-ordered-app-store-changes-on-hold/"><strong>Apple appeals Epic decision:</strong></a> Remember when Apple managed to avoid a monopoly ruling and wound up being told by a judge to let third-party developers tell users that there were other ways to buy their iOS software? Well, Apple isn’t really big about the idea. So it’s appealing the ruling and asking for a stay. In an era when Microsoft is building inroads with developers, Apple appears confident in its market position to the extent that it’s comfortable moving in the opposite direction. (I’m reminded of the old-timey phrase my dad learned from a farmer: “Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.”)</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/reddit-hires-former-google-cloud-exec-as-its-first-chief-product-officer/"><strong>Reddit hires former Google Cloud exec:</strong></a> Reddit, a place where communities can run forums for anything under the sun (from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/">the niche</a> to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/">the mainstream</a>), is building out its executive team. Normally, we’d add “in anticipation of an IPO” to that comment, but given that Reddit is having a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/reddit-is-raising-up-to-700m-in-series-f-funding/">smashing time raising private capital</a>, we doubt that any sort of liquidity event is in the near-term offing.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/nerdwallets-ipo-filing-reveals-high-margin-content-business-accelerating-marketing-spend/">Inside NerdWallet’s IPO filing:</a> </strong>Not every venture-backed company is building enterprise software. NerdWallet is one such company. It’s essentially a content play that writes stuff for consumers and SMBs in search of financial products and advice. The goal is to provide unbiased commentary &#8212; and make fat commissions. It’s a pretty good business overall, though its IPO filing details the impacts of both COVID (on growth) and a recent push on the advertising front (harming profits).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/how-los-angeles-is-preparing-for-the-air-taxi-takeoff/"><strong>LA works to figure out air taxis:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Once, when visiting Brazil, I was told that the São Paulo elite get around by helicopter. That made sense given that the traffic I experienced in that lovely city was fang-meltingly miserable. LA is something akin to the American São Paulo from a traffic perspective. So it’s not a huge shock that LA is ahead of the market on figuring out how air taxis are going to work. If they are going to work at all.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/varda-space-industries-will-send-its-first-space-factory-to-orbit-on-a-spacex-falcon-9-rocket/"><strong>Space factories?</strong></a> Varda Space is going to get its first space factories into orbit in 2023 thanks to SpaceX launch systems and hardware help from Rocket Lab. It’s going to send up three vesicles, which will include a factory (manufacturing?) module and a way of coming back to Earth. In time, space factories will make stuff that is supposed to stay in space, but it appears for now that Varda wants to do work in low grav that is hard to do elsewhere and bring the goods back planetside when done.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/frankieone-nabs-16m-to-provide-fintechs-with-id-and-fraud-management-as-a-service/"><strong>FrankieOne raises $16M for fintech fraud prevention:</strong></a> Breaking out a particular problem from a busy industry and offering a solution as a service is good business. Many startups work along those lines. One such company is FrankieOne, which TechCrunch writes offers financial technology companies “ID and fraud management as a service.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/swile-raises-200-million-for-its-employee-benefits-card-and-app/"><strong>French round No. 1:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Swile has raised $200 million from SoftBank for its employee card service that puts benefits on said plastic. What do cards from the new unicorn unlock for staff? TechCrunch writes that benefits like “meal vouchers, gift cards and sustainable mobility vouchers” are typical.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/10/mobile-gaming-startup-homa-games-raises-50-million/">French round No. 2:</a> </strong>Homa Games has raised $50 million in a round led by Northzone for its mobile games business. The company has racked up hundreds of millions of downloads just this year.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/tiger-global-backs-african-fintech-mono-in-15m-series-a-round/"><strong>Mono raises $15M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Er, no, Mono has nothing to do with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/epstein-barr/about-mono.html">mono</a>. <em>Instead</em>, it’s a startup in Africa that is building a Plaid-like service for its continent. Which is super neat, and, frankly, an easy thing to fund for VCs, we reckon. African fintech has been hot lately, so who wouldn’t want to put capital into its connective tissue?</li>

<h2>BaaS served three ways: A closer look at a rapidly evolving market</h2>
<p>Ryan Lawler continues his exploration of the emerging banking-as-a-service sector by examining three different BaaS strategies:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216337" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>Turnkey banking as a service.</li>
<li>Playing matchmaker between banks and fintechs.</li>
<li>Buying a bank to get into BaaS.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;If you’re looking to spin up a new fintech app or want to add banking, debit cards or other financial services to your existing business, knowing how each of these competitors is positioned to work with customers and bank partners is key,&#8221; he writes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">HR technology has been thrown into the spotlight in the last 20 months: COVID-19 has changed the way we work, and so how we manage people in the world of work has had to change, too. Today, a Munich-based startup called <a href="https://www.personio.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Personio</a>, which has built a big business out of how to address that issue specifically for small and medium enterprises, is announcing $270 million in funding on the heels of strong demand for its services, and to help it fuel its next steps. With this Series E, Personio&#8217;s valuation is jumping up to $6.3 billion, making it one of the most valuable startups &#8212; HR or otherwise &#8212; in Europe at the moment.</p>
<p>The funding is being led by Greenoaks Capital Partners, with new investors Altimeter Capital and Alkeon also participating. Index Ventures, Accel, Meritech, Lightspeed, Northzone and Global Founders Capital &#8212; all previous backers &#8212; were also in the round. Index and Meritech led the company&#8217;s previous round, which was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/personio-raises-125m-on-a-1-7b-valuation-for-an-hr-platform-targeting-smes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> only in January of this year</a>. That Series D round was at a $1.7 billion valuation &#8212; meaning the figure has grown by 3.7x in 10 months, a mark of how fast Personio itself has been growing.</p>
<p>Personio today provides recruiting and onboarding, payroll, absence tracking and other major HR functions in an all-in-one platform aimed at European SMEs (typically 10-2,000 employees). It now has 5,000 customers &#8212; compared to 3,000 in January. While Personio will continue to grow that range of tools, it will also expand into what CEO Hanno Renner describes as &#8220;people workflow automation.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216060" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Essentially, this is about speeding up the process of doing HR-dependent work in other applications that may exist outside of Personio by automatically populating HR information and triggering actions within those apps, which might have otherwise taken much longer to complete manually. This could, for example, involve creating and issuing an employment contract, or turning access to certain apps on or off when a person joins or leaves an organization.</p>
<p>If Personio&#8217;s existing platform could be thought of as &#8220;the Workday for SMEs&#8221; &#8212; a suite of HR tools that work together for the needs of SMEs in the same way that enterprises have with their own large, multi-faceted platforms aimed at them &#8212; then the automation tools that Personio is now adding might be thought of as the company&#8217;s answer to UiPath or ServiceNow for SMEs, using machine learning, robotic process automation and other techniques to take away some of the more repetitive busy work involved in tasks related to HR.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;We&#8217;ve been working on it for 12 months, and we now have 5,000 customers that we learn from using our product as it is,&#8221; Renner said in an interview. The crux of the issue is about getting software in different silos to work together more quickly, so that when, for example, a contract needs to go out to a prospective hire, foot dragging doesn&#8217;t mean the hire might sign elsewhere, or a fired employee can&#8217;t still get into a company&#8217;s IT system. &#8220;HR processes go beyond HR. They involve other functions and departments. Delays not only waste time, they could have detrimental outcomes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pitch for Personio up to now has been that it&#8217;s part of the group of enterprise startups that have tapped a lucrative seam of customers, SMEs, by simply building products for them. SMEs as a sector is huge &#8212; there are <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/38365/attachments/2/translations/en/renditions/native" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 25 million SMEs in Europe alone</a>, accounting for more than 99% of all enterprises &#8212; but it is often overlooked, because it is fragmented around a wide range of verticals and interests, with varying IT budgets that are sometimes very small or not there at all.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In the world of HR, Renner says that was an even more acute state of affairs. Most SMEs track HR-related data on Excel spreadsheets, or just plain paper. &#8220;What we see is that day-to-day, 70% of SMEs don&#8217;t have any kind of HR solution,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But digital transformation hasn&#8217;t completely overlooked the sector, and so more forward-thinking SMEs have gradually adopted sales, finance and CRM software, and that has &#8220;trickled down&#8221; to thinking about HR, he said.</p>
<p>Personio now believes that this will also help with its pitch to sell its customers automation. A typical SME, the company estimates, now uses on average some 40 different apps, with many of these needing data from HR systems to work. The idea is that Personio will now be able to provide those connectors to speed up how all of it works.</p>
<p>The company has a lot of growing left to do: When you consider that there are 1.7 million businesses in the subset of SMEs that Personio targets (10-2,000 employees), that is just a tiny percentage of the market.</p>
<p>It means that growth is likely to come to Personio, with or without the newer automation piece taking off, so the funding &#8212; raised opportunistically, before Personio needed it &#8212; will be handy. What the new technology does give it, regardless, is a window into potentially also providing automation services to SMEs beyond those of HR over time, and so this significant hike in valuation is likely related to that diversification as much as for the bigger opportunity to build more HR inroads into the SME space.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“While small businesses are the backbone of the European economy, they have been underserved and overlooked by legacy players for too long. Personio democratizes enterprise capabilities and delivers a step change in productivity, simplifying HR workflows across the full employee lifecycle,&#8221; said Neil Mehta, founder and managing partner of Greenoaks, in a statement. &#8220;</span>We are lucky to be partners with many of the leading private technology companies in the world, and I am confident that the Personio team is just getting started on their mission. Launching the People Workflow Automation category will deliver even more value to businesses across Europe. We are proud to join Personio at this thrilling stage of their journey and look forward to being partners for many years to come.”</p>
<p>Longer term, that could involve going public &#8212; but the emphasis there is on <em>longer</em>. Personio has now raised $500 million and Renner said that it is at least 18-24 months away from thinking about that next step. &#8220;We are not in a hurry to go public,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google TV is adding <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-tv/more-you-personalized-profiles/">multiple user profiles</a> to allow everyone in a household to access their own personalized space with their Google account. Google says with personalized profiles, users will get TV show and movie recommendations tailored just for them, easy access to their personal watchlist and help from their Google Assistant.</p>
<p>The search giant outlined in a <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-tv/more-you-personalized-profiles/">blog post</a> that as users watch TV, their profile takes their interests and preferences into account to help them discover more content that they’re likely to enjoy. Parents can also set up a kids profile to give their children access to movies and shows under their supervision. Each Google account has its own watchlist so that content you want to watch later will show up in your own profile and stay separate from other users’ lists.</p>
<p>Google also notes that you can “ask for recommendations by saying, ‘what should I watch?’ or get help streamlining your day by saying “show me my day.” Your profile is linked to your account’s Google Assistant, so you’ll get the personalized answers you are looking for.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216370" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company says it’s easy to set up a new profile as your downloaded apps and app login details will be used across profiles so you won’t have to start from scratch each time you set up a new profile.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216394" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216394" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2216394 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tv-ambient-mode.png" alt="" width="1000" height="590" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tv-ambient-mode.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tv-ambient-mode.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tv-ambient-mode.png?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tv-ambient-mode.png?resize=768,453 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tv-ambient-mode.png?resize=680,401 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/google-tv-ambient-mode.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216394" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Google also stated that it’s making its screensaver-like feature &#8220;Ambient Mode&#8221; more useful by adding more personalized information and recommendations cards. For instance, your TV will now keep you up to date with info based on your profile on things like the weather, news, sports and more. Users will be able to scroll through on-screen shortcuts to do things like quickly view photos or start playing music. If users are gone for a longer period of time, their TV will fully shift to Ambient Mode’s photos or curated artwork.</p>
<p>Google TV also expanded its live TV options with the integration of streaming service Philo into its live TV features, in addition to YouTube TV and SLING TV. Users who add Philo as their live TV provider will see their shows on the Live TV tab and their recommendations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Support for profiles and the new ambient mode features will begin rolling out on Chromecast with Google TV and Google TVs from Sony and TCL soon. Profiles will be available globally, while Ambient Mode cards will be first available in the U.S. only.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Have you ever sat in a shared college dorm kitchen space with your roommate and decided to start a business?</p>
<p>I should be clear here: We didn’t really decide to start a business; it was more of a project to create a tool that we could use while studying in school.</p>
<p>Born out of our own frustrations with gathering the right study materials to prepare for exams, Jacques Huppes and I started jotting down what the ideal platform for easily sharing resources like study guides and class notes with other students would look like. We knew we needed to create a simple interface to get started, which was shortly followed by the tedious process of manually uploading hundreds of documents we had gathered from our own previous exam prep and from other friends at the university.</p>
<p>After just three weeks, our idea began to blossom, with friends from other universities asking if we could build the platform to share their school’s study resources as well. We simply asked for their documents and started to subdivide the content based on university. Our company, StuDocu, was officially born and expanding faster than we ever could have imagined.</p>
<p>Our first investment was a USB hard drive, which traveled with us from dorm to dorm — we’d knock on doors to share our story with as many students as possible. We’d use the hard drive to plug into their laptops, copy their files and upload them to the StuDocu website that evening.</p>
<p>While more and more students are now going digital, in 2010 we’d often encounter students with handwritten or printed notes, which we’d collect and carry back on the train ride to Delft to scan and upload in the library. For the first three years, we worked from our dorm rooms in Delft before moving to Amsterdam to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/studocu-raises-50m-as-its-note-sharing-network-for-college-students-passes-15m-users/">grow our business</a>.</p>
<p>We have introduced many iterations of the platform based on feedback and data. In the beginning, we worked based on what we thought was needed, using our own frustration with studying as the guide for how the platform should evolve. One of our other co-founders, Lucas van den Houten, introduced the idea of measuring data we gathered from users via Mixpanel, and from there we were able to give the platform new life. Suddenly, data was telling us where to grow and where to improve. Over the years, we have developed many features and continue to run A/B tests based on the hard data now available to us.</p>
<p>Building a website is a lot of work, but for us, each update had a direct correlation to the increasing uploads and student engagement we set out to achieve. To see those small successes day after day was reassuring.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Magic Leap has had one hell of a journey, and to their credit, it seems investors are still addicted to giving them money.</p>
<p>The augmented reality startup announced today that they have raised $500 million at a $2 billion valuation from existing investors. The round echoes the terms of an October 2014 raise where Magic Leap raised $542 million at a reported $2 billion valuation. Quite a bit has happened in the meantime.</p>
<p>Curiously, Magic Leap decided not to actually disclose any of the specific investors participating in this latest fundraise. At this point, the company has raised $3.5 billion in total funding according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/magic-leap/company_financials">Crunchbase</a>, meaning that most of the investors they&#8217;ve brought in haven&#8217;t fared too well thus far.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216286" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The latest valuation is a far cry from the company&#8217;s $6.7 billion valuation they reached in 2019, but for a startup that nearly shut down last year, it could be a lot worse. Magic Leap fired a healthy chunk of its staff and was forced to raise hundreds of millions at slashed valuation terms last year. The startup also replaced its founder Rony Abovitz with former Microsoft VP Peggy Johnson as CEO.</p>
<p>The company has been trying to turn things around by revamping its messaging with a focus wholly on enterprise audiences after years of trying to compete with Microsoft for military contracts (and failing) and trying to compete with Microsoft for enterprise clients (with some success), all while attempting to also stay on consumer radars by bankrolling expensive games for their very expensive headset.</p>
<p>Alongside news of this new round, we also got a new rendering, via CNBC, of the startup&#8217;s next AR glasses product. The device seems to have gotten a much smaller device footprint, but Magic Leap didn&#8217;t have too much to say on the device&#8217;s new capabilities. In a press release, Magic Leap says that it will roll out the new hardware, called the Magic Leap 2, sometime next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors has started shipping to dealers replacement battery modules for recalled Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicles after delays caused by shutdowns at multiple manufacturing plants as a result of the widespread shortage of semiconductors.</p>
<p>The two battery assembly facilities, in Holland and Hazel Park, Michigan, resumed production at the end of September. At that time, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/gm-extends-chevy-bolt-ev-production-shutdown-through-mid-october/">GM said</a> that replacement battery modules would be shipped to dealers as soon as mid-October.</p>
<p>Vehicles will be prioritized according to “specific build timeframes,” or the batches of vehicles in which it believes defects appear to be clustered, GM said. The replacement process should take around two days at a dealership, and the new batteries will come with an eight-year or 100,000-mile limited warranty. GM is also launching new diagnostic software by mid-November to monitor EV batteries, which will also be installed at a dealership.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216335" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The recall was issued after the automaker discovered two manufacturing defects, a torn anode tab and folded separator, that together can increase the risk of fire. It’s the third time GM has issued a recall for the vehicle, and the most comprehensive, spanning all Bolt EV and EUV models made since 2017.</p>
<p>The news will surely be welcome to Bolt drivers, who were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/nhtsa-urges-some-chevy-bolt-owners-to-park-their-car-away-from-home-citing-fire-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recommended by the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration</a> to park their vehicles away from their homes in case of fire risk. GM also advised Bolt owners to not park within 50 feet of other vehicles, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/gm-tells-some-bolt-owners-to-park-50-feet-away-from-other-cars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg reported</a>.</p>
<p>In all, GM is anticipated to spend around $1.8 billion on costs associated with fixing defective Bolt batteries. The automaker said it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/gm-says-it-will-seek-reimbursement-from-lg-chem-for-1b-chevy-bolt-recall-losses/">seek reimbursement</a> from its battery partner, LG Chem, to the tune of around $1 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">South Africa’s telecommunication provider Telkom SA SOC Ltd has since October discontinued Netflix Inc. from its phone and internet set-top box, said a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-11/telkom-says-netflix-no-longer-available-on-south-africa-provider?sref=gni836kR">report</a>.</p>
<p>Telkom&#8217;s Content Executive Wanda Mkhize said in a statement that the partnership between the two firms would not be renewed and declined to provide further details, Bloomberg reported.</p>
<p>We have reached out to both companies and will update this post as we learn more.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216240" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Netflix has been exploring growth opportunities across Africa over the last few years in the hope of growing its subscriber base and revenues. It’s not clear whether it has plans to build a different route to consumers and existing subscribers in South Africa now that its relationship with Telkom has ended.</p>
<p>Last month, the company announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/netflix-free-plan-kenya/">free plan</a>, available on Android mobile phones, in Kenya to attract new subscribers &#8212; who have access to “about one-quarter of its TV shows and movies”.</p>
<p>Netflix, in a bid to win and retain subscribers across Africa, now features content produced in various markets across the continent, including South Africa’s &#8220;Queen Sono&#8221;, Kenya’s &#8220;Sincerely Daisy&#8221; and Nigeria’s &#8220;Two weeks in Lagos&#8221;.</p>
<p>The video streaming service is looking to tap 303 million people, about 28% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa, connected to mobile internet according to the 2021 GSMA mobile economy <a href="https://data.gsmaintelligence.com/research/research/research-2021/the-mobile-economy-2021">report</a>. The number of people connected to mobile internet is expected to grow to about 40% of this population by 2025, offering a bigger market to internet-based businesses like Netflix.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cheaper and faster internet across the continent has provided a space for video streaming services like Netflix and Amazon.inc to gain a foothold across the continent.</p>
<p>Netflix still has another partner in the country. MultiChoice Group Limited, the continent’s largest pay-TV provider, now offers Netflix and Amazon.Inc as part of its paid video services in South Africa after signing deals with the two firms mid last year. The move aims to retain MultiChoice’s subscriber numbers, creating more of a moat around its own budget streaming service, Showmax, introduced in 2015.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google has pulled several &#8220;stalkerware&#8221; ads that violated its policies by promoting apps that encouraged prospective users to spy on their spouses&#8217; phone.</p>
<p>These consumer-grade spyware apps are often marketed to parents wishing to monitor their child&#8217;s calls, messages, apps, photos and location, often under the guise of protecting against predators. But these apps, which are often designed to be installed surreptitiously and without the device owner&#8217;s consent, have been repurposed by abusers to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/kidsguard-spyware-app-phones/">spy on the phones of their spouses</a>.</p>
<p>The rise in the use of so-called &#8220;stalkerware&#8221; (or spouseware) prompted an industrywide response in recent years to combat the spread of phone monitoring apps. Antivirus makers have worked to better <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/coalition-against-stalkerware-expands-membership">detect stalkerware</a>, and federal authorities are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/spyfone-ftc-stalkerware/">taking action</a> against spyware makers that further expose their victims to security threats. Last August, Google banned ads in users&#8217; search results that promoted apps that are designed &#8220;with the express purpose of tracking or monitoring another person or their activities without their authorization.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216253" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But TechCrunch found five app makers were still advertising their stalkerware apps as recently as last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do not allow ads promoting spyware for partner surveillance. We immediately removed the ads that violated this policy and will continue to track emerging behaviors to prevent bad actors from trying to evade our detection systems,&#8221; a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/spyfone-ftc-stalkerware/">FTC bans spyware maker SpyFone, and orders it to notify hacked victims</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/kidsguard-spyware-app-phones/">A ‘stalkerware’ app leaked phone data from thousands of victims</a></li>

</ul>

	</p>
<p>Google said its <a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/6016086">policy on enabling dishonest behavior</a>, which governs the promotion of spyware, bans ads from promoting intimate partner surveillance, but does not extend to ads that promote tracking a child&#8217;s activity or workplaces monitoring their employees&#8217; devices, the spokesperson confirmed. The policy also exempts private investigation services, though Google would not say if or how it determines for what purpose an app is used.</p>
<p>Vocal supporters of Google&#8217;s efforts against stalkerware have expressed concerns with the policy&#8217;s enforcement. Malwarebytes, a founding member of the <a href="https://stopstalkerware.org/">Coalition Against Stalkerware</a>, a group of companies committed to combating the growing threat of stalkerware, said last year that <a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/stalkerware/2020/07/stalkerware-advertising-ban-by-google-a-welcome-if-incomplete-step/">the policy was &#8220;incomplete&#8221;</a> since it allowed stalkerware makers to &#8220;skirt the rules by changing the face of what they’re selling, without changing the core technology within.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spokesperson for Google declined to provide specifics of how Google&#8217;s enforcement works, but said it looks at a combination of factors to determine if an ad violates its policies, such as looking at the text and images of the ad, how the product is promoted and the landing pages of the ads when clicked.</p>
<p>TechCrunch found that several stalkerware apps used a variety of techniques to successfully evade Google&#8217;s ban on advertising apps for partner surveillance and were able to get Google ads approved.</p>
<p>In one case, mSpy, a spyware app that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/05/mobile-spyware-maker-leaks-2-million-records/">had a major security lapse in 2018</a>, ran Google ads that linked to an interstitial web page on an entirely separate domain from mSpy&#8217;s website, which tripped up Google from detecting that the app was also being marketed to spy on &#8220;your kids, husband or wife, grandma or grandpa.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another stalkerware maker, ClevGuard, which in 2020 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/20/kidsguard-spyware-app-phones/">spilled the phone data on thousands of victims</a>, ran Google ads that linked to a page on its website that said the app could be used on a spouse to &#8220;dispel any doubts in a relationship.&#8221; The page was hidden from Google&#8217;s search index using a &#8220;robots&#8221; file that tells search engines what should and shouldn&#8217;t appear in search results. TechCrunch found two other stalkerware apps using this same technique to run ads, which Google said also violated its policies.</p>
<p>Other violating ads were more overt. PhoneSpector, a spyware maker based on Long Island, NY, ran ads that promoted the app as a way to &#8220;catch a cheater.&#8221;</p>
<p>As of September, Google said it <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10957124">will suspend</a> the accounts of advertisers for three months who repeatedly violate its ad policies, including for promoting spyware for targeting spouses.</p>
<p>None of the stalkerware companies responded to requests for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The potential for telehealth across Africa is vast and promising as mobile connectivity deepens, and innovations that could potentially bridge the doctor-patient ratio gap increase, according to a <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/nl/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/deloitte-nl-mhealth.pdf">Deloitte report</a>.</p>
<p>One company that is planning to drive the wave of telemedicine across the continent, as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on, is <a href="https://mpharma.com/">mPharma</a>, a Ghanaian health tech startup that is set to open 100 virtual centers across seven markets in Africa over the next six months.</p>
<p>As it rolls out these centers, mPharma said its end goal is to deliver quality primary care in communities they serve by providing medical examinations, a service the startup&#8217;s co-founder and CEO Gregory Rockson said lacks in most telemedicine structures.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2214172" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We saw this as an opportunity to leverage our pharmacies as virtual doctor offices so that patients could get examined remotely during a virtual consultation. This is what makes mPharma&#8217;s telemedicine unique,” Rockson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>He said that mPharma already provides about 10,000 physician consultations to patients at the startup’s network of pharmacies, and that the new system will enable them to do it electronically too, reaching more people.</p>
<p>Originally founded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/ghanas-mpharma-partners-with-ethiopian-conglomerate-to-enter-its-eighth-market/">to manage</a> prescription drug inventory for pharmacies and their suppliers, mPharma also runs retail pharmacy operations and provides market intelligence to hospitals, pharmacies and patients.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregory-rockson-43804449/?originalSubdomain=gh">Rockson</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-shoukimas-33933a35?originalSubdomain=il"> Daniel Shoukimas</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-nishiyama-finucane-295ab768/">James Finucane</a>, mPharma is one of the well-funded startups across Africa, raising over $50 million since inception; this includes <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/05/26/mpharma-raises-17m/">a Series C round</a> of $17 million, led by U.K.&#8217;s development arm CDC Group last year. Other <a href="https://medium.com/mpharma-insights/mpharma-raises-6-6-million-in-series-a-funding-463dafda6e0b">existing investors</a> include Silicon Valley backer Jim Breyer of Breyer Capital, Shravin Bharti Mittal of Bharti Global Limited &#8212; an Indian Conglomerate, Social Capital and Golden Palm Investments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>MPharma also enjoys expertise backing from well-experienced professions in the pharmaceutical industry. They include <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/helena-foulkes-54316910">Helena Foulkes</a>, former president of CVS, the largest pharmacy retail chain in the U.S. and Daniel Vasella, ex-CEO and chairman of Novartis; both are members of the board.</p>
<p>The tech startup plans to use its network of pharmacies to build what they describe as a digital primary care service. It will <a href="https://medium.com/mpharma-insights/telemedicine-2-0-mpharmas-vision-to-transform-primary-care-in-africa-576fad3152cb">offer</a> all-in-one diagnostics services using digital “stethoscope, otoscope, thermometer, and examination camera with built-in illumination for high-definition skin and throat images powered by Tytocare”, a telehealth service.</p>
<p>The doctor will also be in a place to request rapid diagnostics tests to be carried out, a service that will be supported by a licensed community health nurse as the medic consults remotely.</p>
<p>Patients in Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Zambia, Malawi, Rwanda and Ethiopia, where mPharma has a presence, are set to benefit from the virtual consultations. It is raising more funding to further grow its business across the continent.</p>
<p>“We currently have five centers open. We have done an assessment of all our pharmacies and plan to establish the Mutti Doctor locations (the virtual centers) based on the needs of the community. We have already identified the first 100 locations,” said Rockson.</p>
<p>The tech startup’s efforts will add to services of tens of other startups across Africa offering variations of telemedicine, like Vezeeta, an Egyptian doctor appointment booking startup. Vezeeta fast-tracked the rollout of home-visit solutions, teleconsultation and online pharmacies across Egypt and Saudi Arabia last year after landing $40 million in Series D funding.</p>
<p>Quro Medical, a South Africa startup, also offers home care complemented by telemedicine service, a step it had to take following the COVID-19 pandemic to reduce the exposure of COVID virus on patients and the doctors. The health startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/south-africas-quro-medical-comes-out-of-stealth-with-1-1m-to-expand-its-hospital-at-home-service/">received $1.1 million</a> in April this year to help the company increase its reach and improve care among its patients.</p>
<p>Rocket Health, with a presence in Uganda and Kenya, also offers consultation, pharmacy and lab services electronically and through a USSD service, making these services accessible to people without internet connection too.</p>
<p>As the pandemic rages on, the industry is expected to continue growing, especially in emerging markets with poor health infrastructure and where the doctor to patient ratio remains grim, when compared to the richer nations.</p>
<p>According to World Health Organisation <a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/medical-doctors-(per-10-000-population)">data</a>, countries across sub-Saharan Africa have an average of 0.23 doctors for every 10,000 people. This is against the best ratio of 84.2 doctors in some of the most developed countries.</p>
<p>Telemedicine is envisaged to bridge this gap and inspire partnerships and birth more startups like Bima, which provide other ranges of services, including health insurance policies. The Europe-based startup, which offers services in emerging markets, recently received $30 million in funding.</p>
<p>The African pharmaceutical market is also expected to grow exponentially as the population balloons, thus providing a space for innovation and a market for startups offering mobile health solutions.</p>
<p>Across Africa, the Deloitte report says, East Africa is the most promising region in terms of healthcare investment owing to its integration and the growing economy, supported by various sectors, including agriculture and tourism. Increased demand for services and products as consumers get more spending power will also increase in healthcare and telecom spend, it said.</p>
<p>As more startups are launched, a market intelligence report by Salient on innovations in healthcare across sub-Saharan Africa said that they will need to come up with ways to retain customers as competition grows and also come up with methods to partner. The partnerships could be with e-commerce companies for the faster distribution of products and to develop digital ordering, payment and fulfillment systems.</p>
<p>“If mHealth’s opportunity is to be fully exploited, stakeholders will need to proactively seek strategic partnerships, public-private or otherwise, and build cooperative and sustainable business models,” the Deloitte report said.</p>
<p>Deloitte remains upbeat that the industry will take off and recommended that startups such as mPharma use data for better public health supply chain planning and visibility, to forge partnerships and to inform company growth.</p>
<p>Rockson hopes that other telemedicine services can utilize the infrastructure his startup has set up to improve the services they offer to patients.</p>
<p>“We are not looking to compete directly with existing telemedicine providers but rather enable them to plug their service into our remote medical examination solution to close the gap they currently face when providing a teleconsult.”</p>
<p>MPharma, which employs 400 people, says it is set to create an additional 340 opportunities over the next six months by employing a wide-range of specialists, including engineers and clinicians.</p>
<p>It recently entered the ninth market after it was contracted by the Gabonese government to build a drug supply chain infrastructure. This comes months after the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/ghanas-mpharma-partners-with-ethiopian-conglomerate-to-enter-its-eighth-market/">entered the Ethiopian market</a> with plans to franchise its brand and focus more on building and refining its infrastructure for a seamless sourcing and distribution system. This in the hope of solving the challenges facing the pharmaceutical market across Africa, including unpredictable supply chains, exorbitant prices and low orders.</p>

		Luca Rossettini is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.dorbit.space/">D-Orbit</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">It was Branson versus Bezos, rocket against rocket, in the race to send the first billionaire into space.</p>
<p>Blue Origin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/jeff-bezos-and-his-brother-will-fly-on-blue-origins-first-human-spaceflight-with-auction-winner/">announced</a> on June 7 that Jeff Bezos, its founder, would fly on the firm’s first crewed mission scheduled for July 20. That same day, <a href="http://www.parabolicarc.com/2021/06/07/virgin-galactics-richard-branson-aims-to-fly-to-space-before-jeff-bezos/">Parabolic Arc</a> reported that Virgin Galactic was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/branson-aims-to-beat-bezos-to-orbit-in-final-stretch-of-billionaire-space-race/">planning</a> to send Richard Branson on a suborbital flight on July 11. And both aimed to beat the third space-going billionaire, Elon Musk.</p>
<p>More than half a century after Apollo 11 landed on the moon, space exploration is clearly on the upswing again. However, today’s missions reflect far more than the ambitions of billionaires, even if Musk, Bezos and Branson have generated the most headlines for their personal space plans.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215991" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Instead, we’re seeing the emergence of a true space economy. This new sector is in its exponential growth phase, and what unifies current commercial projects is the influx of investments in new technologies and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Today’s explorers have plans for expansion that range from the outer limits of our imagination — travel to other planets or colonizing Mars — to the launches of thousands of telecommunication, global navigation and Earth observation satellites, with massive investments being made.</p>
<p>The size of the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ast/media/2018_ast_compendium.pdf">global space economy</a> &#8212; which combines satellite services and ground equipment, government space budgets and global navigation satellites equipment &#8212; is estimated to be about $345 billion. Startup space ventures <a href="https://brycetech.com/reports/report-documents/Bryce_Start_Up_Space_2020.pdf">brought in $5.7 billion</a> in 2019, easily besting 2018’s $3.5 billion record. By 2040, Morgan Stanley estimates that the global space industry could generate revenue of <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investing-in-space">more than $1 trillion</a>.</p>
<p>In other words, we’re at the start of a gold rush in outer space — and our track record for the sustainable development of any environment during gold rushes hasn’t been particularly noteworthy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The threat of catastrophic space collisions is growing</h2>
<p>We are at a critical tipping point for ensuring the safe and sustainable development of new business opportunities in space. Many of these activities use the same regions of the Earth’s orbit, which is not an infinite space. According to <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/news/orbital_debris.html">NASA</a>, more than 100 million pieces of orbital debris of about 1 mm or larger are tracked by the Department of Defense’s global Space Surveillance Network (SSN) sensors. Much more debris &#8212; too small to be tracked, but large enough to threaten human spaceflight and robotic missions &#8212; exists in the near-Earth space environment.</p>
<p>In an environment where both debris and spacecraft are traveling at velocities in excess of 15,700 mph in low-Earth orbit, even a 5 mm nut can shred a solar panel like it was made of paper. In fact, NASA reports that millimeter-sized orbital debris represents the highest mission-ending risk to most robotic spacecraft operating in low-Earth orbit. As space becomes more and more congested, unsafe or irresponsible actions by any one actor could have catastrophic consequences.</p>
<p>Advances in reusable rockets, which lowered the cost to launch 1 kilogram of payload mass to orbit, and the miniaturization of satellites have all helped to create this threat of a traffic jam in Earth’s orbit. Nearly <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/10/visualizing-easrth-satellites-sapce-spacex/">3,000 active satellites</a> are currently in orbit above our planet, and this number will likely skyrocket in the coming years. A 230% increase in satellite launches per year is expected by 2025, with 24,000 satellite launches now in planning, <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/space-infrastructure-is-the-next-investment-frontier-and-spacs-are-a-launch-pad-11618294752#:~:text=By%202025%2C%20experts%20predict%20a,applied%20to%20fly%2040%2C000%20satellites.">according to MarketWatch</a>. And that figure doesn’t even include launches by SpaceX, OneWeb or Kuiper. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/f/613591/spacexs-starlink-satellites-are-clearly-visible-in-the-skyand-astronomers-arent-happy/">SpaceX’s</a> Starlink alone has applied to fly 40,000 satellites.</p>
<p>The cost to launch 22 tons to low-Earth orbit has <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/blockchain/2019/06/space-tech-transforming-satellite-launches-with-blockchain/">declined</a> from $200 million to about $60 million thanks to reusable rockets. Satellite applications that once required one massive high-performance satellite with a cost in the hundreds of millions of dollars can now be tackled with constellations of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/06/small-satellites-growth-space/#:~:text=It%20says%20it%20can%20build,able%20to%20endure%20for%20years.">cheaper</a> ($1 million), smaller, lower-performance satellites working together to provide a global service.</p>
<p>While the performance of a single smaller satellite is still inferior to that of a much larger one, the use of data from multiple satellites can often produce comparable results. Moreover, the architecture of a constellation is highly scalable, so as soon as newer generations of satellites are launched, the performance of the infrastructure as a whole increases exponentially.</p>
<h2>Sustainable development requires new technologies and better governance</h2>
<p>Sustainable economic expansion will require innovative solutions to support traditional and new customers throughout the life cycle of a space mission, from a careful analysis of a mission&#8217;s requirements to end-of-life decommissioning.</p>
<p>Some of these solutions will require completely new space-based infrastructures that can streamline launch, operation and decommissioning. D-Orbit’s ION Satellite Carrier, for example, is a space transportation vehicle designed to host a batch of satellites, transport them to orbit and release them individually into distinct orbital slots. This deployment service complements the one offered by launch providers, which targets only the most strategic orbits, enabling satellite operators to cover the last mile in a significantly shorter time and use all the resources of their spacecraft to extend the duration of the mission itself.</p>
<p>This is the first step toward the creation of permanent space logistic infrastructures that can move spacecraft from one orbit to another, extend the life of older vehicles, perform repairs and collect satellite wrecks and other debris.</p>
<p>The issues surrounding sustainable growth in the space economy are too important and consequential to be left to a single company or country.</p>
<p>To strengthen international cooperation and establish a set of ground rules, we need a new model of space governance based on consensus among countries, with common standards. While the technology for debris-capturing spacecraft is already attainable, for example, there are still legal challenges to allow an operator based in a country to approach, capture and remove a space object launched by another country. Formulating global regulation to address this kind of operation is an essential step that can open new markets and business opportunities.</p>
<p>Forty-eight organizations and other government and industry stakeholders, including D-Orbit, formed the <a href="https://spacesafety.org/">Space Safety Coalition</a> (SSC) in 2019 to actively promote best practices for the long-term sustainability of space operations. The SSC has developed guidelines for avoiding launch and on-orbit collisions, minimizing human casualties from spacecraft or debris reentry and minimizing the impact of radio frequency interference (RFI) events, among other best practices for the overall long-term sustainability of space operations.</p>
<p>This industry-led sustainability effort needs to be adopted by all space stakeholders. How we develop and regulate the space economy will have long-lasting repercussions, and the window for avoiding mistakes is rapidly closing.</p>
<p>It is essential that we lose no time in developing the infrastructure, best practices and governance that will broaden humankind’s ability to operate in space and create still-unimagined opportunities for us all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s external policy review board will meet with Frances Haugen, a former Facebook employee who went public with her concerns about the company last week. Facebook&#8217;s Oversight Board <a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/1232363373906301-oversight-board-to-meet-with-frances-haugen/">announced Monday</a> that it would meet with Haugen &#8220;in the coming weeks&#8221; after the whistleblower accepted the board&#8217;s invitation to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Board members appreciate the chance to discuss Ms. Haugen’s experiences and gather information that can help push for greater transparency and accountability from Facebook through our case decisions and recommendations,&#8221; the Oversight Board wrote in a blog post.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>In its announcement of the meeting with Haugen, the Oversight Board mentioned its ongoing interest in a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-files-xcheck-zuckerberg-elite-rules-11631541353">secret Facebook program known as &#8220;cross check&#8221;</a> that allowed some high profile users to circumvent the platform&#8217;s rules. The board said it was specifically examining whether the company had been &#8220;fully forthcoming&#8221; when answering questions on the cross check system and plans to share its findings in a report later in October.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported the existence of the program in an<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039?mod=series_facebookfiles"> investigative series on Facebook published last month</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple today released its second minor update to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ios-15/">iOS 15</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/apples-ipados-15-breaks-the-app-barrier/">iPadOS 15</a>, which includes an &#8220;important security update&#8221; for a zero-day bug under active exploitation.</p>
<p>Both iOS 15.0.2 and iPadOS 15.0.2, which are available to download on supported devices now, include a fix for a memory corruption vulnerability that allowed an application to execute arbitrary code with the highest level of device access, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212846">Apple says on its security support page</a>.</p>
<p>While details on the bug remain thin, Apple warns that it &#8220;may have been actively exploited&#8221; — so it&#8217;s probably a good idea to update your devices right away.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216191" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The updates also address a number of other glitches in iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, including an issue that caused the iPhone Leather Wallet and with MagSafe not to connect to Find My, a bug that could cause AirTags not to appear in the ‌Find My‌ Items tab, and another that caused <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/carplay/">CarPlay</a> to fail to open audio apps or to disconnect during playback. There&#8217;s also a fix for a glitch that saw photos saved to your library from Messages deleted after removing the associated thread or message.</p>
<p>Apple is currently testing the first major update to iOS 15.1, which will be the first major update to iOS 15. This update will re-enable SharePlay in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-announces-facetime-updates-at-wwdc-2021/">FaceTime</a>, add new iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max camera features and bring support for adding a COVID-19 vaccination card to Apple Wallet. It&#8217;ll probably include a handful of bug fixes, too.</p>
