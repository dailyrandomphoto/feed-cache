										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sunlight is a great source of energy, but it rarely gets hot enough to fry an egg, let alone melt steel. Heliogen aims to change that with its high-tech concentrated solar technique, and has raised more than a hundred million dollars to test its 1,000-degree solar furnace to a few game mines and refineries.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/heliogens-new-technology-could-unlock-renewable-energy-for-industrial-manufacturing/">We covered Heliogen when it first made its debut in 2019</a>, and the details in that article still get at the core of the company&#8217;s tech. Computer vision techniques are used to carefully control a large set of mirrors, which reflect and concentrate the sun&#8217;s light to the extent that it can reach in excess of 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit, almost twice what previous solar concentrators could do. &#8220;It&#8217;s like a death ray,&#8221; founder Bill Gross explained then.</p>
<p>That lets the system replace fossil fuels and other legacy systems in many applications where such temperatures are required, for example mining and smelting operations. By using a Heliogen concentrator, they could run on sunlight during much of the day and only rely on other sources at night, potentially halving their fuel expenditure and consequently both saving money and stepping toward a greener future.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Heliogen&#8217;s new tech could unlock renewable energy for industrial manufacturing&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/heliogens-new-technology-could-unlock-renewable-energy-for-industrial-manufacturing/embed/#?secret=HpjkO7g7V3" data-secret="HpjkO7g7V3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Both goals hint at why utilities and a major mining and steel-making company are now investors. Heliogen raised a $25M A-2, led by Prime Movers Lab, but soon also pulled together a much larger &#8220;bridge extension round&#8221; in their terminology of $83M that brought in the miner ArcelorMittal, Edison International, Ocgrow Ventures, A.T. Gekko, and more.</p>
<p>The money will be used both to continue development of the &#8220;Sunlight Refinery,&#8221; as Heliogen calls it, and deploy some actual on-site installations that would work in real production workflows at scale. &#8220;We are constantly making design and cost improvements to increase efficiency and decrease costs,&#8221; a representative of the company told me.</p>
<p>One of those pilot sites will be in Boron, CA, where Rio Tinto operates a borates mine and will include Heliogen&#8217;s tech as part of its usual on-site processes, according to an MOU signed in March. Another MOU with ArcelorMittal will &#8220;evaluate the potential of Heliogen&#8217;s products in several of ArcelorMittal&#8217;s steel plants.&#8221; Facilities are planned in the U.S., MENA, and Asia Pacific areas.</p>
<p>Beyond mining and smelting, the technique could be used to generate hydrogen in a zero-carbon way. That would be a big step towards building a working hydrogen infrastructure for next-generation fuel supply, since current methods make it difficult to do without relying on fossil fuels in the first place. And no doubt there are other industrial processes that could benefit from a free and zero-carbon source of high heat.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re being granted the resources to do more projects that address the most carbon-intensive human activities and work toward our goals of lowering the price and emissions of energy for everyone on the planet,&#8221; Gross said in a release announcing the round(s). &#8220;We thank all of our investors for enabling us to pursue our mission and offer the world technology that will allow it to achieve a post-carbon economy.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Senate confirmed big tech critic and prominent antitrust scholar <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/lina-khans-timely-tech-skepticism-makes-for-a-refreshingly-friendly-ftc-confirmation-hearing/">Lina Khan as FTC Commissioner Tuesday</a>, signaling a new era of scrutiny for the tech industry. Khan was confirmed in a 69-28 vote, with Republicans joining Democrats in a rare show of bipartisan support for Khan&#8217;s ideas on reining in tech&#8217;s most powerful companies.</p>
<p>An associate law professor at Columbia, Khan&#8217;s star rose with the <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox">publication of a landmark paper</a> examining how the government&#8217;s outdated ways of identifying monopolies have failed to keep up with modern business realities, particularly in tech. In Khan&#8217;s view, that regulatory failure has allowed the biggest tech companies to consolidate unprecedented wealth and power, in turn making it even more difficult to regulate them.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m so grateful to the Senate for my confirmation. Congress created the FTC to safeguard fair competition and protect consumers, workers, and honest businesses from unfair &amp; deceptive practices. I look forward to upholding this mission with vigor and serving the American public.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&mdash; Lina Khan (@linamkhan) <a href="https://twitter.com/linamkhan/status/1404841168182169602?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 15, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>President Biden <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/lina-khan-biden-ftc-antitrust/">nominated Khan back in March</a>, sending an early message that Biden would not extend the warm relationship big tech companies enjoyed with the White House under former President Obama.</p>
<p>Khan&#8217;s confirmation is a sign that the agency will be prioritizing tech antitrust concerns, a priority that will run parallel to Congressional efforts to bolster the FTC&#8217;s enforcement powers. The FTC famously imposed a $5 billion fine on Facebook for privacy violations in 2019, but the record-setting fine was only a glancing blow for a company already worth more than $500 billion.</p>
<p>Last week, Congress revealed a long-anticipated package of bipartisan bills that, if passed, would overhaul tech&#8217;s biggest businesses and redraw the industry&#8217;s rules for years to come.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/klobuchar-antitrust-law-enforcement-reform-act-booker-markey/">previous bill proposed by Sen. Amy Klobuchar</a> would set aside a pool of money that the FTC could use to create a new division for market and merger research, one step toward modernizing antitrust enforcement to keep up with relentless growth from tech&#8217;s most powerful giants.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A group of 200 startup founders, investors, associations and government members are backing a manifesto and a set of recommendations in order to create the next wave of tech giants in Europe. Today, French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting an event in Paris with some of the members of this group called <a href="https://scaleupeurope.tech">Scale-Up Europe</a>.</p>
<p>Companies, investors and associations that signed the manifesto include Alan, Axel Springer, Bpifrance, Darktrace, Deutsche Startups, Doctolib, Eurazeo, Flixbus, France Digitale, Glovo, La French Tech, N26, OVHcloud, Shift Technology, Stripe, UiPath and Wise.</p>
<p>“To achieve all that, I&#8217;ll follow your ambition — 10 technology companies that are worth €100 billion or more by 2030,” Macron said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That’s an ambitious goal — that’s why Scale-Up Europe has laid out a roadmap and is issuing a <a href="https://sifted.eu/intelligence/reports/scale-up-europe">report</a>. While it is backed by both private actors and public institutions, it could be considered as a sort of lobbying effort for the European Commission and European governments.</p>
<p>There are a handful of key topics in those recommendations. And it starts with funding. In particular, the group thinks Europe is still lagging behind when it comes to late-stage investments. The biggest VC funds aren’t as big as the biggest VC funds in the U.S. or in China.</p>
<p>The French government has been working on a way to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/macron-announces-e5-billion-late-stage-investment-pledge-from-institutional-investors/">foster</a> late-stage funds and investments in public tech companies in France. “On funding, we’ve seen the success of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/macron-announces-e5-billion-late-stage-investment-pledge-from-institutional-investors/">Tibi initiative</a> at the French level. We think we should follow that model at the European level,” a source close to Macron told me.</p>
<p>It means that Europe should consider using public funding as a multiplier effect for VC funds. The <a href="https://www.eif.org">European Investment Fund</a> is already pouring a lot of money in VC funds. But Scale-Up Europe recommends associating private funds of funds, sharing risk and pooling public investment banks for increased collaboration.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="saFEnqZHny"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/macron-announces-e5-billion-late-stage-investment-pledge-from-institutional-investors/">Macron announces €5 billion late-stage investment pledge  from institutional investors</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Macron announces €5 billion late-stage investment pledge  from institutional investors&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/macron-announces-e5-billion-late-stage-investment-pledge-from-institutional-investors/embed/#?secret=saFEnqZHny" data-secret="saFEnqZHny" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The second topic is foreign talent. Some countries already have a tech worker visa. The group thinks it should be standardized across the European Union with some level of portability for social rights.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, an open letter called <a href="https://www.notoptional.eu/en">&#8220;Not Optional&#8221;</a> also highlighted some discrepancies with stock option schemes. Today’s report states once again that some governments should adopt more favorable rules with stock options.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="PJOxDe40uY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/27/30-european-startup-ceos-call-for-better-stock-option-policies/">30 European startup CEOs call for better stock option policies</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;30 European startup CEOs call for better stock option policies&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/27/30-european-startup-ceos-call-for-better-stock-option-policies/embed/#?secret=PJOxDe40uY" data-secret="PJOxDe40uY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The third topic revolves around Deep Tech startups. According to the report, Europe isn’t doing enough to foster more Deep Tech startups and investors. Recommendations include standardizing patent transfer frameworks. Those schemes are important if you want to turn a research project into a company. It also says that the European Innovation Council could also take on a larger role in defining a Deep Tech roadmap.</p>
<p>Scale-Up Europe then highlights some recommendations to improve relationships between big corporations and startups. These are mostly tax breaks, R&amp;D tax benefits and other fiscal incentives. (I’m personally not convinced there will be more European tech giants if we incentivize acquisitions with tax breaks.)</p>
<p>Finally, the group of investors, founders and government members behind Scale-Up Europe think there should be a European tech mission that works a bit like <a href="https://lafrenchtech.com">La French Tech</a> in France. This tech mission could clear regulatory hurdles, promote startups and more.</p>
<p>Overall, those recommendations are mostly focused on making it easier to create — and grow — a startup in Europe. Investors as well as startup employees who hold stock options will be quite pleased to see that it’ll be easier to make money quickly. It’ll be interesting to see whether the European Commission reuses some of these recommendations.</p>
<p>To be fair, those are actionable recommendations. And yet, building a tech giant is a complicated task. Tech giants tend to control a large chunk of their tech stack, including in areas such as cloud hosting, payments, analytics, advertising and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Many European startups are currently built on APIs, frameworks and platforms that are built in the U.S. or in China. Scale-Up Europe misses the point on this front. Scaling European startups isn’t a gold rush. It’s a long process that requires continuous investments that start from the bottom of the tech stack and moves upward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nintendo defied expectations today with an E3-timed Direct showing off not the hoped-for new Switch hardware but a dozen or so new games — as well as a general release window for the much-anticipated next Zelda game. And to celebrate the original&#8217;s 35th anniversary, it will sell a new Game &amp; Watch featuring the first three games in the series.</p>
<p>Among other things, Nintendo showed off remasters or remakes of titles from the &#8220;Monkey Ball,&#8221; &#8220;Mario Party,&#8221; &#8220;Advance Wars, &#8220;Wario Ware&#8221; and other series, and announced new entries in the &#8220;Mario + Rabbids&#8221; and &#8220;Shin Megami Tensei&#8221; worlds. Other newly announced or teased games will be making it to Switch as well, like the new &#8220;Guardians of the Galaxy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps most surprising was the inclusion of a new side-scrolling Metroid game, the first in nearly 20 years — and in fact, it has been in and out of development for half that time. &#8220;Metroid Dread,&#8221; the fifth in the mainline series that began on the NES, will release October 8, and we&#8217;ll see if Nintendo has managed to keep pace in a genre it pioneered but others have refined.</p>

<p>Everyone was hoping for Zelda news, however, and Nintendo&#8230; only slightly disappointed us. As the announcers noted, it&#8217;s the 35th anniversary of the NES original, and the perfect time to announce something truly special, but they have &#8220;no campaigns or other Nintendo Switch games planned.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead, they offered an admittedly tempting Game &amp; Watch in the style of the one we saw released last year for the Mario series. I had lots of good things to say about that device, and the new one will no doubt be just as fun. The ability to pause the game and pick it up later (but not rewind or save states) should make for a fun, authentic playthrough of the first three games in the Zelda series: &#8220;The Legend of Zelda&#8221; and &#8220;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&#8221; for NES, and &#8220;Link&#8217;s Awakening&#8221; for Game Boy (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/links-awakening-remake-is-a-classic-well-worth-revisiting/">recently remade</a>).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166426" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/zelda-game-watch2.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166426" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2166426" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/zelda-game-watch2.jpg" alt="A handheld gaming machine with Zelda games on it." width="1024" height="573" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/zelda-game-watch2.jpg 1082w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/zelda-game-watch2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/zelda-game-watch2.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/zelda-game-watch2.jpg?resize=768,429 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/zelda-game-watch2.jpg?resize=680,380 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/zelda-game-watch2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2166426" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nintendo</p></div></p>
<p>The last item on the list was a new look at the follow-up to Breath of the Wild, which years after its debut still shines as one of the, if not the, best game on the Switch. Its sequel has a lot to live up to!</p>
<p>While the first trailer was all cinematic, this one showed gameplay and the overworld, including a new level of verticality that brings flying fortresses and castles in the air into play. It certainly looks impressive, but one wonders how much further the company can push its Switch hardware. After all, &#8220;Breath of the Wild&#8221; pushed the system to its limits at its debut, and even then it was not as powerful as its rivals from Microsoft and Sony — both now replaced by a new generation.</p>
<p>One hopes that Nintendo is simply being weird and has a trick up its sleeve, as it has many times before. The Switch was announced out of nowhere, and previous hardware updates have also dropped with little or no warning and seemingly arbitrary timing. What&#8217;s expected is an updated Switch that&#8217;s physically the same dimensions but considerably updated inside and using a larger, better display. Perfect backwards compatibility, like with the 3DS series of handhelds, also seems only logical. But Nintendo has always done its own thing and its fans wouldn&#8217;t have it any other way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Android shared information today about six features that will roll out this summer. Some of these are just quality of life upgrades, like starring text messages to easily find them later, or getting contextual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/12/googles-gboard-introduces-emoji-kitchen-a-tool-to-mash-up-emojis-to-use-as-stickers/">Emoji Kitchen</a> suggestions depending on what you&#8217;re typing. But other aspects of this update emphasize security, safety and accessibility.</p>
<p>Last summer, Google added a feature on Android that basically <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/google-is-turning-android-phones-into-seismometers/">uses your phone as a seismometer</a> to create &#8220;the world&#8217;s largest earthquake detection network.&#8221; The system is free, and since testing in California, it&#8217;s also launched in New Zealand and Greece. Now, Google will introduce this feature in Turkey, the Philippines, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The company says that they&#8217;ll continue expanding the feature this year, prioritizing countries with the highest earthquake risk.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166404" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166404" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2166404 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1.-Earthquake-Alerts.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166404" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google is also expanding on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/google-assistant-can-now-control-android-apps/">another feature released last year</a>, which made Google Assistant compatible with Android apps. In the initial update, apps were supported like Spotify, Snapchat, Twitter, Walmart, Discord, Etsy, MyFitnessPal, Mint, Nike Adapt, Nike Run Club, eBay, Kroger, Postmates and Wayfair. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_OAyYiya40&amp;">Today&#8217;s update</a> mentioned apps like eBay, Yahoo! Finance, Strava and Capital One. These features are comparable to Apple&#8217;s support of Siri with iOS apps, which includes the ability to open apps, perform tasks and record a custom command.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166408" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166408" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2166408 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5.-Voice-Access-Gaze-Detection.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166408" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>When it comes to accessibility, Google is ramping up its gaze detection feature, which is now in beta. Gaze detection allows people to ask Voice Access to only respond when they&#8217;re looking at their screen, allowing people to naturally move between talking with friends and using their phone. Now, Voice Access will also have enhanced password input &#8212; when it detects a password field, it will allow you to input letters, numbers and symbols by saying &#8220;capital P&#8221; or &#8220;dollar sign,&#8221; for example, making it easier for users to more quickly enter this sensitive information. In October, Google Assistant became available on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/google-assistant-comes-to-gaze-powered-accessible-devices/">gaze-powered accessible devices</a>, and in the same month, Google researchers debuted a demo that made it so <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/google-research-lets-sign-language-switch-active-speaker-in-video-calls/">people using sign language could be identified</a> as the &#8220;active speaker&#8221; in video calls. Apple doesn&#8217;t have a comparable gaze detection feature yet that&#8217;s widely available, though <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/26/apple-acquires-smi-eye-tracking-company/">they acquired SensoMotoric Instruments</a> (SMI), an eye-tracking firm, in 2017. So, hopefully similar accessibility features will be in the works at Apple, especially as Google continues to build out theirs.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s Android update also lets Android Auto users customize more of their experience. Now, you can set your launcher screen from your phone, set dark mode manually and more easily browse content on media apps with an A-Z scroll bar and &#8220;back to top&#8221; button. Messaging apps like WhatsApp and Messages will now be compatible on the launch screen &#8212; proceed with caution and don&#8217;t drive distracted &#8212; and EV charging, parking, and navigation apps will now be available for use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Refraction AI calls itself the Goldilocks of robotic delivery. The Ann Arbor-based company, which recently raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/last-mile-delivery-robotics-company-refraction-ai-raises-4-2m/">$4.2 million seed round</a> and expanded operations to Austin, was founded by two University of Michigan professors who think delivery via full-size autonomous vehicles (AV) is not nearly as close as many promise and sidewalk delivery comes with too many hassles and not enough payoff. Their &#8220;just right&#8221; solution? Find a middle path, or rather, a bike path.</p>
<p>The company’s REV-1 robot, which co-founder and CTO Matthew Johnson-Roberson debuted on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/demo-with-matthew-johnson-roberson-refraction-ai/">TechCrunch Sessions: Mobility stage</a> in 2019, was built on a foundation of a bicycle. At about 4 feet tall and 32 inches wide, the three-wheeled vehicle can travel at up to 15 miles per hour, which means it can stop quickly to avoid obstacles while still being faster than a human.</p>
<p>The intermediate speed also means that the REV-1 doesn’t need to see as far ahead as a full-size AV, which allows it to function well on radars, sensors and cameras instead of requiring expensive lidar, according to the company.</p>
<p>Johnson-Roberson has spent nearly 20 years in academic robotics. Universities are home to many of the advances in field robotics, but the average person doesn&#8217;t see many such applications everyday when they look out their window. This desire to make something that is useful to the general public has been a huge motivator for the academic-turned-founder.</p>
<p><em>The following interview, part of an ongoing series with founders who are building transportation companies, has been edited for length and clarity. </em></p>
<p><b>TechCrunch: You unveiled Refraction AI on the TechCrunch stage two years ago. How has it evolved since?</b></p>
<p><b>Matthew Johnson-Roberson: </b>It&#8217;s been a really exciting ride. At that time, we had one vehicle — the one that we rolled out on stage — and now we have 25 vehicles in Ann Arbor and Austin, which we just announced. So things have changed quite a bit in the intervening years. We had already predicted a lot of changes around food delivery, specifically, and lots of those were accelerated by the pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/elisity">Elisity</a>, a self-styled innovator that provides behavior-based enterprise cybersecurity, has raised $26 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>The funding round was co-led by Two Bear Capital and AllegisCyber Capital, the latter of which has invested in a number of cybersecurity startups including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/cybersecurity-startup-panaseer-raises-26-5m-series-b-led-allegiscyber-capital/">Panaseer</a>, with previous seed investor Atlantic Bridge also participating.</p>
<p>Elisity, which is led by industry veterans from Cisco, Qualys, and Viptela, says the funding will help it meet growing enterprise demand for its cloud-delivered Cognitive Trust platform, which it claims is the only platform intelligent enough to understand how assets and people connect beyond corporate perimeters.</p>
<p>The platform looks to help organizations transition from legacy access approaches to zero trust, a security model based on maintaining strict access controls and not trusting anyone — even employees — by default, across their entire digital footprint. This enables organizations to adopt a &#8216;work-from-anywhere&#8217; model, according to the company, which notes that most companies today continue to rely on security and policies based on physical location or low-level networking constructs, such as VLAN, IP and MAC addresses, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/vpn/">VPNs</a>.</p>
<p>Cognitive Trust, the company claims, can analyze the uniquely identify and context of people, apps and devices, including Internet of Things (IoT) and operational technology (OT), wherever they’re working. The company says its AI-driven behavioral intelligence, the platform can also continuously assess risk and instantly optimize access, connectivity and protection policies.</p>
<p>&#8220;CISOs are facing ever increasing attack surfaces caused by the shift to remote work, reliance on cloud-based services (and often multi-cloud), and the convergence of IT/OT networks,&#8221; said Mike Goguen, founder and managing partner at <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/two-bear-capital">Two Bear Capital</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>&#8220;Elisity addresses all of these problems by not only enacting a zero trust model, but by doing so at the edge and within the behavioral context of each interaction. We are excited to partner with the CEO, James Winebrenner, and his team as they expand the reach of their revolutionary approach to enterprise security.&#8221;</p>
<p>Founded in 2018, Elisity — whose competitors include the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/vectra-ai-picks-up-130m-at-a-1-2b-valuation-for-its-network-approach-to-threat-detection-and-response/">Vectra AI</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/lastline/">Lastline</a> —<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>closed a $7.5 million seed round in August that same year, led by Atlantic Bridge. With its seed round, Elisity began scaling its engineering, sales and marketing teams to ramp up ahead of the platform’s launch.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s looking to scale in order to meet growing enterprise demand, which comes as many organizations <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/tech-companies-are-looking-at-more-flexible-work-models-when-offices-reopen/">move to a hybrid working model</a> and seek the tools to help them secure distributed workforces.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;When the security perimeter is no longer the network, we see an incredible opportunity to evolve the way enterprises connect and protect their people and their assets, moving away from strict network constructs to identity and context as the basis for secure access,&#8221; said Winebrenner.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;With Elisity, customers can dispense with the complexity, cost and protracted timeline enterprises usually encounter. We can onboard a new customer in as little as 45 minutes, rather than months or years, moving them to an identity-based access policy, and expanding to their cloud and on-prem[ise] footprints over time without having to rip and replace existing identity providers and network infrastructure investments.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>We do this without making tradeoffs between productivity for employees and the network security posture.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elisity, which is based in California, currently employs around 30 staff. However, <a href="https://www.elisity.com/company?#TeamLeadSection">it currently has no women in its leadership team</a>, nor on its board of directors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever toured an apartment and fell in love with the model unit?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re not alone. Harvard Business School grad Cameron Johnson is a former institutional real estate investor and Greystar exec turned startup founder who realized that very often, “renters would try to rent the model apartment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This got him thinking. People would love to rent a model apartment in a building, and no one likes to move. This spelled opportunity in Johnson’s mind.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in 2017, he came up with the idea of </span><a href="https://nicksonliving.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nickson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Dallas-based startup that fully furnishes apartments on demand.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166333" style="width: 299px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166333" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2166333" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Nickson.jpg?w=200" alt="" width="289" height="433" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Nickson.jpg 852w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Nickson.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Nickson.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Nickson.jpg?resize=768,1154 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Nickson.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Nickson.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166333" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> CEO and founder Cameron Johnson / Nickson</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought ‘What if you gave people the ability to simply rent the model, or the ability to add everything in their space needs with a few clicks, similar to how a cable modem comes to your house,’” CEO Johnson said. “I wondered, ‘Why can&#8217;t we do that for everything else?’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Nickson doesn’t just provide furniture such as beds and sofas, it delivers all the essentials too &#8212; from extension cords to pots and pans to silverware to curtain rods. By partnering with a variety of retailers, the startup claims that it allows users “to make their new spaces move-in ready in as little as 3 hours.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">take a style quiz and share apartment layout details. Nickson’s designers create an initial layout based on the dimensions of an apartment, desired functions (such as work from home) and the volume of furnishings based on a person’s lifestyle. Once the layout is complete, Nickson creates a custom design, including all furnishings and home goods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon signing up, users </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pay a one-time installation fee for the furniture-as-a-service offering, and then a monthly subscription charge for the duration of a lease &#8212; starting at $199 a month for a studio to $500 a month for a three-bedroom apartment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup also offers concierge services such as a household supply starter kit and maid service, as an add-on to its flat monthly subscription.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nickson is currently only live in the Dallas market, but plans to expand into other cities over the next 12 months, including expanding its beta tests in Austin and Houston. And it’s just raised a $12 million Series A to help it advance on that goal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A fund managed by Pendulum Opportunities LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22404557/pendulum-barack-obama-robbie-robinson-startup-founders-diversity">Pendulum Holdings LLC</a>, led the Series A round, which also included participation from Motley Fool Ventures, Revolution’s Rise of the Rest and Backstage Capital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global supply chain, leading to delivery delays for consumers. Nickson has purchased items over time that it stores as local inventory, making it even more attractive to renters who don&#8217;t want to deal with delays and hunting down furniture and essentials, Johnson said. The convenience Nickson offers led to its user base growing 700% in 2020 compared to the year prior, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robbie Robinson, co-founder and CEO of Pendulum, said his firm was drawn to invest in Nickson due to a combination of Johnson’s “vision, secular shifts toward renting and subscription consumption and the company’s disruptive business model.” (Robinson is President Barack Obama’s former financial adviser, and recently founded Pendulum to invest $250 million in founding startups of color).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kabir Ahmed, vice president at Pendulum, added that he believes Nickson’s model is superior to the concept of renting one-off furniture pieces in that it offers an “end-to-end, turnkey solution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This seamless experience is highly differentiated and offers a compelling value proposition for the consumer,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, Nickson is not the only company attempting to turn the stodgy furniture rental industry on its head. Other startups offering similar services as Nickson include </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/founded-by-a-former-uber-exec-oliver-space-wants-to-design-and-furnish-apartments-for-busy-professionals/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oliver Space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/fernish-lands-15m-in-khosla-led-series-a-for-furniture-rental-platform/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fernish</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/the-landing-is-bringing-shoppable-social-and-collaboration-to-interior-design/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Landing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>But Nickson claims that it stands out from the competition in that it &#8220;takes care of everything&#8221; beyond furniture (including artwork and toilet brushes) and that it can curate space and bring it all in before a renter even shows up.</p>
<p>&#8220;No other competitor in this space offers this level of service, detail or turnaround,&#8221; Johnson says. &#8220;You can literally arrive at your new home with a suitcase and toothbrush, and it&#8217;s ready to &#8216;live in.'&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526266/facebook-smartwatch-two-cameras-heart-rate-monitor">word got out</a> that Facebook was taking another big step into first-party hardware with the planned launch of its own smartwatch. The most intriguing part of the report was the inclusion of not one but two watches. Other wearable makers have flirted with video and images on wrist-worn devices, but the feature is far from mainstream.</p>
<p>Industry leader Apple certainly doesn’t seem to be rushing into the idea, so Wristcam went and did it for them with the launch of a band sporting its own camera capable of shooting 4K images and 1080p. The product launched late last year, following a successful crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p>Now its makers are going a more traditional funding route, announcing a $25 million raise led by Marker LLC. “We will use the funding to scale our team, Wristcam production, go to market, and R&amp;D of our computer vision engine for wearables,” CEO Ari Roisman told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Part of that funding involves effectively doubling the company’s headcount by early next year and helping deliver updates to some of the demands and concerns that have arisen since the product’s “public beta” launch in December.</p>
<p>Among the forthcoming features are live video. The company says it has sold “thousands” of units, which currently retail for $299 through the Wristcam site &#8212; so $20 more than a Watch SE. The company says it ran into COVID-19 supply chain issues earlier this year, but has pushed through and is now fulfilling orders daily.</p>
<p>In spite of Facebook’s apparent interest in wrist-base imaging, Roisman says he’s not concerned about possible Sherlock from Apple.</p>
<p>“I see camera continuing to be a core part of the iPhone strategy, with DSLR quality equivalence, including Pro offerings priced north of $1,000,” the exec says. “Meanwhile, I see continued Apple Watch focus on quantified health and wellness, as opposed to power, data and real estate intensive functionality that could conflict with the iPhone strategy.”</p>

<p>Our <a href="http://bit.ly/DiceSentimentReport">2021 Technologist Sentiment Report</a> — which in the second quarter polled technology professionals who mostly work at bigger organizations — shows 48% of tech professionals expressed an interest in changing companies this year, up from 40% in the fourth quarter of 2020, and a big jump from 32% in the second quarter last year.</p>
<p>It’s a unique moment, one that creates an unusual opportunity for startup founders on the hunt for talent.</p>

			We are amidst a sprawling renegotiation between employers and employees as to the very nature of work, and no one has more leverage than skilled technologists.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Fast-growing upstarts have a lot of advantages. Bigger companies may be more likely to <em>attempt</em> to recreate the office environment of the past — especially if they have leased space and a built environment that will be difficult to unwind. Startups are often nontraditional and may be able to react to create the hybrid work environments many technologists crave as the economy reopens.</p>
<p>While all startups are certainly not focused on being disruptive, they often rely on cutting-edge technology and processes to give their customers something truly new. Many are trying to change the pattern in their particular industry. So, by definition, they generally have a really interesting mission or purpose that may be more appealing to tech professionals.</p>
<p>A migration of tech talent just as the economy is revving up would be disruptive and could also play to startup strengths. The market for tech talent is already strong: Tech hiring has increased every month since November, according to our last <a href="http://bit.ly/DiceQ1TechJobReport">tech jobs report</a> released in May. Great data engineers, developers, business analysts and the like are in red-hot demand, and unemployment in tech is just above 2.4% percent, versus 5.5% percent in the economy overall.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple Podcasts Subscriptions are now live across more than 170 countries and regions, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-and-channels-are-now-available-worldwide/">announced</a> this morning. First <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/">unveiled this spring</a>, subscriptions allow listeners to unlock additional benefits for their favorite podcasts, including things like ad-free listening, early access to new episodes, bonus material, exclusives or whatever else the podcast creator believes will be something their fans will pay for. Channels allow podcasters to group their shows however they like &#8212; for instance, to highlight a set of shows with a shared theme, or to offer different mixes of free and paid content.</p>
<p>The new subscription features were initially set to arrive in May, but Apple later <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526186/apple-podcasts-in-app-subscription-launch">emailed creators</a> that the launch was being pushed to June. This was likely due to a <a href="https://podnews.net/article/apple-podcasts-lemon-bugs?utm_source=podnews.net&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=podnews.net:2021-05-28">series of back-end issues</a> impacting the service, including things like delayed episodes and malfunctioning analytics, among other things.</p>
<p>At launch, Apple says there are thousands of subscriptions and channels available, with more expected to arrive on a weekly basis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When listeners purchase a subscription to a show, they&#8217;ll automatically follow the show in the redesigned Apple Podcasts app. The show&#8217;s page will also be updated with a Subscriber Edition label, so they&#8217;ll be able to more easily tell if they have access to the premium experience.</p>
<p>The app&#8217;s Listen Now tab will expand with new rows that provide access to paid subscriptions, including their available channels.</p>
<p>In the app, users can discover channels from show pages and through Search, browse through recommendations from the Listen Now and Browse tabs, and share channels with friends through Messages, Mail and other apps.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s delay to invest in the Podcasts market has given its rivals a head start on growing their own audience for podcasts. At the time of the spring announcement of subscriptions, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/spotify-podcast-listeners-to-top-apples-for-the-first-time-in-2021-forecast-claims/">an industry report suggested</a> that Spotify’s podcast listeners would top Apple’s for the first time in 2021.</p>
<p>Despite the competition, Apple is betting its massive install base will bring in creators. Those creators agree to pay Apple a 30% cut of their subscription revenue in year one, just like subscription-based iOS apps. That cut drops to 15% in year two. Spotify, by comparison, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/spotify-launches-paid-podcasts-through-new-anchor-feature/">is taking no revenue cut</a> for the next two years while its program gets off the ground. It will then take only a 5% fee.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last week we announced that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/carnegie-mellon-university-president-farnam-jahanian-is-speaking-at-techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburgh/">Carnegie Mellon University President Farnam Jahanian</a> will be speaking at our upcoming City Spotlight: Pittsburgh event. Today, we’re excited to announce another big guest: Mayor Bill Peduto.</p>
<p>The event will be held on June 29. You can <a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburg">register here for free</a> to listen to our conversations with Mayor Peduto and Jahanian, among others.</p>
<p>An alumni of both Carnegie Mellon University and Pennsylvania State University, Peduto served on Pittsburgh’s City Council for a dozen years before being elected mayor in 2014. I’ve spoken with the mayor on numerous occasions, and aside from being one of the city’s biggest cheerleaders, he’s also a staunch proponent of the startup scene bolstered by local universities like CMU.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Having two world-class research universities allows us to draw the companies here in order to be able to utilize that talent. At the same time, that talent is building out the startup community,” Peduto told me in a recent conversation. “The other components of the startup community are now, for the first time, being properly invested in. I think what you’re seeing change over the past five years in Pittsburgh is West Coast VCs aren’t looking to move startups to California. They’re looking to invest in Pittsburgh.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Calling all Yinzers, TechCrunch is (virtually) headed to Pittsburgh!&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/calling-all-yinzers-techcrunch-is-virtually-headed-to-pittsburgh/embed/#?secret=ThjO9gleDg" data-secret="ThjO9gleDg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Having resources like those universities has been instrumental in building out Pittsburgh’s startup community. But the city &#8212; which long bore the scars of rustbelt depression &#8212; has traditionally had difficulty retaining much of its talent, losing out to better-known startup ecosystems in places like New York and San Francisco.</p>
<p>But that’s changing &#8212; and the city is changing along with it. Pittsburgh currently has one of the world’s most vibrant robotic startup ecosystems, is at the center of much of the world’s autonomous vehicle research and has birthed successful companies like Duolingo.</p>
<p>Event organizer Matt Burns will be speaking to Mayor Peduto about the challenges and successes in building up such an ecosystem.</p>
<p>We’re still looking for startups to participate in the event. It’s free to register and participate in networking and watch the event (<a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-city-spotlight-pittsburg">click here to register</a>). It’s also free to apply to pitch your startup at the event (<a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/F2JkiUKt">click here to apply</a>). We’re looking for early-stage companies from the greater Pittsburgh area that can give a two-minute pitch to a panel of local venture capitalists in exchange for feedback.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It certainly follows then that some leading construction robotics companies are able to strike while the iron is hot with some healthy raises. Today, Bay Area-based Dusty Robotics announced a $16.5 million Series A. Led by Canaan Partners and featuring NextGen Venture Partners, Baseline Ventures, Root Ventures and Cantos Ventures, the round brings the startup’s full funding up to $23.7 million.</p>
<p>“We have an enormous amount of demand from customers across the U.S., and around the world,” founder and CEO Tessa Lau told TechCrunch. “In addition to growing our team, we will be expanding our fleet of robots and building more robots to service this demand.”</p>
<p>Canaan partner Rich Boyle adds that the pandemic has helped accelerate some of the already existing demand.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/8zE4X06fly8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>&#8220;Both markets are incredibly active and evolving quickly, I believe mostly due to longer-term trends. Those include things like continued improvements in AI and labor shortages in key industries, as well as the decreasing price of robotic hardware. That said, COVID has driven changes in how people are thinking about the design, construction and ongoing utilization of real estate assets, and it&#8217;s driven substantial changes in behavior — how we work, how we live, how we shop, and some of those changes that were accelerated by COVID we think are here to stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Dusty team is still fairly lean at about 17 employees, largely located in Mountain View. The startup’s first product is the Field Printer, a robot that prints out plans on the floor of construction sites. The company likens the maps to “Ikea Instructions.” The autonomous bot has been used by Swinerton, DPR Construction, Build Group and Pankow Builders, among others.</p>
<p>“We just released our third-generation hardware platform, which was designed from the ground up by our team in Mountain View to be purpose-built for producing accurate and speedy layout on construction sites,” says Lau. “We&#8217;ve been working on this product since fall of 2018 and have incorporated lessons learned from completing over 1 million square feet of production layout into this third-generation design.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nuro, the autonomous delivery startup founded in 2016 by former Google engineers Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu, is expanding into parcel logistics through a partnership with FedEx.</p>
<p>The <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">multiyear, multiphased strategic partnership announced Tuesday aims to test and ultimately deploy Nuro&#8217;s <a href="https://medium.com/nuro/the-world-on-time-with-help-from-robots-announcing-nuros-partnership-with-fedex-32f33b39d36a">next-generation autonomous delivery vehicle</a> within FedEx operations. This bot will follow Nuro&#8217;s more recent R2 bot. Unlike others in the autonomous vehicle industry, Nuro has always focused its </span>efforts on designing a low-speed electric self-driving vehicle that transports packages, not people. But those &#8220;packages&#8221; have been more centered on the delivery of groceries, food and even medical supplies. Nuro has partnered with CVS, Domino&#8217;s and Krogers, for instance.</p>
<p>The deal with FedEx marks its first foray into parcels logistics. The pilot program has already started in Houston. This multiyear commitment will allow Nuro to bring its technology to more people in new ways, and eventually reach large-scale deployment, according to Cosimo Leipold, Nuro&#8217;s head of partnerships.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>FedEx has been working internally on its own autonomous vehicle technology, notably a sidewalk delivery bot. The SameDay Bot, which was named Roxo, was developed in collaboration with DEKA Development &amp; Research Corp. and its founder Dean Kamen who invented the Segway and iBot wheelchair. FedEx first unveiled its SameDay Bot in February 2019. The FedEx bot is equipped with sensing technology such as LiDAR and multiple cameras, which when combined with machine learning algorithms should allow the device to detect and avoid obstacles and plot a safe path, all while following the rules of the road (or sidewalk).</p>

<p>The company said at the time it planned to work with AutoZone, Lowe&#8217;s, Pizza Hut, Target, Walgreens and Walmart to figure out how autonomous robots might fit into its delivery business. The idea was for FedEx to provide a way for retailers to accept orders from nearby customers and deliver them by bot directly to customers&#8217; homes or businesses the same day. The company has tested the bots in Memphis, Tennessee as well as Plano and Frisco, Texas and Manchester, New Hampshire, according to a spokesperson.</p>
<p>The partnership with Nuro moves away from the sidewalk and onto the road. Nuro&#8217;s R2 is bigger and designed to operate on public roads, allowing it to travel farther distances and carry heavier loads.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">FedEx said it has made a long-term commitment to use Nuro&#8217;s autonomous bots for last-mile delivery at large scale.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;FedEx was built on innovation, and it continues to be an integral part of our culture and business strategy,&#8221; said Rebecca Yeung, vice president, advanced technology and innovation, FedEx Corporation.</p>

You can’t attract a co-founder, teammates, customers or investors without a well-crafted pitch about your product and vision, and so learning how to pitch and communicate effectively tends to be the first gateway to early entrepreneurial success.</p>
<p>While books and talks galore have been published on pitching, the reality is that the art of the pitch deck is a constantly changing fashion. The pandemic last year upended notions of how to draft a deck, given that founders had to pitch virtually on shared screens. As always, those aesthetics continue to change: VCs are busier than ever, seeing more companies than ever, and have to wade through ever more decks in their quest to find the next startups to back.</p>
<p>As we enter a hybrid investing world with a mix of online and in-person pitching, getting the pitch deck right has changed again — and remains just as important as ever.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That’s why we’re excited to be hosting Mar Hershenson, the founding managing partner of Pear VC, on one of our most perennially popular panels — How to Craft Your Pitch Deck, which will happen on the Extra Crunch stage at the all-virtual <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=Hershensonpost">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> coming up this September 21-23.</p>
<p>Hershenson has been a longtime venture capitalist and has consistently invested at the founding stages of startups. She has backed IPO’d companies like Guardant Health and DoorDash, as well as startups such as Aurora Solar, BioAge and Branch. Perhaps most importantly, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/the-vcs-who-founders-love-the-most/">in our survey of founders last year</a>, Hershenson was one of the top-ranked VCs in the world in terms of founder recommendations.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="O5UBZwUcdq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/the-vcs-who-founders-love-the-most/">The VCs who founders love the most</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The VCs who founders love the most&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/the-vcs-who-founders-love-the-most/embed/#?secret=O5UBZwUcdq" data-secret="O5UBZwUcdq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Her background is as a technical builder and entrepreneur. In addition to nabbing a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Stanford, Hershenson co-founded three companies before heading into venture: Barcelona Design, Sabio Labs and Revel Touch.</p>
<p>On this panel, Hershenson will discuss what’s changed when it comes to pitch decks in 2021, how she evaluates pitch decks in her day-to-day investing work, and whether and how pitch decks evolve and expand from first connection to final pitch meeting. We’ll also be taking questions from the audience to ensure that we cover all the strategies and tactics you have questions on about this critical skill.</p>
<p>So come <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=Hershensonpost">join Hershenson</a> (and all of our other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=Hershensonpost#eb919231-f3e4-4def-8dd0-afb0bc7c9c6e">fantastic speakers</a>) at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?promo=Hershensonpost">Disrupt 2021 online this September 21-23</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Solid Power, a solid-state battery developer backed by Ford and BMW, is going public. The company said Tuesday it would head to the NASDAQ via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Decarbonization Plus Acquisition Corp III at a post-deal implied market valuation of $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>The transaction is expected to generate around $600 million in cash, including a $165 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) transaction from investors Koch Strategic Platforms, Riverstone Energy Limited, Neuberger Berman and Van Eck Associates Corporation. Solid Power said in a statement Tuesday that the funds will go toward growth and operations.</p>
<p>Solid state batteries are considered by many as the next long-awaited breakthrough in battery technology. They are so named because they lack a liquid electrolyte, the mechanism that moves ions between the cathode and anode in traditional lithium-ion batteries, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/">as Mark Harris explained in an Extra Crunch article</a> earlier this year. By getting rid of this liquid component, developers say SSBs are safer and with far superior energy density. Solid Power said <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001844862/000119312521190525/d124653dex993.htm">in a June 15 investor presentation</a> that its batteries are expected to deliver a nearly 500-mile range on a single charge and more than double a conventional battery&#8217;s 8-year lifespan.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ford Motor Company and BMW AG have made it clear they’re bullish on Solid Power’s ability to deliver. The two OEMs led the battery developer’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/ford-bmw-lead-solid-powers-130m-series-b-round/">$130 million Series B</a> in May and signed joint development agreements for automotive-scale batteries from Solid Power’s pilot production line to be delivered in early 2022.</p>
<p>The SPAC transaction will likely be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021, Solid Power said. It’s expected to trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “SLDP.”</p>
<p>Solid Power is just the latest battery company to go public via a SPAC in recent months. One of its main rivals, Volkswagen-backed QuantumScape, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/vw-backed-quantumscape/">went public via a SPAC merger</a> last September at a valuation of $3.3 billion. Earlier this year, European battery manufacturer FREYR and power system developer Microvast <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/battery-companies-are-the-latest-spac-target-as-evs-get-a-huge-regulatory-boost/">also announced mergers</a> with so-called “blank-check” firms.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK&#8217;s competition watchdog will take a deep dive look into Apple and Google&#8217;s dominance of the mobile ecosystem, it <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-to-scrutinise-apple-and-google-mobile-ecosystems">said today</a> &#8212; announcing a market study which will examine the pair&#8217;s <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">respective smartphone platforms (iOS and Android); their app stores (App Store and Play Store); and web browsers (Safari and Chrome). </span></p>
<p>The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is concerned that the mobile platform giants&#8217; &#8220;effective duopoly&#8221; in those areas  might be harming consumers, it added.</p>
<p>The study will be wide ranging, with the watchdog concerns about the nested gateways that are created as a result of the pair&#8217;s dominance of mobile ecosystem &#8212; intermediating how consumers can access a variety of products, content and services (such as music, TV and video streaming; fitness tracking, shopping and banking, to cite some of the examples provided by the CMA).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;These products also include other technology and devices such as smart speakers, smart watches, home security and lighting (which mobiles can connect to and control),&#8221; it went on, adding that it&#8217;s looking into whether their dominance of these pipes is &#8220;stifling competition across a range of digital markets&#8221;, saying too that it&#8217;s &#8220;concerned this could lead to reduced innovation across the sector and consumers paying higher prices for devices and apps, or for other goods and services due to higher advertising prices&#8221;.</p>
<p>The CMA further confirmed the deep dive will examine &#8220;any effects&#8221; of the pair&#8217;s market power over other businesses &#8212; giving the example of app developers who rely on Apple or Google to market their products to customers via their smart devices.</p>
<p>The watchdog already has an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/">open investigation into Apple&#8217;s App Store</a>, following a number of antitrust complaints by developers.</p>
<p>It is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">investigating Google&#8217;s planned depreciation of third party tracking cookies</a> too, after complaints by adtech companies and publishers that the move could harm competition. (And just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">last week</a> the CMA said it was minded to accept a series of concessions offered by Google that would enable the regulator to stop it turning off support for cookies entirely if it believes the move will harm competition.)</p>
<p>The CMA said both those existing investigations are examining issues that fall within the scope of the new mobile ecosystem market study but that its work on the latter will be &#8220;much broader&#8221;.</p>
<p>It added that it will adopt a joined-up approach across all related cases &#8212; &#8220;to ensure the best outcomes for consumers and other businesses&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s giving itself a full year to examine Gapple&#8217;s mobile ecosystems.</p>
<p>It is also soliciting feedback on any of the issues raised in its <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/60c8683a8fa8f57cef61fc18/FINALMobile_ecosystems_-_statement_of_scope_-_V4.pdf" rel="external">statement of scope</a> &#8212; calling for responses by 26 July. The CMA added that it&#8217;s also keen to hear from app developers, via its <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/NkC2FNEXxL" rel="external">questionnaire</a>, by the same date.</p>
<h2>Taking on tech giants</h2>
<p>The watchdog has previously scrutinized the digital advertising market &#8212; and found <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/uks-competition-regulator-asks-for-views-on-breaking-up-google/">plenty to be concerned about vis-a-vis Google&#8217;s dominance</a> there.</p>
<p>That earlier market study has been feeding the UK government&#8217;s plan to reform competition rules to take account of the market-deforming power of digital giants. And the CMA suggested the new market study, examining &#8216;Gapple&#8217;s&#8217; mobile muscle, could similarly help shape UK-wide competition law reforms.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">Last year</a> the UK announced its plan to set up a &#8220;pro-competition&#8221; regime for regulating Internet platforms &#8212; including by establishing a dedicated Digital Markets Unit within the CMA (which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uks-digital-markets-unit-starts-work-on-pro-competition-reforms/">got going earlier this year</a>).</p>
<p>The legislation for the reform has not yet been put before parliament but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">the government has said</a> it wants the competition regulator to be able to &#8220;proactively shape platforms&#8217; behavior&#8221; to avoid harmful behavior before it happens&#8221; &#8212; saying too that it supports enabling ex ante interventions once a platform has been identified to have so-called &#8220;strategic market status&#8221;.</p>
<p>Germany already adopted similar reforms to its competition law (early this year), which enable proactive interventions to tackle large digital platforms with what is described as &#8220;paramount significance for competition across markets&#8221;. And its Federal Cartel Office has, in recent months, wasted no time in opening a number of proceedings to determine whether <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/amazons-market-power-to-be-tested-in-germany-in-push-for-early-action-over-antitrust-risks/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/googles-data-terms-are-now-in-germanys-competition-crosshairs/">Google</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/in-latest-big-tech-antitrust-push-germanys-fco-targets-google-news-showcases-fine-print/">Facebook</a> have such a status.</p>
<p>The CMA also sounds keen to get going to tackle Internet gatekeepers.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, CEO Andrea Coscelli said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Apple and Google control the major gateways through which people download apps or browse the web on their mobiles – whether they want to shop, play games, stream music or watch TV. We’re looking into whether this could be creating problems for consumers and the businesses that want to reach people through their phones.</p>
<p>“Our ongoing work into big tech has already uncovered some worrying trends and we know consumers and businesses could be harmed if they go unchecked. That’s why we’re pressing on with launching this study now, while we are setting up the new Digital Markets Unit, so we can hit the ground running by using the results of this work to shape future plans.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The European Union also unveiled its own proposals for clipping the wings of big tech last year &#8212; presenting its Digital Markets Act plan <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">in December</a> which will apply a single set of operational rules to so-called &#8220;gatekeeper&#8221; platforms operating across the EU.</p>
<p>The clear trend in Europe on digital competition is toward increasing oversight and regulation of the largest platforms &#8212; in the hopes that antitrust authorities can impose measures that will help smaller players thrive.</p>
<p>Critics might say that&#8217;s just playing into the tech giants&#8217; hands, though &#8212; because it&#8217;s fiddling around the edges when more radical intervention (break ups) are what&#8217;s really needed to reboot captured markets.</p>
<p>Apple and Google were contacted for comment on the CMA&#8217;s market study.</p>
<p>A Google spokesperson said: <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“Android provides people with more choice than any other mobile platform in deciding which apps they use, and </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://googleimpactreport.publicfirst.co.uk/uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://googleimpactreport.publicfirst.co.uk/uk/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1623853918420000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEgRKoYSRADDqyVAteHhdkRqNDcqQ">enables thousands of developers and manufacturers</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to build successful businesses. We welcome the CMA’s efforts to understand the details and differences between platforms before designing new rules.”</span></p>
<p>According to Google, the Android App Economy generated £2.8BN in revenue for UK developers last year, which it claims supported 240,000 jobs across the country &#8212; citing a <a href="https://googleimpactreport.publicfirst.co.uk/uk/">Public First report</a> that it commissioned.</p>
<p>The tech giant also pointed to operational changes it has already made in Europe, following antitrust interventions by the European Commission &#8212; such as adding a choice screen to Android where users can pick from a list of alternative search engines.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/google-ditches-pay-to-play-android-search-choice-auction-for-free-version-after-eu-pressure/">Earlier this month</a> it agreed to shift the format underlying that choice screen from an unpopular auction model to free participation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cruise, the self-driving subsidiary of GM, has tapped a $5 billion line of credit from the automaker&#8217;s financial arm to pay for hundreds of purpose-built electric and autonomous Origin vehicles as they start to roll off the assembly line.</p>
<p>The access to the credit provided by GM Financial will push Cruise&#8217;s &#8220;total war chest&#8221; to more than $10 billion as it prepares for commercialization, CEO Dan Ammann wrote in a blog post Tuesday.</p>
<p>Pre-production of the Cruise Origin, which was first unveiled in January 2020, has started at GM&#8217;s Factory ZERO assembly plant. Factory ZERO is the renamed and renovated Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant. Last year, GM announced plans to invest $2.2 billion into the factory to produce all-electric trucks and SUVs as well as Cruise Origin. The automaker said at the time it will invest an additional $800 million in supplier tooling and other projects related to the launch of the new electric trucks. Detroit-Hamtramck will be GM’s first fully dedicated electric vehicle assembly plant. When fully operational, the plant will create more than 2,200 jobs, according to GM.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Origin, the product of a multi-year collaboration with parent company GM and investor Honda, is designed for a ridesharing service. The shuttle-like vehicle has no steering wheel or pedals and is designed to travel at highway speeds. The interior is roomy, with seats that face each other, similar to what a traveler might find on some trains.</p>
<p>The first run of 100 pre-production Cruise Origins will be assembled over the summer and tested at GM&#8217;s Milford proving grounds. Commercial production of the Cruise Origin is expected to begin in 2023.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[E-commerce platform Shopify announced this morning its one-click checkout service known as Shop Pay will become available to any U.S. merchant that sells on Facebook or Google &#8212; even if they don&#8217;t use Shopify&#8217;s software to power their online stores. That makes Shop Pay the first Shopify product offered to non-Shopify merchants, the company notes. [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-commerce platform Shopify <a href="https://news.shopify.com/shop-pay-becomes-first-shopify-product-to-extend-beyond-shopify-merchants-soon-available-to-any-business-selling-on-facebook-and-google">announced</a> this morning its one-click checkout service known as Shop Pay will become available to any U.S. merchant that sells on Facebook or Google &#8212; even if they don&#8217;t use Shopify&#8217;s software to power their online stores. That makes Shop Pay the first Shopify product offered to non-Shopify merchants, the company notes.</p>
<p>First <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/20/shopify-pay-aims-to-complete-the-picture-for-online-checkout/">introduced</a> at its developer conference in 2017, Shop Pay is similar to other instant checkout solutions that offer an easier way to pay online by reducing the number of fields a customer has to fill out during the checkout process. The service remembers and encrypts the customer&#8217;s information, so consumers can check out with just a tap when shopping online and, as of recently, even <a href="https://news.shopify.com/shop-pay-installments-launches-in-the-us">pay for purchase in installments</a>, thanks to a partnership with Affirm.</p>
<p>Shopify in February had <a href="https://news.shopify.com/shop-pay-expands-to-facebook-and-instagram">expanded</a> Shop Pay to Facebook and Instagram, in partnership with Facebook, but it only worked for existing Shopify merchants selling on those social platforms at the time. In May, Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/google-partners-with-shopify-on-online-shopping-expansion/">announced</a> at its I/O developer conference it was <a href="https://news.shopify.com/from-discovery-to-checkout-shopify-and-google-deepen-commerce-collaboration">partnering</a> with Shopify on an online shopping expansion that would give Shopify&#8217;s more than 1.7 million merchants the ability to reach customers through Google Search and other &#8220;shopping journeys&#8221; that began through other Google properties like Search, Maps, Images, Lens, and YouTube.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company declined to share how many of its 1.7 million merchants are already available on Facebook or Google today, but said they are two of the most popular channels.</p>
<p>Following today&#8217;s announcement, other merchants will also have the option to adopt Shop Pay for their own Facebook or Google stores. While how many will actually do so is yet unknown, Shopify notes that every day 1.8 billion people log onto Facebook and a billion shopping sessions take place across Google.</p>
<p>The company also touted Shop Pay&#8217;s advantages, including its 70% faster checkout than a typical checkout offers, with a 1.72x higher conversion rate &#8212; meaning fewer abandoned charts.</p>
<p>For consumers, the advantage of using Shop Pay over a traditional checkout, beyond the speed, is its integration with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/shopify-launches-shop-a-new-mobile-shopping-app/">Shopify&#8217;s mobile app, Shop</a>, which organizes and tracks your online orders across merchants, including Amazon,  so you can see when orders are arriving or quickly ask questions and manage returns.</p>
<p>To date, the Shop app has tracked over 430 million orders, the company says.</p>
<p>Over time, the Shop app can also customize a feed including users&#8217; favorite stores to point to other recommendations, including those from local merchants. Shopify confirmed that the Shop app will be able to track the Shop Pay-enabled orders from the non-Shopify merchants.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since launching, Shop Pay has set the standard for checkout experiences, facilitating more than $24 billion in orders,&#8221; noted Shopify VP, Carl Rivera, who heads Product for Shop. &#8220;According to studies, cart abandonment averages 70%, with nearly 20% occurring because of a complicated checkout process. Shop Pay makes that process fast and simple, and the expansion to all merchants selling on Facebook and Google is a mission-critical step in bringing a best-in-class checkout to every consumer, every merchant, every platform, and every device,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The expansion could be a notable challenge to other payment mechanisms, including PayPal, Venmo, Apple Pay, and those offered by the platforms themselves, thanks to Shopify&#8217;s growing traction with merchants &#8212; one analysis gives its platform a <a href="https://www.oberlo.com/statistics/ecommerce-platform-market-share-in-usa">23% market share</a> in the U.S &#8212; combined with the popularity of the Shop app, now the No. 3 Shopping app on the App Store.</p>
<p>The news follows yesterday&#8217;s <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-shopify-confirms-significant-investment-in-payment-processor-stripe/">confirmation</a> that Shopify has taken a significant stake in payments giant Stripe, the backbone of the Shop Pay service, as well as Shopify&#8217;s partner on merchant services, including bank accounts and debit cards.</p>
<p>Shopify says the Shop Pay service will be enabled for all U.S. merchants selling on Facebook in the &#8220;coming months,&#8221; and will roll out to all merchants on Google by late 2021.</p>
