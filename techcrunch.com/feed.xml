										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Space may be the final frontier, but in terms of investment, VCs are just getting started. With that in mind during TC Sessions: Space 2020 last week, we spoke to three investors who&#8217;ve been actively funding what could become tomorrow&#8217;s biggest companies to learn where they might focus next.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Sustainability is a major issue for all of their portfolio companies.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Our guests &#8212; <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/tess-hatch" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="tess-hatch">Tess Hatch <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> of Bessemer Venture Partners, who has long focused on the commercialization of space; Mike Collett of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/promus-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="promus-ventures">Promus Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a venture firm that invests in deep tech software and hardware companies; and Chris Boshuizen of the venture firm DCVC and a cofounder of Planet Labs &#8212; had a lot of intriguing observations on topics, including the dangers of orbital debris, space manufacturing, and how they&#8217;d rate the U.S. government when it comes to fostering space-related innovations.</p>
<p>For those who missed the event, we&#8217;ve posted a video of our conversation below.</p>
<h2>Space junk could affect long-term sustainability</h2>
<p>Hatch, who recently co-authored an<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/removing-space-debris-requires-action-and-caution/"> informative piece</a> on the topic, said there&#8217;s little consensus about whether space junk is a critical matter that deserves more regulatory attention or an issue that will resolve itself through tech advancements, even while startups like <a href="https://astroscale.com/">Astroscale</a> and <a href="https://www.dorbit.space/">D-Orbit</a> are focused on the issue. The commercial industry&#8217;s expectation seems to be that space companies can regulate themselves and launch constellations without leaving pieces of launch vehicles or rocket stages in space, she said.</p>
<p>For her part, Hatch said it&#8217;s something to potentially invest in within a &#8220;handful of years.&#8221; At the moment, she added, &#8220;it&#8217;s not at the top of my list just due to looking for a shorter return on my investment for my LPs in the fund.&#8221;</p>
<p>Collett and the others stressed that in the meantime, sustainability is a major issue for all of their portfolio companies. &#8220;Everybody wants to do their job as a corporate citizen to make sure they&#8217;re not leaving anything else up there that doesn&#8217;t need to be there. Indeed, Boshuizen noted that at Planet Labs, best practices were taken very seriously.</p>
<p>Still, Boshuizen noted concerns about newer capital sources that might be less focused on the issue of space debris. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think everyone necessarily has the same space background,&#8221; he said, explaining that &#8220;we&#8217;re seeing a lot of outside investment from new people joining the industry, which is exciting, but also they don&#8217;t really know how important this is [and] it&#8217;s important for people to realize that they&#8217;ve got to pay attention to this.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been a busy year of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/27/google-clouds-newest-data-center-opens-in-salt-lake-city/">expansion</a> for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/06/microsoft-to-open-first-data-center-in-new-zealand-as-cloud-usage-grows/">the</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/microsoft-announces-its-first-azure-data-center-region-in-denmark/">large</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/microsoft-azure-announces-its-first-region-in-austria/">cloud</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/27/google-clouds-newest-data-center-opens-in-salt-lake-city/">providers</a>, with AWS, Azure and Google aggressively expanding their data center presence around the world. To cap off the year, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Cloud today <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/google-cloud-announces-new-regions">announced</a> a new set of cloud regions, which will go live in the coming months and years. These new regions, which will all have three availability zones, will be in Chile, Germany and Saudi Arabia. That&#8217;s on top of the regions in Indonesia, South Korea, the U.S. (Las Vegas and Salt Lake City) that went live this year &#8212; and the upcoming regions in France, Italy, Qatar and Spain the company also announced over the course of the last twelve months.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2089793" style="width: 892px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/regions.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089793" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2089793" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/regions.png" alt="" width="882" height="464" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/regions.png 882w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/regions.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/regions.png?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/regions.png?resize=768,404 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/regions.png?resize=680,358 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/regions.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2089793" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>In total, Google currently operates 24 regions with 73 availability zones, not counting those it has announced but that aren&#8217;t live yet. While <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Azure is well ahead of the competition in terms of the total number of regions (though some still lack availability zones), Google is now starting to pull even with AWS, which currently offers 24 regions with a total of 77 availability zones. Indeed, with its 12 announced regions, Google Cloud may actually soon pull ahead of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aws" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="aws">AWS, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which is currently working on six new regions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The battleground may soon shift away from these large data centers, though, with a new focus on edge zones close to urban centers that are smaller than the full-blown data centers the large clouds currently operate but that allow businesses to host their services even closer to their customers.</p>
<p>All of this is a clear sign of how much Google has invested in its cloud strategy in recent years. For the longest time, after all, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google-cloud-platform" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google-cloud-platform">Google Cloud Platform <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> lagged well behind its competitors. Only three years ago, Google Cloud offered only 13 regions, for example. And that&#8217;s on top of the company&#8217;s heavy investment in submarine cables and edge locations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.bolt.com/">Bolt</a>, a startup that offers online checkout technology to retailers, announced this morning that it has added $75 million to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/bolt-5-series-c--fdcb8cc8">its Series C round</a>, bringing the financing to a total of $125 million.</p>
<p>WestCap and General Atlantic led the new tranche, which <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/mtakso" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="mtakso">Bolt <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanBreslow">Ryan Breslow</a> told TechCrunch was raised at around twice its Series C valuation. PitchBook pegs the company&#8217;s Series C at a post-money valuation of $500 million, implying that the Series C1 values Bolt at around $1 billion.</p>
<p>The company is calling the latest check its &#8220;Series C1.&#8221; Why not just call it a Series D? According to Breslow, Bolt&#8217;s future Series D will be much larger.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While Bolt&#8217;s creatively demarcated Series C1 is interesting, the capital event is in line with how the checkout space is growing in aggregate right now. There&#8217;s a lot of money being put to work on solving a particular e-commerce pain point.</p>

<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/byepass" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="byepass">Fast, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a competing online checkout software provider, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/26/stripe-leads-20m-series-a-into-fast-which-is-building-a-universal-checkout-service-for-e-commerce/">raised $20 million in March</a>. And this June, Checkout.com, which is based in England but has a global stable of offices, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/checkout-com-the-uk-payments-startup-raises-another-150m-now-valued-at-5-5b/">raised $150 million at a $5.5 billion valuation</a>.</p>
<p>Bolt, meanwhile, announced the first <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/bolt-5-series-c--b2bfd736">$50 million of its Series C in July</a>. The company&#8217;s C1 event, therefore, represents not only the fourth major investment into checkout tech this year, but it also fits into a now-regular trend of fast-growing startups raising two checks in 2020 &#8212; companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/welcome-raises-6m-to-help-your-company-hire-and-keep-employees/">Welcome</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/skyflow-raises-17-5m-more-to-help-companies-protect-your-personal-data/">Skyflow</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/agentsync-lands-consecutive-rounds-as-insurtech-booms/">AgentSync</a> and <a href="https://finledger.com/2020/12/16/bestow-raises-70-million-to-grow-digital-life-insurance-platform/">Bestow</a> also completed the feat this year.</p>

<p>But enough talking about its market. Let&#8217;s dig into what Bolt is building and why it just took on another truckload of cash.</p>
<h2>Series C1</h2>
<p>Bolt offers four connected services: checkout, payments, user accounts and fraud protection.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s core offering is its checkout product, which it claims is both faster than comparable industry averages and has higher conversion rates. The startup&#8217;s payments and fraud services fits into its checkout universe by ensuring that transactions are real and that payments can be accepted. Finally, Bolt&#8217;s user accounts (shoppers are prompted to save their credentials when they first execute a purchase with the startup&#8217;s tech) boost the chance that someone who has checked out online using its tech will do so again in the future, helping Bolt to sell its service and ensure customers benefit from it.</p>
<p>The more shoppers that Bolt can attract, the more accounts it will have in the market feeding more data into its anti-fraud tool and checkout personalization technology.</p>
<p>And Bolt is reaching more online buyers, with the company claiming a roughly 10x gain of the number of people who have made accounts with its service this year. According to Breslow, the number was around 450,000 last December. It&#8217;s around 4.5 million now, he said, and Bolt expects the figure to reach 30 million next year.</p>
<p>Given the huge scale of its expected account creation, TechCrunch asked Breslow about his confidence interval in the number. He said 90%, thanks to Authentic Brands Group (ABG) linking up with Bolt, a deal that his company <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/authentic_brands_group_partners_with_bolt_to_power_forever_21s_online_checkout_experience/prweb17554634.htm">announced</a> last month. Breslow said that ABG has 50 million shoppers; perhaps the 30 million figure is possible.</p>
<p>(Distribution for checkout tech is like oxygen, so competing companies in the space love to chat about their availability gains. Here&#8217;s Fast talking about being <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fast-opens-up-payments-technology-to-woocommerce-enabling-one-click-checkout-for-millions-of-new-online-sellers-301191902.html">supported by WooCommerce</a> from last week, for example. Fast declined to share processing growth metrics with TechCrunch after that announcement.)</p>
<p>Bolt&#8217;s historical shopper growth has paid dividends for its total transaction volume. The company told TechCrunch that it processed around $1 billion in transactions this year, up around 3.5x from its 2019 gross merchandise volume (GMV). That approximate pace of growth implies a roughly $286 million GMV result for Bolt last year; how far the company can scale that figure in 2021 will be our chief measuring stick for how well its ABG deal performs.</p>
<p>Breslow told TechCrunch that Bolt expects to 3x its GMV in 2021, which we read as implying a roughly $3 billion number.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t just take that figure, apply a payment processing percentage and walk away with a revenue guess for Bolt. The company does make money from payments, but also from charging for its other services &#8212; like fraud protection &#8212; on a SaaS basis. So Bolt is a hybrid payments-and-software company, an increasingly popular model, though one <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/ramp-raises-30m-as-the-battle-to-own-corporate-spend-heats-up/">that certain categories of software</a> are slow to pick up on.</p>
<p>Underpinning Bolt&#8217;s plans to treble GMV and greatly expand its shopper network is its new capital. The $75 million cache of new dollars is going into handling market demand, moving upmarket and engineering, the company said. In short there&#8217;s a lot of in-market demand for better checkout tech &#8212; hence all the venture activity &#8212; and larger customers need more customizations and sales support. Bolt is going to spend on that.</p>
<p>Given that Bolt just reloaded, it would not be a surprise to see Fast or Checkout.com raise more capital in Q1 or Q2 of 2021. More when that happens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every Saturday in your inbox</a>. </em></p>
<p>Hi friends and new readers, welcome back to The Station, a newsletter dedicated to all the present and future ways people and packages move from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">I asked you last week to share your picks for the biggest stories of the year. While there was a mix, two startup-focused themes emerged: COVID-19 and the pressure it put on companies as well as the unexpected flurry of deals that occurred despite the pandemic. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">SPACs, Tesla&#8217;s skyrocketing share price, Waymo&#8217;s driverless ride-hailing service opening up to the public in the Phoenix area, Uber&#8217;s 2020 evolution (which I addressed last weekend) and Amazon&#8217;s acquisition of Zoox also made the list. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Speaking of Zoox, I posted an article last week of my <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/inside-zooxs-six-year-ride-from-prototype-to-product/">interview with Jesse Levinson</a>, the co-founder and CTO of Zoox. Access to the article requires an EC subscription, so I&#8217;ll offer a nugget here that I thought was new and interesting.</span></p>
<p>I asked Levinson what his hope was at the federal level? Specifically, if he sees real guidelines being formalized? Here&#8217;s the exchange.</p>
<p><strong>LEVINSON</strong>: Well, we&#8217;re actually in good shape from a federal perspective. We have designed our vehicle to comply with the FMVSS (Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards) and we are crash testing our vehicle to all of those standards. We&#8217;ve actually attempted most of them and passed every one that we&#8217;ve attempted, so you know, really we&#8217;re not actually blocked on the federal level.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see what happens with the new administration and what the future of regulations brings but at this point we&#8217;re actually good to go.</p>
<p><strong>YOURS TRULY</strong>: Then you don&#8217;t need an exemption (federally)? You don&#8217;t have a steering wheel.</p>
<p><strong>LEVINSON</strong>: Yeah, we&#8217;ve designed our vehicle to be compliant with the FMVSS. And so we were not looking for an exemption approach.</p>
<p><strong>ME AGAIN</strong>: Is it because you&#8217;re going to be under 25 miles an hour? My understanding was that if you didn&#8217;t have a steering wheel that the vehicle wouldn&#8217;t comply. So how does that work?</p>
<p><strong>LEVINSON</strong>: I would just say that&#8217;s not our interpretation of the standards.</p>

<p>The end of 2020 has produced a string of acquisitions, mergers and fundraising rounds that seemed unlikely this spring as the COVID-19 pandemic spread volatility and uncertainty.</p>
<p>One of the bright spots in 2020 was delivery. Startups focused on delivery — whether it is via trucking, autonomous bots or airborne devices like drones — managed to secure new funding while others struggled.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean the pandemic didn&#8217;t delay or create obstacles for delivery startups. Take Indian food delivery company Zomato, for example.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The 12-year-old company did <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/indian-food-delivery-giant-zomato-raises-660-million/">raise $660 million</a> in a Series J round this month. Tiger Global, Kora, Luxor, Fidelity (FMR), D1 Capital, Baillie Gifford, Mirae and Steadview participated in the round. Zomato now has post-money valuation of $3.9 billion.</p>
<p>However, Zomato originally anticipated to close the round 11 months ago. Several obstacles, including the current pandemic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/indias-zomato-raises-100m-from-tiger-global-says-it-is-planning-to-file-for-ipo-next-year/">delayed the fundraise effort</a>. Ant Financial, which had originally committed to invest $150 million in this round, only delivered a third of it.</p>
<p>More money appears to be headed toward Zomato, which is preparing to go public in 2021. Zomato co-founder and CEO Deepinder Goyal said the company is also in the process of closing a $140 million secondary transaction.</p>
<p>Zomato, which acquired <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/uber" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="uber">Uber&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Indian-based food delivery business early this year, has good reason to stack its coffers. The company faces a fight for market share with rival Swiggy and a new emerging threat of Amazon.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>AutoLeap</strong>, a six-month-old, Toronto-based startup, revealed that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/autoleap-thinks-it-will-turn-chaotic-repair-shop-experiences-into-seamless-ones/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">raised $5 million</a> in seed funding in September led by Threshold Ventures. The round also included individual investors Shift co-founder George Arison, former General Motors CEO Rick Wagoner and former senior Bridgestone exec Ned Aguilar.</p>
<p><strong>Bolt</strong>, the Estonian startup that&#8217;s building an on-demand network to move food and people around in cars, on scooters and on bikes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/bolt-raises-182m-to-expand-its-on-demand-transportation-network-in-europe-and-africa/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">raised €150 million</a> ($182 million at current rates) in an equity round. CEO and co-founder Markus Villig has growth on the brain. He told TechCrunch that Bolt, which already covers 200 cities in 40 countries, will use the new funds to expand geographically with an aim to become the biggest provider of electric scooters in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Boom Supersonic</strong> raised $50 million in new funding led by WRVI Capital for a post-money valuation of more than $1 billion, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-15/supersonic-jet-startup-boom-technology-is-now-a-unicorn">Bloomberg reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Cargo.one</strong>, the air cargo booking platform, <a href="https://www.cargo.one/press/series-b-announcement">raised $42 million</a> in a Series B funding round that was led by Bessemer Venture Partners. Existing investors Creandum, Index Ventures, Next47 and Point Nine also participated in the round. The company raised $18 million in a Series A round earlier this year.</p>
<p><strong>CarGurus</strong>, the online automotive marketplace, agreed to acquire a 51% interest in Plano, Texas-based CarOffer at an enterprise valuation of $275 million. Under the deal, CarGurus has the option to buy the remaining equity interest in the company over the next three years. CarOffer is an automated instant vehicle trade platform that offers an alternative to the traditional wholesale auction model.</p>
<p><strong>GoFor Industries</strong>, a Canadian delivery company, raised CA$20 million in a Series A round that will be used to drive its expansion into the United States, <a href="https://www.freightwaves.com/news/canadian-last-mile-delivery-startup-closes-20m-cad-series-a">Freightwaves reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Motorq</strong>, the connected car API company, raised $7 million in a Series A round of funding led by Story Ventures with participation from existing investors FM Capital and Monta Vista Capital. A new strategic investor, Avanta Ventures, the investment arm of CSAA, also joined the round.</p>
<p>Motorq developed a cloud-based system that captures and then monitors embedded data from a vehicle&#8217;s onboard computers and then run analytics and machine learning models on the data. Motorq says the system can help put those analytics into context, which can be combined with other information, and then sent to customers via application programming interfaces (APIs) and other tools. Datapoints include vehicle location, charge/fuel use, driver behavior, safety warnings, maintenance alerts and certain remote commands.</p>
<p><strong>Volcon ePowersports</strong> raised $2.5 million in public funding through the WeFunder platform. The company said it has raised more than $4.5 million since September through a seed round of funding and through WeFunder. The capital will be used to continue the build-out of Volcon&#8217;s production facilities and assembly lines. For the unfamiliar, Volcon is aiming to build and start deliveries of an all-electric off-road motorcycle called the Grunt in Spring 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Vroom</strong>, the online used-car company, has agreed to acquire Vast Holdings Inc., which includes Austin-based vehicle listings platform CarStory, for $120 million, <a href="https://www.autonews.com/retail/vroom-agrees-buy-carstory-120-million?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+autonews%2FBreakingNews+%28Automotive+News+Breaking+News+Feed%29">reported Automotive News</a>.</p>
<h2>Uber ATG-Aurora integration</h2>
<p>Autonomous vehicle company <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aurora-innovation" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="aurora-innovation">Aurora Innovation <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> isn&#8217;t wasting any time integrating with Uber Advanced Technologies Group. As you might recall, just a week or so ago, Aurora announced that it was acquiring Uber&#8217;s self-driving subsidiary in a complex deal that will give the combined company a valuation of $10 billion.</p>
<p>Aurora CEO Chris Urmson sent offers via email Thursday to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/aurora-sends-offers-to-majority-uber-atg-employees-but-not-the-rd-lab/">more than 75% of employees</a> at Uber ATG, according to a source familiar with the post-acquisition integration process. That&#8217;s more than 850 employees. If every employee accepts, Aurora will more than double in size overnight.</p>
<p>Uber ATG Toronto, which employs about 50 people where the subsidiary conducted its research and development work, did not make the cut, according to a source. Nor has Uber ATG&#8217;s chief scientist Raquel Urtasun, who led the Uber ATG R&amp;D team. Urtasun, who is considered a leading expert in machine perception for self-driving cars, is also a University of Toronto professor and the Canada Research Chair in Machine Learning and Computer Vision as well as the co-founder of the Vector Institute for AI.</p>
<p>News of the Toronto closure prompted a few venture capitalists and founders to share their surprise that Aurora wouldn&#8217;t have pinpointed Urtasun and the rest of the R&amp;D as some of the most desirable candidates to join the newly combined company. We don&#8217;t know if they did. Here&#8217;s what I can predict. If the texts and emails I received are any indication, Urtasun is already fielding offers from several other AV companies.</p>
<h2>One more policy thing</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896325 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png" alt="the station autonomous vehicles1" width="1600" height="401" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=1536,385 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/the-station-autonomous-vehicles1.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>A curious item popped up this week that certainly must have captured the attention of policy folks at any autonomous vehicle company planning to operate in the United States.</p>
<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration posted a notice this week that offers a clarification to AV policy. Before I dig in, let me provide a brief overview of the law.</p>
<p>Today, a motor vehicle must comply with all federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS), which set a minimum threshold of performance that a vehicle must meet. But once you determine that the &#8220;driver&#8221; can be system of hardware and software (a simplification I know) and not a human, it raises questions about whether a vehicle really needs the physical steering wheel and other traditional controls a robot simply has no use for.</p>
<p>This notice reverses prior statements that NHTSA made, most notably a letter of interpretation that the agency sent in 2016 to Chris Urmson, who at the time was heading up Google self-driving project.</p>
<p>The 2016 interpretation created a Catch-22 scenario for AV companies that wanted to use vehicles with novel designs like those that lacked a steering wheel or pedals. NHTSA said, at the time, that manufacturers had certify that a motor vehicle complied with requirements of all applicable FMVSS and to design the vehicle in such a way that NHTSA would be able to conduct each element of each test procedure specified within each applicable regulation. But that was impossible because certain test conditions or procedures could not be conducted on the vehicle as specified in the FMVSS</p>
<p>The only real path forward was for a company to ask for exemptions.</p>
<p>This notice not only acknowledges that the 2016 interpretation was too restrictive, it seems to have removed a major obstacle that will allow robotaxis to get on the road sooner.</p>
<p>And now suddenly, Levinson&#8217;s comments (yeah way back up at the top of this newsletter) make more sense. Here&#8217;s a <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-28107.pdf">link to the notice</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://ibm.com">IBM</a> has been busy since it announced plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/ibm-plans-to-spin-off-infrastructure-services-as-a-separate-19b-business/">spin out its legacy infrastructure management business</a> in October, placing an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/as-ibm-spins-out-legacy-infrastructure-management-biz-ceo-goes-all-in-on-the-cloud/">all-in bet on the hybrid cloud</a>. Today, it built on that bet by acquiring Helsinki-based multi-cloud consulting firm <a href="https://nordcloud.com/">Nordcloud</a>. The companies did not share the purchase price.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nordcloud" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nordcloud">Nordcloud <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> fits neatly into this strategy with 500 consultants certified in AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform, giving the company a trained staff of experts to help as they move away from an <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ibm" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ibm">IBM <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>-centric solution to choosing to work with the customer however they wish to implement their cloud strategy.</p>
<p>This hybrid approach harkens back to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/with-the-acquisition-closed-ibm-goes-all-in-on-red-hat/">the $34 billion Red Hat acquisition</a> in 2018, which is really the lynchpin for this approach, as CEO Arvind Krishna told CNBC&#8217;s Jon Fortt <a href="https://www.cnbcevents.com/cnbc-evolve-summit/">in an interview last month</a>. Krishna is in the midst of trying to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/">completely transform his organization</a>, and acquisitions like this are meant to speed up that process:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>The Red Hat acquisition gave us the technology base on which to build a hybrid cloud technology platform based on open-source, and based on giving choice to our clients as they embark on this journey. With the success of that acquisition now giving us the fuel, we can then take the next step, and the larger step, of taking the managed infrastructure services out. So the rest of the company can be absolutely focused on hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence.</p></blockquote>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;IBM is acquiring APM startup Instana as it continues to expand hybrid cloud vision&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/ibm-is-acquiring-apm-startup-instana-as-it-continues-to-expand-hybrid-cloud-vision/embed/#?secret=V9tzjYrhWS" data-secret="V9tzjYrhWS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>John Granger, senior vice president for cloud application innovation and COO for IBM Global Business Services, says that IBM&#8217;s customers are increasingly looking for help managing resources across multiple vendors, as well as on premises.</p>
<p>&#8220;IBM&#8217;s acquisition of Nordcloud adds the kind of deep expertise that will drive our clients’ digital transformations as well as support the further adoption of IBM&#8217;s hybrid cloud platform. Nordcloud’s cloud-native tools, methodologies and talent send a strong signal that IBM is committed to deliver our clients’ successful journey to cloud,&#8221; Granger said in a statement.</p>
<p>After the deal closes, which is expected in the first quarter next year subject to typical regulatory approvals, Nordcloud will become an IBM company and operate to help continue this strategy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that this deal comes on the heels several other small recent deals, including <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-acquires-expertus-technologies-inc-to-expand-hybrid-cloud-digital-payment-solutions-301193468.html">acquiring Expertus</a> last week and <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-11-16-IBM-to-Acquire-SAP-Consulting-Partner-TruQua">Truqua</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/ibm-is-acquiring-apm-startup-instana-as-it-continues-to-expand-hybrid-cloud-vision/">Instana</a> last month. These three companies provide expertise in digital payments, SAP consulting and hybrid cloud applications performance monitoring, respectively.</p>
<p>Nordcloud, which is based in Helsinki with offices in Amsterdam, was founded in 2011 and has raised more than $26 million, according to PitchBook data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. government is one of the biggest spenders in the nascent space industry, and the man who handles the money for the Air Force&#8217;s $16 billion checkbook wants startups to know that his door is open for them.</p>
<p>In all, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/will-roper" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="will-roper">Will Roper, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, handles about $60 billion worth of budget for the Air Force &#8212; a mandate that includes spending money on the new tech initiatives the Air Force deems important.</p>
<p>Historically, the Department of Defense hasn&#8217;t been the greatest at working with startups &#8212; and many tech companies have been loath to work with the DoD. However, since much of modern civilian infrastructure is based on global positioning systems and other satellite technologies that fall under the Defense Department&#8217;s purview, those views on cooperation are changing on both sides.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Space isn&#8217;t a quiet domain of communication and navigation and exploration anymore,&#8221; Roper told the audience at TechCrunch&#8217;s latest Sessions event, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/">TC Sessions: Space 2020</a>. &#8220;It&#8217;s increasingly becoming a hostile place&#8230; So we&#8217;re gearing up a new kind of competition on the military side that could extend to space and that&#8217;s creating a lot of new space programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roper emphasized that the interest from the Air Force and the government more broadly extends well beyond offensive capabilities and military priorities. As space becomes an economic opportunity, Roper sees the Air Force as an engine for driving technology development forward in ways that have commercial benefits.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great, great time for innovation in new technologies that could help the military, but we want to do more than just help the military. That&#8217;s the old thinking in the Pentagon. That&#8217;s all that would help us win the Cold War in the 20th Century, but it&#8217;s not going to help us in the 21st, where technology is globalized and accelerating,&#8221; Roper said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to find ways where our military mission and our funding can help accelerate commercial markets too, so it&#8217;s competing on a much bigger stage. But we think it&#8217;s where we need to aspire to be, so that we&#8217;re playing the right catalyst role in this nation and with our partners around the world,&#8221; Roper said.</p>
<p>There are several programs that startups can tap to get those federal dollars. Two of the easiest points of entry are through the <a href="https://afwerx.com/">AFWERX</a> and its<a href="https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2438536/spacewerx-launch-announced-during-afwerx-accelerate/"> recently announced SpaceWERX</a> arm focused entirely on space technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;These look like any tech company,&#8221; Roper told the audience at the TechCrunch event. &#8220;They&#8217;re outside our fence lines. They&#8217;re easy to walk into&#8230; Now you don&#8217;t have to know the mission, we will help you find the mission and the customer &#8212; the warfighter associated with it. It&#8217;s a great model because it keeps the company focused on what they know best, which is their tech.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the last three years, Roper estimated that the AFWERX program had brought 2,300 companies into the Air Force and Space Force programs, and most of them had never worked with the military before, he said.</p>
<p>Within AFWERX there are three programs that particularly relate to integrating startups into the procurement process, Roper said. One is the <a href="https://www.afwerx.af.mil/airmen-guide.html">Spark program</a>, which pairs military with private industry; one is the <a href="https://www.afwerx.af.mil/afventures.html">AFVentures</a> program, which is designed to finance new innovations coming from private industry; and finally there&#8217;s the Prime program, which helps commercialize and certify technologies.</p>
<p>Roper pointed to the recent certification the Air Force gave to Joby Aviation for its flying cars. &#8220;So there&#8217;s a new military market that will hopefully generate a new commercial market,&#8221; Roper said.</p>
<p>In 2021, the Prime program will expand to space technologies, according to Roper.</p>
<p>As the demand for new tech grows, there&#8217;s no shortage of innovations Roper would like to see from private industry. From new autonomous innovations that could help co-pilot spacecraft to technology for refueling and in-space maneuverability, and reusable equipment from boosters to other components that can bring costs down.</p>
<p>Roper also acknowledged that the Pentagon has a long way to go to &#8220;hack the acquisition system&#8221; when it comes to dual-use technologies.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs have pointed out that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/20/entrepreneurs-say-regulatory-constraints-are-hampering-commercial-applications-of-space-tech/">one of the biggest obstacles to the growth of the commercial space industry has been the inability of the U.S. government to open up the technology for use by private industry</a>.</p>

<p>Roper hopes to change that. &#8220;We want to use our military dollars, our mission, and potentially our certifications to help get you there without changing your core product,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you succeed as a commercial success, then we succeed as well, because now we&#8217;ve got a great tech partner, that hopefully we can continue to come to to solve problems in future. The thing that we&#8217;ll want to understand early on is how our military market and all those benefits I just mentioned, how can they help you get to commercial success? And what is it that we not need to do to pull you off that trajectory?&#8221;</p>
<p>Contracts with AFWERX are fixed-price and progress as companies hit certain milestones on the product roadmap. These orders increase incrementally as the technology proves itself, so a contract could start with the delivery of a prototype, then experimental usage, then a commercial contract, then broad adoption. &#8220;What we&#8217;re looking to do is see if you can move the ball forward on your technology, and if you do, then we do another contract. We step you up our process,&#8221; Roper said.</p>
<p>Roper sees the project as nothing less than the evolution of the aerospace and defense industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot of amazing companies today that helped build stealth bombers and space planes and all sorts of awesome stuff. They&#8217;re defense companies and we still need them,&#8221; Roper said. &#8220;What we&#8217;re hoping to help build in this century is a set of new companies that are just tech companies. They&#8217;re not defense, purely, and they&#8217;re not commercial purely. They&#8217;re just technology companies and they do a bit of business on both sides.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify users have<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/spotify-launches-2020-wrapped-with-new-features-including-quizzes-badges-and-yes-stories/"> Wrapped</a> and Instagram users <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/12/30/instagram-top-9-how-to-2/">have</a> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/31/business/instagram-top-nine-how-to-trnd/index.html">their Top 9</a>. And now TikTok users will have their own year-in-review feature, too. The company today <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/year-on-tiktok">announced</a> the launch of its first personalized annual recap feature with the launch of &#8220;Year on TikTok,&#8221; a video highlight reel that showcases individual users&#8217; own top TikTok moments. This includes things like how long you&#8217;ve been on TikTok, what sort of videos you watched most, your favorite tracks and creative effects, metrics on how often you commented and shared videos, and more.</p>
<p>The feature will also identify your favorite &#8220;vibes&#8221; &#8212; meaning, the sort of videos you like best, such as crafts, cooking, animals, travel, Cottagecore or any of the now numerous communities that have sprung up on the social video platform.</p>
<p>If users haven&#8217;t been on TikTok long enough to have developed their own &#8220;vibe,&#8221; TikTok says their &#8220;Year on TikTok&#8221; will include other top videos from its &#8220;<a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/the-year-on-tiktok-top-100">Year on TikTok: Top 100</a>&#8221; list instead.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2089770" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089770" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2089770" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-from-iOS.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-from-iOS.png 1125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=768,1663 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=946,2048 946w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089770" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>The content for the recap is presented in a familiar way. You&#8217;ll vertically scroll down through a video that details your 2020 interests and activities. You then have the chance to share that video directly to your own TikTok profile in order to receive a special profile badge that puts a &#8220;2020&#8221; on top of your profile photo.</p>
<p>The app&#8217;s &#8220;Year on TikTok&#8221; page also includes other TikTok highlights to browse through, including top memes, top creators, top viral videos, most impactful creators, top celebs, top songs and other year-end trends.</p>
<p>TikTok users can access their &#8220;Year on TikTok&#8221; by tapping the icon on their For You feed &#8212; a prominent placement &#8212; or by scrolling to the banner at the top of the app&#8217;s Discover page.</p>
<p>The accuracy of TikTok&#8217;s recap is debatable. For example, even though every other video in my For You feed is related to politics and news (go figure!), TikTok informed me my top &#8220;vibes&#8221; were things like home, travel and animal videos. That&#8217;s true too, but it&#8217;s an incomplete list and doesn&#8217;t match up with the majority of my past &#8220;likes.&#8221; It seems that TikTok may be curating the experience to focus on more positive &#8220;vibes&#8221; &#8212; and political videos and themes didn&#8217;t make the cut.</p>
<p>Regardless of its attempts at spin, social features that offer users a personalized retrospective of how they engaged with an app through the year have proven to be fairly popular &#8212; and a good marketing mechanism, as well.</p>
<p>Spotify&#8217;s Wrapped, for instance, has been so well-received that people began to complain that people&#8217;s Wrapped shares were dominating and overwhelming their social feeds at year-end. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/spotify-launches-2020-wrapped-with-new-features-including-quizzes-badges-and-yes-stories/">Spotify this year partially addressed this problem</a> by offering new customization options for its 2020 Wrapped that let users adjust the color of their Wrapped card before sharing. This way, the flood of Wrapped shares wouldn&#8217;t look quite as homogenous as in prior years, and may be perceived as less of an annoyance.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Year on TikTok&#8221; feature will likely do well, too, though it&#8217;s hard to track. The hashtag #YearOnTikTok is up to 5.4 billion views, thanks to users who are adopting the tag in hopes of propelling their videos to a wider audience or getting on the For You page. The real test will be how many creators end up with the 2020 badge stuck on their profile in the days to come.</p>
<p>While TikTok&#8217;s feature is fun, if you find it somewhat lacking there are third-party alternatives.</p>
<p>One app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/retroplay/id1540371699">Retroplay</a>, launched its own 2020 TikTok Year in Review this month. The app does more than just round-up your own stats and metrics. Users can also vote for their favorite creators and videos through Retroplay&#8217;s &#8220;Superlatives&#8221; awards, collect cards from favorite creators and customize their own highlight reel. But the app is brand-new and struggling with bugs &#8212; the highlight reel is currently down while it&#8217;s being fixed, for instance, and the app couldn&#8217;t resolve a username that began with a period instead of a letter, we found.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to focus more on the year-in-review for content creators, and over the past two weeks have been working with creators to get their ideas. We&#8217;ve temporarily disabled the Highlight Reel feature based on feedback,&#8221; the developers responded in an email to TechCrunch. They said creators will be able to create their Top 4 or Top 9 video compilations through a new feature launching at the end of the week.</p>

<p>The app also had difficulties pulling data as TikTok didn&#8217;t offer an API and cut them off from accessing public-facing user videos and pulling stats.</p>
<p>But the app&#8217;s design is catchy and the interactive features are engaging, so hopefully the developer can address the other issues soon &#8212; and before year-end!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A long-awaited COVID-19 relief bill finally received congressional approval over the weekend. Top-line efforts include plans to bolster a population feeling intense strain after nine months of shutdown. The $600 direct payment has, understandably, grabbed the most headlines, but there’s a ton to dig into amidst the $900 billion package.</p>
<p>Most relevant for our coverage is several billion earmarked for broadband-related issues, including $7 billion set aside to increase broadband access for low-income Americans. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer issued a release noting that the money will go to “help[ing] millions of students, families and unemployed workers afford the broadband they need during the pandemic.” The deal includes $50 a month for broadband for qualifying families.</p>
<p>Internet access has been one of countless pain points, as schools across the country have shut down in order to stop the spread of COVID-19. Lack of a solid internet connection can severely hamstring remote schooling.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Also notable is the $1.9 billion set aside to “rip and replace” ZTE and Huawei equipment, according to reporting from <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-internet-congress/u-s-lawmakers-back-1-9-billion-to-replace-telecom-equipment-from-chinas-huawei-zte-sources-idUSKBN28U0MC">Reuters</a>. Huawei in particular has been a longtime target for the U.S. government. The Chinese technology giant was added to the Department of Commerce’s so-called Entity List last year. Precisely what such moves have meant for companies like Huawei and ZTE has been something of an evolving picture in subsequent months.</p>
<p>More legislation earlier this year officially barred U.S. companies from purchasing networking equipment from either, followed by plans to begin the process to “rip and replace” existing services. Part of the new bill, it seems, will involve the purchasing of equipment to replace gear being removed from U.S. networks.</p>
<p>A Huawei spokesperson earlier noted, “to force removal of our products from telecommunications networks. This overreach puts U.S. citizens at risk in the largely underserved rural areas &#8212; during a pandemic &#8212; when reliable communication is essential.”</p>
<p>The future status of companies like Huawei and ZTE under the incoming Biden administration, however, remains to be seen. Notably, the Commerce Department recently added an additional 77 names to the Entity List, including prominent Chinese firms DJI and SMIC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NextMind debuted its Dev Kit hardware at CES last year, but the <a href="https://www.next-mind.com">hardware is now actually shipping</a>, and the startup shared with me the production version to take a test drive. The<a href="https://www.next-mind.com"> NextMind controller</a> is a sensor that reads electrical signals from your brain&#8217;s visual cortex, and translates those into input signals for a connected PC. A lot of companies have developed novel input solutions that use either eye tracking or electrical impulse input from the body, but NextMind&#8217;s is the first I&#8217;ve tried that worked instantly and wonderfully, providing a truly amazing experience of a kind that&#8217;s hard to find in the current world of relatively mature computing paradigms.</p>
<h2>The basics</h2>
<p>NextMind&#8217;s developer kit is just that &#8212; a product aimed at developers that&#8217;s meant to give them everything they need to get building software that works with NextMind&#8217;s hardware and APIs. It includes the NextMind sensor, which works with a range of headgear, including simple straps, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/oculus-vr" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="oculus-vr">Oculus <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> VR headsets and even baseball hats, along with the software and SDK required to make it work on your PC.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2089746" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089746" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2089746" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NextMind_Product3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NextMind_Product3.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NextMind_Product3.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NextMind_Product3.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NextMind_Product3.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NextMind_Product3.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NextMind_Product3.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/NextMind_Product3.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089746" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NextMind</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The package that NextMind provided me included the sensor, a fabric headband, a Surface PC with the engine pre-installed and a USB gamepad for use with one of the company&#8217;s pre-built software demos.</p>
<p>The sensor itself is lightweight, and can operate for up to eight hours continuously on a single charge. It can charge via USB-C, and its software is compatible with both Mac and PC, along with Oculus, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/htc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="htc">HTC <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Vive and also Microsoft&#8217;s HoloLens.</p>
<h2>Design and features</h2>
<p>The NextMind sensor itself is surprisingly small and light &#8212; it fits in the palm of your hand, with two arms that extend slightly beyond that. It features an integrated clip mount that can be used to attach it to just about anything to secure it to your head. In terms of fit, you just need to ensure that the nine sets of two-pronged electrode sensors make contact with your skin, which NextMind provides instructions on doing by essentially making sure it straps snugly to your head, and then &#8220;combing&#8221; the device slightly (moving it up and down to get your hair out of the way).</p>
<p>It wears comfortably, though you will notice the electrodes pressing into your skin, especially over longer use periods. The ability to use a standard baseball cap with the clip makes it super convenient to install and wear, and it worked with the Oculus Rift and Oculus Quest headstraps easily and instantly, too.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2089745" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089745" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2089745" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MusicProd-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MusicProd-2.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MusicProd-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MusicProd-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MusicProd-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MusicProd-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MusicProd-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MusicProd-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089745" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> NextMind</p></div></p>
<p>Setup was a breeze. I was guided by NextMind&#8217;s co-creators, but the app provides clear instructions as well. There&#8217;s a calibration process during which you look at an animation being displayed on the host PC, which helps the sensor identify the specific signals your occipital lobe is emitting when performing the target behaviour that you&#8217;ll later use to actually interact with NextMind-optimized software.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where it&#8217;s worth pausing to explain how NextMind is actually &#8220;reading your thoughts&#8221;: The sensor basically learns what it looks like when your brain is engaged in what the company calls &#8220;active, visual focus.&#8221; It does this using a common signal that it overlays on controllable elements of a software&#8217;s graphical user interface. That way, when you focus on a specific item, it can translate that into a &#8220;press&#8221; action, or a &#8220;hold and move,&#8221; or any other number of potential output results.</p>
<p>NextMind&#8217;s system is elegantly simple in conception, which is probably why it feels so powerful and rich in use. After the calibration process, I immediately jumped into the demos and was performing a range of actions effectively with my brain. First was media playback and window management on a desktop, and from there I moved on to composing music, entering a pin on a number pad and playing multiple games, including a platform where my mind control was supplementing my physical input on a USB gamepad to create a whole new level of fun and complex gameplay that wouldn&#8217;t be possible otherwise.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/DTS-w4K8m08?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent&#038;listType=playlist&#038;list=PLhD-5xWuPzi1yQBfKIgJCAYc1h9WTtB-_' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>This is a Dev Kit, so the included software is just a small sampling of what could be possible with NextMind eventually, now that developers are able to build their own. What&#8217;s amazing is that the included samples are breathtaking on their own, providing an overall experience that is mind-bending in all the best possible ways. Imagining a future where NextMind hardware is even smaller and a seamless part of an overall computing experience that also includes traditional input is tantalizing, indeed.</p>
<h2>Bottom line</h2>
<p>NextMind&#8217;s Dev Kit is definitely just that &#8212; a Dev Kit. It&#8217;s intended for developers who are going to use it to write their own software that will take advantage of this unique, safe and convenient form of brain-computer interface (BCI). The <a href="https://www.next-mind.com">kit retails for €399 (around $487 USD), and is now shipping</a>. NextMind has plans to eventually consumerise the product, and to work with other OEMs as well on implementations, but for now, even in this state, it&#8217;s an awe-inspiring glimpse into what could well be the next major shift in our daily computing paradigm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://eneba.com">Eneba</a>, a marketplace for gamers that sells games and other products, has raised an $8 million round of funding from Practica Capital and InReach Ventures. The funding is described as a &#8220;combination&#8221; of a seed and Series A round. Also participating in the funding for the Lithuanian startup was FJ Labs and a group of angel investors, including Mantas Mikuckas, COO of Vinted. The investment highlights once again the strength of the Baltics region as a tech ecosystem, after Lithuania produced its first Unicorn in the shape of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/27/vinted-the-second-hand-clothes-marketplace-raises-141m-at-a-1b-valuation/">Vinted</a>, and Estonia added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/european-unicorns-are-no-longer-a-pipe-dream/">Pipedrive</a> to its unicorns list.</p>
<p>With the increased shift to digital entertainment during the pandemic, the startup has managed to garner much more U.S. traffic. Launched in 2018 by two Lithuanian school friends, Vytis Uogintas and Žygimantas Mikšta, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/eneba" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="eneba">Eneba <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> says it has attracted 26 million unique users because of its security features, &#8220;one-click to buy&#8221; gamer experience and fingerprinting technology. The site also optimizes its localized gaming experiences to show locally trending gaming products. Eneba’s platform is designed to reduce risky transactions, simplify the refunding process and deal with fraud threats.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CMO Žygimantas Mikšta said: &#8220;We had a lot of new users coming to Eneba during these uncertain times. While it was extremely satisfying to see our numbers increasing tenfold, there was a challenge to meet the demand. To better reflect our user numbers, we had to quickly expand our team to 130.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Security has risen up the agenda in online gaming as virtual goods and services connected to games can be highly susceptible to fraud or theft. Although it competes with outlets like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ebay" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ebay">eBay <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and retailers like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gamestop" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gamestop">GameStop <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Game.co.uk, Eneba thinks it has found a better, tailored online pre/post-buying experience for gamers, while addressing the risk problems for sellers and buyers in the gaming world.</p>

<p>In <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/realpage" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="realpage">RealPage, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Thoma Bravo is getting a full-service property management platform with services like renter portals, site management, expense management and financial analysis for building and property owners.

<p>&#8220;RealPage’s industry leading platform is critical to the real estate ecosystem and has tremendous potential going forward,&#8221; Bravo said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As for RealPage, company CEO Steve Winn, who will remain with the company, sees the deal as a big win for stock holders, while giving them the ability to keep investing in the product. &#8220;This will enhance our ability to focus on executing our long-term strategy and delivering even better products and services to our clients and partners,”  Winn said in a statement.</p>

<p>RealPage, which was founded in 1998 and went public in 2010, is a typical kind of mature platform that a private equity firm like Thoma Bravo is attracted to. It has a strong customer base with more than 12,000 customers, and respectable revenue, growing at a modest pace. In its most <a href="https://investor.realpage.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/350/realpage-reports-third-quarter-2020-financial-results">recent earnings statement</a>, the company announced $298.1 million in revenue, up 17% year over year. That puts it on a run rate of more than $1 billion.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, Thoma Bravo will pay RealPage stockholders $88.75 in cash per share. That is a premium of more 30% over the $67.83 closing price on December 18th. The transaction is subject to standard regulatory review, and the RealPage board will have a 45-day &#8220;go shop&#8221; window to see if it can find a better price. Given the premium pricing on this deal, that isn&#8217;t likely, but it will have the opportunity to try.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://onetrust.com/">OneTrust</a>, the four-year-old privacy platform startup from the folks who brought you <a href="http://airwatch.com">AirWatch</a> (which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/22/vmwares-1-5b-airwatch-buy-all-about-mobile-workplace/">acquired by VMmare for $1.5 billion</a> in 2014), announced a $300 million Series C on an impressive $5.1 billion valuation today.</p>
<p>The company has attracted considerable attention from investors in a remarkably short time. It came out of the box with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/onetrust-raises-200m-at-a-1-3b-valuation-to-help-organizations-navigate-online-privacy-rules/">a $200 million Series A</a> on a $1.3 billion valuation in July 2019. Those are not typical A round numbers, but this has never been a typical startup. The Series B was more of the same &#8212; $210 million on a $2.7 billion valuation this past February.</p>
<p>That brings us to today&#8217;s Series C. Consider that the company has almost doubled its valuation again, and has raised $710 million in a mere 18 months, some of it during a pandemic. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/technology-crossover-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="technology-crossover-ventures">TCV <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> led today&#8217;s round joining existing investors Insight Partners and Coatue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So what are they doing to attract all this cash? In a world where privacy laws like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/gdpr" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="gdpr">GDPR <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and CCPA are already in play, with others in the works in the U.S. and around the world, companies need to be sure they are compliant with local laws wherever they operate. That&#8217;s where <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/onetrust" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="onetrust">OneTrust <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> comes in.</p>
<p>&#8220;We help companies ensure that they can be trusted, and that they make sure that they&#8217;re compliant to all laws around privacy, trust and risk,&#8221; OneTrust Chairman Alan Dabbiere told me.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xvxQB7247M"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/onetrust-raises-200m-at-a-1-3b-valuation-to-help-organizations-navigate-online-privacy-rules/">OneTrust raises $200M at a $1.3B valuation to help organizations navigate online privacy rules</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;OneTrust raises $200M at a $1.3B valuation to help organizations navigate online privacy rules&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/11/onetrust-raises-200m-at-a-1-3b-valuation-to-help-organizations-navigate-online-privacy-rules/embed/#?secret=xvxQB7247M" data-secret="xvxQB7247M" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That involves a suite of products that the company has already built or acquired, moving very quickly to offer a privacy platform to cover all aspects of a customer&#8217;s privacy requirements, including privacy management, discovery, third-party risk assessment, risk management, ethics and compliance and consent management.</p>
<p>The company has already attracted 7,500 customers to the platform &#8212; and is adding1,000 additional customers per quarter. Dabbiere says that the products are helping them be compliant without adding a lot of friction to the building or buying process. &#8220;The goal is that we don&#8217;t slow the process down, we speed it up. And there&#8217;s a new philosophy called privacy by design,&#8221; he said. That means building privacy transparency into products, while making sure they are compliant with all of the legal and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>The startup hasn&#8217;t been shy about using its investments to buy pieces of the platform, having made four acquisitions already in just four years since it was founded. It already has 1,500 employees and plans to add around 900 more in 2021.</p>
<p>As they build this workforce, Dabbiere says being based in a highly diverse city like Atlanta has helped in terms of building a diverse group of employees. &#8220;By finding the best employees and doing it in an area like Atlanta, we are finding the diversity comes naturally,&#8221; he said, adding, &#8220;We are thoughtful about it.&#8221; CEO Kabir Barday also launched a diversity, equity and inclusion council internally this past summer in response to the Black Lives Matter movement happening in the Atlanta community and around the country.</p>
<p>OneTrust had relied heavily on trade shows before the pandemic hit. In fact, Dabbiere says that they attended as many as 700 a year. When that avenue closed as the pandemic hit, they initially lowered their revenue guidance, but as they moved to digital channels along with their customers, they found that revenue didn&#8217;t drop as they expected.</p>
<p>He says that OneTrust has money in the bank from its prior investments, but they had reasons for taking on more cash now anyway. &#8220;The number one reason for doing this was the currency of our stock. We needed to revalue it for employees, for acquisitions, and the next steps of our growth,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lockheed-martin" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lockheed-martin">Lockheed Martin <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (LM), the U.S.’s largest defence contractor, will acquire <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aerojet-rocketdyne" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="aerojet-rocketdyne">Aerojet Rocketdyne <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> (AR), a rocket engine and missile manufacturer, for $4.4 billion including debt and net cash, giving the company a larger stake in space and hypersonic technology. The move comes amid the context of increasing competition in the Space and Defence industries.</p>
<p>In a news release, the company said the proposed acquisition adds substantial expertise in propulsion to Lockheed Martin’s portfolio and that Aerojet Rocketdyne’s technologies were already &#8220;key components&#8221; of Lockheed’s supply chain. It already uses Aerojet Rocketdyne’s propulsion systems in its aeronautics, missiles and fire control offerings.</p>
<p>Aerojet Rocketdyne’s 2019 revenues were approximately $2 billion. The company, headquartered in El Segundo, California, has nearly 5,000 employees and was formed in 2013 when GenCorp’s Aerojet and Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne were merged. The company produces solid rocket motors as well as tactical and strategic missiles for the Defense Department.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>AR makes the RL10 rocket engine that powers the upper stage of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/united-launch-alliance" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="united-launch-alliance">United Launch Alliance’s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Delta 4 and Atlas 5 launch vehicles, and also produces the RS-25 engines for NASA’s Space Launch System.</p>
<p>The company’s move comes as it attempts to increase its propulsion capabilities to compete with new entrants such as <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-exploration-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-exploration-technologies">SpaceX <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/blue-origin" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="blue-origin">Blue Origin <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> for space contracts with the U.S. government. Meanwhile, rival Raytheon is preparing to combine with United Technologies Corp. to create an aerospace-and-defense giant.</p>
<p>Lockheed CEO James Taiclet said in a statement: “Acquiring Aerojet Rocketdyne will preserve and strengthen an essential component of the domestic defense industrial base and reduce costs for our customers and the American taxpayer.”</p>
<p>Aerojet’s CEO Eileen Drake said: “As part of Lockheed Martin, we will bring our advanced technologies together with their substantial expertise and resources to accelerate our shared purpose: enabling the defense of our nation and space exploration.&#8221;</p>
<p>The acquisition is expected to close in the second half of 2021 but will be subject to the usual requirement for approvals by regulators and Aerojet Rocketdyne’s stockholders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in January, <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/introducing-the-oneplus-concept-one.1167337/">OnePlus showed off</a> its first concept phone. The aptly (if plainly) named Concept One sported color-shifting glass, giving the effect of an “invisible camera” on the rear of the device. The concept wasn’t particularly useful &#8212; if anything it was a fun diversion from boring old phone updates.</p>
<p>From that standpoint, the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/oneplus" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="oneplus">OnePlus <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> 8T Concept is more of the same. It’s not particularly useful as far as smartphone updates go &#8212; and more to the point, there’s absolutely zero guarantee this technology will ever make it onto an actual phone. Once again, the headlining technology has more to do with how the phone looks than how it actually functions.</p>
<p>The big thing here is something called ECMF, or Electronic Color, Material and Finish. Basically it’s a color-changing film that coats the phone. It has metal oxide, which activates when voltage is applied, changing the glass from dark blue to light silver.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2089443" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089443" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2089443" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/16-9.2020-12-18-18_27_00.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089443" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> OnePlus</p></div></p>
<p>OnePlus says, “Our designers took inspiration for these colors from the multi-hued flowing water in the hot springs of Pamukkale, Turkey. Nature has perfected many designs, and by drawing inspiration from Pamukkale and other natural elements, we can craft new interaction experiences that are more natural, intuitive, and effortless.”</p>
<p>As for the utility of such technologies, OnePlus suggests a coat that changes color to notify the user of incoming calls. Weirder still is a future that uses mmWave technology to capture a user’s breathing pattern, “enabling the color to change in sync and effectively making the phone a biofeedback device.”</p>
<p>As far as new phone features, this one is firmly in the “why not” column.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An Indian court rejected <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/future-group" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="future-group">Future Group&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> plea that sought to prevent its partner <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> from interfering in &#8212; and blocking &#8212; the Indian retail giant&#8217;s $3.4 billion asset sale deal to Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries, delivering a glimmer of hope to the American e-commerce firm that has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/amazon-to-invest-1-billion-to-digitize-small-businesses-in-india/">invested more than $6.5 billion</a> in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Future Group was seeking an ad-interim injunction to restrain its partner Amazon from writing to regulators and other authorities to raise concerns over &#8212; and halt &#8212; the deal between the two Indian giants. The Delhi High Court ruled on Monday that Amazon cannot be barred from writing to regulators and authorities on account of &#8220;potentially irreparable damage.&#8221; The regulators will decide whether the deal should be approved in accordance with the law, the court said.</p>
<p>The court, however, also observed that the lawsuit filed by Future Retail, a unit of Future Group, was maintainable and its attempt to seek approval of the transaction with Reliance Industries was also valid.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We welcome the verdict of the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi rejecting the interim injunction sought by Future Retail and their claim that the Emergency Arbitrator process is invalid under Indian law,” an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
<p>The ruling is the latest episode in the high-stake battle between estranged partners Amazon and Future Group. Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/amazon-future-coupons/">bought 49% in one of Future’s unlisted firms</a> last year in a deal that was valued at over $100 million. As part of that deal, Future could not have sold assets to rivals, Amazon said in court filings.</p>
<p>Things changed this year after the coronavirus pandemic starved the Indian firm of cash, Future Group chief executive and founder Kishore Biyani said at a recent virtual conference. In August, Future Group said that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/29/indias-reliance-retail-to-acquire-future-groups-retail-wholesale-and-logistics-businesses-for-3-4-billion/">reached an agreement with Ambani’s Reliance Industries</a>, which runs India’s largest retail chain, to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics, and warehousing businesses for $3.4 billion.</p>
<p>Months later, Amazon protested the deal by reaching an arbitrator in Singapore and asked the court to block the deal between the Indian retail giants. Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/25/reliance-says-its-3-4-billion-deal-with-future-group-fully-enforceable-under-indian-law-despite-amazon-winning-an-arbitration-order/">secured emergency relief from the arbitration court</a> in Singapore in late October that temporarily halted Future Group from going ahead with the sale.</p>
<p>Until Monday, it remained unclear whether that ruling would hold any water in front of Indian courts. So much so that hours after the Singapore arbitration court announced its verdict, Future Group and Reliance said in a statement that will be going ahead with the deal &#8220;without any delay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amazon had also reached out to the Competition Commission of India, the Indian watchdog, to block the deal. Competition Commission of India, however, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/india-approves-reliances-3-4-billion-deal-with-future-group-brings-a-new-headache-to-amazon/">approved the deal</a> between the Indian firms. In earlier hearings, lawyers for Future Group likened Amazon’s effort to block Future Group’s deal to the East India Company, the British trading house whose arrival in India kicked off nearly 200 years of colonial rule.</p>
<p>At stake is India’s retail market that is estimated to balloon to $1.3 trillion by 2025, up from $700 billion last year, according to consultancy firm BCG and local trade group Retailers’ Association India. Online shopping accounts for about 3% of all retail in India.</p>
<p>Future Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>The conglomerate first revealed its SPAC plans in October when SoftBank Investment Advisers chief executive officer Rajeev Misra<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/12/softbank-vision-fund-head-rajeev-misra-vision-fund-2-is-backing-spac.html"> said he was planning a SPAC</a> while speaking at the Milken Institute Global Conference. An SPAC would give the Vision Fund another way of investing in private companies, and also allow the public to invest in SoftBank’s portfolio picks.</p>
<p>SPACs are blank-check companies created for the purpose of merging or acquiring other companies, and have gained popularity this year as an alternative to traditional stock market debuts.</p>
<p>While this would be SoftBank’s first SPAC, one of its portfolio companies, real-estate platform OpenDoor, recently went public through an SPAC. Another one of its investments, Indonesian e-commerce giant Tokopedia, is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/47ac0aa7-220c-4f8e-baac-4f44cfb09156">also considering going public through a SPAC</a> backed by Richard Li and Peter Thiel, after putting its IPO plans because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for SoftBank said it had no comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Payam Banazadeh and his team started <a href="https://www.capellaspace.com/">Capella Space</a> in 2016, they had visions of providing private industry with a wealth of new data that they could use in all sorts of ways to create business opportunities and improve efficiencies.</p>
<p>Four years later, Banazadeh is still waiting for that commercial opportunity.</p>
<p>Capella is still successful. The company has managed to raise $82 million in venture capital financing and has a robust pipeline of government contracts, but Banazadeh has not seen the kinds of uptake in private industry.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He&#8217;s not the only one.</p>
<p>Speaking at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2020/">TC Sessions: Space 2020</a>, Banazadeh was among a number of executives including Peter Platzer, the chief executive officer of <a href="https://spire.com/">Spire Global</a>; Helsinki-based <a href="https://www.iceye.com/">ICEYE&#8217;</a>s co-founder and chief executive Rafal Modrzewski; and Melanie Stricklan, the founder and chief strategy officer of Slingshot Aerospace; who spoke about the central role government plays in the current space business and how they&#8217;re hoping that will change.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think regulation in the US&#8230; has made huge improvements this past year. But the challenge is always how do you balance national security concerns with making sure that the US industrial space can keep up with the competition internationally,&#8221; Banazadeh said. &#8220;I think we need to&#8230; in the US&#8230; we need to take a leadership position to not just restrict the US companies on following what international companies are doing, but rather allow US companies to go above and beyond and be able to capture more of the commercial market by being able to provide some of the more advanced features [that they have] on the government side.&#8221;</p>
<p>Modrzewski agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we were starting <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/iceye" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="iceye">ICEYE, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> we were kind of all under the impression that the idea behind new space and things that we are doing, is really to enable the use of observation for the betterment of the world&#8230; For improving efficiencies of businesses, monitoring climate change, doing all these things that that that we haven&#8217;t been able to do to do before,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And when I look at basically democratizing data and handing best capabilities available to commercial industries, as well as to the government, ultimately, right, because they are users of the same, the same supply chain. I see that you know, the largest factor that&#8217;s currently stopping the evolution is actually national approach to particular sets of activities. I think the the more globally we approach to the market, the broader the competition, the less limitation we impact&#8230; It seems to work significantly better for everyone as a global community, if we allow those companies to freely collaborate, and the data exchange to be free. So if there was one wish that I had for 2021, it is to have less borders, and more open markets in terms of exchange of data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Governments are, already, massive customers for most of these businesses. In total government spending represents around half of the total $423 billion spent on the space industry already,<a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/5049/space-exploration/"> according to data from Statista</a>.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investing-in-space#:~:text=The%20Global%20Space%20Economy&amp;text=Morgan%20Stanley%20estimates%20that%20the,from%20satellite%20broadband%20Internet%20access.">if the industry is to achieve the $1 trillion potential revenue that Morgan Stanley projects for businesses in the next 20 years</a>, then more will have to be done to unlock private industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we started the company, we saw the immediate opportunity in commercial. And as we dug a little deeper and made some progress, we realized that the commercial market is still not as mature as we had hoped it to be. And in the meantime, we quickly found out that the government market, both US government, as well as international governments are expanding and growing much faster than, than before, specifically for this type of data, because of the new challenges and challenges and threats that are that are around the corner,&#8221; Banazadeh said. &#8220;And so we&#8217;ve pivoted and focused on going after governments in catering to their needs&#8230; We do want to get back into commercial, we have that aspiration. And that&#8217;s our long term goal. We just think that we&#8217;re probably a few years out to get there.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the commercial market may not have materialized to the degree that these entrepreneurs would have hoped, there are still opportunities for plenty of business from government contracts thanks, in part, to the increasing complexity of operating in space.</p>
<p>That means big business for company&#8217;s like <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/slingshot-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="slingshot-3">Slingshot, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which provides what Stricklan calls &#8220;situational awareness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether that&#8217;s in orbit or terrestrially, we provide answers to our customers around their risk and and how to mitigate that risk, or at least how to understand the risk as it pertains to spatial-temporal information,&#8221; Stricklan said. &#8220;And so right now &#8230; their most important asset is their data [and] in order to get that data, they have to have their satellites in orbit, and they have to have safety of flight and all those different things.&#8221;</p>
<p>The exploding number of satellites in orbit and the presence of nearly 500,000 pieces of space debris means that operationally these very expensive assets are at greater risk than they were. Slingshot tries to solve that problem by giving its customers orbital awareness of potential risks, and providing ways to process data to understand the terrestrial risks that companies face.</p>
<p>Everyone from insurance companies to logistics providers to financial investors use satellite data and imagery in their decision making process and an increasing driver for all of these businesses is a chance to model out impacts from climate change, according to Platzer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I think the demand for a global understanding off the planet, to use its resources in an effective and responsible way, is unabated&#8230; For Spire in particular, you know, the impact of climate change through weather on every single business in every single country, for every single person is certainly not going away. And so that demand is is absolutely increasing,&#8221; Platzer said. &#8220;So I honestly actually see mostly, almost exclusively opportunities, and not necessarily obstacles, funding in the industry is growing at 46%. year over year. Company creation is growing at 32% year over year. So I think I think it&#8217;s really a very, very dynamic period, which is more dominated by opportunities than obstacles I would say.&#8221;</p>
<p>Increasingly, startups will be able to meet these opportunities, especially if they can receive a boost from government entities that can highlight the areas that are emerging business opportunities and leave it to private industry to pursue them, Modrzewski said.</p>
<p>Still, the panelists agreed that there&#8217;s no better time to start a company focused on the space industry than now.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;If I could encourage those that have any sort of inspiration to start a company around space to do it, just do it. Execute on that, that vision, but understand all of the things that we talked about today are different than the risk of say, starting a marketing company. So be up to the challenge to understand the government as part of this and understand rules and regulations, and outside of the government that impact how we fly satellites, how we take care of satellites, how we provide data and understand that there&#8217;s a lot of legacy that comes with this industry,&#8221; Stricklan said. &#8220;I think the global space ecosystem is one that remains heavily siloed. It&#8217;s not like the digital transformations that have happened in Silicon Valley. Over the last 10 or 15 years. This industry still needs that digital transformation and so the the world is your oyster, but be prepared and be up for the challenge.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Citizen Lab researchers say they have found evidence that dozens of journalists had their iPhones silently compromised with spyware known to be used by nation states.</p>
<p>For more than the past year, London-based reporter Rania Dridi and at least 36 journalists, producers and executives working for the Al Jazeera news agency were targeted with a so-called &#8220;zero-click&#8221; attack that exploited a now-fixed vulnerability in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> iMessage. The attack invisibly compromised the devices without having to trick the victims into opening a malicious link.</p>
<p>Citizen Lab, the internet watchdog at the University of Toronto, was asked to investigate earlier this year after one of the victims, Al Jazeera investigative journalist Tamer Almisshal, suspected that his phone may have been hacked.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/the-great-ipwn-journalists-hacked-with-suspected-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit/">a technical report</a> out Sunday and shared with TechCrunch, the researchers say they believe the journalists&#8217; iPhones were infected with the Pegasus spyware, developed by Israel-based NSO Group.</p>
<p>The researchers analyzed Almisshal&#8217;s iPhone and found it had between July and August connected to servers known to be used by NSO for delivering the Pegasus spyware. The device revealed a burst of network activity that suggests that the spyware may have been delivered silently over iMessage.</p>
<p>Logs from the phone show that the spyware was likely able to secretly record the microphone and phone calls, take photos using the phone&#8217;s camera, access the victim&#8217;s passwords, and track the phone&#8217;s location.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2089606" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2089606" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2089606" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nso-abilities-1.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="653" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nso-abilities-1.jpg 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nso-abilities-1.jpg?resize=150,109 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nso-abilities-1.jpg?resize=300,218 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nso-abilities-1.jpg?resize=768,557 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nso-abilities-1.jpg?resize=680,493 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/nso-abilities-1.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2089606" class="wp-caption-text">Citizen Lab analyzed the network logs of two hacked iPhones and found it could record ambient calls, take photos using the camera, and track the device&#8217;s location without the victim knowing. (Image: Citizen Lab)</p></div></p>
<p>Citizen Lab said the bulk of the hacks were likely carried out by at least four NSO customers, including the governments of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, citing evidence it found in similar attacks involving Pegasus.</p>
<p>The researchers found evidence that two other NSO customers hacked into one and three Al Jazeera phones respectively, but that they could not attribute the attacks to a specific government.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Al Jazeera, which just broadcast its reporting of the hacks, did not immediately comment.</p>
<p>NSO sells governments and nation states access to its Pegasus spyware <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/gyznnq/how-nso-group-helps-countries-hack-targets">as a prepackaged service</a> by providing the infrastructure and the exploits needed to launch the spyware against the customer&#8217;s targets. But the spyware maker has repeatedly distanced itself from what its customers do and has said it does not who its customers target. Some of NSO&#8217;s known customers include authoritarian regimes. Saudi Arabia allegedly used the surveillance technology to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/world/middleeast/saudi-khashoggi-spyware-israel.html">spy on the communications of columnist Jamal Khashoggi</a> shortly before his murder, which U.S. intelligence concluded was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html">likely ordered</a> by the kingdom&#8217;s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</p>
<p>Citizen Lab said it also found evidence that Dridi, a journalist at Arabic television station Al Araby in London, had fallen victim to a zero-click attack. The researchers said Dridi was likely targeted by the UAE government.</p>
<p>In a phone call, Dridi told TechCrunch that her phone may have been targeted because of her close association to a person of interest to the UAE.</p>
<p>Dridi&#8217;s phone, an iPhone XS Max, was targeted for a longer period, likely between October 2019 and July 2020. The researchers found evidence that she was targeted on two separate occasions with a zero-day attack — the name of an exploit that has not been previously disclosed and that a patch is not yet available — because her phone was running the latest version of iOS both times.</p>
<p>&#8220;My life is not normal anymore. I don&#8217;t feel like I have a private life again,&#8221; said Dridi. &#8220;To be a journalist is not a crime,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Citizen Lab said its latest findings reveal an &#8220;accelerating trend of espionage&#8221; against journalists and news organizations, and that the growing use of zero-click exploits makes it increasingly difficult — though evidently not impossible — to detect because of the more sophisticated techniques used to infect victims&#8217; devices while covering their tracks.</p>
<p>When reached on Saturday, NSO said it was unable to comment on the allegations as it had not seen the report, but declined to say when asked if Saudi Arabia or the UAE were customers or describe what processes — if any — it puts in place to prevent customers from targeting journalists.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first we are hearing of these assertions. As we have repeatedly stated, we do not have access to any information related to the identities of individuals upon whom our system is alleged to have been used to conduct surveillance. However, when we receive credible evidence of misuse, combined with the basic identifiers of the alleged targets and timeframes, we take all necessary steps in accordance with our product misuse investigation procedure to review the allegations,&#8221; said a spokesperson.</p>
<p>“We are unable to comment on a report we have not yet seen. We do know that CitizenLab regularly publishes reports based on inaccurate assumptions and without a full command of the facts, and this report will likely follow that theme NSO provides products that enable governmental law enforcement agencies to tackle serious organized crime and counterterrorism only, but as stated in the past, we do not operate them. Nevertheless, we are committed to ensuring our policies are adhered to, and any evidence of a breach will be taken seriously and investigated.”</p>
<p>Citizen Lab said it stood by its findings.</p>

<p>Spokespeople for the Saudi and UAE governments in New York did not respond to an email requesting comment.</p>
<p>The attacks not only puts a renewed focus on the shadowy world of surveillance spyware, but also the companies having to defend against it. Apple rests much of its public image on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/apple-takes-aim-at-adtech-hysteria-over-ios-app-tracking-change/">advocating privacy</a> for its users and building secure devices, like iPhones, designed to be hardened against the bulk of attacks. But no technology is impervious to security bugs. In 2016, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spying-karma/">Reuters reported</a> that UAE-based cybersecurity firm DarkMatter bought a zero-click exploit to target iMessage, which they referred to as &#8220;Karma.&#8221; The exploit worked even if the user did not actively use the messaging app.</p>
<p>Apple told TechCrunch that it had not independently verified Citizen Lab&#8217;s findings but that the vulnerabilities used to target the reporters were fixed in iOS 14, released in September.</p>
<p>“At Apple, our teams work tirelessly to strengthen the security of our users’ data and devices. iOS 14 is a major leap forward in security and delivered new protections against these kinds of attacks. The attack described in the research was highly targeted by nation-states against specific individuals. We always urge customers to download the latest version of the software to protect themselves and their data,&#8221; said an Apple spokesperson.</p>
<p>NSO is currently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/whatsapp-spyware-nso-group/">embroiled in a legal battle with Facebook</a>, which last year blamed the Israeli spyware maker for using a similar, previously <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/13/whatsapp-exploit-let-attackers-install-government-grade-spyware-on-phones/">undisclosed zero-click exploit</a> in WhatsApp to infect some 1,400 devices with the Pegasus spyware.</p>
<p>Facebook discovered and patched the vulnerability, stopping the attack in its tracks, but said that more than 100 human rights defenders, journalists and &#8220;other members of civil society&#8221; had fallen victim.</p>
