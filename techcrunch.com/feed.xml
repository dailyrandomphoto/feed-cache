										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishal-punwani-md">Vishal Punwani</a>, the CEO and co-founder of SoWork, is building a business based off of a feeling that he stumbled upon by accident.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sowork.com/">SoWork,</a> a virtual coworking startup, began after Punwani and his co-founders decided to build a machine learning edtech company. While building, Punwani’s team, who ironically met while playing World of Warcraft just 17 years ago, needed a better way to communicate. So, combining their love for building and gaming, the group put together an internal communication product inspired by virtual worlds.</p>
<p>The team’s internal communication tooling began growing faster than their external edtech one. The startup eventually rebranded and pivoted to Sophya, a company based on the feeling that every employer will eventually feel the pressure to invest in a virtual work experience for employees to repair culture and combat climate change.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216738" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The feeling was enough to convince investors to back the early-stage startup. SoWork announced today that it has raised a $15 million seed round led by <a href="https://www.taliscapital.com/">Talis Capital</a>, a U.K.-based firm that routinely cuts early-stage checks. Beyond hiring and R&amp;D capital, SoWork has also added one big customer to its 100-company private beta: Tinder.</p>
<p>By bringing on a virtual space, Tinder is trying to show new and old distributed employees what its work culture is like, from collaboration rooms to company-wide virtual events such as hackathons. Still, while delayed office reopening plans may have triggered Tinder’s interest in a virtual space, the company appears to think the technology will be key going forward.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2216743" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOffice2.png" alt="" width="813" height="507" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOffice2.png 1296w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOffice2.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOffice2.png?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOffice2.png?resize=768,479 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOffice2.png?resize=680,424 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOffice2.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 813px) 100vw, 813px" /></p>
<p>“It’s been incredibly important to find more permanent ways to extend Tinder’s culture into a hybrid physical and virtual space as we think about the future of how our employees will be working,” said Nicole Senior, VP of Culture and DE&amp;I at Tinder, in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Permanence is the elephant in the room for any virtual HQ. SoWork is joining a string of virtual HQ platforms like <a href="https://www.teamflowhq.com/">Teamflow</a>, <a href="https://with.so/">With</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/sequoia-capital-puts-millions-of-dollars-into-gather-a-virtual-hq-platform/">Gather</a>. One of the biggest challenges for any virtual HQ business is if it&#8217;s realistic to expect employers, especially those in the growth stage, to transfer their growing teams to the metaverse, when in person offices do the trick. And as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/slacks-new-video-and-voice-tools-are-nod-to-changing-face-of-work/">Slack invests more to bring spontaneity and huddles </a>to its already well-ingrained service, startups need to prove that its customers, even the ones that didn&#8217;t grow up gaming, want to live and work in an online universe.</p>
<p>“If they&#8217;re not feeling the problem, that’s fine. But eventually, there&#8217;ll be so many companies that have built up a base in whether it&#8217;s SoWork or something else, that the benefits of being on those other platforms will start to build up. And then all of a sudden, there are benefits there that [employers] can&#8217;t get elsewhere,” Punwani said. “It’s like Twitter. In the beginning, [no company] was like ‘oh we must have Twitter.’ But as it became the place where all of the random noise happened, then they said, ‘we want to go there because we want to stay relevant.’”</p>

<p>Sophya has a number of functionalities that add to its experience, from proximity-based audio and high-quality video, self-expression of avatars, customizable offices, and visualization of who is around you. It is also building ways for employees to venture outside of their offices into the broader SoWork ecosystem to network with folks at other companies and to attend community events &#8211; all within the platform. Punwani estimates that teams spend between 25-40 hours per week working out of their virtual offices, for both asynchronous catch ups and synchronous meetings.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2216744" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOutside.png" alt="" width="889" height="467" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOutside.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOutside.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOutside.png?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOutside.png?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOutside.png?resize=680,357 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SoWorkOutside.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 889px) 100vw, 889px" /></p>
<p>Still, the startup’s biggest differentiation may be the team’s mindset on climate change. Unlike many virtual HQs on the market, SoWork is loud about its mission to combat climate change by giving employers a way to grow their companies virtually, instead of through offices. The startup plans to showcase estimates of how much carbon emissions and commute times have been saved for companies that live in SoWork rather than IRL. It also chose a bank for its Canadian entity that is 100% divested from fossil fuels, and is doing the same for its U.S. corporation, per the co-founder.</p>
<p>“Climate is the number one thing that we’re trying to deal with, it’s why our tagline is moving workplaces from the earth to the cloud,” Punwani said. “Imagine what that does to climate impact, right? [It limits] carbon footprint, commuting, small business travel, [and the] building [of] pointless fucking buildings and parking lots.”</p>
<p>The diversity of the team is also striking in comparison to its competitors. Punwani is joined by two co-founders, Emma Giles and Mark Liu, and 5 of SoWork’s 6 main teams in ops, marketing, growth, product and research, are led by women.</p>
<p>SoWork is opening up its private beta to the public in the first week of November. There are already over 1,000 people on the waitlist.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Paris-based cryptocurrency broker <a href="https://www.sheeldmarket.com">SheeldMarket</a> has raised a $10 million Series A funding round led by Atomico. As a EU-registered broker, the company wants to help institutional investors buy and sell crypto assets in a regulated way.</p>
<p>Most cryptocurrency products designed for institutional investors focus on American or Asian investors. SheeldMarket thinks it can convince institutional investors in Europe by complying with local regulation and offering a product that works better for European investors.</p>
<p>In addition to Atomico, Semantic also participated in today’s funding round. Several angel investors also participated, such as Pascal Gauthier (CEO of Ledger) and Alexis Bonillo (co-founder of Zenly).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216741" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If you want to start investing in cryptocurrencies as an institutional investor, you have to deal with several products and services, such as exchanges, custodians and over-the-counter providers. Customers using SheeldMarket can get started more easily.</p>
<p>When you start working with SheeldMarket, you can deposit your funds directly with SheeldMarket. After that, the startup lets you process market orders through multiple crypto exchanges and over-the-counter platforms. SheeldMarket automatically routes your order to the platform that offers the best exchange rate and/or enough liquidity. The average order size on the platform is $150,000.</p>
<p>“We appreciate SheeldMarket&#8217;s advanced platform because it allows us to execute very large trades across multiple global crypto exchanges, in a regulated way, using advanced algorithms. This has been a gamechanger for us when it comes to saving time, manpower and trading costs compared to trying to execute the same volume of trades manually,” Wave Financial’s Benjamin Tsai said in a statement.</p>
<p>In addition to improving its current product offering, SheeldMarket also wants to integrate with decentralized finance protocols (DeFi). This way, it could open up high-yield opportunities to financial investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And this is key to understanding the potential of these prime brokers. Institutional investors aren’t just looking for ways to expose part of their portfolio to crypto price changes. DeFi opens up a ton of possibilities with new, sophisticated financial products. And institutional investors always like to be able to access more markets and more products.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerging markets fintech financier Lendable is targeting to raise a $100 million fund to invest in African and Asian fintech companies, the firm said in an emailed statement today</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, the firm said it planned to raise funds to enable new loans of $120 million to $180 million to give fintechs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These companies would then provide credit, asset finance, payments and remittances to individual customers and businesses in emerging markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is unclear if this fund continues that discussion since there&#8217;s no reference in this recent statement. But what is clear is Lendable stating that this is its fourth fund.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216735" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubbed the MSME Fintech Credit Fund, Lendable says it will provide credit to African and Asian fintech companies so they can offer credit facilities and financial services for over 150,000 small businesses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the fintech lender has closed $49 million from these investors: DFC, EMIIF (DFAT), Calvert Impact Capital, Ceniarth, BIO, FMO, and FSD Africa. It expects to close another $20 million this fourth quarter before a final hard close in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first close takes Lendable&#8217;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overall</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> committed capital to more than $200 million. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From 2016 until August this year, Lendable claims to have managed a pipeline of over $400 million. It has also disbursed $180 million in that timeline</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-goldfarb-17211728"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel Goldfarb</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/dylan-fried-024b825b"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Dylan Friend,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lendable has provided over 1.4 million consumer and small business loans, over 80,000 productive asset loans, and more than 105,000 solar home systems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Lendable says it has delivered an annualized net return of 14.32% to its investors.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have had an amazing response to this Fund and have brought on board an impressive slate of leading impact investors and DFIs who back our approach,&#8221; Goldfarb said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Through our fintech investments, we are providing essential working capital for MSMEs that enables off-grid customers to buy energy products and opens the door to innovative digital banking services to consumers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of World Mental Health Day, an app called <a href="https://www.mentalhappy.com/">MentalHappy</a> is launching with the goal of making mental health care accessible, affordable and stigma-free.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been on both sides of the spectrum where I can afford the $175 an hour for therapy, and where I couldn&#8217;t afford it,&#8221; said founder and CEO Tamar Blue. &#8220;We all need help navigating the life events that we go through, but how do we do that with an expert, not pay a fortune for it, be accessible, and do that collectively with other people in a positive way?&#8221;</p>
<p>MentalHappy&#8217;s approach to solving this problem is to develop low-cost peer support groups on its app, with qualified professionals facilitating each group. These groups start at $10 per month, spanning topics like Black mental health, life after divorce and coping with anxiety. Some groups are more intimate, while others can have upwards of 100 members, functioning as a message board with the ability to join video meetings with the group leader. Blue told TechCrunch that she expects the app to have over 1000 support group leaders by the end of the year, facilitating discussions about over 47 different types of life events. So far, MentalHappy is working with psychologists, general practitioners (MD), acupuncturists, and certified life coaches. Currently, the app is operating in the United States, but Blue plans to explore other countries and languages in the future.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216003" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Security is top of mind for everyone,&#8221; Blue said. While some groups can be fully anonymous, others use screen names to identify participants. &#8220;A lot of the groups have privacy control mechanisms, so the user would have to submit some type of authentication to let the group leader know who they are and why they want to join, just to make sure it&#8217;s a great fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>MentalHappy also offers a revenue stream for qualified health and wellness professionals &#8212; the company takes 5% of their monthly earnings on the app. The professionals set their own price for access to their groups. But for larger groups, content moderation might pose a challenge. While MentalHappy has automated systems to identify trigger words or bullying, a group leader is expected to moderate their own group. Blue said sometimes leaders will bring in an assistant or an associate therapist to help them manage the group.</p>
<p>&#8220;MentalHappy is a marketplace,&#8221; Blue said. &#8220;Similar to Airbnb hosts or Patreon creators, support group leaders are marketplace participants operating independently.&#8221;</p>

<p>An app like MentalHappy needs both facilitators and group members to work, and scaling the app at a sustainable rate could pose a challenge &#8212; what if there are too many people seeking help, but not enough professionals to provide it? Right now, MentalHappy is focusing on onboarding group leaders, some of whom have existing client bases that they bring with them to the platform.</p>
<p>The cost of therapy often prohibits people from seeking mental health care, but Blue thinks that a remote, digital experience can also help people who might not physically be able to access specialized care in their area. Plus, the United States is experiencing a shortage in therapists &#8212; according to the American Psychological Association (APA), there are only <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2020/01/datapoint-states">31.3 licensed psychologists</a> per 100,000 people. Many therapists and psychologists have <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/how-to-get-help-when-theres-a-waitlist-to-see-a-therapist-5116341">long waitlists</a>, making it harder for new patients to start treatment. Though one-on-one treatment can be essential for some people, MentalHappy&#8217;s peer support groups can help make care more accessible and immediate in the interim.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we don&#8217;t realize is nearly 180 million people live in rural areas in the United States, where they just simply aren&#8217;t in driving distance to any type of mental health facility or office,&#8221; Blue told TechCrunch. &#8220;So, meeting other people online is a perfect way to get that help.&#8221;</p>
<p>MentalHappy also operates with a strong focus on diversity, working to develop support groups for people of various identities.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a Black woman in tech here in San Fransisco, so I definitely know what it feels like to not really be able to identify with professionals, or colleagues, or people who look like you,&#8221; Blue said. &#8220;That&#8217;s something we really focus on. We do have Black and Brown health professionals on the platform that lead groups, because we know that provider fit is definitely very critical.&#8221; In a recent launch event, for example, NFL Hall of Famer Terrell Owens was part of a support group specifically for Black men, seeking to shed light on the particular stigmas that Black men face in seeking mental health care.</p>
<p>But over the last five years, mental health care startups have been scrutinized for how they navigate the murky line between making money and providing quality support to users in need. The anonymous mental health app Talkspace struggled with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/toddessig/2016/08/18/talkspace-reveals-clients-email-violating-clinical-confidentiality/?sh=5e6cb71a4652">violating clinical confidentiality</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/19/14004442/talkspace-therapy-app-reviews-patient-safety-privacy-liability-online">preventing therapists</a> from reporting dangerous situations due to the patients&#8217; anonymity.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will facilitate case by case management of the identities of people in dangerous situations,&#8221; Blue said. &#8220;We carefully vet the support group leaders and review their background. We provide best practices to ensure they are safeguarded as well as members on the platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>So far, the second-time founder has raised <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/briefing-4-29-21/">$1.1 million in seed funding</a> from Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures (Blue&#8217;s first company <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/canustart2day">CanUStart</a>, which was acquired, helped efficiently match job seekers with employers). At first, MentalHappy was a wellness product for large corporations, working with clients like the UCSF Benioff Children&#8217;s Hospital and Boston Scientific. When an employee at these companies experienced a significant life event, MentalHappy provided <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/24/mentalhappy-helps-companies-send-custom-care-packages-to-employees-going-through-a-rough-time/">wellness kits</a> for support. But Blue wanted to expand MentalHappy&#8217;s reach by creating a consumer product for the general public to access mental health support. Blue was part of the summer 2018 Y Combinator class, where she redeveloped MentalHappy into the app it is today, available on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mentalhappy/id1574363583">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mentalhappy.app">Android</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buy now, pay later (BNPL) has been making headlines all over the place this year &#8212; from </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/square-to-buy-buy-now-pay-later-giant-afterpay-in-29b-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Square’s planned acquisition of Afterpay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/wall-street-hugs-affirm-as-it-starts-life-as-a-public-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Affirm going public</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, Latin America remains an under-penetrated market in the increasingly crowded space.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nelo.mx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a startup founded by former Uber international growth team leads, began offering buy now, pay later services to Mexico earlier this year. Its ultimate goal is to expand to all of Latin America. And it has just raised $20 million in an effort to help it advance on that goal. The Mexico City-based company already is live with over 100 merchants, including Steve Madden and Ben &amp; Frank. Using Nelo’s app, customers can make purchases from merchants such as Amazon, Mercado Libre, Telcel, Netflix and Spotify.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215725" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our goal is to enable digital commerce throughout LatAm, and BNPL in Mexico is our first step towards that vision,” said CEO and co-founder Kyle Miller.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York-based Two Sigma Ventures led the round, with existing backers such as Homebrew, Susa Ventures, Crossbeam and angel investor and popular podcast host <a href="https://twitter.com/APompliano" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anthony Pompliano</a> also participating. New investors include angels like Gokul Rajaram and Emilie Choi, founders and employees from Wealthsimple, Orum, Alloy, Chime, Square and funds/syndicates in addition to Primer Capital, Gaingels and Moving Capital. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the latest Series A financing, Nelo has raised a total of $25.6 million since its 2019 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be clear, Nelo is not the only player in the Mexican market. A number of others, including Alchemy and Addi, have also outlined plans for buy now, pay later offerings in the region. But what differentiates Nelo from its competitors, according to Miller, is that it claims to be the only BNPL company in the region that has a consumer mobile app in addition to an embedded checkout experience for merchants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our mobile app allows customers to buy now and pay later at over 75 merchants, and very soon, any</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">merchant,” Miller said, “ultimately becoming the destination for any consumer that wants to buy online. This captive consumer base is crucial to building the network that is Nelo.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelo issued its first product in Mexico in January 2020, similar to a debit card offering from a neobank. In the middle of the year, the company launched credit installment loans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then in March of 2021, Nelo launched its first product via an Android app. Customers can use its offering like a credit card, connecting directly with merchants such as Netflix and Spotify. Many users started out by paying for things like utility bills and cell phone bills, turning them from prepaid to postpay.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why global investors are flocking to back Latin American startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/why-global-investors-are-flocking-to-back-latin-american-startups/embed/#?secret=8JVvOzCnob" data-secret="8JVvOzCnob" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the startup has apps on both Android and iOS and its revenue and GMV is growing by 50% month over month, according to Miller. It is currently seeing over 100,000 new purchases/transactions per month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nelo is planning to use its new capital to grow its consumer and merchant base, and to continue to build out its team. The company has hubs in Mexico City, New York City and remote employees. It currently has 23 employees, up from 12 in January. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, Nelo is focused 100% on Mexico, where Miller notes, e-commerce is “exploding&#8221; and is home to &#8220;the fastest growing market in the world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This has greatly impacted our business,” he told TechCrunch. “Right now is the perfect time for this business and product.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two Sigma Ventures Partner Frances Schwiep believes that Nelo has the potential to emerge as the leading financing option for consumers in LatAm, starting with BNPL.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In her view, the case for BNPL in LatAm, and particularly Mexico, is even stronger than for BNPL in the many regions where it has already exploded in popularity such as the United States, Europe and Australia. She points out that in Mexico, there is an “extreme” lack of access to credit with less than 15% of the population in Mexico having a credit card. Also, there is existing behavior around paying in installments in Mexico that has been around for several decades, called “meses sin interes,” but via “difficult-to-access” cash vouchers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, e-commerce spend in Mexico is increasing much faster than access to credit, Schwiep noted, in addition to open fintech regulation in the country making it all easier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The relatively young population in Mexico is also more aligned with the target demographic for BNPL businesses,” she said. “On top of this, the accelerating adoption of banking and mobile e-commerce in LatAm has created an environment for a breakout company in the space today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a personal level, having lived in Mexico over the past year (and previously having lived in LatAm in 2011), Schwiep told me that it has been “wild” to witness the market for digital commerce essentially transforming overnight. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe Nelo has built the team, product, data moat and go to market playbook that is best positioned to capitalize on this incredible market opportunity,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that Nelo started by offering installment payments for everyday essentials, such as utility and phone bills, before evolving into retail, gives the startup some advantages, Schwiep added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“First, Nelo owns a direct and deep, recurring relationship with the consumer,” she said. “Nelo is the only BNPL company in the region building the trust and brand loyalty with the consumer in this way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plus, the multiple touch points per month with consumers translates into a “tremendously valuable longitudinal data asset for Nelo,” according to Schwiep. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They are amassing valuable repayment history on their platform that incumbents like Affirm and Afterpay and even local credit bureaus do not have on consumers in the region,” she said.</span></p>

<p>In addition to its work with music artists and labels, Spotify has been working to embrace the podcast creator community with its acquisition of podcast-related companies over the years, including various studios and creation tools, like Anchor. It has also been working to help creators better monetize their efforts with the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-spotify-audience-network-an-audio-ad-marketplace/">new advertising products</a>, paid <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/spotifys-podcasts-subscriptions-service-is-now-open-to-all-u-s-creators/">subscriptions</a>, engagement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/spotify-rolls-out-podcast-polls-and-qas-to-creators-and-users-worldwide/">tools</a>, and <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-27/spotify-ushers-in-new-era-of-podcast-monetization-with-new-tools-for-all-creators/">integrations</a> that would allow creators to connect their existing subscriber base to Spotify&#8217;s platform. It also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">launched</a> a social audio app, Spotify Greenroom, where it will host live content.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Mic Check&#8221; will expand on Spotify&#8217;s creator commitments by offering a selection of conversations with both musicians and podcasters alike. The show will include exclusive recordings and personal stories from this group of global creators, all of which will remain exclusive to Spotify.</p>
<p>The company is also bringing back its flagship show, &#8220;For the Record&#8221; for a third season on October 26. This show will continue to offer Spotify&#8217;s commentary on product and financial news, like its earnings reports, product launches and other business updates.</p>
<p>However, this season, the company will make &#8220;For the Record&#8221; even more of an area for breaking news, saying that it will be the only place where it will share certain business updates.</p>
<p>“From the start, Spotify has always had a unique story to tell and an ambition to tell it our own way,&#8221; said Spotify’s Head of Global Communications, Dustee Jenkins, in a statement. &#8220;The &#8216;Spotify: For the Record&#8217; podcast was launched last year and served as an important step in building our broader audio communications channels. Now we are excited to share that we’re expanding and launching two additional shows that will allow us to speak to each of Spotify’s audiences more directly – about the topics they care most about,&#8221; she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the years, applications have gotten bigger and bigger. Even a small company could be dealing with large libraries of open source code, making it time-consuming to pull the various pieces of a project together, package them up and compile them into a single program. This often creates a bottleneck for developers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.engflow.com/">EngFlow</a>, an early stage startup coming out of the <a href="https://www.alchemistaccelerator.com/">Alchemist Accelerator</a> this month, wants to help fix that by distributing the compiling part over as many machines as needed in the cloud, pushing out compiled projects faster. In fact, they claim to take a process that used to take hours and distill it down to minutes or even seconds, depending on the size of the build.</p>
<p>Today the company announced a $3.7 million seed investment led by Andreessen Horowitz with participation from First Minute Capital, Alchemist Accelerator and various angels.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216676" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company founders, CEO Helen Altshuler and CTO Ulf Adams met several years ago while both were working at Google where they were experiencing the build bottleneck directly. They found that as software became increasingly complex, it was taking longer and longer to compile &#8212; and this was in spite of computers becoming ever faster.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re doing is we&#8217;re basically breaking up the build process into smaller steps, and then we&#8217;re distributing those steps across multiple machines so instead of running it on your laptop, we can run it in a data center [in the cloud]. So if it&#8217;s not moving quickly enough for you, you can just add a couple more machines and make it faster,&#8221; Adams explained.</p>
<p>While he was at Google building the company&#8217;s developer infrastructure, Adams also built some software called <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> to deal with the compiling bottleneck that the company would later contribute to open source. Altshuler managed Bazel adoption at Google, so the two of them have been working closely for some time before launching EngFlow at the beginning of 2020.</p>
<p>As EngFlow develops, Altshuler says that they want to help developers who don&#8217;t necessarily want to download Bazel and figure out how to distribute the workloads themselves. But even though they see Bazel as a key build system, they don&#8217;t want to confine themselves to that.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We provide the SaaS services, a distributed compute and build acceleration service. Some of our customers even refer to our product as a build accelerator. It works with Bazel, but we are not exclusive to Bazel, which is interesting, [given that we are] the team that built Bazel,&#8221; she said. They also work currently with Android and Chromium and are looking to support other build systems in the future.</p>
<p>In terms of diversity, Altshuler says that she doesn&#8217;t necessarily define her identity as being a woman in tech. &#8220;It&#8217;s an interesting thing because I didn&#8217;t know I was a woman in technology until 10 years into my career when I was invited to speak on a women in technology panel. I thought we were all people here,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>That said, she says that so far her company has grown diverse organically, first by virtue of the diverse background of the two founders, and she believes that it just builds on itself. &#8220;It just sort of happened because of the fact that our network is wide. It also means, yes, more naturally people, not just women, but more women will reach out to me, then perhaps other other managers, [which has allowed us to] be more balanced without being deliberate,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Their startup idea is gaining traction with several paying customers already including Snap, Brave and Mighty Technologies. By taking the approach that they are going to be more than the commercial version of Bazel, they believe they can be a much larger company. The startup expects to remain remote as it grows. As a matter of fact, the two founders have not met in person since launching last year.</p>

The automaker has <a href="https://investor.gm.com/news-releases/news-release-details/general-motors-lg-electronics-reach-agreement-bolt-ev-recall" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">reached a deal</a> that will have LG pay nearly all the costs associated with recalling the Chevy Bolt EV and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevys-2022-bolt-ev-redesign-comes-with-an-entirely-new-model-210004893.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">EUV</a>, with GM estimating that LG will &#8220;offset&#8221; $1.9 billion of the $2 billion in expenses. GM will recognize that financial recovery in its third-quarter earnings.</p>
<p>The brand said it was happy to land an agreement with a &#8220;valued and respected supplier.&#8221; With that said, there&#8217;s little doubt GM is using the deal to redirect blame — it stressed that the recall was prompted by &#8220;manufacturing defects&#8221; in LG batteries. LG spotted anode and cathode-anode separator issues that, combined, could increase the chance of battery fires.</p>
<p>LG has since addressed the battery issues and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-restarts-production-of-bolt-ev-batteries-following-model-wide-recall-194412215.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">restarted production</a>. The immediate costs of the recall may be secondary, however. Both companies have taken a hit to their relatively fragile reputations in the electric vehicle space — it doesn&#8217;t look good for GM in particular when its two main EVs have to be taken off the road, if only briefly.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nearly a year after <a href="https://ridedott.com">Dott</a> originally announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/dott-to-expand-beyond-e-scooters-with-bike-sharing-service/">plans</a> to launch a bike-sharing service, the new offering is going live in Paris. Dott is better known for its scooter-sharing service across dozens of European cities. It is adding electric bikes to complement its service.</p>
<p>In addition to Dott, Lime and Tier also have scooters currently available in Paris. These three companies have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/lime-dott-and-tier-win-paris-scooter-permits-delivering-bird-a-loss-in-a-key-market/">won permits</a> to operate scooter-sharing services with 5,000 scooters each. In addition to Paris, Dott operates in major European cities in Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Poland, Spain and the U.K.</p>
<p>Dott originally planned to launch bike-sharing with its own custom-designed bike in March 2021. That plan is taking longer than expected but the company still expects to manufacture its own bikes in Europe. In the meantime, Dott is partnering with its existing scooter manufacturer <a href="https://okai.co">Okai</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216686" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Bikes are already live in the app in Paris. You can see scooters and bikes nearby, or you can filter the map view to focus on bikes or scooters specifically. Dott expects to provide 3,000 e-bikes in Paris by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Renting a Dott e-bike costs as much as renting a scooter. Prices differ depending on the city. In Paris, for example, it costs €1 to unlock a bike (or a scooter) and €0.23 per minute. There are also multiple passes that let you get unlimited rides for a certain time or waive unlock fees. These passes work with both scooters and e-bikes.</p>
<p>In Paris, Dott’s bike-sharing service competes with Lime, which acquired Jump’s e-bikes as part of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/uber-leads-170-million-lime-investment-offloads-jump-to-lime/">complicated investment deal</a> with Uber. It costs €1 to unlock a Lime e-bike and €0.20 per minute. <a href="https://getapony.com/fr">Pony</a> also offers free-floating bikes for a third of Lime’s rate.</p>
<p>And yet, Dott’s biggest competitor will be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%A9lib%27">Vélib’</a>, the dock-based bike-sharing service subsidized by the city of Paris. There are <a href="https://www.paris.fr/pages/velib-franchit-la-barre-des-400-000-abonnes-9062">hundreds of thousands</a> of Vélib’ subscribers in Paris. Even with a free V-Libre account, users pay €3 for an e-bike ride of 45 minutes or less. As a comparison, riding a Dott e-bike for 20 minutes costs €5.60.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But price is just one thing as I already saw someone happily riding a Dott bike. For instance, some users will install Dott to unlock scooters and end up using bikes in addition to scooters. The startup also plans to launch its bike-sharing service in Rome, Milan, Brussels and London. These bikes feature a swappable battery and the fleet will be operated by the same in-house logistics teams.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Between <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-messenger-instagram-whatsapp-are-all-down/">Facebook outages</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/twitch-streamers-respond-after-huge-leak-of-creator-payout-data/">Twitch data breaches</a>, last week was bumpy for social platforms and the creators who build businesses on them. As internet creators look to diversify their income streams and retain ownership over their audiences, membership software maker Memberful is launching a newsletter feature today to add to its subscription membership services.</p>
<p>While competitor Substack takes 10% of creator revenue, Memberful charges 4.9%, plus a monthly rate of either $25 or $100, depending on the pricing plan. For those with a large enough audience, retaining that extra 5.1% of revenue can make a difference, even with the added monthly fee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our focus for the last eight years of building a product has been to be great at membership, and then provide you the ability to plug-in to a Mailchimp, or a Discord, or a WordPress,&#8221; Memberful founder and CEO Drew Strojny told TechCrunch. &#8220;But we noticed, having done this for so long, that communication &#8212; and specifically communication with email &#8212; is so fundamental to the digital membership model that we felt like this is something we have to do. When you&#8217;re building a membership, it&#8217;s almost guaranteed that you&#8217;re going to want to email your members.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216078" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Strojny said that even without its own newsletter feature, Memberful has been attracting former Substack users. Since Memberful offers white-label membership plans, creators can use the service to have more agency over how their branding and their newsletter appear. Like Substack, Memberful allows users to retain ownership over their email lists.</p>
<p>Patreon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/08/patronage-empire/">bought Memberful</a> in 2018, but instead of absorbing the independent brand, Memberful now functions as a subsidiary of Patreon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of it as more of a decentralized Patreon,&#8221; Strojny said. &#8220;When consumers use Memberful, they probably don&#8217;t even know they&#8217;re using Memberful, they just think, &#8216;Oh, I&#8217;m on this site and I&#8217;m signing up for a membership.'&#8221;</p>
<p>When creators offer subscriptions on Patreon, it&#8217;s housed under the company&#8217;s domain &#8212; but Memberful lets creators embed subscription tools on their own websites. (See, for example, the YouTube series <a href="https://www.mythicalsociety.com/#become-a-member">Good Mythical Morning&#8217;s website</a> or podcast network <a href="https://www.relay.fm/membership">Relay FM&#8217;s membership page</a>, which use Memberful). While Patreon charges a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/pricing">percentage</a> of creator earnings (between 5% and 12%, depending on the plan), Memberful charges <a href="https://memberful.com/pricing/">a set rate plus a transaction fee</a> (10% for the $0 starter plan, or $4.9% for the $25 pro plan and $100 premium plan). The premium plan is a white-label offering, removing the Memberful branding altogether.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At launch, the newsletter feature will function like a members-only blog and email list. Users need to log in to view content on the web, but in the future, Strojny says that creators will be able to make public posts that are available to anyone online, subscriber or not. Memberful customers will be able to schedule emails and send messages to targeted subscriber groups, like members on different monthly tiers. This feature will appear on Memberful customers&#8217; dashboard alongside conversion analytics, branding, checkout and content hosting tools.</p>
<p>As a subsidiary of Patreon, Memberful&#8217;s content moderation policies take after its parent. Patreon <a href="https://www.patreon.com/policy/guidelines">bans</a> bullying, harassment, and hate speech, while Substack <a href="https://substack.com/content">also prohibits</a> writers who &#8220;publish content or fund initiatives that call for violence, exclusion, or segregation.&#8221; But Substack has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/11/business/media/substack-newsletter-competition.html">criticized</a> for its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/substack-explains-its-hands-off-approach-to-content-moderation/">lax enforcement</a> of its content moderation policies, which it has referred to as &#8220;<a href="https://on.substack.com/p/substacks-view-of-content-moderation">hands-off</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t feel like we have to reinvent the wheel when it comes to content moderation because, being a Patreon company, we have the resources in place to handle that,&#8221; Strojny said. &#8220;It makes us feel really good about having a lot of that already established.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://alviere.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alviere</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an embedded finance startup that aims to help any brand deliver financial products and services to its customers and employees, announced today it has closed $70 million of new funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, New York-based Alviere closed a $20 million Series A led by Viola Ventures and Viola Fintech, with the participation of CommerzVentures, Mitsubishi Capital Corporation, Wix.com Capital, Draper Triangle Ventures, Cross River Bank Capital, CERCA Partners and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, just six months later, the startup is announcing an additional $50 million in Series B investment. Unnamed institutional fintech investors led the latest financing, which included participation from existing backers Viola Ventures, Viola Fintech and CommerzVentures, as well as Cleveland-based North Coast Ventures. Opera Tech Ventures, the VC arm of BNP Paribas, also put money in the round. Alviere has now raised a total of $71 million since its 2017 inception.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216333" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embedded finance is a hot topic these days and it feels like we’re seeing a growing number of rounds in the space. Just last week, TechCrunch reported that Productfy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a banking-as-a-service (BaaS) company that aims to build “DeFi for traditional finance,” </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/08/productfy-raises-16m-to-build-the-shopify-of-embedded-finance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $16 million in a Series A round of funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by CM Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuval Brisker, CEO and co-founder of Alviere, started the company with Pedro Silva a few years after having </span><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/oracle-buys-toa-technologies-pull-170015173.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sold his previous company, TOA Technologies, to Oracle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a deal rumored to have valued it at over $500 million. (TOA was a Cleveland, Ohio, cloud-based enterprise software company.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is loathe, though, to slap the BaaS label on his newest startup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re doing embedded finance, which is as big or bigger than BaaS,” Brisker told TechCrunch.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever you want to call it, the market for embedded finance is massive and expected to grow worldwide to become a $7.2 trillion market by 2030, according to a forecast from</span><a href="https://www.simon-torrance.com/blog/EmbeddedFinance1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Simon Torrance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Last year, the banking-as-a-service market alone was valued at $356 billion, according to</span><a href="https://www.verifiedmarketresearch.com/product/banking-as-a-service-baas-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Verified Market Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The foundations of Alviere were born out of an attempt to build a payment app to exchange money without exchanging personal information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We quickly learned that was not an easy undertaking,” he recalls. “But we built for ourselves, we realized we could white label and sell to others.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But instead of building a consumer app, the team decided to package the solution &#8212; dubbed The HIVE &#8212; to businesses or brands to be able to launch any financial service on their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how is this different from BaaS?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I look at BaaS offerings, it is usually selling technology to tech mavens who can use it to actually either accelerate the ability to build financial products or embed those products in their software or technology,” Brisker said. “That’s not what we’re doing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, he added, Alviere is going more mainstream and after brands that don’t currently offer any financial technology and don’t know how to do it but might have an existing loyal customer base. By using Alviere, those customers would be able to go to customers, he said, and say, “Hey, we now offer a bank account.” And rather than a partnering bank owning the customers, the actual brand would own the customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brisker doesn’t see Alviere’s offering as a threat to banks. His argument is that by removing the “pain” of having to deal with customers, banks can actually improve profitability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you take away a lot of the customer service components you&#8217;re going to have a much more efficient operation, and they&#8217;ll still be able to have the deposits and the lender loans,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alviere plans to use its new capital in part to expand beyond North America (it is licensed in &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">almost&#8221; all 50 U.S. states) to Europe and Latin America. The goal is to provide financial services to a new cohort of users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortune 500 companies are Alviere’s target, and so far, it has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">closed deals with two unnamed brands that each have more than 10 million household subscribers or customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The startup’s business model relies on its customers&#8217; success, according to Brisker. Basically, it shares the revenue it makes with its customers, which will make money each time on interchange fees each time a branded credit card is swiped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re deeply embedded in their business on multiple levels,” Brisker said. “Embedded finance technology is taking the decentralization of financial services to the next level. Now any brand with an existing customer base &#8212; be it a telco, a retailer, a shoe company, an automobile company, a marketplace &#8212; will be able to deliver financial products and services to its customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims that by using its software, brands can start lucrative lines of businesses that can allow them to deliver “everything personal finance” to their customers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial services that Alviere’s HIVE enables brands to embed in their business include direct deposit FDIC Insured checking and savings accounts; credit, debit, prepaid and gift cards; payment services; domestic and international money transfers; loyalty programs and cash pick up and deposits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omry Ben David, general partner at Viola Ventures, said his firm had been proactively looking to make a play in the embedded finance space for “quite some time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As legacy fintech investors for the past 20 years, we believe consumer financial services are undergoing a tectonic shift and that the next consumer banking revolution will be for established brands to offer bespoke, well-crafted financial services to their existing, and new, loyal audiences,” he wrote via e-mail. “Be it a checking/savings account, branded credit card, loyalty or gift cards, BNPL loans, digital payments services, remittance, etc. – all ‘programmed’ and inter-connected to suit a specific consumer segment, geography and/or need. No more &#8216;one size fits all.&#8217; ”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Carving out 45 minutes or an hour for a workout can be difficult between work, home and daily life. Digital fitness and wellness company <a href="https://fitonapp.com/">FitOn</a> was created to provide 15- or 20-minute workouts aimed at getting people moving in whatever time they can make.</p>
<p>The company closed on an $18 million Series B round of funding, led by Delta-v Capital, with participation from existing investors Accel, Telstra Ventures, Crosscut Ventures, Maverick Ventures and Second Avenue Partners.</p>
<p>The funding comes as the Los Angeles-based company hits 10 million members for its app that offers personalized fitness and wellness programs and a unique social experience from trainers likes Orangetheory Fitness, KINRGY and Zumba, and even some celebrity ambassadors like Gabrielle Union, Julianne Hough, Halle Berry, Jonathan Van Ness and The Chainsmokers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216126" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Founded by the husband-and-wife team of former Fitbit executive Lindsay Cook and AllTrails founder Russell Cook, the app launched two years ago with a mission of what CEO Lindsay Cook called a “democratization of digital fitness.”</p>
<p>“I was super immersed in the category and working at a fitness company, but found that I did not have a lot of time for fitness myself,” she said. “I was underwhelmed by some of the apps, which were not premium products and had so many barriers to entry, like expensive bikes or hardware equipment. I saw a change to democratize fitness when I saw that no one was going after the mass market.”</p>
<p>She teamed up with her husband, who had spent 20 years in digital products, to put together a health and fitness app that would do what AllTrails did for outdoors and what Calm did for meditation, Cook added.</p>

<p>FitOn is a freemium product, and members have access to hundreds of workouts in cardio, strength, yoga, stretch and meditation. It also has a pro subscription model that includes music tracks on top of the workouts, connection to health monitoring devices, offline downloads, meal plans and recipes. It also has a social platform built in with a chat feature, and members can invite friends to participate in programs and challenges.</p>
<p>The latest round of funding gives FitOn a total of $30 million raised to date, which includes a seed round in 2018 and Series A in 2020.</p>
<p>“FitOn is delivering millions of workouts a month to its members by prioritizing product innovation, community and premium content to build one of the largest health and fitness communities,” said David Schaller, managing partner at Delta-v Capital. &#8220;We are thrilled for FitOn to join our portfolio of innovators in digital fitness and wellness, which includes other category-leaders such as Tonal.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since the Series A, the company’s growth has accelerated and is up 500% year over year on revenue from the subscription model. Now that it has passed 10 million members, Cook expects to reach 25 million by the end of next year. In addition, FitOn members passed over 1 billion workout minutes, and most work out three or four times a week.</p>
<p>The app is seeing over 285% more downloads than Peloton, 588% more than Beachbody and is consistently in the top 20 of the health and fitness category and has garnered more than 300,000 five-star reviews, according to Cook.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to grow its team, build out key positions and continue on its fast pace of releasing new products. In the past two years, the company released more than 78 products. FitOn has focused mostly on the United States, but it is planning to grow internationally as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a business still two years in the making, we are satisfied with revenue and have lots of opportunity to build large-scale business,&#8221; Lindsay Cook said. “In this anti-diet culture, it is not about the ‘perfect body,’ but promoting self-care. We are building a lifestyle brand encouraging people to do a 10-minute workout here and there.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.getresq.com/">ResQ</a>, which does end-to-end equipment repairs for over 4,000 restaurant groups &#8212; from Taco Bell to Tim Hortons &#8212; has raised a $39 million Series A co-led by Tiger Global and Canvas Ventures. The capital, which includes investments from Homebrew, Inovia Capital and Golden Ventures, comes just months after the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/resq-seed-75/">announced its $7.5 million seed round. </a></p>
<p>Driving down customer costs is a big business anywhere, but especially within the world of restaurants &#8212; which already have razor-thin margins and built-in volatility. With this in mind, ResQ’s growth and subsequent capital makes sense. The startup, built by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kuljeev-singh-1299a657?originalSubdomain=ca">Kuljeev Singh</a>, offers “revenue recovery” services to its customers by optimizing its back-of-house operations.</p>
<p>ResQ&#8217;s core service connects contractors to restaurants, and then provides them with one spot to organize communication, pay bills and establish accountability. Toast’s lucrative IPO has brought a renewed spotlight to the opportunity for cloud-based software services within the restaurant industry. The Boston-based company was valued at $4.9 billion in early 2020, and currently hovers at a valuation of $25.81 billion, according to several finance websites.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216419" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Indications of a hot market abound as Freshworks, Toast price IPOs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/indications-of-a-hot-market-abound-as-freshworks-toast-price-ipos/embed/#?secret=InmhIdGK6i" data-secret="InmhIdGK6i" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Singh views Toast as a potential partner, not a competitor, because the public company works on front-of-house operations and point-of-sales processes.</p>
<p>“This is not just a piece of technology you build and you sell to restaurants,” Singh said. “We have to build a marketplace in the background, build products and services for local and national contractors…there’s so much depth.” ResQ is having conversations with restaurant tech companies that need back-of-house solutions, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/02/the-full-stack-approach-but-this-time-sans-status-quo/">everyone tries to become an end to end solution.</a></p>
<p>Abid Lallani, president of The Lallani Group and a customer, said that ResQ has helped them “no longer need to look for vendors, shop around for multiple quotes and spend time going back and forth with vendors.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>By saving worker time and offering clearer visualization into how repairs will work, restaurants on the ResQ platform have seen up to a 20% decrease in annual operation costs, according to the company. New customers include Fogo de Chão, Marugame Udon and Akamai Brands.</p>
<p>Like any two-sided marketplace, ResQ exposes itself to challenges of supply and demand. In its world, it needs to curate the delicate balance between a growing, diverse group of skilled workers and a subset of locations where it can reasonably offer its on-demand servicing. The startup grew its contractor base by 400% in the last four months, and expanded its operations from seven to 36 states in the same time period.</p>
<p>Labor shortages are a challenge that ResQ will have to constantly navigate &#8212; and one that its <a href="https://www.eater.com/22675736/restaurant-labor-shortage-2021-materials-food-sourcing-delivery">customers are currently facing every single day.</a> As the startup has scaled, a lot of its focus has been about understanding how to bring value to the evolving nature of the restaurant industry, from full-service businesses to a small independent company. Helping employees on staff better spend their time seems to be the common thread.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re essentially giving that time back to those team members, when you already have labor shortages, to focus on growth projects, to focus on opening up new restaurants, or to focus on guest experience,” Singh said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following Tile&#8217;s recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/tile-secures-another-40-million-to-take-on-apple-airtag-with-new-products/">close on $40 million</a> in debt financing, the company today is introducing its latest lineup of lost-item trackers, including the long-promised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/tile-to-launch-to-launch-a-new-tracker-powered-by-ultra-wideband-technology/">ultra wideband powered tracker</a> aimed to compete with Apple AirTag, Tile Ultra. This product, though being officially announced, is not yet available for purchase. Instead, the company&#8217;s first updates include the premium Tile device, the Tile Pro, which features a new design meant to better address its core use cases of being attached to bags, keys, backpacks, and luggage. All of Tile&#8217;s other existing trackers &#8212; the Mate, Sticker and Slim &#8212; have also been upgraded with new features like louder rings, longer finding ranges, and increased water resistance, among other things.</p>
<p>Tile has been working on the Tile Ultra for some time, as the company&#8217;s plans for its new technology <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/tile-to-launch-to-launch-a-new-tracker-powered-by-ultra-wideband-technology/">were detailed</a> in January. The device will have the same form factor as Tile Pro, but a more premium design treatment and will ship with a stainless steel ring. More importantly, the device will be powered by ultra-wideband technology, which is the same thing Apple AirTag uses for more precise finding capabilities.</p>
<p>When available, Tile Ultra will combine both Bluetooth and ultra-wideband finding capabilities with the ability to seek out objects as far away as 400 feet, then display their location in an updated mobile app interface. Here, you&#8217;ll look at a camera view of your room or other location, with large, AR arrows pointing you to the location of your missing Tile.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216632" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2216664" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216664" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2216664" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/UWB_AR.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/UWB_AR.jpg 7500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/UWB_AR.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/UWB_AR.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/UWB_AR.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/UWB_AR.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/UWB_AR.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/UWB_AR.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/UWB_AR.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216664" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tile</p></div></p>
<p>Tile, a staunch Apple critic in recent months, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tile-bashes-apples-new-airtag-as-unfair-competition/">has been vocal about</a> how Apple has entered its market and immediately put it at a disadvantage from a competitive standpoint. Though <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/235016/will-2021-be-the-year-apples-u1-chip-goes-wide.html">newer model iPhones</a> shipped with ultra-wideband capabilities powered by the U1 chip, the ability to tap into that functionality has not been available to third-party developers until the launch of iOS 15. That gave Apple a head start with AirTag. For comparison, Tile says it has been working closely with its partner Google to ensure that its new ultra-wideband device will work well with Android 12, which brings ultra-wideband to Android for the first time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple held off making ultra wideband available to pilot until they launched their first product and had that product in the market for a while,&#8221; noted Tile CEO CJ Prober, of the delay to launch Tile Ultra. For this reason, the upcoming Tile Ultra won&#8217;t ship until early 2022.</p>
<p>In the near term, the rest of Tile&#8217;s lineup is getting a significant refresh.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The popular Tile Pro looks very different with its new, more slender form factor, which Tile landed on after around 16 different design choices it tested internally.</p>
<p>&#8220;This form factor really resonated with folks because of the way it hangs on your keys &#8212; it&#8217;s like a key fob, and it just fits really well,&#8221; notes Prober.</p>
<p>The device only has slight enhancements on the performance side, as the aesthetics change was the big update here. It will continue to feature a 400 ft finding range and a one-year replaceable battery.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216643" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216643" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2216643" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Black-Pro-Sticker-Combo.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Black-Pro-Sticker-Combo.jpg 7952w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Black-Pro-Sticker-Combo.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Black-Pro-Sticker-Combo.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Black-Pro-Sticker-Combo.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Black-Pro-Sticker-Combo.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Black-Pro-Sticker-Combo.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Black-Pro-Sticker-Combo.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Black-Pro-Sticker-Combo.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216643" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tile</p></div></p>
<p>The rest of Tile&#8217;s lineup was updated, too. The Tile Mate has an updated, sleeker design that also fits well on purses and keys, and will now come in both black and white. It features a 250 ft range (an increase of 25% over prior versions) improved water resistance (to IP67, or 30 mins. at one meter deep), a louder ring, and a 3-year non-replaceable battery.</p>
<p>Tile Sticker, which works well on things like your TV remote or other items where you can&#8217;t easily attach a tracker, is getting a 67% improvement in range to up to 250 ft. It will also get the same update in terms of a louder ring, improved water resistance, and a 3-year non-replaceable battery.</p>
<p>And finally, the Tile Slim, designed for tucking inside wallets, has received the same updated set of performance improvements, too in terms of range, battery, and ring.</p>
<p>Pro and Slim will retail for $34.99. Mate is $24.99 and Sticker is $29.99.</p>

<p>Along with the product updates, Tile is updating its mobile app with a new way to find lost items, called Lost and Found. This service allows anyone who finds a lost Tile item to scan a QR code on the device to see the owner&#8217;s contact information, so they can coordinate its return.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216662" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216662" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2216662" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tile-Lost-and-Found-User-Experience.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tile-Lost-and-Found-User-Experience.jpg 7500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tile-Lost-and-Found-User-Experience.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tile-Lost-and-Found-User-Experience.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tile-Lost-and-Found-User-Experience.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tile-Lost-and-Found-User-Experience.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tile-Lost-and-Found-User-Experience.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tile-Lost-and-Found-User-Experience.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tile-Lost-and-Found-User-Experience.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216662" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tile</p></div></p>
<p>Inspired by AirTag&#8217;s security features, which periodically warns if an unknown AirTag is following you around, Tile will also identify if an unknown device is nearby. This feature, however, works differently from Apple&#8217;s AirTag. Instead, users will be able to download the Tile app, then push a button to enable a manual scan of unwanted Tiles nearby. They will not need a Tile account to do so. This functionality is not yet live, but was designed based on recommendations from the National Network to End Domestic Violence, Tile says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost 70% of stalking victims know their offender,&#8221; says Prober. &#8220;And their guidance was that you really need to put this kind of safety feature in the hands of the user, as opposed to having people waiting for some type of notification that might go away.&#8221;</p>
<p>This feature, called Scan and Secure, will go live on iOS and Android early next year.</p>
<p>Though Tile has moved into services and has been expanding through partnerships with companies who want to include lost item finding into their own products, the majority of Tile&#8217;s revenue still comes from the direct sale of its devices. To date, Tile has sold 40 million trackers and has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/tile-secures-another-40-million-to-take-on-apple-airtag-with-new-products/">over</a> 425,000 paying subscribers &#8212; a smaller portion of the many more users who don&#8217;t subscribe to a premium service. During the first half the year, Tile&#8217;s revenues increased by over 50%, but the company declines to share its hard numbers.</p>
<p>The new Tile lineup, except for Tile Ultra, is available today on Tile.com and retailers like Amazon, Costco, Best Buy, Target, and others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A number of startups have emerged aimed at cleaning up low Earth orbit, which is currently crowded with millions of pieces of space junk – including anything from broken satellites, to rocket fragments, to debris from vehicle stages or space missions. While the task of cleaning up LEO is an important one, there’s one problem, according to Alex Fielding, co-founder of a new space venture alongside Steve Wozniak: we don’t know where most of the space junk is actually located.</p>
<p>“Orbital cleanup companies, they don&#8217;t have resolution, or we don&#8217;t agree on where almost any object in low Earth orbit is with greater accuracy than maybe three or 400 kilometers on any given moment,” Fielding said in a recent interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Fielding and Wozniak are aiming to close that knowledge gap with their new company, Privateer. The company, which has been in stealth, got some attention in September after Wozniak tweeted a link to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a7A1w1C2TE&amp;feature=emb_title&amp;ab_channel=Privateer">one-minute promo vodeo on Youtube</a>, and rumors intensified that Privateer would be focused on cleaning up space objects.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216646" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="78ZnTVmuqZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/removing-space-debris-requires-action-and-caution/">Removing space debris requires action and caution</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Removing space debris requires action and caution&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/removing-space-debris-requires-action-and-caution/embed/#?secret=78ZnTVmuqZ" data-secret="78ZnTVmuqZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Turns out, that’s not quite accurate. “Privateer actually got started, not with the goal of cleaning up space on day one,” Fielding explained. “We really got started with the goal of building […] the Google Maps of space.”</p>
<p>This is not the first collaboration for Fielding and Apple co-founder Wozniak. The two created Wheels of Zeus in the early 2000s, a hardware company that developed tech to track the location of physical objects.</p>
<p>“When we started that, half of the stuff in space twenty years ago was trash,” Fielding said. The situation has only gotten more dire since. “You&#8217;re in a world with many, many, many more things [in orbit], of which those many more things are far more dangerous, they&#8217;re almost all in low orbits, they&#8217;re moving very, very fast, and they&#8217;re not well tracked or understood for the most part.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The dangers of space junk remain all too present. In May, astronauts aboard the International Space Station discovered a five-millimeter-wide hole in a robotic arm attached to one of the modules. While that arm remains functioning, the ISS did not perform a maneuver to avoid being hit, which suggests that the object was one of the millions in orbit that are too small to be tracked by the U.S. Space Force’s Space Surveillance Network.</p>
<p>In the same way that launch companies like Rocket Lab and SpaceX are now providing services that used to be the exclusive purview of public agencies like NASA, Privateer could fill in these massive data gaps.</p>
<p>Privateer is hitting the ground running. The company will be sending up its first satellite, dubbed “Pono 1,” on February 11, 2022. The spacecraft, which will be roughly 3U in size (just about half-a-foot), will be equipped with 42 sensors, 30 of which are non-optical and twelve of which are optical cameras. The non-optical sensors will be capable of a precision of as much as 4 microns. The actual body of the satellite will be made of carbon fiber and 3D printed, using an approach that means it’s a single, solid piece with the same rigidity of titanium, Fielding said. Instead of propellant, it will be directionally oriented using magnetic torquers, a small device that generates electric current for attitude control.</p>
<p>Pono 1 will only stay up for four months, when it will be deorbited and vaporized back in the Earth’s atmosphere. The second satellite, Pono 2, is going up at the end of April. Privateer has already chosen a launch provider and received the requisite approvals for both launches.</p>
<p>In addition to the launches, Fielding said Privateer is already working with Astroscale, an orbital logistics and servicing startup that’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/astroscale-successfully-demos-in-space-capture-and-release-system-to-clear-orbital-debris/">currently demo-ing</a> a space junk removal satellite. Privateer also signed a partnership with the Space Force.</p>
<p>To not pursue a complete Google Maps of space might not just be negligent – it could be fatal, according to Fielding. “I&#8217;m an optimist and I still am very, very, very afraid that we&#8217;re too late, that we&#8217;re probably within 24 months of the first on-orbit human space casualty. And the reason for that is just the proliferation in low Earth orbit.”</p>

	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The humble USB-C port has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/europe-proposes-usb-c-as-a-common-charger-for-electronic-devices-131605815.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">been in the news</a> because Europe wants to make it a standard for all mobile devices to reduce e-waste — and Apple is the only manufacturer still not using the standard for its smartphones. Now, a robotics engineering student has proved that its possible to replace the iPhone&#8217;s Lightning connector with a USB-C port, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/10/11/iphone-gets-usb-c-thanks-to-creative-robotics-engineer" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><em>Apple Insider</em></a> has reported.</p>
<p>On his YouTube channel, EFPL master&#8217;s student Ken Pillonel teased an iPhone X with a USB-C port, promising a full video later on how it was done. In an earlier <a href="https://kenp.io/iphone_usbc_mod_part_1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">blog post and video</a>, he explained how he reverse-engineered the Lightning connector, then built a <a href="https://kenp.io/iphone_usbc_mod_part_1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">prototype</a> PCB connector to prove the concept.</p>
<p>Pillonel discovered that Apple sells a Lightning connector to certified partners that build USB-C to Lightning cables. He managed to get one out of a third-party cable, then remove the metallic part and expose the PCB. With that done, he pulled the female Lightning port from an iPhone and soldered wires from the bare C94 board to a PCB with USB-C connectors. &#8220;Once that was done I had my first working prototype,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Lightning is gone and only USB-C is left.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216649" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The next step was to &#8220;fully reverse engineer the C94&#8221; board so that everything can be shrunk down to fit into a phone, he said. That part has apparently been done, judging by the video above, and will be fully explained in a second video.</p>
<p>An iPhone with a USB-C port is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-10-iphone-11-pro-usb-c-fastcharge.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">dream</a> for many users, as it would allow for faster PD charging and the use of standard, non-proprietary cables. It&#8217;s also clearly feasible for Apple, given that the iPad Pro has a USB-C port. Europe has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/europe-proposes-usb-c-as-a-common-charger-for-electronic-devices-131605815.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">proposed a rule</a> that would require USB-C charging for all phones and electronic devices, with the aim of reducing e-waste and consumer inconvenience.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear if this has been done before, but most folks shouldn&#8217;t try a project like this at home. Pillonel has an electronics background and is <a href="https://kenp.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">working on</a> a Master&#8217;s degree in Robotics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL). That&#8217;s without mentioning that it would obviously void your iPhone&#8217;s warranty.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When the Trump administration <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/trump-ban-tiktok/">announced</a> it would ban TikTok in the U.S., a number of alternative short-form video apps began to flourish, as users hedged their bets on a potential TikTok exit. Among these was Byte, an app co-created by Vine co-founder Dom Hofmann, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/03/byte-tops-a-million-downloads-amid-spam-issues-and-content-concerns/">topped 1.3 million downloads</a> in its first week alone. But when Trump&#8217;s ban on TikTok failed, Byte <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/style/clash-byte-app-acquisition.html">sold to</a> rival <a href="https://www.clashapp.co/">Clash</a> &#8212; an admission of sorts that TikTok&#8217;s momentum couldn&#8217;t be beaten. Now, new owner Clash is kicking off round two. It&#8217;s relaunching its app with the &#8220;best of Byte&#8221; under the hood alongside a suite of creator tools for monetizing a fan base.</p>
<p>This time, the focus isn’t on beating TikTok, but working in parallel alongside it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.clashapp.co/">Clash</a> was founded by Brendon McNerney, a former Vine star who at one point grew his own social following on the now-shuttered app to over 700,000 followers. As someone who worked directly in the creator space, McNerney believes he could offer a unique perspective on creator monetization &#8212; something even leading apps can still struggle with today.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216198" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The newly rebuilt Clash’s premise is that it can help creators identify, engage and monetize their strongest and most loyal fans.</p>
<p>To do so, Clash is introducing a set of tools for creators and their fans, including a virtual tipping mechanism called Drops (not to be confused with product drops, popular in e-commerce) and a custom messaging system called Fanmail, for starters.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216326" style="width: 325px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216326" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2216326" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_4_.jpg?w=315" alt="" width="315" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_4_.jpg 920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_4_.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_4_.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_4_.jpg?resize=768,1660 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_4_.jpg?resize=315,680 315w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_4_.jpg?resize=711,1536 711w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_4_.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216326" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clash</p></div></p>
<p>The idea is that creators could grow their overall fanbase by using larger platforms like Instagram, TikTok or YouTube, where they can monetize the crowd through various methods, like advertising revenue share, brand sponsorships and other more direct methods, when available, like tips and subscriptions. Meanwhile, Clash could serve as the backchannel for the fans who are more invested in the creator&#8217;s journey &#8212; like those who are willing to help fund a creator&#8217;s work, similar to Patreon, or those who want a closer relationship with their favorite creators than they would otherwise be able to achieve elsewhere.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>McNerney says large platforms, like TikTok, can limit creators&#8217; monetization potential.</p>
<p>&#8220;TikTok is a virality machine. It just creates new creators every day &#8212; an issue because there&#8217;s only so many ad dollars&#8230;there&#8217;s only so many dollars in the Creator Fund,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>The founder took inspiration from what was working well in other industries, like Twitch with live content, OnlyFans for adult content and Patreon for more project-based work, like podcasts.</p>

<p>&#8220;The thing that really stuck out was, in 2019, I started seeing creators post their Venmo links in their bio. It was kind of a head-scratch moment,&#8221; McNerney says. He began to think about how those link-in-bio systems could be turned into more of a product. &#8220;And so we really started from the question&#8230;if Patreon was built now, what would it look like? And then: how can we do what we know well &#8212; which is short-form video?&#8221; he continues. &#8220;We really wanted to build a short-form video platform, where the video was just the medium, but the whole point of the platform was to support your favorite creators and connect with your fans.&#8221;</p>
<p>The initial beta version of Clash launched last summer on the App Store. Soon, the team found creators wanted to use it as a more authentic place to engage with fans outside of larger platforms. Creators wanted to create content specifically designed for the top 10-15% of their fan base &#8212; people who were already supporting them in other ways, like buying their merchandise, for example.</p>
<p>This led to the launch of Clash&#8217;s first product, Fanmail, where fans could pay to unlock the ability to send personalized messages to top creators, who acknowledge them and respond directly.</p>
<p>It also introduced Drops, a digital good purchased from the App Store that fans can use as a token of appreciation or for access to send Fanmail.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216322" style="width: 325px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216322" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2216322" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_2_.jpg?w=315" alt="" width="315" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_2_.jpg 920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_2_.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_2_.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_2_.jpg?resize=768,1660 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_2_.jpg?resize=315,680 315w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_2_.jpg?resize=711,1536 711w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_2_.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216322" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clash</p></div></p>
<p>Creators can redeem Drops at 2,500 (or $25), <a href="https://clashappco.medium.com/?p=f4a1f62b6e2c">Clash says</a>. This is a lower threshold than some creator platforms, like Twitch, where you need to <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/affiliate-payout-faq?language=en_US">have earned $100</a> to cash out. Clash says it will also seed its network by gifting hundreds of Drops to new users, free of charge. And, for the time being, Clash will not take a cut of these sales &#8212; meaning creators keep 100% of the revenue from the Drops they receive. (The company hasn&#8217;t yet decided what percentage it will take when the promotional period ends sometime next year.)</p>
<p>McNerney envisions how Clash can be used in the early stages of content creation and planning, which makes it more symbiotic with larger platforms, like TikTok, instead of a direct competitor. For example, one of Clash&#8217;s launch creators, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ladyyasmina1?">Yasmine Sahid</a>, who makes comedic videos on TikTok, is using Clash to fund her other passion: making music. She&#8217;s been building her first music video with the support of fans on Clash, who are funding it through their Drops. And as the video is produced, these fans get access to the behind-the-scenes content and other sneak peeks.</p>
<p>Plus, he argues, innovations in creator monetization may need to take place outside of larger platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest issue, I think, is while [these large platforms] are experimenting with these tools, they&#8217;re not leaning into them. At the end of the day, their revenue is 98, 99% from advertising revenue,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The model that they see themselves leaning into is just strictly focusing on keeping eyeballs glued to the screen. Whereas, they&#8217;re improving their algorithms &#8212; they want people viewing &#8212; we actually want people engaging,&#8221; McNerney adds.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216324" style="width: 325px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216324" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2216324" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_3_.jpg?w=315" alt="" width="315" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_3_.jpg 920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_3_.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_3_.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_3_.jpg?resize=768,1660 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_3_.jpg?resize=315,680 315w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_3_.jpg?resize=711,1536 711w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_3_.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216324" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clash</p></div></p>
<p>At launch, Clash&#8217;s app has been rebuilt to handle future scale and to support monetization tools. Meanwhile, Clash is including what the team loved about Byte, including the way Byte&#8217;s Camera worked, the in-app feed and the app&#8217;s Discovery page. There are other similarities between Byte&#8217;s design and the new app, as well.</p>
<p>And while Clash will gain access to Byte&#8217;s existing registered user base of 5 million when it relaunches in Byte&#8217;s place on the app stores, it plans to support a variety of creators &#8212; not just the young Gen Z&#8217;ers who <a href="https://community.byte.co/t/wow-the-hate-towards-millenials-is-real/55146?page=3">used to try to</a> &#8220;<a href="https://community.byte.co/t/stop-bullying-millennials/56166">bully the millennials</a>&#8221; off the original Byte app.</p>
<p>In the near-term, Clash plans to add something called a &#8220;fan score&#8221; based on their engagement in the app, including entering chats and commenting on videos. It plans to release this feature soon after the public debut.</p>
<p>Of course, even as a platform for the most loyal fans, Clash will have its competition from startups and big tech alike. Twitter has built Super Follow to cater to creators while Instagram has been spotted working on its own fan subscription product in recent days.</p>
<p>Co-founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pj-leimgruber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/pj-leimgruber/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633623542719000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGBxqFq37wCK2ezV-ySdrr15btWiQ">P.J. Leimgruber</a>, who previously founded influencer agency NeoReach, LA-based Clash is now a team of 17 full-time. Many early employees have backgrounds in social and creator platforms, including Facebook, TikTok, Vine, Snap, Twitter, Google, Pinterest and Cameo. Vine&#8217;s/Twitter&#8217;s head of Creator Development, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karynisaunicorn/">Karyn Spencer</a>, is also Clash&#8217;s creator advisor. Byte and Vine co-founder Dom Hoffman remains an advisor.</p>
<p>Ahead of its relaunch, Clash raised $9.1 million in funding over three rounds. The latest was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005283/en/Clash-Acquires-Byte-App-Secures-Investment-from-Alexis-Ohanian%E2%80%99s-Seven-Seven-Six">a seed round</a> led by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian’s new fund Seven Seven Six. Other investors in Clash include M13 Ventures, Plug and Play, ACME Capital, and angels Jesse Leimgruber (NeoReach co-founder) and NBA Players, Austin Rivers and Seth Curry.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.clashapp.co/">Clash</a> is relaunching today under Byte&#8217;s listing on the App Store and will soon launch on Google Play.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.plume.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plume</a> &#8212; a communications startup that partners with carriers to provide smart mesh WiFi to improve broadband connectivity in homes, and then offers other smart home services on top of that network &#8212; has been in the middle of a massive boom in its business fueled by the rapid uptake, use, and complete reliance on broadband in the home working as best as it can.</p>
<p>Now it has closed a huge funding round to ride the wave. The Palo Alto-based startup has raised another $300 million led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 at a valuation of $2.6 billion. Plume&#8217;s CEO and founder Fahri Diner said the startup will be using the money to continue building out its software platform, inking and servicing more deals with carriers, and generally expanding its horizons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two years ago, the killer app was WiFi, managing the pods,&#8221; he said, referring to the system of mesh routers that are used to improve the speed and quality of a WiFi network in homes. &#8220;That is no longer it, although it&#8217;s still a big piece of it. Access control and device security are growing fast, and people are also engaging with our motion sensors since indoor cameras are going away because of privacy reasons. IOT, health, energy management, and home security are all areas we have been testing for two years and they work, so we will be leaning into a lot of stuff.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216594" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Other investors in this latest round were not disclosed but previous backers include a strong mix of strategic and financial investors: Charter Communications, Comcast Cable, Foxconn, Insight Partners, Jackson Square Ventures, Liberty Global Ventures, Presidio Ventures, Qualcomm, Samsung, Service Electric Cablevision, Shaw Ventures, Silicon Valley Bank, and UpBeat Venture Partners among them. Insight was the sole backer in its last round, investing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/plume-picks-up-270m-at-a-1-35b-valuation-to-power-smart-home-wifi-for-broadband-providers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$270 million at a $1.35 billion valuation</a> in the startup. The fact that this latest SoftBank-led round is coming just eight months later is a mark of how rapidly Plume&#8217;s business has been growing.</p>
<p>Indeed, Covid-19 and the impact it had on how we use our broadband at home has probably been the biggest driver of Plume&#8217;s business in the last year.</p>
<p>As more people have been compelled to stay home to work, study, and pass the time, the more strain we&#8217;ve been putting on those home networks. In some cases, like mine, that strain also quickly led to major cracks: I am myself a Plume user; after trying a number of other things it was the only solution that could get the broadband to work well and reliably in our London Victorian house.</p>
<p>I guess we weren&#8217;t the only ones. Plume said that business ballooned in the last two quarters, adding 13 million new households to total 35 million (&#8220;more than our biggest customer, Comcast,&#8221; Diner pointed out to me); and it added 350 million more devices to its platform bringing the total to 1.2 billion devices; plus 60 more broadband carrier customers to now total 240 million globally (these include cable companies, telcos, and wireless carriers that also offer broadband).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s also now partnering with those carriers to branch out beyond their own broadband. In an OTT-style play, in the UK, Plume and Virgin Media are selling HomePass, which includes the Plume pod and software to manage it and run other services, across all of the UK (25 million households), regardless of whether Virgin is providing the broadband underpinning the service or not.</p>
<p>All of this is banked around services for consumers and the connected home. These are two areas where the startup will definitely continue to expand its reach, as outlined by the range of managed services Diner said the company has been working on for some time, along with others tapping into the connected home and specifically electronic objects that already have some degree of interfacing with the internet (think here: Plume letting you know when your connected Nespresso machines is about to need cleaning). These are due to start to get rolled out later this year when Plume releases an update of its app.</p>
<p>But further along, the company&#8217;s next steps will likely be outside the home, Diner said. One big area where you could see it doing more, for example, is in the area of industrial environments, where there are vast networks of often remote devices that are costly to connect to networks in a reliable way, which also need monitoring &#8212; two areas where Plume could figure in the future.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We might segment the market into residential, business, and industrial IoT,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have a phenomenal foothold in residential, which we are now moving into small business. Industrial is also in our scope. We have ambitious plans and this financing gives us more capability.&#8221; What is not in scope, he added, is enterprise campuses, where often there is already extensive internet wiring and bespoke WiFi solutions that fit into a company&#8217;s particular networking and security configurations. </span></p>
<p>“The pandemic has dramatically accelerated the adoption of digital services, increasing our dependence on smart devices,” said Nagraj Kashyap, Managing Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, who joined the <span class="il">Plume</span> Board of Directors, in a statement. “Through its innovative cloud data platform, we believe <span class="il">Plume</span>’s consumer-first approach provides customers with reliable connectivity in their homes and beyond. We are pleased to partner with Fahri and the team to support their ambition of reinventing services for smart spaces globally.”</p>
