										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">More of the world’s economy is moving online, and that is underscored by the long list of recent fundings and acquisitions in the digital ID authentication and anti-money laundering (AML) space, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/okta-acquires-cloud-identity-startup-auth0-for-6-5b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Okta’s $6.5 billion acquisition of Auth0</a>. Today, another startup announced it has raised capital: end-to-end due diligence platform <a href="https://www.firstaml.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First AML</a>.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Blackbird Ventures (which is also one of First AML’s users) and Headline led a $21 million (about $29.2 million NZD) Series B in the New Zealand-based company, with participation from returning investors Bedrock Capital, Icehouse Ventures and Pushpay founder Eliot Crowther. This brings First AML’s total raised to about $30.1 million USD (about $42 million USD).</p>
<p>Founded in 2017, First AML entered Australia this year and will use part of its Series B to expand into international markets, starting with the United Kingdom. It is also looking at Singapore and the United States. The company also plans to double its employee count from 90 to 180.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226857" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="afyF8bH6yu"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/okta-acquires-cloud-identity-startup-auth0-for-6-5b/">Okta acquires cloud identity startup Auth0 for $6.5B</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Okta acquires cloud identity startup Auth0 for $6.5B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/okta-acquires-cloud-identity-startup-auth0-for-6-5b/embed/#?secret=afyF8bH6yu" data-secret="afyF8bH6yu" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>One of the main ways First AML is different from other digital ID authentication startups (like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/jumio-raises-150m-as-its-all-in-one-id-authentication-platform-crosses-300m-verified-identities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jumio</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/15/onfido-the-ai-based-id-verification-platform-raises-100m-led-by-tpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Onfido</a> or <a href="http://ty-and-access-management-business-grows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ForgeRock</a>, to name a few) is that instead of individual end users, it focuses on complex entities and transactions, which may mean performing due diligence on multiple organizations and people at a time. Unlike many other authentication and KYC (know your customer) startups, its main clients aren’t banks. Its clients include other types of financial service providers, accountants, law firms and real estate agencies.</p>
<p>“We haven’t focused on working with banks because there are a lot of medium-sized enterprises in the economy that also need to comply with AML rules,” co-founder and chief executive officer Milan Cooper told TechCrunch. “Many people focus on banks because those are the big guys, but the smaller law firms and investment firms, they need to comply as well. What we’ve found is that they don’t have the resources to invest in internal teams to set up a really sophisticated compliance process.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jumio raises $150M as its all-in-one ID authentication platform crosses 300M verified identities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/jumio-raises-150m-as-its-all-in-one-id-authentication-platform-crosses-300m-verified-identities/embed/#?secret=PgapNJ3zbp" data-secret="PgapNJ3zbp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>First AML’s founding team, which also includes Bion Behdin and Chris Caigou, wanted to launch the startup because two of them (Cooper and Caigou) were former corporate bankers and “saw the pain of AML onboarding firsthand context and how it would slow down transactions,” Cooper said.</p>
<p>For example, compliance teams needed to contact multiple stakeholders for documentation, and often had to follow up because the wrong paperwork was sent. “The KYC process is so cumbersome and it was not a good customer experience trying to onboard, so we saw an opportunity to streamline it and remove friction.”</p>
<p>The company’s proprietary platform seeks to automate as much of the compliance process as possible, such as ID verification (including biometric identification for remote verifications) and visual tools that help clients understand company ownership structures.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2226860" style="width: 1032px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226860" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2226860" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/First-AML-product-image.png" alt="An example of First AML's user interface" width="1022" height="863" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/First-AML-product-image.png 1022w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/First-AML-product-image.png?resize=150,127 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/First-AML-product-image.png?resize=300,253 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/First-AML-product-image.png?resize=768,649 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/First-AML-product-image.png?resize=680,574 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/First-AML-product-image.png?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1022px) 100vw, 1022px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2226860" class="wp-caption-text">An example of First AML&#8217;s user interface</p></div></p>
<p>“We take on the full KYC process end to end, and importantly, we do it for complex customer entities like companies and trusts. This is where many of our competitors don’t offer a full end-to-end solution,” said Cooper. “They might offer a solution for identity verification of a single person, whereas we are taking that whole process off their hands, which includes digging through the layers of a complex entity to understand who the beneficial owners are and coordinating the data collection process from multiple beneficial owners.”</p>
<p>For example, law firms that need to comply with AML regulations use First AML to conduct KYC on potential clients, which may include companies with multiple shareholders, directors and subsidiaries, that all need to be checked. Meanwhile, investment firms turn to the platform to onboard new investors, including trust structures and other types of complex entities.</p>
<p>Many of First AML’s clients previously relied on manual email and paper-based processes that often required people to send notarized copies of documents like passports or utility bills. First AML’s platform starts by analyzing an entity’s structure. Then it pulls data from public sources and obtains information from non-public sources.</p>
<p>“Essentially we figure out what’s going on in these complex entity structures, which are very prevalent in financial and other sectors, and then the platform facilitates data collection from multiple stakeholders within that complex entity, including biometric ID verification, and uploaded documents,” Cooper explained.</p>
<p>First AML is also building database, which currently has more than 350,000 verified entities. If an entity onboards through its platform and is involved in other compliance procedures, First AML can get their consent to retrieve their previous verifications. This means they don’t need to go through the full AML process every time they do a transaction. “It’s a key differentiator for us and a key competitive advantage that will really speed up the way KYC happens in the future,” Cooper said.</p>
<p>Cooper said the recent publication of <a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/pandora-papers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Pandora Papers</a>, an investigative report that revealed the hidden offshore accounts of 35 former and current world leaders, has increased concerns about AML compliance.</p>
<p>“Our take is that there is still a lot of shady transactions going on in the global economy and the Pandora Papers have revealed that there is a lot of money going around and tax evasion occurring. For us, this is a signal to governments that AML laws are needed in many countries,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Australia is still behind some of the rest of the world in terms of introducing AML rules into new sectors like legal accounting and real estate. The U.S. is another example where it’s the financial sector that’s captured, but non-financial sectors are not. It puts more pressure on lawmakers to clamp down on these illegal activities.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement about the investment, Blackbird Ventures partner Samantha Wong said, “We heavily rely on First AML. This is what is special about this deal—how intimately connected we are to the customer pain point, our love for the product roadmap and the network effects that emerge as their business model goes global.”</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lip-Bu Tan and Young Sohn created this fund to invest in early-stage deep tech companies, specifically big data, AI, semiconductor, cloud, and digital biology, Managing Partner of Walden Catalyst Sohn told TechCrunch.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The San Francisco-based venture capital firm announced today the closing of a $550 million fund, which was oversubscribed. The VC firm did not disclose the names of its limited partners.&nbsp;</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225583" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sohn and Tan, who have proven track records across the semiconductors, cloud, and electronics industries, are early investors in many tech companies, including Zoom, Inphi, Berkeley Lights, Habana, and Nuvia.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Walden Catalyst is a new fund founded in early 2021, but it has a strong legacy from Walden International and Samsung Catalyst Fund,” said Sohn, who previously held the position of corporate president and chief strategy officer at Samsung Electronics. Tan is also the founder and chairman of Walden International.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Walden Catalyst focuses on the U.S., Europe, and Israel as it sees consistent breakthroughs from the three regions in the areas of its interest, deep tech, Young said. Also, its partners have deep networks in those countries, having invested in the deep tech industries over the last few decades, helping Walden find breakthrough ideas attracting top entrepreneurs, Young added.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To date, Walden Catalyst has invested in six deep-tech startups, three in the US, two in Israel, and one in the EU, Young continued.

The company&#8217;s initial ticket size ranges from a few million to $25 million in one round, Young noted.&nbsp;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Data paints a picture. It tells a story that informs and enlightens,” Sohn said. “The amount of data in the world keeps doubling every two years, but only about 2% of all data is analyzed, so there is much more we can do to gather meaningful insights. We are excited and honored to work with the next generation of deep-tech entrepreneurs across the U.S., Europe and Israel, who are seizing on the data explosion and will ultimately change the world.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The team of four additional partners – Shankar Chandran, Roni Hefetz, Francis Ho, and Andrew Kau – has decades of experience on investments and exits in the deep-tech space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[To date, the company has over 9,000 paying customers, has tripled revenue in the past 12 months and maintained profitability for more than 18 months.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.apollo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apollo.io</a>, which is developing sales intelligence and engagement software for business-to-business companies, brought in $32 million in Series B funding to continue with its go-to-market acceleration approach.</p>
<p>Tribe Capital led the round and was joined by NewView Capital and existing investor Nexus Venture Partners. The latest funding gives the San Francisco-based company $40 million in total funding since it was founded in 2015, co-founder and CEO Tim Zheng told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Zheng previously founded a company in the education space doing something similar that helped customers send more targeted marketing emails. When friends saw how well it worked, they wanted a tool like that for their respective industries, he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226582" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>He says the subscription-based service has amassed over 2 million business contacts to help customers more accurately identify prospective customers using advanced algorithms and more than 200 unique business attributes. The tool displays this information automatically when visiting LinkedIn profiles and will also alert you with new contact information if someone changes jobs or is promoted.</p>
<p>“Usually the way to generate sales is to find the pipeline of customers, and to do that outbound, you have to figure out the right people, and we streamline and automate that process,” he added. “Instead of setting up Apollo in months, it takes minutes and a couple of clicks.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sales reps that were averaging 10 to 12 meetings can look to book three times that amount using Apollo, Zheng said. To date, the company has over 1 million user signups and 9,000 paying customers. It has grown its user base by more than 200% and tripled revenue in the past 12 months and maintained profitability for more than 18 months.</p>
<p>He believes there is still a big part of the market that is untapped, and the new funding will enable the company to accelerate marketing, engineering and product development. The company also intends to double its employees to 300 in the next 12 months.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Sri Pangulur, partner at Tribe Capital, joined Apollo.io’s board. Pangulur was tracking the company over the last year and the firm decided to lead the round after seeing its adoption and using the product itself.</p>
<p>“As we emerge from the pandemic, buyers want an Amazon-like experience where companies are anticipating their needs. You need user data to better drive the sales experience, and as it evolves more personalized capabilities as well,” he added. “Apollo has some unique positioning in that they are doing product-led growth, but also covering the data stack as well.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Users can choose to create from scratch or import designs, then use the library and layouts features to create fully functional pages.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The traditional way to design for the mobile environment involves a lot of back-and-forth as developers design in one program, prototype in another and collaborate in yet a third tool.</p>
<p>A new startup, <a href="http://www.createwithplay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Play,</a> is touting itself as “the only native iOS product design tool that makes it possible to <a href="https://createwithplay.medium.com/4eab0d770738" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create, iterate and collaborate directly from your phone</a>.” Legacy software requests workarounds and hacks to do something similar, explained company co-founder and co-CEO Dan LaCivita.</p>
<p>“This is the only design tool that uses the phone as a primary input device,” he told TechCrunch. “It allows you to design, prototype and collaborate from the phone and is the only one that gives product designers a way to experience designs as they are creating them on the medium they are using. You can essentially play in Apple’s sandbox without having to code.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226617" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Users can choose to create from scratch or import designs from tools, like Figma, and use the Play Library for common user interface components like buttons, cards and video players or Page Layouts for something quick and customizable to create fully functional pages. There’s also native iOS features like live maps, augmented reality and camera functionality.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="h97u3rmHgj"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/figma-continues-expansion-beyond-design-with-updates-to-figjam-white-board-tool/">Figma continues expansion beyond design with updates to FigJam whiteboard tool</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Figma continues expansion beyond design with updates to FigJam whiteboard tool&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/figma-continues-expansion-beyond-design-with-updates-to-figjam-white-board-tool/embed/#?secret=h97u3rmHgj" data-secret="h97u3rmHgj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>LaCivita started the company in 2019 with Eric Eng, Joon Park and Michael Ferdman, who all worked together in a previous startup called Firstborn where they built websites and mobile products.</p>
<p>“We experienced all of the pain points firsthand,” LaCivita said. “Joon said there had to be a better way. We are continuing to build on traditional graphic design software, so we don’t need another tool, but another approach, like the phone, as an input device.”</p>
<p>Play is in the App Store, but is in private beta with a waitlist of over 25,000 people. They will be let in over the next few months and into next year. It is a freemium model right now, but next year will also have some pricing tiers.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced $9.1 million in funding led by First Round Capital and including Oceans Ventures. The round is a combination of seed rounds from earlier this year and last year.</p>
<p>The funding will go toward scaling the team and continuing to develop new products, like Play for iPad, which was announced two weeks ago, that was a direct ask from customers, LaCivita said. It also recently unveiled its Teams feature to allow people to collaborate with one another.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When the founders first met with Todd Jackson from First Round Capital they were not looking to raise, but the “relationship clicked,” LaCivita said, and they found a partner that they felt would collaborate more as a teammate than as a venture capitalist.</p>
<p>Jackson said he found Play on Twitter and became intrigued. In his previous roles at Dropbox and Facebook, he had worked with designers having the same usability issues.</p>
<p>He sent Play to some of his friends who spent hours building a design and adding animations that were only available on the desktop.</p>
<p>“It never occurred to me that you could do this much on a phone,” he said. “There is a mental model where people think there is just one design tool that does one thing. We often talk about how many ideas for mobile products don’t see the light of day because you can’t share it with someone else. Play unlocks that for everyone.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://mosaic.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mosaic Building Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Phoenix, Arizona-based construction tech startup, has raised $44 million in a Series B funding round led by Peak State Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New investors Starwood Capital, invisionAZ, Tekfen Ventures, Volt Capital, Brightstone and Naval Ravikant also put money in the round. They joined previous backers Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Building Ventures, Innovation Endeavors, 8VC, Founders Fund and the Milstein family, bringing Mosaic’s total funding to $68.75 million since its 2015 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, Mosaic’s software and team serve as a tech-enabled general contractor for production-scale residential development projects. In other words, the company manages construction infrastructure in what it says is an effort to free up real estate developers to focus on things like land acquisition, sales and marketing and architecture. The end goal? To make residential construction more scalable.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226734" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup says it is able to do that because its technology actually automates the construction planning process. Its software is designed to shorten build times, cut costs, reduce materials waste and improve construction quality for homebuilders. At its core, Mosaic’s technology digitizes standard construction plans and identifies the best way for homes to be built onsite, using the same materials, workers and procedures as traditional home builders do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Says Salman Ahmad, co-founder and CEO of Mosaic: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been trying to vertically integrate our construction operations with our technology stack&#8230;instead of us trying to take the approach of just building software that addresses a single point solution, we&#8217;re basically trying to do what AWS did for tech startups where home builders and residential developers are able to offload their construction operations to Mosaic and focus their time and energy on their business operations.” </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2226737" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226737" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2226737 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mosaic.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mosaic.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mosaic.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mosaic.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mosaic.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mosaic.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mosaic.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2226737" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mosaic CEO and co-founder Salman Ahmad / Mosaic</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a number of proptech companies using software to make construction more efficient, but Mosaic has taken a unique strategy of</span><a href="https://www.builderonline.com/land/development/mandalay-homes-partners-with-mosaic-for-new-home-construction-in-arizona_o"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> acquiring a home builder, Mandalay Homes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a move that created an instant pipeline to put its technology to work on building new homes, according to Ahmad. To date, the company has completed 160 homes and has 195 under construction, with the plan of building 400 homes over the next two years.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is looking to double its current 70-person headcount by the end of 2022 and to speed up the construction of homes within its more than $500 million residential development project pipeline.  Specifically, it is actively recruiting engineering, product, back office, construction and project management roles. It is also looking to expand outside of its home state Arizona by the end of next year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But that doesn’t serve the other 99.99% of homes that are still customized to the buyer and built on site,” he wrote via email. “No one has figured out a way to change that equation until Sep and Salman started Mosaic, and the magic of why Mosaic works is they care just as much about why people work together as the homes that get built.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mosaic’s effort to have a focus on tradespeople, or subcontractors, in fact is something that Ahmad is proud of &#8212; especially as the labor shortages rage on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that the trade partners are the industry&#8217;s most precious resources and a lot of what Mosaic’s focus has been to develop technologies and tools to really enable our trade partners to be successful and to be able to lean on  osaic as a trusted and preferred building partner,” he said. “It&#8217;s becoming increasingly obvious to us that maximizing the efficiency of the precious trade resources that we have is paramount to not just our success as a business, but the success of the industry and to addressing some of the broader housing crises that exist across the country.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Mezli's prototype robot restaurant is up and running and serving customers Mediterranean-style grain bowls and side dishes from the company’s KitchenTown location in San Mateo.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While studying engineering at Stanford, Alex Kolchinski, Alex Gruebele and Max Perham met and bonded around the lack of food options on campus and the cost of the options that were there.</p>
<p>“Even on a subsidized meal plan, it would cost $10 for lunch and more for dinner,” Kolchinski told TechCrunch. “I would sit and do my work in the dining hall just to be able to eat two lunches. Alex (Gruebele) would just go to Chipotle and spend his stipend there.”</p>
<p>While thinking about how to provide good food at a lower cost, both Kolchinski and Gruebele, who were doing PhD work involving robotics, got to thinking about how robots could help people with meal prepping and other tasks.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226427" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“It turns out that a $10 burrito bowl really costs $3 in food costs, and the rest of the money goes to places like labor, overhead and real estate,” Kolchinski added. “If we built a self-contained restaurant, we would bring down the price of really good food, and it would be close by.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2226433" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226433" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2226433" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Step-by-step-bowl-animation.gif" alt="Mezli bowl animation" width="900" height="900" /><p id="caption-attachment-2226433" class="wp-caption-text">Animation of how a Mezli bowl comes together. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mezli</p></div></p>
<p>The trio paired up with Michelin-star chef Eric Minnich, who was previously part of the founding culinary team and executive chef of Spanish restaurant The Commissary in San Francisco, to start <a href="https://www.mezli.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mezli</a>, a company building fully autonomous modular restaurants. Most of the plans were laid out last year, and started in January at Y Combinator.</p>
<p>Mezli&#8217;s prototype robot restaurant is up and running and serving customers from the company’s KitchenTown location in San Mateo. The machines take up a 10-foot by 20-foot space and are freestanding. They are loaded with ingredients, initially offering Mediterranean-style grain bowls, side dishes and drinks.</p>
<p>The bowls start at $4.99. Diners can order directly from the restaurant or order online and pick up the food from a smart locker or have it delivered. The test location is already showing promise: 44% of customers who have tried the food have become repeat customers, Kolchinski said.</p>
<p>The company is now working on its third version of its prototype that will be ready for a public launch next year, he said. That momentum is backed by a $3 million seed round from investors including Metaplanet, roboticist Pieter Abbeel, restaurateur Zaid Ayoub and Y Combinator. That new funding will enable the company to add more talent, parts, food and operational expenses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once the company can scale, Mezli will be able to 3D-print thousands of the modular restaurants and deploy them in a fraction of the time and money it takes for traditional restaurants to get up and running, Kolchinski added.</p>
<p>“We will be scaling up to a few locations and then mass producing them,” he said. “We expect to hit 1,000 locations faster than other restaurants due to our mass production method.”</p>
<p>One of Mezli’s backers, Pieter Abbeel, is a professor at UC Berkeley and an entrepreneur on the founding team of both Gradescope and Covariant. He heard about Mezli from some of the founding teams’ classmates and wanted to get involved.</p>
<p>He was attracted to the company’s vision of providing healthy food that is more affordable and accessible. As a scientist himself, he also liked the “<a href="https://fs.blog/first-principles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first principles</a>” approach to using business and engineering to reduce the bottleneck of getting food into people’s hands and how the food is served.</p>
<p>“It resonates with me,” Abbeel said. “Anything physical is always harder than you think, so if you don’t come up with a first principles way to solve it, it will be difficult. In addition, from day one, the food was being served and that is compelling.”</p>

<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your spooktacular central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B. <em>Happy Halloween</em>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been an insane week of news that kicked off with <strong>Tesla</strong> hitting a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/trillion-dollar-tesla/">trillion-dollar market valuation</a> when shares pushed higher after Hertz announced plans to buy 100,000 of its electric vehicles. At the same time, the FSD software beta saga has continued to play out. The latest was National Transportation Safety Board Chairwoman <strong>Jennifer Homendy</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/ntsb-chair-elon-musk-change-tesla-autopilot/">calling on Tesla</a> to change the design of its advanced driver assistance system to ensure it cannot be misused by drivers, according to a letter sent to the company’s CEO <strong>Elon Musk</strong>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226830" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The FSD controversy is not fading away. I wonder if Tesla owners, especially those who bought into FSD years ago, will turn on Musk and the company? They can&#8217;t possibly love Musk&#8217;s latest comments, in which he confirmed that Tesla vehicles with Autopilot 2.0 will need a camera upgrade before owners who already bought FSD can get access to the beta software. But perhaps these owners will happily bring in their vehicles for the upgrade. How do you expect this to play out?</p>
<p>In the meantime, I started my week by exchanging a Jeep Wrangler 4XE Unlimited Sahara plug-in hybrid for the new all-electric Mercedes-Benz EQS580 4MATIC. These vehicles, which were provided to me for one week of testing, couldn&#8217;t be more different. Reflecting on my experiences with EVs over the past six years or more, it&#8217;s fascinating to see what has improved and what has not. More to come on my thoughts about these two vehicles.</p>

<p>The understated news of the week came from the <strong>North American Bikeshare and Scootershare Alliance</strong> (NABSA) and its annual conference. One of the many interesting micromobility concepts that was covered during the event was the launch of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/private-and-public-sector-come-together-to-create-privacy-principles-for-mobility-data/">seven privacy principles for mobility data</a>. Created via a collab between mobility companies&#8211; like Uber, Lyft, Spin, Bird and Lime &#8212; cities and other stakeholders, these guidelines at least start the conversation on responsible uses of rider data, both on the city side and the operator side.</p>
<h3>Micromobility operator update</h3>
<p><strong>Spin</strong> and <strong>TransLoc</strong>, a transpo tech and software provider, have announced a five-year agreement with the University of California San Diego to create a mobility ecosystem that will optimize how the school&#8217;s 75,000 students and staff move around campus. Spin will also be expanding its presence at the uni, bringing in 600 e-bikes and e-scooters and a network of Spin Hub charging stations, which will be integrated into TransLoc&#8217;s transit software. Next year, TransLoc will also power the school&#8217;s small buses and electric carts for on-demand services.</p>
<p><strong>Bird</strong>, which also offers vehicles to the UCSD students, has announced to the world that size does matter. The operator is <a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/how-bird-increased-footboard-size-improves-scooter-safety-stability/">expanding the footboards</a> on its Bird Three scooters to sturdy 25 inches, saying a bigger footboard makes for a more stable, more comfortable ride.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/bird-shared-vehicles-now-featured-in-moovit-transit-planning-app/">Bird just integrated</a> with transit planning app <strong>Moovit</strong> in 65 cities across 12 countries. Bird joins the likes of Spin and Lime on the app, all of which will now be able to feature available nearby vehicles, including how long it&#8217;ll take to walk to them and what their charge is like.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more Bird thing. Keep an eye out for the company&#8217;s IPO! Bird goes public via SPAC any day now. Its shareholder vote to approve the SPAC deal is on November 2, and its first Q3 earnings call is scheduled for November 15.</p>
<p><strong>Cake</strong>, the Swedish e-motorbike maker, is launching its first real live store. The CAKEsite, as the company is calling it, is a combo between a showroom, retail, test ride and service center. The site in Stockholm is the first of a planned 25 sites in North America and Europe by 2025.</p>
<h3>When cities do micromobility right</h3>
<p>The <strong>Miami Riders Alliance</strong> announced that its e-scooter program has recorded more than 1.2 million rides in 2021, and is on track to beat the previous ridership record of 1.3 million rides from 2019 before the end of November. The pilot program has generated over $3M in city revenue, which has helped fund new protected bike lanes downtown.</p>
<p><strong>Wellington, New Zealand</strong> is getting a <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/no-additional-lanes-for-cars-in-64b-wellington-transport-plan/2G3PUMHJ4VCCUZ35S2C7NYB3R4/">second Mt Victoria tunnel</a> per its $6.4 billion transport package, and among the options that are being discussed is one that would convert the tunnel into one dedicated to walking and cycling only. That&#8217;s a big deal in a city that&#8217;s pretty car-centric. There&#8217;s also talk of adding a dedicated bus priority lane to the mix, which would really open up non-car transit options for those in the eastern suburbs of the city.</p>
<p><strong>Paris</strong> wants to be <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-22/how-paris-will-become-100-cyclable">100% cyclable</a> by 2026 and is planning to throw down $291 million to bulk out its protected bike lane system by 180 miles, build 180,000 new bike parking spots, get rid of 70,000 on-street car parking spots, help businesses get on cargo bikes and raise awareness among school kids about how to bike.</p>
<p><strong>Lyft</strong> and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser started offering free 30-day Capital Bikeshare memberships to all D.C. residents to combat travel disruptions caused by reduced Metrorail service. Now that&#8217;s how you integrate micromobility into public transit!</p>
<h3>Micromobility money</h3>
<p><strong>Tier Mobility</strong> just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/tier-scoots-off-with-first-close-of-its-200m-series-d/">snagged $200 million</a> which it says is the &#8220;first close&#8221; of its Series D. The Berlin-based company is going to raise even more, apparently. Tier says the full round will be a mix of debt and equity.</p>
<p><strong>Rad Power Bikes</strong>, the fat tire e-bike manufacturer, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/rad-power-bikes-raises-154m-series-d/">raised a $154 million</a> Series D from existing institutional investors, which brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $329 million. The company will spend the money on funding tech and product innovation, building out its distribution centers and expanding its supply chain.</p>
<h3>Fresh swag</h3>
<p>E-bike manufacturer <strong>Tenways</strong> just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/the-tenways-cgo-600-is-a-very-serviceable-urban-belt-drive-e-bike-great-for-commutes/">launched its first model</a>, the CGO 600, on Indiegogo at a price of $1,400. It&#8217;s optimized for the urban environment, with a lightweight frame and a 250W motor for steep hills. And even though its on Indiegogo, which really gives no indication of whether the bike is actually going to make it to your door or not, the company says its bikes are already rolling off the production lines.</p>
<p><strong>Serial 1</strong>, electric bike-spawn of <strong>Harley Davidson</strong>, has unveiled its second single-edition e-bike. The <a href="http://www.serial1.com/bmx">MOSH/BMW</a> is available for auction, which will close on Tuesday, November 2 at 5pm MDT.</p>
<p><strong>Future Motion</strong> is launching <a href="http://onewheel.com/">two new Onewheels</a>: the GT and the Pint X. The GT is Onewheel&#8217;s new flagship product with more power, torque and performance. It&#8217;s got 3hp and gives up to 32 miles of charge. The vehicle is available for pre-order and ships in January, and it&#8217;ll cost $2,200. The Pint X is a compacted model with 18 miles of charge per day and a top speed of 18 mph. This one costs $1,400 and ships now.</p>
<p>E-bike and e-scooter maker <strong>Okai</strong> is launching the Beetle EA10 seated electric scooter and the Neon ES20 portable, smart street scooter, signaling a desire to hit different use cases. The Beetle has a wide cushioned seat and shock absorbers, and can go 16 mph at top speed. The Neon has a 1-click folding design, sweet customizable neon lights on the stem and undercarriage and 25 miles of range.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a new deal as much as a new disclosure that gives fresh insight into how closely Rivian&#8217;s future is tied to Amazon.</p>
<p>Amazon disclosed Friday that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/amazon-reveals-20-stake-in-rivian-ahead-of-ev-makers-ipo/">owns a 20% stake in Rivian</a>. That&#8217;s notable!</p>
<p>According to a regulatory filing, Amazon held equity investments (as of September 30) including preferred stock of Rivian that represented about 20% ownership interest. That holding had a &#8220;carrying value&#8221; of $3.8 billion, up from $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2020.</p>
<p>Amazon has invested $1.345 billion into Rivian, according to the EV maker&#8217;s initial public offering. Amazon also recently purchased $490 million worth of convertible notes in Rivian that will convert to Class A shares after the IPO, pursuant to certain pricing provisions.</p>
<p>What does this all mean? Amazon stands to gain if Rivian&#8217;s IPO is successful. And Rivian might be an independent company, but Amazon has considerable influence as an investor and customer. Expect Amazon to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amazon</strong> dipped back into its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/amazon-2b-climate-fund-invest-three-startups/">$2 billion climate fund</a> and invested in fast-charging technology Resilient Power, CMC Machinery and put additional capital into Infinium, a renewable fuels technology company it previously backed.</p>
<p><strong>Arc</strong>, a startup that launched 10 months ago with ambitions to electrify everything on the water, has brought <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/will-smith-kevin-durant-and-sean-diddy-combs-invest-in-electric-boat-startup-arc/">on several new investors</a>, including funds from Will Smith&#8217;s Dreamers VC, Kevin Durant and Rich Kleiman&#8217;s Thirty Five Ventures and Sean &#8220;Diddy&#8221; Combs&#8217; Combs Enterprises. The new investment, which co-founder and CEO Mitch Lee describes as a strategic round, pushes Arc&#8217;s total funding past $7 million. VC firm Andreessen Horowitz led the company&#8217;s seed round in February. Chris Sacca&#8217;s Lowercarbon Capital and Ramtin Nami&#8217;s Abstract Ventures invested in Arc&#8217;s seed round.</p>

The team of Pixar veterans has technology that Aurora believes can improve the computer simulation tool it uses to test and train its self-driving system more like the real world. Aurora will also own Colrspace&#8217;s IP, specifically technology that combines CGI and machine learning.</p>
<p><strong>Autochek</strong>, an African automotive company, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tlcom-and-4dx-drive-13-1m-seed-round-to-scale-autocheks-platform-across-africa/">raised $13.1 million</a> in a seed round led by pan-African VC firms TLcom Capital and 4DX Ventures.

<p>Hello everyone! Welcome back to Policy Corner.</p>
<p>The months-long saga to pass a budget reconciliation bill and an infrastructure bill &#8212; each historic in their own right, each touting trillion dollar price tags &#8212; is far from over.</p>
<p><strong>President Joe Biden</strong> unveiled his updated Build Back Better budget plan on Thursday, but the big arm of resistance came from his own party &#8212; more specifically, the progressive wing of the Democrats, who remain insistent that both bills move in tandem through the vote. Because no vote went forward, Biden had to leave for the United Nations Climate Change conference in Glasgow without a robust set of provisions on climate to show off to the other world leaders.</p>
<p>While the budget bill saw some heartbreaking changes &#8212; including a provision that would&#8217;ve established a national paid family leave program &#8212; what&#8217;s relevant here at The Station is that the expanded electric vehicle incentive for consumers survived the many rounds of revision. A $7,500 consumer tax credit for EVs has been around for a while, but supporters say it&#8217;s high time for it to be updated.</p>
<p>The major changes include:<br />
• Adding an additional $4,500 credit for EVs made in the U.S. and in union shops<br />
• Adding an additional $500 for EVs made with batteries where at least 50% of the components are U.S.-made<br />
• Removing the cap that limits the credit to manufacturers that have sold less than 200,000 EVs<br />
• Limiting the incentive to EVs that cost under $55,000 for sedans; $69,000 for SUVs; and $74,000 for pickups<br />
• Limiting eligibility for individuals that make under $400,000 per year or $800,000 for joint filers</p>
<p>One of the biggest benefits for the middle class would come in the form of when the incentive actually kicks in. Right now, consumers must claim the credit on their taxes at the end of the year, but under the new language, the discount would be applied upon purchase. It could open up a new EV purchase for many who otherwise couldn&#8217;t wait for tax time.</p>
<p>The provision has won the support of the Big Three automakers, the United Auto Workers Union, and Sierra Club, amongst others. Opposing the bill are major automakers, including Honda Motor, Hyundai, BMW AG, Volkswagen, Nissan Motor, Tesla and Toyota Motor.</p>

<p><strong>Arcimoto</strong>, makers of the small, electric, three-wheeled Fun Utility Vehicle, is partnering with car sharing company REEF as part of the company&#8217;s zero-emission vehicle-sharing program. Now, Arcimoto vehicles will be available to<a href="https://electrek.co/2021/10/26/arcimotos-fast-and-fun-3-wheeled-electric-vehicles-soon-to-be-rentable-by-the-minute/"> rent by the minute</a> in Santa Monica via REEF&#8217;s platform.</p>
<p><strong>Canoo</strong> reached an agreement with <strong>Panasonic</strong> to supply batteries for its all-electric lifestyle vehicle. The vehicle, which will be manufactured by VDL Nedcar, is scheduled for production in the fourth quarter of 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Ford</strong> and <strong>Newlab</strong> accepted six startups in its inaugural cohort of the Mobility Studio, a program that aims to help these companies pilot a range of services and technologies to help spur more widespread electrical vehicle adoption. The chosen startups include vehicle-as-a-service platform <strong>Autofleet</strong>, electric grid infrastructure developer <strong>Rhombus Energy Solutions</strong>, charging-as-a-service company <strong>SparkCharge</strong>, EV charging hardware and software provider <strong>EVPassport</strong>, EV management and monitoring software company <strong>WeaveGrid</strong> and vehicle-to-grid startup <strong>Fermata Energy</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>General Motors</strong> said it will install up to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/gm-will-work-with-dealers-to-install-40000-ev-charging-stations-across-north-america/">40,000 electric vehicle chargers</a> across North America as part of a plan to pour nearly $750 million into charging infrastructure that will help attract drivers to its electrified models. Under the program, GM will supply the charging equipment to auto dealers, who will work to identify suitable sites and get the infrastructure installed within their respective communities.</p>
<p><strong>Proterra</strong> will supply its H Series battery system technology to <strong>Komatsu</strong> for the development of battery-electric underground mining vehicles. The aim is to go into commercial production in 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Uber</strong> and EV charging and energy management company <strong>Wallbox</strong> have partnered to give ride-hailing drivers access to at-home charging infrastructure. Wallbox will offer drivers with Uber a discounted package for a charger, installation and the option to finance the package. The pilot program will kick off in the San Francisco Bay Area. If successful, the companies said it will be rolling out to other regions in the US, Canada and globally.</p>
<p><strong>Xponent Power</strong> has developed and is now launching a retractable solar awning for RVs. That&#8217;s neat! According to Xponent, the average RV uses about 7,200 kWh a year of energy. The Xpanse Solar Awning, as it is called, generates more than 1.2kW of solar power to run onboard appliances.</p>
<h3>Misc. stuff</h3>
<p><strong>Robert Bosch GmbH</strong> said it will invest another €400 million ($467 million) to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/bosch-boosts-investment-semiconductor-chip-capacity/">expand its chip manufacturing facilities</a> in response to the ongoing semiconductor shortage. The boosted expenditure, which is earmarked for 2022, will go toward expanding operations at the company&#8217;s wafer fabrication plants in Dresden and Reutlingen, Germany, and its semiconductor component facility in Penang, Malaysia.</p>
<p><strong>Stellantis</strong> has launched a rewards program and app with startup Miles. The new program, called Stellantis Miles, allows customers of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Fiat or Alfa Romeo vehicles to earn miles for all their travel, not limited to driving. The app was developed in partnership with Miles and available for free download on iOS and Android. Users can redeem their miles for personalized rewards from more than 250 leading retailers, as well as donate their miles to raise money for charity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hourly workers make up <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2020/home.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abut 55% of the working world</a>, yet when it comes to tech built for the world of work, their so-called knowledge worker counterparts dominate the space. Today, an app built specifically to address the needs of the former is announcing a big round of funding &#8212; underscoring both the evolving landscape of business software, and how hourly and shift workers are increasingly coming into their own.</p>
<p><a href="https://wheniwork.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When I Work</a> &#8212; a popular messaging platform that lets hourly workers employed by a business sign up for shifts, trade shifts with colleagues, and let management and others know when they cannot make it to a shift &#8212; has closed a growth round of $200 million, funding that the company will be using both for business development, and to expand its product.</p>
<p>The funding is coming from a single investor, Bain Capital (specifically its Tech Opportunities fund), and while the pair are not disclosing valuation, it&#8217;s being described as a &#8220;majority growth investment&#8221;, which implies something around $400 million. CEO Martin Hartshorne said in an interview that When I Work is profitable, and it has been since June of last year &#8212; notable considering we were in the depths of pandemic living and economic uncertainty &#8212; and its steady rise was the reason for raising now, after raising just $24 million in the 11 years prior.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226744" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have hit a new phase,&#8221; he said, with growth currently &#8220;north of 35%&#8221; and generating a profit. &#8220;The customers love the product and culture is really good. We’ve got something great and it&#8217;s time to go for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Previous backers include Arthur Ventures, Drive Capital, Greycroft and High Alpha.</p>
<p>Founded in Minneapolis in 2010, When I Work says its app is already used by some some 10 million hourly workers in the U.S. across some 200,000 businesses, with a focus on smaller businesses and franchises of well-known names (the list includes Dunkin’, Ace Hardware, Ben &amp; Jerry’s and Kenneth Cole). Some of that growth has specifically come from the changing needs of the market: while some retailers were forced to shutter operations, and some closed down altogether, other sectors like healthcare picked up steam.</p>
<p>Hartshorne noted that in Q2 of this year, the company picked up more than 50 customers &#8220;spinning up vaccination operations&#8221; &#8212; that is, building shift-based systems to handle that effort.&nbsp;The plan will be to continue doubling down on the opportunity in the U.S. as well as to start moving into other markets internationally.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As for the app itself, it has mainly made its name around providing tools to make it easier to communicate with shift-based and hourly staff, people whose hours mean that it&#8217;s <a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/43/3/zsz240/5599823" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlikely that everyone would be at the business at the same time</a> for meetings, and have potentially more variable schedules when they work, schedules that often need shifting depending on customer traffic and the circumstances of workers themselves.</p>
<p>As its name implies, When I Work&#8217;s most-used functions and managing shifts and communicating with the team, addressing what are the biggest and most general productivity challenges for that segment of workers. But over time it has capitalized on the audience and engagement to add in other services like payroll facilitation (interconnecting with more dedicated payroll software), labor reports, and analytics, and the idea is that this part will continue to grow, both organically and likely by way of acquisition.</p>
<p>Software catering to the world of work has largely been focused on so-called knowledge workers over the last decade or two: equipped with computers, smartphones and tied into work that relies on software and apps, that segment was a natural fit for more software tools, which have if anything only become more specialized over time, addressing specific verticals and use cases.</p>
<p>Yet digital transformation, and the rise of smartphone usage among the general population, have presented a host of new opportunities to expand the products and use cases for software in the workplace to touch a much wider swathe of workers. The population at large has shifted to using apps and other digital products in their daily non-work lives, and so they, too, want and are ready for those tools to help them do their work more easily, too.</p>
<p>In the case of When I Work, employees install it on their own smartphones, a signal of how bring-your-own-device has been an even stronger trend in this category of workers than it has been among knowledge workers. (They log in much as you might on any other work-based app, based on the company you work for and your mobile number or email.) Hartshorne said that a good part of its growth has been from word-of-mouth, with employees asking for it from new employers, having used it at a previous job.</p>
<p>But given that wider trend, it&#8217;s no surprise that company is not without competitors, as well as others addressing the same segment of workers that could potentially also become competitors, if not already. They include the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/homebase-raises-71m-for-a-team-management-platform-aimed-at-smbs-and-their-hourly-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homebase</a>, which raised $71 million earlier this year; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/workiz-locks-in-13m-for-productivity-tools-aimed-at-home-services-professionals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workiz</a>, which focuses on home services pro&#8217;s; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/29/fountain-a-platform-for-recruiting-gig-and-hourly-workers-raises-23m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fountain</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/wonolo-raises-140m-for-its-staffing-platform-used-by-1m-laborers-and-front-line-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wonolo</a> (both currently aimed more at recruiting and signing less-than-full-time people up to shifts); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/workwhile-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WorkWhile</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/yoobic-raises-50m-for-its-chat-and-communications-app-app-aimed-at-frontline-and-service-workers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yoobic</a> (more of a productivity platform for frontline workers currently); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/crew-a-workplace-and-slack-messaging-rival-for-shift-workers-raises-35m-adds-enterprise-version/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crew</a> (which <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/square-acquires-crew" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Square acquired</a> earlier this year); <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/05/workplace-reaches-7-million-paid-subscribers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workplace</a> (which now has 7 million paying users); and <a href="https://www.justworkshours.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justworks</a> (which in September filed to go public). The fact that some of these are addressing the same segment of users, but with different features, also presents something of a roadmap for When I Work and how it might expand, too.</p>
<p>Phil Meicler, an MD at Bain Capital Tech Opportunities, said that the engagement on When I Work &#8212; 85% of its users log in an use it at least once a week &#8212; makes the app one of the more compelling in that bigger field.</p>
<p>&#8220;In today’s modern workforce, having a solution that yields such clear productivity gains and strong employee engagement are unique,&#8221; he said, noting that the labor shortage among the hourly working sector has become even more acute in recent times. &#8220;Doing what it does at scale and efficiently is difficult to execute. The combination of growth and profitability was a core part of why we were excited about When I Work.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that Bain &#8220;shares Martin&#8217;s vision&#8221; to continue to expand the HR suite. &#8220;Building out the product through the eyes of the employees what else they use, how we could extend to make their lives easier, is the aim, and it has a terrific foundation in scheduling. It has a unique opportunity to grow organically and through M&amp;A.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Years ago, Americans spent most of their disposable income on food but consistent investment in retail infrastructure has changed that. Now, they only <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/12/this-map-shows-how-much-each-country-spends-on-food/">spend 6% of their household income</a> on food and beverages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa still battles with this and it is not hard to see why. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The continent’s retail markets are highly fragmented and mostly made up of small and informal retailers and intermediaries, which is why a ton of tomatoes that costs around $100 in the U.S., for instance, costs about $400 in Kenya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2014, <a href="https://twiga.com/">Twiga Foods</a> has been using technology to build supply chains in food and retail distribution on the continent, starting with Kenya</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the seven-year-old company is announcing a $50 million Series C round to scale its efforts in the East African nation and other neighbouring countries</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226777" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This funding comes after the company’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/28/kenyas-twiga-foods-eyes-west-africa-after-30m-raise-led-by-goldman/">$30 million Series B round</a> &#8212; $23.75 million equity and $6.25 million debt &#8212; in 2019. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/twiga-foods">Crunchbase</a>, Twiga has raised over $100 million in both debt and equity financing rounds</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most of Twiga’s operational history, it connected vendors and outlets with farmers via an app to access different agricultural produce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in 2019, the company began to connect FMCGs and manufacturers with retailers in Kenya in a bid to increase revenue, thereby dipping its hands into a space with regional players such as Sokowatch and MarketForce. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see ourselves as building a one-stop-shop for the informal retailer and all their needs. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">what we’re evolving into as a business,” CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-njonjo-867167156?originalSubdomain=ke">Peter Njonjo</a> said to TechCrunch in an interview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The B2B e-commerce food distribution platform claims that over 100,000 customers use its services across Kenya while delivering more than 600 metric tons of product to 10,000+ retailers daily.  </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Kenya’s Twiga Foods eyes West Africa after $30M raise led by Goldman&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/28/kenyas-twiga-foods-eyes-west-africa-after-30m-raise-led-by-goldman/embed/#?secret=790L3eqphZ" data-secret="790L3eqphZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Njonjo affirms that smallholder farmers remain at the core of Twiga’s operations. But having worked with them at scale and distributing fresh produce over the years, the Kenyan company has identified some challenges, especially in the traceability of some produce like tomatoes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twiga can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">effectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> track food and produce from processing to distribution. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there’s bound to be some lapses in the production end of things where for instance, farmers can apply a lot of pesticides to crops without Twiga’s knowledge, thereby creating food safety problems for the end consumer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To avoid situations like this in the future, Twiga plans to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">personally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> handle the value chains of some produce where traceability can be an issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For us, it’s choosing value chains where you can manage the traceability issue while there are some value chains that will be harder to manage,” the CEO said, “The key thing is that we now have a more blended approach. It’s not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about working with small farmers; w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e still work with them but on some value chains. But we’re looking at having large commercial farms integrated into our supply chain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Njonjo says Twiga is investing in a proof of concept to develop an alternative way of producing food on the continent and cover both ends of traceability and mass scale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the company, the proof of concept aims to reduce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the price consumers pay for popular domestic plant-based food products by over 30%. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the company manages to set it up, Njonjo says the model might </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be spun</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> off as a separate business to maintain a more asset-light approach to expansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The funding will be used to test the concept out. Twiga also plans to use part of the funding to roll out low-cost manufactured food and non-food products under its brand before the end of the year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the investors from Twiga’s Series B round in 2019 took part in this recent fundraise. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This time</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, however, Paris- and Nairobi-based family office and private equity firm Creadev led the Series C round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa-focused firms TLcom Capital, IFC Ventures, DOB Equity, and Goldman Sachs’ spinoff <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/goldman-sachs-spinoff-juven-to-back-african-tech-companies-with-large-checks/">Juven</a>, wrote follow-on checks too. First-time investors OP Finnfund Global and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endeavor</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Catalyst Fund participated as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">deeply</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> convinced in Twiga’s potential to revolutionize informal retail across  Sub-Saharan Africa,” said Pierre Fauvet, Africa director at Creadev, in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Tapping into a $77 billion urban market on the continent, Twiga has gained significant traction since </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, leveraging on technology to optimize the food supply chain in African cities and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">constantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> innovating to better tackle logistics,  commercial, social and environmental challenges.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round also presented a consolidation of Twiga’s cap table where earlier investors got some liquidity via a $30 million secondary sale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When CEO Peter Njonjo spoke with TechCrunch in an interview in 2019, Twiga was targeting a pan-African expansion by Q3 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But the pandemic </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and resulting lockdowns stalled those plans, yet Twiga made good use of the situation and quadrupled its revenues within that time — from April last year to August 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years on, the company, which now has more than 1,000 employees, is ready to make those moves and is expanding to other East African markets, Uganda and Tanzania, before the end of the year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is currently working with development finance partners to figure out how to scale its proof of concept where it will a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ct as an off-taker to sell horticultural crops from February 2022 across East Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fairly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> successful in Kenya. So, we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">want to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">consolidate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> our dominant position, clear out our proof of concept and expand to the neighbouring countries,” remarked Njonjo, who <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/01/27/grant-brooke-steps-down/">founded the company with ex-CEO Grante Brooke</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hitting these targets would set Twiga up for a bigger fundraise sometime next year, according to Njonjo</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. After that, Twiga will look at other markets &#8212; Cote d’Ivoire, DRC Congo, Ghana and Nigeria. Njonjo adds that Twiga’s expansion into Nigeria might involve some M&amp;A action.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roblox, the gaming platform that is immensely popular amongst young players, <a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1454954676726628356" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> on Twitter Sunday evening that it is back online worldwide.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Roblox is back online everywhere! Thank you for your continued patience as we get back to normal.</p>
<p>&mdash; Roblox (@Roblox) <a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1454954676726628356?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226817" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The recovery came after an outage that lasted <a href="https://status.roblox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three days</a>, a somewhat rare streak of blackout for a tech firm of Roblox&#8217;s colossal size. The company said earlier that the cause was an &#8220;<a href="https://status.roblox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal system issue</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A core system in our infrastructure became overwhelmed, prompted by a subtle bug in our backend service communications while under heavy load,&#8221; David Baszucki, Roblox&#8217;s founder and CEO explained in a <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2021/10/update-on-our-outage/">post</a> after operations were restored.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was not due to any peak in external traffic or any particular experience. Rather the failure was caused by the growth in the number of servers in our datacenters. The result was that most services at Roblox were unable to effectively communicate and deploy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recovery &#8220;took longer&#8221; than expected due to &#8220;difficulty in diagnosing the actual bug,&#8221; Baszucki said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rumors had it that a promotional partnership between the gaming platform and Chipotle, which planned to give out <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chipotle-to-open-virtual-restaurant-on-roblox-with-1-million-in-free-burritos-and-serve-up-5-digital-entree-offer-for-boorito-301408455.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1 million worth</a> of free burritos to Roblox players around Halloween time, led to the crash. Roblox <a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox/status/1454215549014069249" target="_blank" rel="noopener">denied</a> in a tweet that the disruption was caused by any &#8220;experiences or partnerships&#8221; on the platform.</p>
<p>The Roblox crash also came on the heels of Facebook&#8217;s rebranding announcement to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">become Meta</a>. Roblox, which allows users to build and play games, is often seen as the emblem of metaverses.</p>
<p>The outage is not just causing impatience among young users over Halloween weekend but also Roblox&#8217;s millions of developers who make money by touting games to kids and teens. Roblox had more than 43 million daily active users <a href="https://ir.roblox.com/news/news-details/2021/Roblox-Reports-Second-Quarter-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as of August</a>.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the three-day disruption will dent Roblox&#8217;s investor confidence in the company&#8217;s technical capacity once the market opens on Monday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Xx3EeqgK70?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>On the last Gang recording session in early October before the birth of our first grandchild, I tried to stir the pot by attacking Democratic Progressives for capsizing the second of two Infrastructure bills. The moderates, led by the recalcitrant Joe Manchin and his silent sidekick Kyrsten Sinema, were successfully gumming up the Democrats&#8217; best chance for holding control of the House and perhaps Senate. What else is new, you say?</p>
<p>In tech news, Facebook was busily exploiting the tone deaf policy of getting slightly irritated with growing pressure from whistleblowers, former venture capital critics who built their careers on the company&#8217;s early success, and a two-fisted teamup from a Congress in over its head and the media looking for a good story to replace Donald Trump&#8217;s devolution as credible threat. Today, Facebook ads talk of reforming Section 230 and otherwise providing rules for the company to follow. Infrastructure bingo has whittled down the cost by 60%; the plan is to get it passed in time to influence the election of the Governor of Virginia.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226809" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As I write this, it&#8217;s the end of October. I went to Ray Wang&#8217;s CCE conference down the coast in Half Moon Bay. The Ritz exists in a time warp, where the details of the outside world fade into the sound of the Pacific Ocean lapping up against the gentle lawns. Like the Ritz, conferences are testing the principles of the last economy against the shimmer of the next one. We could call it Work from Anywhere or Build Back Better or the last Beatle record, but I suggest we dig in to the fundamental shift and play in the surf of a new reality.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a reality where each of us with a little coin in our pockets and a phone can participate in the new media. It&#8217;s not quite an even playing field, as accumulating a meaningful audience is not provided with the available cloud tools. But what is provided is plenty to start with: a free newsletter tool, free social audio tools to broadcast and evangelize the newsletter&#8217;s editorial agenda, and tickets to a dazzling array of services and streaming choices to distribute your stuff. So, a few freemium products to jumpstart things and then look out, hold on to your wallets. The net result of this is called the creator economy by vendors and prospective producers, but it&#8217;s more likely a consumers economy.</p>
<p>We saw this with blogs and then podcasts, born out of RSS and its attachment extension. The RSS readers gave us civilians the ability to aggregate the stuff we wanted in what looked like an email client but also a newsgroup. Twitter added a layer of social graph which broad- or narrowcast our preferences to an emerging social cloud, a sphere of influence that both aggregated media and inserted us into that media flow on equal terms. As someone who was lucky enough to find access to the technology press pre-blog, I knew full well what a powerful hand-hold this new technology proffered. I can see the same fingerprints in this new economy as certain newsletter nodes create a pecking order for what I and our virtual cohort deems valuable. Social signals provide clues and notification trails to identify, amplify, and negotiate tickets to what I perceive as the new post-pandemic conference.</p>
<p>At CCE, a Salesforce colleague allowed as how he&#8217;s stopped watching the Gang because our Trump talk is too depressing. Of course, who really needs another podcast anyway. To be fair, Trump has been largely replaced by Manchin, but the pain point is more and more the media&#8217;s difficulty in defining a rationale for coverage that doesn&#8217;t descend into picking fights and promoting a lifestyle of anxiety and anger for ratings. This should be good news for the new economists, but secretly we all want to become the &#8220;real&#8221; media and are subverted into a similar editorial model. So my complaining about conflict of interest in the media is about as inconsequential as worrying about Trump. If I don&#8217;t like it, build it back better.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Well, I’d like to, but I have to wait a while longer for the promised Record/Replay function to ship on Clubhouse, Twitter, and everywhere. I’ve had the ability to record for months, but what I’m waiting for is everybody to have access to the marketplace. Talent will out, and not just talent in words or one-directional podcasts but in marketing, analytical insights, pure promotion, and actionable ideas that shape all these domains. And this means holding these folks accountable to their promises. Clubhouse said “weeks” more than a month ago.</p>
<p>A day ago, Twitter announced new features for its Twitter Labs early look subscription service, unfortunately only available currently in Canada and Australia. I&#8217;d gladly pay $4.95 a month to test out new features. And more importantly, who else would? C&#8217;mon, @jack, I&#8217;ll even pay with bitcoin if I have to. But things are moving quickly: Twitter just announced record tools are now in beta and will ship to creators and listeners in a couple of weeks. Et tu, Clubhouse?</p>
<p>At CCE I met with Paul Greenberg, who, with his partner (and Gillmor Gang member) Brent Leary, are building a series of what he calls live streaming shows around the CRM Playaz banner. Paul says he looks forward to this column/newsletter and that I should write more and more often. I recognize what Paul and Brent are doing in live streaming as the leading edge of what this moment is about, so I understand what they mean by encouraging this work I&#8217;m doing. These tools, together with the experiences and network of colleagues and friends I&#8217;ve accumulated along the way, give me an extraordinary opportunity to extend ideas, styles, and the actual music of what we crave as the consumer economy. When what I do works, even I appreciate it, and in truth has always been my northern light in talking with an audience no matter how large or undetectable. And the rewards on the upside can be astonishing.</p>
<p>We all know how the Grateful Dead spawned a forest of recorders and microphones at their concerts, not just allowing but encouraging it by letting some of them plug into the group&#8217;s live mixing board. By the late Eighties, a band that was largely a touring outfit had transcended the record business and stood as the largest grossing live act on the planet. It also spawned a hit album and only Top Ten single, Touch of Grey, through the force of the Dead micro-community, not the other way around.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two 19-year-old entrepreneurs, who previously collaborated on a number of projects including a ride-hailing commute app for school kids and left Stanford last year to pursue a new startup, said on Sunday they have raised $60 million to disrupt India’s overcrowded and highly-competitive grocery delivery market.</p>
<p>Glade Brook Capital led Zepto’s first institutional financing round, the startup’s founder and chief executive Aadit Palicha told TechCrunch in an interview. Nexus, Y Combinator, Global Founders Capital, as well as angel investors Lachy Groom, Neeraj Arora, and Manik Gupta also participated in the round, which values Zepto at $225 million.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.zeptonow.com">Zepto</a>, which has largely operated in stealth mode until today and launched its app six months ago, has been the talk of the town for several months. The startup, whose name <a href="https://twitter.com/pacificleo/status/1452554053603450884">playfully uses a mathematical term</a> to describe the business, offers a 10-minute grocery delivery service, beating many heavily-backed rivals on speed.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226748" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To achieve this feat, Zepto has set up dark stores across the cities where it operates (Mumbai, Bangalore, and as of this week, Delhi.) Palicha said these dark stores, which the startup has set up, are designed and optimized for fast deliveries. (Zepto’s approach, for which Palicha said he looked at other markets and spoke with the operators running those firms, is different from many Indian startups that rely on regular grocery stores for inventory.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The way we are growing right now, and the current penetration and frequency of usage we are seeing, the opportunity is just massive,&#8221; he said. The startup plans to soon expand to Hyderabad, Pune, and Kolkata and grow the number of dark stores it has to over 100 by early next year, from 40 currently, he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2226750" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2226750" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2226750 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MPV05064.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MPV05064.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MPV05064.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MPV05064.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MPV05064.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MPV05064.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MPV05064.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MPV05064.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MPV05064.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2226750" class="wp-caption-text">A dark store operated by Zepto. (Image credits: Zepto)</p></div></p>
<p>The idea to create Zepto came, said Palicha, when he and Kaivalya Vohra (the other founder) were locked in their houses in Mumbai last year because of the pandemic. &#8220;We just had been exposed to the entrepreneurial and tech startup world in a very deep way. Now we were in Mumbai and the biggest problem for the two of us bachelors was securing grocery and essentials,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Maharashtra &#8212; like every other Indian state &#8212; had enforced lockdown to contain the spread of the virus, which among other things, meant that deliveries were taking two to three days to reach their customers. &#8220;We were extremely frustrated,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We felt that the online play of the Indian grocery delivery space, which is one of the world&#8217;s largest, was grappling with some gross execution errors,&#8221; he added, without naming any firm.</p>
<p>Zepto, which has assembled a team that includes former executives from Flipkart, Uber, Dream11, Pharmeasy, and Pepperfry, competes with a number of heavily-backed startups including SoftBank-backed Swiggy and Grofers, and Google-backed Dunzo, many of which have expanded to the fast grocery delivery category in recent quarters.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve been ignoring the noise and executing heads- down for a long time to perfect this model, and our efforts are paying off. Today, we’re consistently growing 200% every single month with an unstoppable team, robust product infrastructure, and deep access to institutional capital,” said Palicha.</p>
<p>At stake is an opportunity that is estimated to be worth $21 billion by 2025, according to a recent note prepared by Sanford C. Bernstein analysts. &#8220;Online grocery penetration is expected to reach ~3-5%, by 2025 from less than 1% today. Long-term structural drivers remain strong: rising income and affluence, lower tier consumption, e- commerce penetration (~30% CAGR) and a young population (~50% below 25). Grocery spend as a proportion of income remains high at ~ 30%,&#8221; they wrote in the note.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is significant room for driving higher penetration in existing cities with high traffic, increase in conversion and retention. Adoption of online grocery has increased with engagement level and order volumes accelerating. DAU (daily active users) has seen strong growth for many e-grocery apps during lockdowns. Downloads have increased recently. Online grocery has demand side advantages of 24 / 7 shopping, wide SKU ranges, same day/next.&#8221;</p>

		Kathryn Kosmides is a survivor of gender-based violence and the founder of nonprofit background check <a href="https://www.garbo.io/">Garbo</a>.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen’s message about Instagram’s impact on teenage girls was unequivocal: Facebook’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739">studies</a> found that 13% of British teens said Instagram prompted thoughts of suicide, and 17% of teen girls say Instagram makes eating disorders worse.</p>
<p>These statistics, however, are only one part of the bigger picture when it comes to the general safety of teenagers online.</p>
<p>It’s estimated that there are over <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-110hhrg38335/html/CHRG-110hhrg38335.htm">500,000 sexual predators</a> active on the internet each day. In 2020, there were over <a href="https://www.missingkids.org/gethelpnow/cybertipline">21.7 million reports</a> of suspected child sexual exploitation made to the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children’s CyberTipline. Online enticement reports &#8212; which detail when someone is communicating with a child via the internet with the intent to exploit them &#8212; increased by more than 97% from the year before.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225097" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Reports of online predators are on the rise, but predatory behavior online is as old as Netscape.</p>
<p>My family got our first PC in 1999. I started on gaming platforms like Neopets and Gaia Online. Soon, I was posting thoughts and communicating with other users on Myspace and Tumblr. As my online world expanded, I encountered old men pretending to be preteens. At one point, I began a “relationship” with a 17-year-old boy when I was just 12 years old. Of course, I didn’t talk about any of this, mostly out of shame. I didn’t know I was being groomed — I had never heard the word used until I started doing gender-based violence work myself.</p>
<p>Grooming is subtle, and for a teen unfamiliar with it, undetectable. An individual grooms to build trust and emotional connection with a child or teen so they can manipulate, exploit and abuse them. This can look like an older teen asking to webcam and slowly prodding a child or teen to do inappropriate things such as spin around for them or change clothes to something “cuter,” or a digital “friend” pressuring someone to engage in cybersex. Predators sometimes pretend to be a young person to obtain personal details such as photos or sexual history; they then weaponize this information for their own pleasure.</p>
<p>I only recently realized that there is CSAM — or child sexual abuse material — of me out there on the internet. Footage of me may still reside on someone’s old cell phone or on a hard drive collecting dust. It could one day be shared onto private Discords or Telegram channels.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>My individual experience as a teen girl on the internet is part of what led me to build a nonprofit <a href="https://www.garbo.io/">online background check</a> that allows anyone to see if someone they are speaking with has a history of violence — ideally before the first in-person meeting. We recently made the decision to allow users as young as 13 to access our public records database in the future. While we may never be able to entirely stop children and teens from being exploited online, we can at least arm them with tools and technology to understand whether someone they meet online has a record of bad behavior.</p>
<p>Of course, a background check is only one tool in the safety arsenal &#8212; people frequently lie about their names and identities. If a child is being groomed, or an adult is exploiting them, they are often doing so in ways that are anonymous, isolated and secret.</p>
<p>This is why educating young people about avoiding the dangers that lurk online is key. This can involve teaching them to identify early red flags like <a href="https://www.garbo.io/blog/love-bombing">love bombing</a>, extreme jealousy, pushing boundaries, etc. We can also communicate to young people what a healthy, safe, <a href="https://www.garbo.io/blog/consent">consensual</a> relationship looks like — with “<a href="https://www.garbo.io/blog/green-flags-of-a-healthy-relationship">green flags</a>” as opposed to red ones.</p>
<p>There are various <a href="https://www.wiredsafety.com/for-teens---protecting-yourself-online">practical skills</a> that we can incorporate into kids&#8217; education as well. Teach them to be selective about what photos they share and whose follow requests they accept and to bring an adult if they meet people they know online in real life.</p>
<p>When the adults in their lives discuss the dangers of online dating and internet communication openly and consistently, children and teens learn how to recognize the risks. This can go a long way toward preventing serious trauma. Conversations about safety online, like sex education, are often left to parents, while parents assume kids are having them at school. It can be difficult to navigate these discussions, especially for parents who don’t always understand online culture, but it is essential that parents seek out resources to educate themselves.</p>
<p>As Haugen pointed out, online platforms also have a responsibility. Trust and safety departments at online platforms are relatively new, and there’s still a lot to learn and improve on.</p>
<p>On most digital platforms, content moderators are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/may/25/facebook-moderator-underpaid-overburdened-extreme-content">understaffed, underpaid and undertrained</a>. Online platforms need to put protection over profit and invest in additional training and support for the mental health of those responsible for keeping their platforms safe. By giving safety teams the tools and time they need to think critically about questionable content, they can execute on their mandate effectively and with care.</p>
<p>Though the internet can create environments that lead to abuse, it can also be a powerful tool in educating young people about early warning signs and the realities of the world, including arming them with access to information about who they&#8217;re talking to online.</p>
<p>Reactive measures to combat abuse &#8212; from the criminal justice system to platform moderators &#8212; are a Band-Aid on a bleeding wound. Preventing sexual abuse before it happens is the best protection we can give our kids. By taking responsibility — whether as platforms, politicians or parents — for the potential harm caused online, we can begin to create a safer world for all of us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Angel investing has traditionally been mostly open to men, who travel in certain circles and have access to certain networks, but Amanda Robson, a principal at Cowboy Ventures, is attempting to change that by building an informal network of women and non-binary folks who have the means to write checks, but for whatever reason have not been able to easily move into this type of investing.</p>
<p>Robson says that when it comes to angel investing, women and non-binary people have been left out. &#8220;I had a number of friends who had recently within the past couple of years become VP-level at different companies, and they had an interest in angel investing, and they had the means to at that point, but they didn&#8217;t have access,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>That was in contrast to males in a similar position. &#8220;They found that a lot of their male counterparts who were also execs or male founders were getting pinged by their VC friends to join in on deals, and they weren&#8217;t getting the same treatment,&#8221; she said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223764" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Robson says that she found this surprising at first because at her firm, they try to fill the cap table with a diverse set of angels. As she looked around, she found that wasn&#8217;t the case at all firms, but it wasn&#8217;t always because of a lack of desire to be more diverse. It was also a sourcing problem. They didn&#8217;t know where to look.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2224264" style="width: 601px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2224264" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2224264 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amanda-Robson.jpg?w=680" alt="Amanda Robson, principal at Cowboy Ventures" width="591" height="333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amanda-Robson.jpg 2100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amanda-Robson.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amanda-Robson.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amanda-Robson.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amanda-Robson.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amanda-Robson.jpg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amanda-Robson.jpg?resize=2048,1151 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Amanda-Robson.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2224264" class="wp-caption-text">Amanda Robson, principal at Cowboy Ventures</p></div></p>
<p>So if you had one group looking to invest, and another looking for diverse investors, it seemed that something could be done to bridge the gap. &#8220;I just found myself in a unique position having been in venture for almost six years and having a bunch of VC relationships because of that, and then also having access to awesome female [and non-binary] founders and operators that I could kind of bridge that gap in a pretty seamless way,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Her experience is not uncommon. Diana Murakhovskaya, general partner and co-founder at the Houston-based Artemis Fund, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/the-artemis-fund-focuses-on-women-founders-in-underserved-communities/">told TechCrunch recently</a> that prior to launching the fund in 2019, she and her co-founders attended networking events in the Houston area and noticed a dearth of women. She started hosting dinners to find out why.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“I said, ‘Where are all the women?’ [ … ] And so we started doing these dinners to bring together women and asking them why they’re not investing, what they’re doing. And these were all corporate women [who had the money to invest].” Like Robson, Murakhovskaya found that these women had never been invited to invest, and they started a firm to change that.</p>
<p>Robson took a different approach. She has a day job, but she knew that she could make some introductions when it made sense. &#8220;So I&#8217;m the conduit between the two [groups]. I have this database with angel investors and other VC relationships and then also deal flow that I see that will come from other angel syndicate groups or deals that Cowboy can&#8217;t invest in because we&#8217;re conflicted out, and I try to connect those two,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Robson, on her own, created this database of people, many of whom she knew previously or learned about when she put out a call for female and non-binary angel investors on Twitter. &#8220;I chatted with them and got a sense of their background and what they were interested in, if they truly understood the risks and dynamics of angel investing, and added folks that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&mdash; Robby (@amanda_robs) <a href="https://twitter.com/amanda_robs/status/1451581642598879236?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>She said going outside her network would also help create a more diverse database that went beyond people she had known personally. &#8220;I also knew that my network would be limited, and the whole point of this is increasing access, so I wanted to be a little bit more public about it so folks who wanted to be angels could see those messages on Twitter and then join in,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The database includes the names, check sizes they are willing to invest, sectors they want to invest in and previous investments (if any). She says that typical check sizes are between $15,000 and $50K, but she has seen checks as small as $5K or less as she attempts to get more people involved.</p>
<p>&#8220;In some cases recently there have been newer female [and] non-binary angel investors who have wanted to write checks that are $5K, some even below, and some founders and VCs have been open to those smaller check amounts because they want to add diversity to the cap table,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Lisa Wallace, who is co-founder at pay equity startup <a href="https://www.assemble.inc/">Assemble</a>, says that she had been an angel for a couple of years when she responded to one of Robson&#8217;s tweets. She also found that when her company was raising a seed round, it was difficult to find a diverse group of angels for her cap table. She says that Robson&#8217;s network solves both problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that there&#8217;s actually two parts of the problem. First of all, I&#8217;m a diverse angel, and I want to make sure that I [can access] dealflow, selfishly. But on the other side of it, it would have been really easy had Amanda had this when I was raising my round because I would have just pinged her,&#8221; Wallace said.</p>
<p>Stella Garber is another angel in Robson&#8217;s network who is former CMO at Trello, and started angel investing in 2016. She too came across one of Robson&#8217;s tweets and says that it&#8217;s always good to find other sources of possible deals as an angel investor.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really great to see all the different types of deals that come through that channel. There&#8217;s been a mix of all types of different industries, mostly early stage I would say. But obviously as an angel, you have to do your own due diligence, but it&#8217;s just nice to have that channel to get deals from,&#8221; Garber said.</p>
<p>While these two had experience in angel investing, not everyone does, so Robson has also been helping set up workshops to explain what&#8217;s involved to those who are expressing interest and want to learn the mechanics of this type of investing.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Robson admits that quite a bit overhead is required to run the network because she is the sole conduit. But she says that it&#8217;s the kind of job that is hard to outsource because she has the first-hand knowledge of both firms and angels that the role requires.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do want to get some help to grow it, but I also think that there are limits to how much I can outsource any parts of this because the access piece is super important. I&#8217;ve been doing this for four to five months and I&#8217;ve only sent 18 deals through, but all of those ended up getting a lot of interest from the group because they&#8217;re highly curated.&#8221;</p>
<p>She says the ultimate purpose is to build this network of successful angels. &#8220;I want to have these rockstar angels who&#8217;ve gotten access to amazing deals and have amazing track records. And so that&#8217;s really the ultimate goal. And it&#8217;s more about that and in making these angels successful than me leading this group.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, founded by <a href="https://eg.linkedin.com/in/alifnasser">Ali Nasser</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmad-kawass-56b65815/">Ahmed ElKawass</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdelrahmanhosny/">Abdelrahman Hosny</a> in 2020, operates a delivery and fulfilment model. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> delivers packages of all kinds for merchants and retailers &#8212; ranging from mom and pop stores and social media to fashion retailers who make thousands of shipments and international brands &#8212; to customers in Egypt.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226717" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the fulfilment side, ShipBlu stores merchants’ products in warehouses it leases. Then it connects with merchants’ online stores and monitors orders via a dashboard, so when they come in, ShipBlu picks and packs the orders from the warehouse and sends them to the customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ShipBlu charges its customers per package, depending on two standard sizes, destination and shipping speed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While these three factors are common in e-commerce and fulfilment, CEO Nasser said shipping speed is not prioritized the same way as the other two in Egypt. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to him, ShipBlu is one of the few e-commerce fulfilment companies that offers that service to customers in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We let the merchant decide: Do they need to get that product to their customer overnight, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">therefore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, pay or charge the customer for overnight fees?” Nasser said to TechCrunch in an interview. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Or are they willing to for a more </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">budget-friendly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> option and would like to ship that package in three to five days? We offer that option to merchants, who in turn can decide to offer that to customers. So it could be the customer’s choice or the merchants’ choice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ShipBlu only </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched this August</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Per its <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/shipblu">YC profile</a>, ShipBlu signed on more than 40 merchants during its first month. And since then, the company has managed to double its clientele while tripling revenues in the same period, said Nasser without stating hard numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the next couple of months, Nasser says he wants ShipBlu’s network and infrastructure to reach 99% of Egypt’s population.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whether you’re living in a small village or a large town or a large city, we want to be able to get to you and have the infrastructure in place to get to your delivery to you,” the CEO remarked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea behind such a daring move &#8212; which appears to be a bit of a stretch considering the timeline &#8212; comes from the founders’ ambition to change an industry that has lagged behind other regions in the wider GCC, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, in terms of e-commerce penetration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 100 million people live in the North African country compared to Saudi Arabia’s 30 million+ people, yet the e-commerce market in Egypt is a third of Saudi Arabia’s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A significant reason this gap has always existed is that the infrastructure needed to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilitate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the process of e-commerce in Egypt is abysmal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It runs deep even on an elementary level where zip codes are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">barely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accurate or non-existent, presenting many challenges to last mile or delivery providers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The zip codes were one of the issues Nasser observed from Egypt’s fragmented e-commerce and fulfilment market during his return from the US to the country months before the pandemic broke out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As online payments boomed globally and in Egypt and upon finding out via research that the market size for last-mile delivery in MENA stands at over $3.1 billion </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">annually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Nasser and his co-founders ElKawass, Abdelrahman Hosny got together to start ShipBlu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was that period that it hit us and we realized how much more can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be done</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for delivery services in the standard of service and the features that are available today. Compared to Europe and the US and other parts of the world, there was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so much more that we could bring to the market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Egypt is an entirely different market compared to these developed regions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For instance, 40% of deliveries fail in the country, while the global benchmark for the latter is about 8%. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The high rate of delivery failure makes the operating costs for over 150 providers in Egypt generally high. ShipBlu, differentiating itself</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the market, says it has developed AI and ML algorithms to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “reduce costs, meet delivery constraints, and refine its operating assumptions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO says ShipBlu’s end goal is to make customers choose a three-hour delivery window for their packages and know what date to expect them, which contrasts how most traditional e-commerce fulfilment companies function.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Roughly 56% of the time when someone in Egypt places an order online, they don’t even have a delivery date</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. After you place your order and you get an email confirmation, it’s complete silence until, on a random day, you’re going to get a call from the agent who’s on your on their way to you asking if you are available to pick up the package. We’re changing that,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ShipBlu has competition with the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/egyptian-startup-flextock-closes-3-25m-in-the-largest-pre-seed-yet-in-mena/">Flextock</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/bosta-raises-6-7m-to-expand-e-commerce-delivery-business-across-africa-and-mena/amp/">Bosta</a> in Egypt. And following the completion of its seed round, the company now has a mutual investor with Flextock in Flexport, the billion-dollar freight and logistics company YC backed in 2014. The unicorn also invested in Nigerian <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/nigerias-sendbox-raises-1-8m-to-provide-e-commerce-fulfilment-for-small-merchants/amp/">e-commerce fulfilment startup Sendbox</a> this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">MENA-focused venture capital firm Nama Ventures led ShipBlu’s seed round with participation from 1984 Ventures; Orange Ventures, the venture capital arm of Orange Telecom; Starling Ventures and other VC funds and angel investors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says the investment will help grow its service offering and coverage across Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>subscribe here.</em></a></p>
<p>I spent the past month interviewing current and former employees at Ro, a health tech unicorn, about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/ro/">rising tensions within the company as it struggles to grow into its $5 billion valuation.</a> Many employees, who joined for Ro’s mission, said that the company’s execution began to struggle after raising a $500 million Series D. The co-founders began to amplify a new focus for the company: Become the &#8220;Amazon of healthcare.&#8221; Ro CEO and co-founder Zachariah Reitano, who was not made available for comment on my story, <a href="https://medium.com/@zreitano/lets-talk-about-it-growth-business-culture-at-ro-c8b0b51670c5">released a statement in response to my piece.</a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This story started because I was tipped off about a slew of departures. After conducting a few interviews, I realized that people who had joined for mission were leaving because of low morale and poor execution &#8211; different than &#39;the great resignation&#39; <a href="https://t.co/ty2qXs0ayB">https://t.co/ty2qXs0ayB</a></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226591" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&mdash; natasha (@nmasc_) <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1453431730933669889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>While my story gets into the specific problems that Ro is dealing with, from stagnating ARR to race-to-the-bottom competition, I want to focus on what other startups could learn from this story.</p>
<p>Let’s be clear: It’s not abnormal for a startup to go through trials and tribulations, especially in pursuit of profit and a moonshot of a vision. After all, every startup has a tipping point in which leadership has to take a step back and see what went wrong to avoid failure. The current and former employees that I spoke to for the story — as well as the more than dozen that reached out post-publication — felt like Ro needs a recalibration to truly get past its growing pains. The common solutions that came up? Transparency, more balance and openness to addressing failure so that lessons can be extracted for the future.</p>
<p>Here’s how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/ro/">one former employee put it:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>“The first year that I was there, I was like the happiest person on earth,” a recently resigned employee said. “The piece that needs to be recalibrated is &#8216;what is the end vision?&#8217; What do you mean when you say &#8216;a vertically integrated, patient-centered health system?&#8217; And are the actions moving you toward that? And that’s ultimately why I left, because I didn’t feel like what was being said externally was actually happening internally.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As more startups get ballooned by venture capital and the incentives that come alongside with it, an industrywide recalibration between the Big Pitch and the actual product strategy of companies feels imminent.</p>
<p>Founders should prepare to have conversations about distributed work’s impact on culture and venture capital’s impact on priorities. Investors will have to question the pressure they put on portfolio companies and show value through navigating ups and downs. Press will need to go deeper than the funding round story and poke holes in the narratives that decision-makers craft. And employees, more emboldened than ever, will have to make choices on balance and the importance of self-advocacy.</p>
<p>This shift fits squarely into a perspective that I’ve leaned heavily on through the pandemic: It’s okay to change your mind about what’s important and unlearn what you thought was non-negotiable.</p>

<h2>Even PR is getting into VC</h2>

<p>VSC, a public relations firm that has helped the likes of startups such as ClearCo, Poshmark, Tonal and Tile craft their stories, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/vsc-startup-fund-climate/">has raised millions to invest in the companies they work with.</a> The move is further validation of a trend we’ve been on about in this newsletter for months: Venture is going full stack and one of the most in-demand services is storytelling.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>While VSC’s move feels warranted, it’s somewhat unprecedented. Despite the blending of media and venture, PR firms may have avoided going down this route because their clients — other startups — need them as a shoulder, not an investor. In other words, one could argue that founders may feel less incentivized to be vulnerable with a PR firm about struggles if they are also their investors, the same people they are incentivized to impress.</p>
<p>“Because we’re not the lead investor, we don’t ever put that kind of peer pressure on them,” Chattha said. “We have enough skin in the game to be honest and vulnerable with them, but not so much that we’re going to guide them into the wrong for their business.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226074" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>

<h3>Apple SharePlay Arrives</h3>

<p>Apple&#8217;s new FaceTime feature SharePlay wasn&#8217;t immediately available with the iOS 15 launch, as it needed a bit more polish. But with this week&#8217;s release of iOS 15.1, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/shareplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SharePlay</a> &#8212; and a number of mobile app updates ready to support it &#8212; have finally arrived. The feature makes using Apple&#8217;s video calling platform more interactive and could help to potentially lock in users to Apple&#8217;s ecosystem.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As with many Apple features, SharePlay is easy to use despite the complicated technology powering the new system that runs under the hood. With the tap of a button on FaceTime&#8217;s controls, you can start sharing your device&#8217;s screen on your call or you can just switch over to the app you want to co-watch with a friend &#8212; the app alerts you upon arrival that it supports SharePlay as well as how to get started.</p>
<p>While screen sharing, you can view your screen or other apps together. However, you won&#8217;t have a good experience trying to co-watch videos this way due to lags. Apple also smartly blocks other viewers from seeing your incoming notifications or any kind of application pop-ups or dialogs, as they may contain sensitive information. And everything is end-to-end encrypted, so you can feel comfortable screen sharing in a business setting, not just a personal one. (And this will be further improved when SharePlay arrives on macOS Monterey later this fall.)</p>
<p>If anything, the biggest obstacle to using SharePlay at launch is simply availability.</p>
<p>Apple has a robust lineup of launch partners for the new addition &#8212; but unless you&#8217;ve happened across the App Store&#8217;s editorial round-up of SharePlay-enabled apps (do a search for &#8220;shareplay&#8221; to find it), you may not know if your favorite app is &#8220;SharePlay ready&#8221; as of yet.</p>
<p>Initially, SharePlay is rolling out to apps, including Apple TV+, Apple Fitness, TikTok, NBA: Live Games &amp; Scores, Paramount+, Showtime, Kahoot!, Cameo, SmartGym, Flow, Moon FM, MUBI, Digital Concert Hall, Piano with Friends, Relax Melodies, LookUp, Heads Up!, CARROT Weather, Apollo, Night Sky and others. Disney+ will soon support SharePlay, as will ESPN, HBO Max, Hulu, MasterClass, Twitch, Pluto TV and more.</p>
<p>While that&#8217;s pretty decent right out of the gate, <strong>it is</strong> <strong>missing one key player: Netflix</strong>.</p>
<p>You have to wonder what&#8217;s going there &#8212; is it in the works? Being held back as a negotiating tactic? Is Netflix&#8230;just not interested? As you might recall, Netflix was one of the few streamers that didn&#8217;t add a native co-watching feature (or at least officially partner with another software maker) during the pandemic, while everyone else was busy building remote social experiences. Competitors like Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Plex, HBO and others rolled out co-viewing experiences. But Netflix sat out the trend, despite the growing popularity of third-party co-viewing apps like Netflix Party. With Netflix&#8217;s more recent <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/21465/global-paid-net-subscriber-additions-by-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slower growth</a> following the pandemic&#8217;s peak, you would think the company would see SharePlay as a potential source of new user acquisition.</p>
<p>After all, SharePlay can be used to offer a free user without an account a way to co-watch with a paid subscriber, if that&#8217;s what the developer wants. This, in turn, could then be used to push the free user to buy a subscription after some time has passed &#8212; like <em>after</em> they got hooked on some exclusive shows, perhaps. It seems like a no-brainer to offer support for this sort of thing &#8212; but perhaps Netflix is building out its own version where it can collect more data as a first-party experience. Time will tell.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the SharePlay feature could appeal to younger people who already use FaceTime the way older people use the Phone app, and who are comfortable multi-tasking on their devices.</p>
<h3>In-App Events Go Live</h3>

<p>A whole new way to market apps has now appeared on the App Store. On Wednesday, the first <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/in-app-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in-app events</a> began appearing on the App Store, giving users a new way to find out what&#8217;s happening inside their favorite apps and games right now. At launch, Rise of Kingdoms and Pokémon GO are promoting Halloween special events, for example, as are others. But in-app events could also be used to promote things like movie premieres or live sports in the future. When users tap a new event card on the App Store (in iOS 15 or iPadOS 15), they&#8217;ll be taken directly to the event taking place. They can also tap &#8220;Notify Me&#8221; to get alerts when upcoming events go live, share events with friends or add them to their calendar app.</p>
<p>Other games adopting the feature include Call of Duty: Mobile, PUBG Mobile, Clash Royale and Genshin Impact and soon, so will apps like Tinder, TikTok, Disney+, Hulu, Paramount+, HBO Max and ESPN.</p>

</ul>
<h3><strong>Streaming &amp; Entertainment</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spotify says its service is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/spotify-says-u-s-podcast-listeners-now-use-its-service-more-than-apple-podcasts/">now used more by U.S. podcast listeners</a> than Apple Podcasts.</strong> The company made the announcement during its Q3 earnings, citing its own internal data and Edison Research (where it&#8217;s a client). It did not say how many podcast listeners it had, but noted MAUs overall grew 19% year-over-year to reach 381 million in the quarter, up from 365 million last year. Premium subscribers also grew 19% to reach 172 million, up from 165 million last year.

<h3><strong>Dating</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Match-owned dating app Hinge introduces a new &#8220;Voice Prompts&#8221; feature</strong> that gives users a new way to interact, by answering a prompt through a 30-second recording. The company hopes the voice feature will give users a peek into someone&#8217;s personality and hint at what a first date might be like.</li>
<li><strong>Chinese dating app Lesdo, designed for lesbian women, announced it was shutting down.</strong> This specific niche of online dating has failed to scale and make a profit in the country, despite a potential audience of 10 million in China. Contributing to the problem of scale is a hostile environment for the LGBTQ+ community, as Beijing has pressured charities not to work with queer activists and WeChat deactivated queer groups&#8217; public accounts, <a href="https://www.protocol.com/china/-lesdo-closure-lesbian-app-china" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Protocol reported</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Tinder continued to lead the dating app market with the highest number of paid subscribers,</strong> followed by Match.com, according to new data shared by <a href="https://secondmeasure.com/datapoints/pandemic-online-dating-app-industry-paid-subscribers-bumble-tinder-match/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg&#8217;s Second Measure</a>.</li>

<li><strong>This week, reps from TikTok, Snap and YouTube faced Congress to talk about how their apps are addressing kids and online safety</strong> as the U.S. considers legislation that would require tech companies to offer a safer environment for kids online. One of the highlights from the hearing was listening to senators <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/tiktok-snap-youtube-execs-grilled-impact-young-users/story?id=80793639" target="_blank" rel="noopener">try to get the companies on the record</a> as to whether or not they support specific legislation, like the upcoming COPPA revamp, which only TikTok fully said &#8220;yes&#8221; to. When asked about the KIDS Act, which would prevent manipulative marketing (like undisclosed influencer marketing), there was less support. Companies said they would be happy to &#8220;look&#8221; at the details as if the Act was new, and not something that had already been around for a while.</li>
<li><strong>TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-dodges-questions-about-biometric-data-collection-in-senate-hearing/">dodged questions</a> about its plans for biometric data collection during its first-ever Senate hearing.</strong> In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/tiktok-just-gave-itself-permission-to-collect-biometric-data-on-u-s-users-including-faceprints-and-voiceprints/">an update to the company’s U.S. privacy policy</a> in June, TikTok added a new section that noted the app “may collect biometric identifiers and biometric information” from its users’ content, including things like “faceprints and voiceprints.” The company was questioned by multiple lawmakers on this matter during a hearing conducted by the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-snap-youtube-hearing-congress/">which was focused on</a> social media’s detrimental impacts on children and teens.</li>
<li><strong>The lawmakers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/youtube-and-snapchat-were-asked-to-defend-their-apps-age-ratings-in-senate-hearing/">also asked</a> YouTube and Snap to defend their apps&#8217; age ratings on the app stores,</strong> where they were sometimes rated 13 and up or 17 and up, depending on the platform. <strong>Snap was also pressed on whether its content was even appropriate for younger teens</strong>, given the app&#8217;s Discover page contained content that Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) deemed &#8220;wildly inappropriate&#8221; for a child, like &#8220;recommendations for&#8230;an invite to play an online sexualized video game that’s marketed itself to people who are 18 and up; tips on, quote, ‘why you shouldn’t go to bars alone;’ notices for video games that are rated for ages 17 and up; and articles about porn stars,&#8221; he said.</li>
<li><strong>The senators also asked TikTok, Snap and YouTube <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/lawmakers-confront-tiktok-snapchat-and-youtube-about-eating-disorder-content/">how they handled</a> eating disorder content,</strong> after Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen‘s document leaks exposed Facebook’s knowledge that Instagram could be dangerous for teenage girls with body image issues.</li>
<li><strong>In non-hearing news, Apple is &#8220;very likely&#8221; going to face a DOJ antitrust lawsuit,</strong> <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-very-likely-to-face-doj-antitrust-suit?rc=ajsw4d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Information reported this week,</a> citing sources with knowledge of the matter.</li>

<p>Niantic&#8217;s attempt to once again replicate the success of Pokémon GO, in a way that Harry Potter: Wizards Unite <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/comment-and-opinion/76443/harry-potter-wizards-unite-failed-magic/">has not really been able to</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/pikmin-bloom-an-ar-mobile-game-is-niantics-next-collaboration-with-nintendo/">arrived this week</a>. The company announced the launch of a new AR game Pikmin Bloom in collaboration with Nintendo. The game, like Pokémon GO, encourages users to go outside and explore &#8212; but now, instead of capturing Pokémon, they&#8217;ll collect seedlings and a squad of &#8220;Pikmin&#8221; &#8212; a sort of plant-animal hybrid creature. As you walk, you&#8217;ll leave AR trails of flowers behind you. The game will also later host monthly &#8220;Community Days&#8221; for Pikmin so users can plant and play together. Overall, the game seems less competitive than Pokémon GO and may be aimed at someone who wants more casual gameplay. The game initially rolled out to Singapore and Australia, then the U.S., and will continue to roll out globally.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by the </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>daily TechCrunch+ column</em></a><em> where it gets its name. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Good morning my dear friends, I trust you are well. It’s the weekend! Here’s hoping you are going to consume more sugar in the next few days than your doctor would approve of. After all, we all die in the end. And on that encouraging note, let’s get to work!</p>
<p>TechCrunch’s recurring coverage of venture capital trends has taken on an increasingly global tilt as the startup market has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">expanded to fill every geography</a>. Hence our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/investors-say-indian-startup-funding-could-get-even-hotter-after-record-q3/">ramping coverage of India’s startup scene</a>, not to mention our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/african-startups-join-global-funding-boom-as-fintech-shines/">increasing focus on the startups coming out of the African continent</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226507" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With so many startups raising so very much money, it can be hard to keep it all straight. But we’re not the only organization with its eyes on upstart technology companies busy adapting to the new global startup reality. Venture capitalists are as well.</p>
<p>We’ve seen VCs shake up their operations to better suit a flat world for technology innovation in recent years. Larger funds with more partners to spread focus, for example, or the creation of country- or region-specific funds.</p>
<p>White Star is one such firm with an increasingly broad focus. The venture group recently closed its third fund, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/fund/white-star-capital-raised-white-star-capital-fund-iii--d8476841">a $360 million vehicle</a>, and TechCrunch caught up with founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericmartineaufortin/">Eric Martineau-Fortin</a> a few days back. But instead of chatting about valuations, or sectors, we mostly talked about geographies.</p>
<p>Martineau-Fortin lives in Guernsey, a small island that sits roughly between France and the United Kingdom. Residing between two major landmasses is fitting for the investor, as his firm’s first fund focused on the United States and Europe, roughly splitting investments between the two.</p>
<p>White Star’s second fund expanded its geographical purview to include a modest Asia focus as well. The group’s third fund will split roughly 40/40/20 between America, Europe and Asia, Martineau-Fortin said.</p>
<p>Notably, the group doesn’t actively pursue the Indian market. Which stood out, given how much capital is flowing into the country, but White Star keeps its focus more on the South Korean and Japanese markets, so it can invest in Asia more broadly while not putting India atop its list.</p>
<p>I riffed with Martineau-Fortin about other markets. He had rather positive things to say about Brazil’s startup scene — not a huge surprise with Nubank’s IPO in the offing — and Mexico. More simply, the Latin American venture capital market is respected even by investors that don’t have a focus there.</p>
<p>The world’s venture market remains uneven, despite some flattening. The United States saw $72.3 billion in total VC activity in Q3 2021, <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/venture-trends-q3-2021/">per CB Insights data</a>. Asia as a whole saw $50.2 billion. Europe managed $24.2 billion, and Latin America just $5.3 billion. That means that there’s likely arbitrage out there for the investor willing to add new time zones to their mix.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, White Star could split its investment focus into thirds among the U.S., Europe and Asia. I wonder if that will become a normal split in time. After all, the internet is everywhere at once — sans North Korea, China and a few other markets — so why not put capital into companies, well, everywhere?</p>
<h2>The future of consumer investing</h2>
<p>Taking a hard right turn this morning, let’s talk about consumer investing in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>I promise I am going somewhere with this!</p>
<p>The Exchange caught up with <a href="https://freetrade.io/">Freetrade</a> this week, auspicious timing as our call came in the wake of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/robinhoods-nasty-quarter-shows-the-ups-downs-of-trading-incomes/">Robinhood’s poor earnings report</a>. As a reminder, Robinhood shares fell after the company announced a sharp sequential-quarterly revenue decline, falling active users and slim figures on total funded accounts.</p>
<p>The short answer to what happened from Q2 2021 to Q3 2021 at Robinhood is that crypto trading fell off a cliff on its platform, leading to a lackluster revenue result. The company’s Q4 is forecasted to be even smaller than its Q3. Not good!</p>
<p>I expected the Robinhood results to prove indicative of what Freetrade was seeing amongst its own user base. But, per the <a href="https://twitter.com/doddsie">company’s CEO Adam Dodds</a>, nothing of the sort. Indeed, the company recently announced that it has reached one million users, but more importantly that it has secured 110,000 new <em>funded</em> accounts thus far in October. That’s a <em>huge</em> portion of the company’s aggregate user base in a single month!</p>
<p>That hardly bearish fact in hand, Dodds doesn&#8217;t see Freetrade’s core market of the U.K. as nearly tapped out, and the company has expansion plans involving Canada, Australia and more coming in the next few months. Along with, yes, crypto trading.</p>
<p>The other difference of note between Robinhood and Freetrade, apart from their presently disparate user growth figures, is that the latter company doesn’t engage in payment for order flow. Instead, Dodds explained, the company makes money from subscriptions, a small slice of FX transactions and interest on held user cash.</p>
<p>The subscription element is key to the company’s long-term value, I reckon. Why? Because recurring software revenues are investor catnip, and Dodds said that something akin to a quarter of folks opt to pony up for the paid version of its service.</p>
<p>If that ratio holds up — or merely experiences modest declines — Freetrade could build a huge software business. Given just how much more penetration the startup anticipates in its home market, let alone foreign shores, there’s money to be made. More when Freetrade raises again.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Authoritarian governments from twenty-one countries have deliberately shut down internet service at least fifty times this year, and the problem is only bound to get worse. As regimes such as Venezuela face elections and Cuba experience protests, they’re finding it easier to contain dissent by curtailing digital freedoms – and are becoming increasingly brazen in doing so.</p>
<p>Shutting down the internet can be as easy as flipping a switch. Hosni Mubarak’s Egypt took this approach in 2011, and ten years later, Myanmar’s daily shutdowns lasted <i>months</i> – depriving hundreds of thousands of people of the means to communicate and shrinking the country’s GDP by an estimated 2.5 percent. Just this week in Sudan, citizens are experiencing disruptions to internet access in the midst of an ongoing military coup.</p>
<p>Most governments are more nuanced, however.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2226666" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>The Iranian government was among the first to block websites, as it did in 2009 during the Green Movement. Others, like Tunisia, blocked only certain websites amidst protests demanding greater accountability this year. Increasingly, governments use their control over internet service providers to ‘throttle’, or slow down, particular domains to an unusable speed. Russia, for instance, recently throttled Twitter for refusing to remove “objectionable” content about opposition figure Alexei Navalny.</p>
<p>Governments provide myriad reasons for restricting internet access. Officials often cite national security or a fear of violence during public demonstrations. But as people live more of their lives online, governments’ ability to restrict internet access represents a grave threat to safety, freedom and well-being.</p>
<p>After all, the internet’s growth as a global, borderless network of networks has been a boon to human freedom, providing new ways to discover information and new channels to organize. But growing opposition to a truly global open internet from a surprising number of governments risks a mounting erosion of freedoms as more aspects of our lives shift online.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The problem of deliberate shutdowns has escalated – and UN Special Rapporteur Clement Voule recently<a href="https://undocs.org/A/HRC/47/24/Add.2"> warned</a> that shutdowns are getting worse and more widespread. Internet shutdowns are increasingly being used as the primary tool for governments to silence dissent and control their populations without attracting the ire of the international community.</p>
<p>Internet shutdowns affect people far beyond restricting communication: they immobilize economies by halting commerce and trade, keep people from attending school, and endanger lives. But as covert blocking techniques like throttling have become commonplace, detection of shutdowns has become more difficult. The increasing complexity of the internet makes it difficult to determine what is happening when a government limits its citizens’ access, though. And it’s impossible to condemn what you can’t see.</p>
<p>Documenting even partial internet shutdowns is a critical first step to addressing this issue globally. No government should be able to shut down the internet without the international community knowing about it. That’s why Jigsaw is working with leading researchers at Access Now, Censored Planet, Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI), and others to make information available, build understanding, and mitigate the impact of shutdowns.</p>
<p>A number of resources can reduce the impact of internet shutdowns. Mesh networks, virtual private networks (VPNs), and shared proxy servers can provide the means to help people connect to the open web during shutdowns. Implementing internet-wide standards can make domain-level throttling more difficult.</p>
<p>But technology is only one part of the solution. Preventing future shutdowns requires political action: raising the cost of such action in the eyes of the international community.</p>
<p>Grassroots efforts to highlight internet shutdowns such as the #KeepItOn movement, a coalition of more than 240 organizations from 105 countries, provides a range of advocacy, technical support, and legal interventions to prevent future shutdowns.</p>
<p>Democratic governments, too, should unite in action.</p>
<p>As the world&#8217;s most technologically advanced democracies formalize their multilateral coordination on technology issues in groupings like the T-12 or the Quad, they should prioritize internet shutdowns as a key pillar of their agenda. Through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United States and other like-minded states could build on the work of the Online Freedom Coalition, a grouping of thirty-five democracies committed to online freedom, to enhance funding efforts to understand the technical aspects of the threat and develop technical and policy responses. They could ensure concerted condemnation accompanies future shutdowns and articulate ‘red lines’ to trigger sanctions on countries violating their commitments under international human rights law.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, it is up to democracies to take up the rallying cry for a free and open internet. Only then might the promise of a universally accessible internet be fulfilled.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">My son was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder in the first grade. As a mother, it took an ecosystem of support from schools, counselors and family members to ensure that we understood his needs and provided support for his learning and personal development.</p>
<p>Through our own journey, I’ve seen firsthand the challenges that people with neurological variations like autism face on a daily basis, but perhaps one of the biggest hurdles is overcoming society’s underestimation of this incredibly gifted population.</p>
<p>In my experience, people with neurodiversity are consistently underestimated for their knowledge and skills — but if my son is any indication of the value they can bring to the tech industry, then business leaders are missing out until they prioritize cognitive diversity.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2225053" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Why is neurodiversity important in the technology industry?</h2>
<p>One of the key factors in making each of us different is our neurological makeup. This difference can result in people interpreting, understanding and reacting differently in certain situations within personal and working life. And it often creates different skills and talents within people, such as heightened levels of analytical and creative processing.</p>
<p>The technology industry spans various roles and functions, from data scientists to developers, analysts and many more – not to mention the jobs that have yet to be created as we approach the Fifth Industrial Revolution and our world undergoes a significant digital transformation.</p>
<p>As an industry, we need to work harder to educate how talent can be leveraged in different ways to fulfill these roles, because employees are often a company’s greatest asset.</p>
<p>Throughout history, we’ve relied on our ability as a society to think differently in order to survive and thrive. With differences in thinking, neurodiverse people can bring alternative perspectives that may not have been explored before. It’s critical that businesses continue to prioritize cognitive diversity in their workforce, as every individual brings unique knowledge, experiences, and skills to the table and can help drive progress in technological innovation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>How can the tech sector recognize and recruit neurodiverse talent?</h2>
<p>One of the first barriers to entry for someone who is neurodiverse is the interview process. Traditional interviews take into consideration things like body language and awareness of social cues that can put a neurodiverse person at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Neurodiversity might affect the way that someone communicates; for example, the inability to read non-verbal social cues, resulting in limited eye contact and limited language softening. This behavior could lead to the removal of neurodiverse people from candidacy based on “cultural fit.&#8221; In reality, this is a much larger miscommunication that’s likely to screen out neurodiverse talent from positions in which they could excel.</p>
<p>Chemistry and character-based stages of the hiring process tend to take place first, before digging into the more technical elements of a role, where neurodiverse people can display their advanced skills. This leads us to ask: Are businesses doing enough to support diversity, equity and inclusion if they aren’t giving equal opportunity to neurodiverse people?</p>
<p>One way businesses can address this challenge is by partnering with community organizations to gain expert guidance, education, and best practices around talent acquisition and talent nurturing.</p>
<p>For example, across Stanley Black &amp; Decker, we’re collaborating with the National Organization on Disability and Autism Speaks to establish a hiring program that helps us recruit and retain talent of all abilities. As a leading global company, we have a responsibility to ensure our future is developed for everyone, by everyone, and that means taking steps to ensure our workforce is diverse and inclusive of people of all abilities, including neurodiverse people.</p>
<p>By taking steps to understand how we can all implement inclusive hiring practices, the tech industry can greatly benefit from a talent pool that might have otherwise been untapped. This could provide at least part of the solution to the technology talent shortage that continues to impact the industry.</p>
<p>Job mobility and career advancement within the neurodiverse community can also be explored and developed to ensure that career advancement is not limited to lower-skilled positions.</p>
<p>We must keep in mind the limitations on soft skills and associated characteristics stereotypically looked for in management and leadership roles, such as self-awareness and interpersonal communication.</p>
<p>When you look at case studies of neurodiverse teams, there is a distinct uplift in productivity, particularly in analytical roles. As such, I’d encourage leaders to identify opportunities for all talent to excel in their areas of expertise.</p>

<h2>Can the tech sector help optimize the future of the workplace for neurodiverse people?</h2>
<p>During the past 18 months, we have seen a dramatic shift in requirements from leadership. Employees have more autonomy than ever before, and the same goes for people who are neurodiverse.</p>
<p>They now have the ability to request workplace accommodations that might not have been considered “essential” in the past — for example, more flexible working arrangements or the availability of choices to support alternative requirements to thrive in their working day. This could include variety in their immediate work environment and spaces for limited social interaction, noise or distraction, as well as the availability of headphones to limit auditory overstimulation.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the virtual world in which we’re living presents an added opportunity for people who are neurodiverse because it requires fewer of the typical in-person social skills that were previously expected within the workplace. This means that now more than ever, there are many flexible processes and policies that organizations can put in place to meet employees where they are.</p>
<p>A great way to provide additional support to employees is by encouraging engagement in employee resource groups (ERGs). In 2018, I co-founded our Abilities Network, a global ERG committed to supporting employees with disabilities, employee family caregivers of those with disabilities and the greater global community. It provides them with an engaging environment where they can pursue advancement, bring their full selves to work and thrive.</p>
<p>It was my personal experience that inspired me to establish this ecosystem of support &#8212; I knew how essential it was in helping our family advocate for our son. I did this through charity partnerships such as Autism Speaks. First initiated in 2018, we wanted to provide guidance for our workforce and leverage the National Organization on Disabilities to enhance our education and progress in this area.</p>
<p>By developing these communities, we can open conversations around neurodiversity and create more inclusive environments in which all employees have the tools, resources and support they need to succeed.</p>
<p>This also allows us to support employees as the business adapts. For example, during the pandemic, we saw a large increase in employees suffering from anxiety. Therefore, the Abilities Network partnered with Understanding Anxiety to offer support and tools to employees who need it.</p>
<p>It’s important that we bring best practices in inclusivity to all elements of the business, from hiring to marketing and everything in between.</p>
<p>From a marketing perspective, this means creating, for example, accessible website experiences across a company’s digital platforms to ensure people of all abilities are able to access and experience the company’s information. We’ve been successful in deploying numerous digital experiences with “accessibility by design” through the support of the Abilities Network ERG.</p>
<p>By tracking the progress of the employee experience through employment statistics and employee objectives in a Disability Employment Tracker, we have seen a 54% increase in talent sourcing and a 20% increase in “people, policies and practices” leading to an overall cultural accessibility increase of 105%.</p>
<p>My son has been a tremendous help throughout this process, acting as a sounding board to help me drive toward a more inclusive future, and I’m forever grateful for his partnership. He has been the inspiration behind my passion to ensure inclusivity remains at the heart of everything that I do.</p>
<h2>Neurodiversity presents business opportunities</h2>
<p>Technology changes the world and shapes the future of all industries. As leaders in this space, we have a responsibility to ensure that this future is inclusive and representative of all of us. We must ensure diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives aid not only new talent, but the neurodiverse people already within the talent pool.</p>
<p>My son, now 19 years old, is studying biotechnology and molecular bioscience at a technology university. When he was first diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, we were met with low expectations for his personal and professional development — a collective underestimation of the value his unique skills could bring to the table.</p>
<p>This has driven my passion and efforts to ensure that we at Stanley Black &amp; Decker — and other companies — provide inclusive opportunities for all people.</p>
<p>Neurodiversity presents a huge opening for leaders to bring in unique talent with different skill sets to ultimately drive progress in the tech industry and beyond. And unless we’re tapping into this pool of talent, companies are missing out.</p>
