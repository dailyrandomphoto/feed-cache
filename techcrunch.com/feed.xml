										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the latest bit of regulatory woe for Big Tech in Europe, Google is trying to settle a German antitrust investigation into its news licensing product by offering not to expand the display of News Showcase &#8220;story panels&#8221; into general search results.</p>
<p>The German Federal Cartel Office (FCO) <a href="https://www.bundeskartellamt.de/SharedDocs/Meldung/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2022/12_01_2022_Google_News_Showcase.html">announced today</a> that the company has proposed several measures in response to its antitrust concerns &#8212; which also include taking steps to put clear blue water between News Showcase contracts and ongoing negotiations with publishers related to copyright licensing obligations around so called neighbouring rights for news.</p>
<p>Under EU and German law Google must pay copyright fees to news publishers for displaying snippets of their content &#8212; following a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/european-parliament-votes-for-controversial-copyright-reform/">2019 EU copyright reform</a> which was transposed into German law in May 2021.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256681" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Unilateral attempts by German lawmakers &#8212; around a decade ago &#8212; to force Google to pay licensing fees to local publishers for displaying snippets of their content in Google News were easily thwarted by the tech giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/21/google-makes-google-news-in-germany-opt-in-only-to-avoid-paying-fees-under-new-copyright-law/">switching to an opt-in model</a> for the aggregator in the market.</p>
<p>Ultimately it&#8217;s taken a pan-EU directive &#8212; combine with local antitrust intervention &#8212; to force Google&#8217;s hand on this issue so it can&#8217;t simply change how it operates to circumvent payments.</p>
<p>Although the tech giant&#8217;s compliance with EU copyright law remains a work in progress, to put it mildly. (Its activity in the region on this front has already attracted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">a fine of over half a billion dollars in France</a>, for instance, where Google&#8217;s approach to news licensing also remains under close regulatory watch.)</p>
<p>Germany is also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/in-latest-big-tech-antitrust-push-germanys-fco-targets-google-news-showcases-fine-print/">scrutinizing Google&#8217;s negotiations with local news publishers</a> &#8212; as well as, as of today, extracting operational concessions from it on how it operates News Showcase.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The FCO said it&#8217;s concerned that if Google integrates News Showcase into general search results, as Google has previously said it intends to, it will result in the company self-preferencing its own services or &#8220;impeding services offered by competing third parties&#8221;.</p>
<p>Other concerns it has focus on whether the News Showcase contractual terms &#8220;unreasonably disadvantage&#8221; the participating publishers &#8212; including by making it &#8220;disproportionately difficult for them to enforce their general ancillary copyright when participating in Google News Showcase&#8221;.</p>
<p>The regulator also said it is reviewing Google&#8217;s conditions for access to Google’s News Showcase service &#8212; to examine whether non-discriminatory access is ensured for publishers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s likely no accident that just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/germany-fco-google-decision/">last week the FCO confirmed its ability to apply special measures</a> to Google&#8217;s business, under powers to tackle digital market giants which were passed by local lawmakers at the start of last year. That shrinks the timeframe for regulatory action and squeezes how much room Google has to try to wiggle around any FCO orders.</p>
<p>Similar <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">Big Tech-focused copyright reforms are underway in the UK</a>, too. While ex ante rules for gatekeeping giants are well on their way to being adopted at an EU level (aka, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/ep-imco-dma-vote/">Digital Markets Act</a>). So the operational leash for Big Tech in Europe is only set to shorten.</p>

<p>As well as offering not to expand the showcasing of licensed content to general search results in Germany, the FCO said today that Google has &#8220;already changed some of the practices under examination and declared its willingness to address any remaining ambiguities and concerns by modifying the Showcase contracts and providing clarifying statements&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;In particular, Showcase contracts are to be clearly separated from the ongoing negotiations regarding other ancillary copyright payments between Google and the publishers or their collecting societies,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>The tech giant announced the global<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/google-to-pay-out-1b-to-publishers-to-license-content-for-new-google-news-showcase/"> News Showcase</a> product back in October 2020 &#8212; when it said it would pay participating publishers $1BN collectively to licence their news content to appear in so-called &#8220;story panels&#8221; (see below examples from <a href="https://news.google.com/news-showcase/">Google&#8217;s product marketing</a>) across Google products.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256726" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256726" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2256726" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-12-at-12.39.36.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="341" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-12-at-12.39.36.png 2358w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-12-at-12.39.36.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-12-at-12.39.36.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-12-at-12.39.36.png?resize=768,385 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-12-at-12.39.36.png?resize=680,341 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-12-at-12.39.36.png?resize=1536,770 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-12-at-12.39.36.png?resize=2048,1027 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-2022-01-12-at-12.39.36.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2256726" class="wp-caption-text">Screengrab: Natasha Lomas/TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>At the time Google was facing rising legal requirements in a number of jurisdictions over remuneration for displaying news content (Australia came up with its own legislative template targeting Google and Facebook to pay for news reuse in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/australia-now-has-a-template-for-forcing-facebook-and-google-to-pay-for-news/">August 2020</a>, for example).</p>
<p>So the News Showcase gambit always looked like a naked attempt by Google to limit a looming revenue hit while simultaneously leveraging its market power to generate as much upside for its ad-monetizing Internet content business as possible.</p>
<p>Closed door commercial deals for News Showcase offered Google the chance to dangle a carrot of licensing payments and play publishers off against each other &#8212; pressuring them to agree to its terms and shrink legally mandated licensing fees.</p>
<p>Initially, Google said content licensed under News Showcase would appear in story panels on the Google News app on mobile devices. It went on to expand where participating publishers&#8217; content appeared to include its News aggregator product on the desktop and a personalized content feed on mobile devices, called Google Discover.</p>
<p>Evidently, it hoped to be able to further expand where across its online real-estate the licensed content appears &#8212; including by adding News Showcase into search results.</p>
<p>However, in Europe, where Google&#8217;s search engine remains dominant, its plan quickly landed it in regulatory hot water over competition concerns.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, the News Showcase product provides the prospect of raised visibility for participating publishers by featuring their content to Google users across a number of touchpoints &#8212; including giving mobile users the ability to follow publishers so that more of their content gets threaded into personalized feeds. So there is a strong incentive for publishers to cut deals with Google &#8212; giving it leverage over content licensing negotiations.</p>
<p>For example, publishers may feel incentivized to cut deals with Google for News Showcase in order not to miss out on the prospect of extra traffic being sent their way (especially if competitors have already cut deals) &#8212; putting commercial pressure on them to agree to broad licensing terms that might waive or reduce copyright-based licensing fees.</p>
<p>The problem for Google is that European competition regulators have not been taken in by its attempt to use a proprietary news display product and commercial terms to smudge copyright compliance by co-mingling News Showcase negotiations and contacts with legally required licensing fees &#8212; and have instead listened to publisher complaints that Google is not playing fair. (The FCO probe, for example, was opened followed a complaint filed by the collecting society Corint Media.)</p>
<p>Issuing a hefty sanction last summer, the French competition watchdog said Google had sought to unilaterally impose its global news licensing product in negotiations with publishers — pushing for the legal neighbouring right to be incorporated as “an ancillary component with no separate financial valuation”.</p>
<p>Its investigation continues &#8212; but has already landed Google with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/google-fined-592m-in-france-for-breaching-antitrust-order-to-negotiate-news-copyright-fees/">a $592M fine for breaching an earlier order</a>.</p>
<p>Germany hasn&#8217;t issues any sanctions yet but, with the FCO flush with new powers to tackle abusive digital giants, the threat is clearly there. Hence Google&#8217;s alacritous offer of tweaks to how it operates the News Showcase product in Germany (the FCO only began probing the T&amp;Cs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/in-latest-big-tech-antitrust-push-germanys-fco-targets-google-news-showcases-fine-print/">last summer</a>).</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s dominance in Europe in the market for general search means the company has faced a number of antirust enforcements in recent years &#8212; both at an EU and national level. But it&#8217;s fair to say that EU Member States&#8217; competition watchdogs have been quickest to respond to news publishers&#8217; concerns.</p>
<p>Germany was one of the first markets to get News Showcase which has likely fed the FCO&#8217;s relatively quick scrutiny of the product. Although France was faster to transpose the EU copyright reform into national law &#8212; and its competition watchdog has been keenly focused on Google&#8217;s compliance with the neighbouring right requirement, and with the detail of how it has negotiated fees with news publishers over reuse of their content.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/google-france-antitrust-news-litigation-settlement-offer/">December</a>, the French regulator announced Google had made a series of commitments around negotiating in good faith &#8212; which it proposed should apply for a period of five years.</p>
<p>France&#8217;s watchdog is consulting on Google&#8217;s proposal until the end of this month &#8212; after which it will make a decision whether to accept them or require additional measures.</p>
<p>The German FCO is also now consulting locally on Google&#8217;s operational offers around News Showcase.</p>
<p>In a statement, president Andreas Mundt said: “Google has proposed measures to respond to our competition concerns relating to Google News Showcase. The company no longer plans to include Showcase content in the general search results. The conditions for participating in Google News Showcase are not intended to prevent publishers from enforcing their general ancillary copyright. Access to Google News Showcase is based on objective criteria. We rely on the assessment of the market players affected to ensure that the measures proposed by Google are effective. In view of the wide variety of interests the publishers may have we are thus conducting broader consultations in the sector.”</p>
<p>He further noted that the regulator is keeping a close eye on how Google negotiates with publishers over copyright fees, adding:<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> “Parallel to the Google News Showcase proceeding we are closely monitoring the negotiations on ancillary copyright fees.”</span></p>
<p>In yet another recent regulatory intervention triggered by publisher (and adtech) complaints, Google&#8217;s plan to deprecate support for third party tracking cookies and move to a suite of new ad targeting technologies (aka Privacy Sandbox) is under close supervision of the UK&#8217;s competition watchdog &#8212; and that process has also led Google to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">propose a series of commitments in order to be allowed to proceed</a>.</p>
<p>Separately last summer, France&#8217;s competition watchdog hit Google with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/france-fines-google-268m-for-adtech-abuses-and-gets-interoperability-commitments/">a $268M fine for self preferencing its adtech</a> &#8212; leading to yet another behavioral offer from the tech giant, in that case a set of interoperability commitments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s now 2022 and there are many, many apps out there that allow you to do cardio or build muscle by taking classes inside smartphone apps. We are all familiar with the success of platforms like Peloton (IPO’d), but there are of course new upstarts such as FiiT (raised £9M) or Fitplan (raised $9.9M). Plus there is <a href="http://Moxie.xyz">Moxie</a>, where coaches creator their own courses. What has not quite been cracked yet is the celebrity fitness class. <a href="http://Masterclass.com">Masterclass</a> has largely cornered the market in the higher-arts, but celebrity fitness is a relatively undiscovered country. Yes, of course, there have been individual celebrities who’d made their own fitness app &#8211; but these have limited appeal and amount to a side-hustle for the celeb.</p>
<p>Now a new startup &#8211; in beta since 2021 &#8211; hopes to become that platform where elite athletes can train mere mortals such as myself.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mastersapp.com">Masters</a> (see what they did there?) is an app that lets users train with some of the world’s most famous athletes and learn the tricks of their trade via 4-week-long, guided, on-demand, training programs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255587" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup has now closed a $2.7M Seed funding round led by Sweet Capital (the King.com founders fund) with participation from Mucker Capital, Goodwater Capital and Luxor Capital. In addition, a number of athletes also threw in some angel cash including Shaun White, Bam Adebayo, Kai Lenny and A’ja Wilson and professional tech angel investors including Anton Gauffin, Jakob Joenck, Henrik Kraft, Greg Tseng, Prerna Gupta, Hank Vigil, Janis Zech and Andreas Mihalovits.</p>
<p>The company has signed-up world-famous athletes such as  X Games &amp; 3x Olympic snowboarding champion, Shaun White; World &amp; 9x US champion in 3,000 meter steeplechase, Emma Coburn; Surfing world champion, Kai Lenny; Soccer superstar and Golden Ball winner, Ada Hegerberg; and 2x Wimbledon tennis champion, Petra Kvitova &#8211; among many others.</p>
<p>Greg Drach, CEO and co-founder of Masters said: “The future of learning is ‘learning from the best,’ and in that same vein the future of training is training with the best. If ten people can go to an in-person group exercise class led by a very good trainer, then why can’t 1,000 people, or 10,000 people take a virtual class led by an Olympic champion or NBA legend?… Our goal is to translate those winning methods into actionable programs that anyone can adopt.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256197" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256197" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gus_landscape.png" alt="Masters app" width="1024" height="512" class="size-full wp-image-2256197" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gus_landscape.png 1170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gus_landscape.png?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gus_landscape.png?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gus_landscape.png?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gus_landscape.png?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/gus_landscape.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2256197" class="wp-caption-text">Masters app</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Masters is live now as an iOS app, with each course being cohort-based, meaning that those participating are doing so alongside peers who are on the same journey. Each course is presented in high-quality video.</p>
<p>The startup was founded in 2021 by Greg Drach and Christian Dorffer &#8211; the founders of Midnight Runners, an urban running communities, along with Daniel Taschik, the former CTO/co-founder of Dubsmash, the video-sharing app which was acquired by Reddit in 2020 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/reddit-is-shutting-down-dubsmash-and-integrating-video-tools-into-its-own-app/">shut down by same last year</a>.</p>
<p>Riccardo Zacconi of Sweet Capital commented: “I always wanted to know what the best professional athletes do to reach the top. Like, what do they actually do when they go to the gym? Masters has managed to distill their routines into tangible programs that anyone can do, and they’ve struck a powerful chord with a lot of people.”</p>
<p>Capital from this round of funding will be deployed by Masters to sign new athletes, launch the Android app and improve the product.</p>
<p>Dorffer told me: “People love to follow their sports idols on TV, social media, print and audiobooks… Masters represents a brand new publishing format, we call it ‘interactive training documentaries’. We believe this premium educational format is the future and that traditional lean-back video formats will struggle to compete.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nuro showed off Wednesday one of the final pieces of its commercial autonomous delivery strategy.</p>
<p>The startup, which has raised more than $2.13 billion since former Google engineers Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/nuro-ec-1/">founded the company in June 2016</a>, unveiled a third-generation electric autonomous delivery vehicle designed for commercial operations and manufactured in partnership with BYD North America.</p>
<p>Nuro has dropped the alpha-numeric nomenclature (R1 and then R2) for this delivery bot that is designed to haul packages, not people. Instead, the vehicle is called &#8220;Nuro&#8221; — a self-titled album of sorts meant to introduce the robot to the masses and a name that illustrates where this flagship model sits within the company. If it&#8217;s not clear, the &#8220;Nuro&#8221; is at the top.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256487" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Nuro bot is not a sidewalk delivery bot. This new generation, and all of Nuro&#8217;s previous iterations, are meant for the road.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256493" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Nuro_Modular-Compartments-GIF.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256493" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2256493 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Nuro_Modular-Compartments-GIF.gif" alt="" width="1200" height="698" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2256493" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nuro</p></div></p>
<p>The new &#8220;Nuro&#8221; bot, which has twice the cargo volume of the previous model, customizable storage and temperature-controlled compartments to keep items warm or cool, is an automotive production-grade vehicle. This means the bot is designed and produced to handle the toils one might expect a delivery vehicle to endure, including weather, potholes, human abuse and long hours on the road.</p>
<p>The Nuro delivery bot also contains safety features, which are designed to protect people like pedestrians and cyclists who might encounter the vehicle. The vehicle is equipped with several types of sensors, including cameras, radar, lidar and thermal cameras to provide a 360-degree view that has built in redundancy in case one fails.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One notable item is an exterior airbag that will deploy if the vehicle were to come into contact with a person or other object.</p>

<h2>Bot history</h2>
<p>Initially, the company used modified Toyota Prius sedans for testing as well as for pilot grocery deliveries in Arizona and Texas.</p>
<p>The company transitioned in December 2018 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/31/nuros-self-driving-vehicle-is-a-grocery-getter-and-errand-runner/">to the R1</a>, its first step toward a vehicle designed exclusively for packages.</p>
<p>Its second-generation vehicle, called the R2, was introduced in February 2020. The R2, which was designed and assembled in the U.S. in partnership with Michigan-based Roush Enterprises, was equipped with lidar, radar and cameras to give the &#8220;driver&#8221; a 360-degree view of its surroundings.</p>
<p>However, it was missing a few features typically required by the U.S. Department of Transportation&#8217;s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. After three years of working with regulators, Nuro received a driverless exemption from NHTSA for its R2 vehicle. The exemption allows the vehicle to operate even though it doesn&#8217;t have side-view mirrors, a windshield and a rear-view camera that shuts off when driving forward.</p>
<p>Nuro has also received all of the necessary approvals and permits to operate an autonomous vehicle delivery service — that can charge customers — in California.</p>
<p>The new &#8220;Nuro&#8221; bot is the final step, at least for now, towards its commercial goals.</p>
<h2>Building bots in the desert</h2>
<p>The company, isn&#8217;t quite ready to unleash its Nuro en masse just yet. Although it&#8217;s getting close.</p>
<p>Nuro has raised an abundant amount of capital, piloted its vehicle with high-profile partners and grown to more than 1,200 employees.</p>
<p>In less than five years, the company has attracted high-profile private and institutional investors, including Greylock Partners, SoftBank Vision Fund and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. Its latest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/nuro-lands-investment-from-google-tiger-global-in-new-600-million-round/">$600 million fundraising round</a> announced just a few months ago was led by new investor Tiger Global Management and included Baillie Gifford, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, LLC, Gaorong Capital, Google, Kroger, SoftBank Vision Fund 1, funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. and Woven Capital.</p>
<p>Nuro has also landed several high-profile partners, including 7-Eleven, CVS pharmacies, Dominoes, FedEx, Kroger grocery stores and Walmart.</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s using some of that capital to build a new $40 million end-of-line manufacturing facility and closed-course test track in southern Nevada. The company is also taking over 74 acres of the Las Vegas Motor Speedway to build a closed-course testing facility that will allow the development and validation of its autonomous on-road vehicles. The testing track will measure bot performance in a broad range of scenarios, from avoiding pedestrians and pets to giving bicycles space on shared roadways, as well as environmental tests and vehicle systems validation, the company has previously said.</p>
<p>Its supplier partner BYD North America will assemble the hardware components of the new model; it will then be completed at Nuro&#8217;s new facility, where the bots will be readied for deployment.</p>
<p>&#8220;BYD attaches great importance to this collaboration with Nuro,&#8221; Stella Li, executive vice president of BYD Co. Ltd. and president of BYD Motors Inc, said in a statement. Li added that BYD will use the manufacturing capacity of its Lancaster facility to support Nuro and bring more jobs to California.</p>
<p>Nuro wouldn&#8217;t provide specific production capacity figures; the company says the facility has the capacity to manufacture and test &#8220;tens of thousands&#8221; of delivery vehicles per year. And it didn&#8217;t give a timeline except to say its Nevada facilities will be fully operational this year. Construction began at the site in November 2021.</p>
<p>Nuro didn&#8217;t say where these commercial-grade bots will be deployed first. The company did confirm that it has reached a formal agreement with existing partner Kroger to use the new Nuro delivery bots.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.eureka.security/">Eureka</a>, a Tel Aviv-based startup that provides enterprises with tools to manage security risks across their various data stores, today announced that it has raised an $8 million seed round led by <a href="https://www.ylventures.com/">YL Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Liat Hayun (CEO), a former VP of Product Management at Palo Alto Networks, and Asaf Weiss (CTO), who was formerly a Director of Engineering at Microsoft and Palo Alto Networks. During their time at these companies, they noticed the need for better cloud data security and management tools as businesses continued to amass more data spread across a wider range of clouds and services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Data is a valuable asset for helping businesses operate and compete. However, it has spiraled well beyond the feasible control and management of enterprise security leaders, leaving it exposed and at risk of leaks and loss as well as destruction and exfiltration by bad actors,&#8221; Hayun said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256649" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A lot of companies are only now realizing the magnitude of this problem, she noted, in part because they are still going through their transitions to the cloud and because sensitive data is often the last asset to make this move.</p>
<p>The idea behind Eureka then is to give these businesses insights into all the cloud data stores that are connected to their systems and help them manage access policies and discover configuration issues and policy violations. While many organizations have clear ideas about how they think about data protection, implementing those policies across different data stores, all with their own settings and capabilities, is often a challenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Security leaders are especially excited about Eureka’s policy translation engine,&#8221; Hayun explained. &#8220;The engine automatically translates data protection policies around privacy, risk, compliance and security into platform-specific controls that can be implemented into each cloud data store. It is currently very difficult to translate one into the other, especially as these translation results will vary across different data stores.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team tells me that it believes products from competitors like Imperva and IBM are mostly trying to apply an on-prem approach to a cloud native problem, while platform-specific solutions aren&#8217;t able to address the larger problem of managing access across data environments.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;By offering security leaders the operational powers they require without causing friction to business interests, Liat and Asaf are ushering in an entirely new kind of digital transformation in the coming years,&#8221; says John Brennan, Partner at YL Ventures. They’re enabling companies to leverage any cloud data store they wish while ensuring that security teams maintain full visibility and understanding into the organization’s entire cloud footprint and can easily evolve and manage policy whenever needed.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SeekOut, which aims to help enterprises hire from a more diverse talent pool, announced it has raised $115 million in a Series C round of funding led by Tiger Global Management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing values the Seattle-based startup at over $1.2 billion and brings its total raised to $189 million since its 2017 inception. It follows a year of 300% growth in revenue, bringing its annual recurring revenue (ARR) to the $25 million to $50 million range. For some context, SeekOut was valued at $500 million when it raised </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/seekout-raises-65m/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $65 million Series B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in March of 2021 &#8212; also led by Tiger Global.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A group of former Microsoft executives and engineers —  </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/anoop-gupta-b16d" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anoop Gupta</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/aravind-bala-f211" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Aravind Bala</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/john-tippett-4a54" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> John Tippett</span></a> and<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/vikas-manocha-7c7e" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Vikas Manocha</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — came up with the foundation of what would eventually become <a href="http://www.seekout.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SeekOut</a> in 2016 when they began building a messaging platform that provided a deep level of information about people that others might be emailing. When the quartet realized that what customers really were after was the information they were uncovering, and not so much the messaging capability, the company pivoted in 2017.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256547" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, SeekOut’s goal is to help talent acquisition teams recruit “hard-to-find and diverse talent.” It’s a problem faced by many companies, and increased demand for its offering is evidenced by the fact that over the last 11 months, SeekOut has grown its customer base from 500 to more than 1,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve seen very high retention and huge growth with existing customers,” said Gupta, the company’s co-founder and CEO. He declined to name names, but said that SeekOut is working with six of the 10 “most highly valued companies” by market cap in the U.S. Its customers hail from a range of industries, from technology to pharmaceutical to aerospace and defense to banking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last two years, we’ve seen a seismic shift in the world of work and how companies are engaging with employees,” Gupta told TechCrunch. “There is a lot at stake and how companies hire, retain, grow and develop their people will make a difference between companies surviving or thriving, or dying.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, SeekOut has built out a database with hundreds of millions of profiles using its AI-powered talent search engine and “deep interactive analytics.” It finds talent by scouring public data and using natural-language and machine-learning technologies to understand the expertise of each candidate to build a complete 360-degree view of each potential employee. Specifically, it blends info from public profiles, GitHub, papers and patents, employee referrals, company alumni and candidates in ATS systems.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While SeekOut initially focused strictly on technical talent, it has since broadened its base to helping recruiters and sources find more diverse candidates in general, as well as people with simply “hard-to-find” skill sets. And it claims to do it with “unprecedented speed and precision” via a blind hiring method designed to reduce bias by doing things like giving companies or individuals the ability to filter out things like an applicant’s name, photo or school attended. SeekOut then gives recruiters a way to engage with candidates instantly by getting access to the right contact information in a “single click.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gupta said SeekOut’s platform (dubbed Talent-360) helps companies not only find diverse talent, but helps them improve retention by finding the “right” candidate to begin with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today, enterprises are essentially flying blind when it comes to building and maintaining their workforces. The balance of power is shifting to the employees and the employees care about purpose, flexibility, compensation and their growth,” Gupta said. “And when not done right, it leads to employees walking with their feet and so the great resignation, the great reshuffle is becoming a big challenge.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s also a huge opportunity, the executive believes. And so perhaps it’s not a surprise that SeekOut is emphasizing efforts to help companies not just hire quality talent, but also retain it as part of a new talent optimization offering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a logical move for the company, which has demonstrated strength in talent acquisition.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256550" style="width: 2670px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256550" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2256550 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SeekOut-diversity-screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="2660" height="1800" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SeekOut-diversity-screenshot.jpg 2660w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SeekOut-diversity-screenshot.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SeekOut-diversity-screenshot.jpg?resize=300,203 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SeekOut-diversity-screenshot.jpg?resize=768,520 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SeekOut-diversity-screenshot.jpg?resize=680,460 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SeekOut-diversity-screenshot.jpg?resize=1536,1039 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SeekOut-diversity-screenshot.jpg?resize=2048,1386 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SeekOut-diversity-screenshot.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2660px) 100vw, 2660px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2256550" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> SeekOut</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How companies can develop their internal talent and what they can do, or how they broaden the aperture of hiring, becomes more important with remote and hybrid work and diversity becoming critical to hiring great talent,” Gupta said. “These are all becoming basically very fundamental things that enterprises need to do. To get ahead, given these seismic shifts in technology and innovation, companies can go from being leaders to laggards in a short time.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past year, SeekOut has seen its headcount tripled to about 120 and will likely triple again in 2022, according to Gupta. It is close to break-even in terms of cash flow, but Gupta says that the company’s “revenue growth has been so rapid” that it is supporting its investment growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its latest financing also included participation from Founders Circle Capital, and other existing backers including Madrona Venture Group and Mayfield. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founders Circle’s participation in particular was notable in that it led to SeekOut being able to support a secondary for its employees. Since Founders Circle was willing to buy common shares from employees, some were able to sell a small portion of their vested shares.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m really delighted that our employees are able to realize some of the benefits of their hard work and the success they have created for SeekOut,” Gupta said. “This is something we intentionally sought out to give to our employees.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his part, Tiger Global Partner John Curtius acknowledges that there is a clear shift in the way companies are thinking about hiring and retaining talent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“SeekOut is at the forefront of this change, delivering a best-in-class solution for talent optimization that enables businesses to hire, grow and retain their workforce like never before,” he said in a written statement. “We are excited to partner with them as they continue to reshape the industry and provide companies with data, insights, and actions that drive results.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, Gupta believes that talent recruitment and retention is no longer the problem of an HR department.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The right talent is key to success and that’s why this is becoming a CEO and board of directors Top of Mind issue rather than just something for HR leaders to worry about,” he said. “Data is everywhere in the enterprise, except where you need it most, which is informing the decisions about people you need and the people you have.”</span></p>
<p>In fact, SeekOut&#8217;s data-focused strategy was a big factor in attracting <span class="s1"><a href="https://www.madrona.com/team-profiles/s-somasegar/">S. Somasegar, Managing Director at Madrona</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Their deep technology approach of building the most comprehensive profile of people and a semantic search engine to enable hiring managers and recruiters to be able to clearly define what they are looking for in talent, and being able to generate the right pool of candidates to look from is both unique and highly effective in talent sourcing,&#8221; he wrote via email. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Payments company <a href="https://www.checkout.com">Checkout.com</a> isn’t just a unicorn —&nbsp;it has closed a $1 billion Series D founding round. Following today’s round, the company is now valued at $40 billion.</p>
<p>That’s a stark increase compared to last year’s valuation. With its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/checkout-com-raises-450-million-and-reaches-15-billion-valuation/">Series C round</a>, the company raised $450 million at a $15 billion valuation — it represents a 167% valuation jump in 12 months is not too bad.</p>
<p>Checkout.com is building a full-stack payments company — it acts as a gateway, an acquirer, a risk engine and a payment processor. The company lets you process payments directly on your site or in your app, but you can also rely on hosted payment pages, create payment links, etc.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256730" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It supports card payments, Apple Pay, Google Pay, PayPal, Alipay, bank transfers, SEPA direct debits and even cash payments through various local networks.</p>
<p>Last year, the company also added the ability to issue payouts. Checkout.com customers can send money to a bank account. It also supports payouts to a card on the Mastercard or Visa network. For instance, TikTok and MoneyGram have been using Checkout.com’s payouts feature.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, Checkout.com focuses specifically on large global enterprise merchants with a high volume of transactions. Some of the company’s clients include Netflix, Farfetch, Grab, NetEase, Pizza Hut and Shein. The company also contributes to the payments stack of several fintech unicorns such as Klarna, Qonto, Revolut and WorldRemit.</p>
<p>When it comes to today’s funding round, fasten your seatbelt as the list of investors is quite long. Investors who participated in the round include Altimeter, Dragoneer, Franklin Templeton, GIC, Insight Partners, the Qatar Investment Authority, Tiger Global, the Oxford Endowment Fund and “another large west coast mutual fund management firm,” the company writes in its announcement.</p>
<p>Some of the company’s existing investors are also participating, such as Blossom Capital, Coatue Management, DST Global, Endeavor Catalyst and Ribbit Capital.</p>
<p>Why did Checkout.com raise so much money? Because they can. The company says it has been profitable for several years, which means that investors are just adding money to the balance sheet for long-term growth. Checkout.com only had to hand out 2.5% of the company&#8217;s shares in exchange for $1 billion.</p>
<p>“By combining an elegant technology stack with industry expertise and an &#8216;extra-mile&#8217; approach to service over the past decade, we&#8217;ve built deep partnerships with some of the world’s most innovative companies,” founder and CEO Guillaume Pousaz said in a statement. “Our Series D is validation of that work—but given we’re still in ‘chapter zero’ of our journey, it will also fuel our efforts to unlock the enormous untapped opportunity ahead.”</p>
<p>The company processed hundreds of billions of dollars in payments in 2021 alone. It has tripled its transaction volume for the third year in a row and it now has 1,700 employees across 19 countries.</p>
<p>Up next, Checkout.com wants to focus specifically on the U.S. market. With its headquarter in London, the company originally focused on the EMEA region. And yet, as it tries to work with global enterprise merchants, having a solution that works across all markets could be a big selling point for future clients.</p>
<p>“Much like our approach in EMEA, we will maintain our focus on the enterprise — especially fintech, software, food delivery, travel, e-commerce and crypto merchants. We’re looking to help our U.S. customers grow domestically and internationally, and to help our non-US customers expand into the market here,” Checkout.com’s CFO Céline Dufétel said in a statement.</p>
<h2>The web3 opportunity</h2>
<p>With today’s funding round, Checkout.com will most certainly hire more people and sign new clients. But the company doesn’t plan to stand still as it wants to launch new products.</p>
<p>The ability to issue payouts has created new opportunities. In particular, Checkout.com plans to support marketplaces and payment facilitators later this year. It’ll be a full end-to-end solution with identity verification and the ability to split payments so that marketplace operators can keep a cut on each transaction.</p>
<p>Marketplace customers will also be able to hold funds directly on a marketplace thanks to a new treasury-as-a-service feature. It opens up a ton of possibility as marketplaces can embed financial services directly in their products.</p>
<p>Stripe announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/stripe-announces-embedded-business-banking-service-stripe-treasury/">Stripe Treasury</a> last year. Shopify has been using the feature for <a href="https://www.shopify.com/balance">Shopify Balance</a>. It proves once again that both Stripe and Checkout.com want to cover a bigger chunk of the payment chain.</p>
<p>In addition to new products, Checkout.com has realized that web3 represents a market opportunity. The company already powers some of the payments features of several cryptocurrency companies, such as Coinbase, Crypto.com, FTX, MoonPay and Novi from Meta.</p>
<p>But creating bridges between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies is just one part of the web3 equation. Checkout.com is also beta-testing a solution that could let its customers settle transactions for merchants using digital currencies. In other words, the Checkout.com of web3 could very well be Checkout.com</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many of us are moving around these days a lot less than we used to &#8212; because of Covid, we&#8217;re working from home instead of an office; and we are traveling and going out less. Now, as we shift back into more &#8220;normal&#8221; behavior, a startup that&#8217;s helping to better understand where and how we are getting around has picked up a significant round of funding. <a href="https://www.placer.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Placer.ai</a>, which has built a platform to track and understand footfall in a variety of venues, has raised $100 million, funding that it will be using to continue expanding its platform. Placer has confirmed that the round values it at $1 billion.</p>
<p>The round is coming from an interesting mix of strategic and financial investors. It&#8217;s being led by Josh Buckley, the CEO of Product Hunt; with participation from WndrCo (Disney/Dreamworks&#8217; supremo Jeffrey Katzenberg&#8217;s investment firm), Lachy Groom, MMC Technology Ventures LLC, Fifth Wall Ventures, and Array Ventures; and a swathe of real estate names including J.M. Schapiro (CEO of Continental Realty Corp), Eliot Bencuya and Jeff Karsh of Tryperion Partners, Daniel Klein of Klein Enterprises/Sundeck Capital, and Majestic Realty. This round is coming less than a year after Placer.ai&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/location-data-analytics-startup-placer-ai-raises-50m-series-b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series B of $50 million</a>.</p>
<p>Today, Placer has around 1,000 customers across real estate and property, retail, consumer packaged goods, and municipalities &#8212; some of the names include JLL, Regency Centers, Taubman, Planet Fitness, BJ’s Wholesale Club, and Grocery Outlet &#8212; which are using it to determine anonymized crowd movement, size and sentiment to help with their decision making and strategic planning.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256646" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The plan is to invest both in building out that user base further, and in the platform itself, by bringing in more physical and digital datasets &#8212; for example vehicle traffic, planned construction data, web traffic and purchase data to augment the 50+ data sets that it aggregates today &#8212; which in turn will lead to more use cases for Placer&#8217;s technology.</p>
<p>Given how much our movements have been curtailed in the last couple of years, it&#8217;s somewhat ironic that a company whose currency is physical presence in open places would be growing, much less raising money on the back of its potential. In actual fact, Noam Ben-Zvi, Placer&#8217;s CEO and co-founder, tells me that business has been stronger in recent years than ever before.</p>
<p>Growth has largely coming in two areas. First, people were still shopping, and going to other places, so existing customers were using it to figure out how, where and why people were moving around when they were (indeed Placer.ai created a <a href="https://www.placer.ai/the-square/recovery-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recovery dashboard</a> to track specifically around this idea and how it related to Covid-19). Over time, that core business has gotten smarter.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been around for five years working with early adopters giving us feedback,&#8221; Ben-Zvi said. &#8220;They pass us known information about their properties and we can use that to retrain and calibrate our models so they get more accurate.&#8221; A lot of this to date has been about historical data but now the company is shifting into providing more predictive insights as well, he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Second, the pandemic gave rise to a new set of reasons to need this kind of data, whether it was to determine crowds at testing or vaccination sites, or because the changing economy was precipitating real estate dealmaking, or something else. This meant new customers were, for example, using Placer&#8217;s tools for M&amp;A due diligence, or to help determine interesting opportunities for investment.</p>
<p>Interestingly, he notes that one salient point that Placer has determined is that even with the rise of virtual experiences, physical is not quite dead yet. &#8220;Everywhere the rebound is impressively fast,&#8221; he noted. This is in marked contrast to when the pandemic first descended on the world in early 2020. &#8220;When Covid hit we were concerned. We froze our hiring, and waited since some of our customers weren&#8217;t even opening anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>A lot of the data that Placer is able to pass on to customers &#8212; who essentially construct their own parameters for searching using a self-service tool &#8212; has traditionally been out of their reach despite their best efforts. Katzenberg&#8217;s previous work in the entertainment industry gave him first-hand experience of those black holes in consumer behavior and sentiment, which is one reason why he has gravitated to a company building technology to solve that now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Placer provides instant, simple and actionable insights to questions we&#8217;ve been asking as operators for over 30 years. The pace of innovation, the unique trust that the company has developed, and the massive market demand all point to the magnitude and scale of what this team can achieve,” said Katzenberg in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have long felt like the disruption Placer can bring is massive, but the market demand has far exceeded our initial expectations,&#8221; added Josh Buckley. “We see a powerful opportunity to continue partnering with Placer to improve the way decisions are made in the physical world, fundamentally improving the way these businesses and organizations operate.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.headspace.com/health">Headspace Health</a> has acquired <a href="https://www.sayana.app/">Sayana</a>, an AI-powered mental health and wellness company, for an undisclosed amount. Headspace Health says the acquisition of the San Francisco-based company will expand its ability to provide personalized self-care to its users. The acquisition comes as Headspace and Ginger <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/headspace-and-ginger-are-merging-to-form-headspace-health/">merged last year</a> to form Headspace Health, which is valued at $3 billion. The merger brought Ginger&#8217;s therapy and coaching offerings together with Headspace&#8217;s mindfulness and meditation services.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018 and backed by Y Combinator in 2020, Sayana leverages chat-based sessions with an AI persona that encourages users to track their moods. The app personalizes users&#8217; experiences based on their mood trends and suggests self-care and breathing exercises. The company&#8217;s sleep app helps users get restful sleep sessions based on their mood and sleep patterns.</p>
<p>Headspace Health CEO Russel Glass told TechCrunch in an interview that Sayana&#8217;s apps will continue to operate for a period of time while Headspace Health integrates their core capabilities into the Headspace and Ginger experience. Once the integration is complete, the company will turn off Sayana as a separate experience and move users over into Headspace Health.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256176" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Sayana created a unique, member-driven experience and as we think about the future of what we&#8217;re trying to do, it fits elegantly into the Headspace Health vision of a world where you can support the full continuum of care, regardless of where somebody is in the mental health continuum,&#8221; Glass said. &#8220;One of the things we&#8217;ve seen during the pandemic is just how many people continue to need support, so we have to keep focused on innovation. We have to ensure that we can automate parts of the mental health continuum and deliver personalized self-care content to people that have a need, and that&#8217;s where this acquisition is so exciting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Headspace Health is focused on creating an integrated experience to offer mental health help ranging from prevention to clinical care, all from one platform that is backed by AI and data science. With the addition of Sayana, Headspace Health plans to advance its capability to personalize experiences by offering help and services based on users&#8217; check-ins.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256209" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256209" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2256209" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sayana_sc_white.png" alt="" width="1024" height="610" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sayana_sc_white.png 6016w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sayana_sc_white.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sayana_sc_white.png?resize=300,179 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sayana_sc_white.png?resize=768,458 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sayana_sc_white.png?resize=680,405 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sayana_sc_white.png?resize=1536,915 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sayana_sc_white.png?resize=2048,1220 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sayana_sc_white.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2256209" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Headspace Health</p></div></p>
<p>Glass stated that Headspace and Ginger are already leveraging AI to support their team of behavioral health coaches, therapists and psychiatrists to ensure quality interactions with users, comprehensive tracking of services and close collaboration among care providers. He outlined that adding Sayana&#8217;s capability to understand a user&#8217;s needs in a completely automated way via a robust chatbot experience will destigmatize experiences and offer more personalized and effective care.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of the acquisition, Sayana founder and CEO Sergey Fayfer is joining Headspace Health and is taking on a product leadership role within the company.</p>
<p>“Since our inception, we’ve been on a mission at Sayana to put accessible self-care in everyone’s pocket,” Fayfer said in a statement. “We’re thrilled to bring together our technology, engineering and design expertise to help advance Headspace Health’s efforts to democratize high-quality, affordable mental healthcare around the world.”</p>
<p>In terms of the future, Glass says Headspace Health plans to continue to expand to meet the growing needs of care for mental health. The company&#8217;s goal is to be the most accessible and comprehensive platform by reducing the cost of care as much as possible. He outlined that Headspace Health will continue to innovate to ensure that it can reduce the cost of care, while keeping the quality of care as high as possible. Glass noted that this is going to require Headspace Health to be aggressive in terms of how it thinks about both inorganic growth strategies and organic growth strategies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue to focus on the employer landscape. You&#8217;ll see us continuing to announce new health plan and provider partnerships, there will be a number of those in the coming months,&#8221; Glass said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll continue to focus on youth as an expansion area for us. You&#8217;ll continue to see us innovate. We&#8217;re spending a lot on research and development and will continue to be acquisitive as we see opportunities to add platforms like Sayana to our platform over time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kolonas said the new interest in investment is driven by the country’s high rates of smartphone penetration and savings per capita. “Because of this, there are millions of potential first-time investors just starting to establish money management habits and practices that were previously impossible where they live. Until very recently, most of the asset classes that can be accessed through Pluang were only available to the privileged and wealthy while most others were faced with low financial literacy and very limited investing options.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Like many other investment apps in Indonesia, Pluang includes financial literacy features, which Kolonas said it is “laser-focused on” improving. The new funding will enable Pluang to “provide the tools, resources and education necessary to set our users up for long-term wealth creation.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">In a statement to TechCrunch, Accel partner Ethan Choi said Pluang is Accel’s fourth investment in consumer-focused investment apps globally, after the United States’ <span class="s1">Public.com</span>, Europe’s Trade Republic and Latin America’s Flink. “We were looking for the leader in Southeast Asia,” he said, adding that “after meeting Claudia and Richard [Chua, Pluang’s other co-founder and co-CEO], we were deeply impressed by the traction they have achieved on minimal capital and the fact that they were the only player that had the licenses and product to offer multiple asset classes including equities, indexes, and crypto &#8211; which we believe is critical to building a big business in the region.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ecommerce Brands aims to differentiate itself from the crowded aggregator space by being the technology force for DTC brands to scale while operators focus on running their businesses.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.ecommercebrands.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ecommerce Brands</a> is one of the newest consumer brand aggregators to emerge in a crowded space and aims to integrate with Cart.com to support the backend needs of brands as they scale.</p>
<p>The Atlanta-based company officially kicked off in September 2021, helmed by founder and CEO Mark Bickenbach, who previously served as a business unit president of The Home Depot and CFO of its website, and board chairman Jim Jacobsen, former CEO of RTIC Outdoors and co-founder of Cart.com.</p>
<p>Today, it announced a $40 million investment, with $10 million in equity led by Bearing Ventures, and $30 million in debt.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256389" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2256392" style="width: 496px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256392" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2256392" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5018.jpg?w=486" alt="Mark Bickenbach, Ecommerce Brands" width="486" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5018.jpg 1654w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5018.jpg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5018.jpg?resize=214,300 214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5018.jpg?resize=768,1075 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5018.jpg?resize=486,680 486w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5018.jpg?resize=1097,1536 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5018.jpg?resize=1463,2048 1463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_5018.jpg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2256392" class="wp-caption-text">Mark Bickenbach, founder and CEO of Ecommerce Brands. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ecommerce Brands</p></div></p>
<p>Cart.com, a Houston-based company providing end-to-end e-commerce services, brought in its own funding round, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/e-commerce-as-a-service-platform-cart-com-picks-up-98m-to-give-brands-scaling-tools/">$98 million Series B</a> last August for its software, services and infrastructure for businesses to scale online.</p>
<p>Bickenbach told TechCrunch that Ecommerce Brands plans to acquire direct-to-consumer brands, integrate them on Cart.com and grow them in revenue and profitability, something that previously would have only been done on marketplaces.</p>
<p>“Direct-to-consumer brands are limited in a number of ways, including scaling their operations and technology,” he said. “They run on thinner margins and focus on a single channel, so if you are trying to cover the fixed costs of business, putting money across channels is hard to do. That is where we see the opportunity to take a business, add the technology and let the operators deal with running a business.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He believes that is what differentiates his company from the e-commerce aggregators acquiring successful brands from the likes of Amazon and Shopify.</p>
<p>Overall, e-commerce aggregators have gained traction across the world in the past few years, with successful companies securing billions of venture-backed capital in recent years. Most recently we saw Merama in Latin America become a unicorn after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/e-commerce-aggregator-merama-gets-its-horn-after-just-12-months-in-business/">raising $60 million</a>, while Beijing-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/chinese-amazon-aggregator-nebula-brands-raises-50m-led-by-l-catterton/">Nebula Brands took in $50 million</a>.</p>
<p>Before them was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/gravitiq-throws-its-hat-into-crowded-e-commerce-aggregator-ring/">Gravitiq</a>, focused on healthcare brands, and Heyday’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/heyday-raises-555m-to-buy-up-and-scale-more-d2c-brands-on-the-amazon-marketplace-universe/">$555 million Series C</a>. The big name in aggregators, Thrasio, announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/thrasio-the-amazon-aggregator-raises-1b-in-fresh-funding-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-10-billion/">$1 billion in October</a>, while Perch grabbed a large investment of <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/softbanks-vision-fund-2-leads-775m-investment-in-perch-sets-new-record-for-fastest-company-to-achieve-profitable-unicorn-status-in-the-us-301299324.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$775 million</a> in May.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the new funding will be used to acquire the businesses and get them moving on Cart.com for their back-end operations. Ecommerce Brands also will be building out its own tools to manage growth and operations, while also doing some hiring in the area of supply chain. Bickenbach expects those new tools to be ready by March.</p>
<p>Ecommerce Brands has since acquired five brands, together with annual gross sales of more than $150 million. It is mainly looking at businesses that are EBITDA positive.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company’s technology transforms huge volumes of IT data into actionable insight and automates incident management so IT operations teams can be proactive about their response processes.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">AIOps leader <a href="http://bigpanda.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BigPanda</a> is now valued at $1.2 billion following a new Series D round of $190 million led by Advent International.</p>
<p>Joining Advent in the round are Insight Partners and other existing investors. The latest round gives the company $317 million in total funding, according to Crunchbase data.</p>
<p>Assaf Resnick, BigPanda co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch the company is cementing its leadership in AIOps event correlation and automation. The company’s technology transforms huge volumes of IT data into actionable insight and automates incident management so IT operations teams can be proactive about their response processes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256488" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s been a while since we checked in on BigPanda — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/27/bigpanda-wants-to-bring-order-to-it-alerts-madness/">nearly eight years to be exact,</a> and much has changed since the company came out of stealth in 2014.</p>
<p>Thanks in part to the global pandemic, the digital transformation has penetrated every part of our life, Resnick said. More people trust automated workflow now, including for IT operations. However, people are now in charge of 80% of keeping a business running, but with all of the data flowing, it is nearly impossible to keep up, he added.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CvPWRWTsJx"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/27/bigpanda-wants-to-bring-order-to-it-alerts-madness/">BigPanda Wants To Bring Order To IT Alerts Madness</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;BigPanda Wants To Bring Order To IT Alerts Madness&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/27/bigpanda-wants-to-bring-order-to-it-alerts-madness/embed/#?secret=CvPWRWTsJx" data-secret="CvPWRWTsJx" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Recognizing that pace of innovation and how companies were spending more of their mission critical resources on putting out fires, Big Panda decided to go after additional funding to meet that demand. The company was finishing up its third quarter, which Resnick said was strong, and looking at the fourth quarter when it was decided to go for additional funding.</p>
<p>“The pipeline and market were accelerating beyond what we initially thought,” he added. “When looking at the total available market, we realized our customers were 1% of the market, and with current digital transformation being faster than two years ago, we didn’t have enough people to keep up with the data.”</p>
<p>At the same time, BigPanda was at the beginning of a relationship with Advent, and it made sense to take on the $190 million, which Resnick said “lets us hit the gas on our go-to-market acceleration.”</p>
<p>Even before the new round, the company was seeing good traction in the market. Its 2021 sales grew by 155%, while the fourth quarter set a record for number of new customers added in a single quarter with nearly two times the growth since 2019. BigPanda not only grew its footprint with existing customers last year, but also saw a five-time year-over-year increase in deals valued at over $1 million. Its team also doubled over the past two years.</p>
<p>Much of the company’s current go-to-market strategy is concentrated in North America, but the new funding will provide an outlet for a more international focus, he said. The company already has an office in London and will be investing more there as it also targets mid-market companies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding will also go toward increasing the size of its machine learning, product and R&amp;D teams, while also giving it some capital for strategic acquisition opportunities.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, Advent partner Eric Noeth will join BigPanda’s board of directors while former VMware chief operating officer Sanjay Poonen joins as a strategic advisor.</p>
<p>Noeth said that in talks with other investors and companies in the space, BigPanda’s name kept rising to the surface, especially as more companies leveraged technology, but did not have the manpower to manage all of the data events coming through.</p>
<p>“It is remarkable to find a company with such adoration from a group of competitors and customers,” he added. “AIOps is having a watershed moment. COVID changed technology so much, but now you have a massive tailwind around digital, and that is still in early innings. Most impressive is the cross sectors of customers that all have the same problem of automating and mediating issues quickly. That tangible use case has been a powerful driver for BigPanda.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Resnick and Noeth both say that the scarcity of talent problem is also hitting company chief information officers, whose job, they say, is shifting to be more like a chief technology officer while also retaining the task of keeping the lights on without getting in the way of innovation and velocity.</p>
<p>“Data is growing exponentially, even if there was not a scarcity of talent, it wouldn&#8217;t make sense to invest more money and talent there,” Resnick added. “You have to turn to automation.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning, <a href="https://public.com/">Public</a>, an investment app for the American market, announced the appointment of two new board members. The startup also provided some details regarding its growth in the COVID era, a period that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/fintechs-savings-and-investing-boom-isnt-just-a-domestic-affair/">generated strong results</a> for a number of services that allowed users to save and invest.</p>
<p>Public has added <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeneal/">Jessica Neal</a>, former chief talent officer at Netflix and present-day venture partner at TCV to its board, along with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisbrummerlaw">Dr. Christopher J. Brummer</a>, a professor at Georgetown, member of the Fannie Mae board of directors, and adviser to Paradigm, a firm that invests in crypto-focused companies. (Paradigm recently <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-securities-to-receive-first-outside-investment-11641905101?mod=djemalertNEWS">made the news</a> for taking part in a deal with Sequoia to invest in trading firm Citadel Securities.)</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with Public co-CEOs Leif Abraham and Jannick Malling about the board additions. Broadly, the two appointments align with Abraham&#8217;s view of what his company focused on last year, namely scaling its business operations and its human capital. Neal fits neatly on the human side of that work, while Brummer&#8217;s <a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/chris-brummer/">work on fintech and crypto regulatory matters</a> slots him into the operational side of Public&#8217;s business.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256384" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>The savings and investing boom</h2>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/17/saving-not-spending-is-the-new-hotness-in-fintech/">spilled much ink</a> covering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/08/fintechs-uneven-new-reality-has-helped-some-startups-harmed-others/">the 2020 and 2021 savings and investing boom</a>. Citizens of many countries turned to equities and crypto trading and investing services in droves as global savings rates rose, and the markets proved more volatile than in previous years.</p>
<p>The trend was most commonly viewed through the lenses provided by Coinbase and Robinhood. Both went public in 2021, giving the market insight into their economics, and how broad consumer demand is for crypto and equity investing and trading products. (Public has supported equities and crypto assets <a href="https://medium.com/the-public-blog/introducing-crypto-on-public-211fe0b2dfab">since last October</a>.)</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As investing apps boom, Public doubles down on its social focus&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/as-investing-apps-boom-public-doubles-down-on-its-social-focus/embed/#?secret=82ZN4ki3Gj" data-secret="82ZN4ki3Gj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Public rode the same wave of consumer demand for financial management products and services, raising a mountain of capital in quick order. For example, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/social-stock-trading-services-public-raises-65m-series-c/">announced its $65 million Series C in December 2020</a>, only to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/as-expected-stock-trading-service-public-raises-220m-at-unicorn-valuation/">raise $220 million more in February 2021</a>. Suddenly worth more than $1 billion, the new unicorn earned its place in our mental landscape for companies to track in the consumer fintech market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other firms mirrored Public&#8217;s rapid-fire fundraising cadence. Chicago-based M1 Finance is a good example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/m1-finance-closes-45m-series-c-mere-months-after-it-raised-its-33m-series-b/">having raised</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/m1-finance-raises-another-rapid-fire-round-after-scaling-its-aum-to-more-than-3-5b/">successive rounds</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/m1-finance-raises-150m-in-softbank-led-series-e-boosts-valuation-to-1-45b/">last year</a> as its assets under management, or AUM, scaled rapidly.</p>
<p>But while M1 was willing to share AUM numbers as it grew, and the fact that it was targeting a roughly 1% revenue result for each dollar it helped manage, Public is still conservative regarding what it will share on the growth front.</p>
<p>The company did disclose that it saw &#8220;funded accounts&#8221; grow by 700% last year. But on the revenue front its CEOs were more coy, saying in a statement that their goals this year include &#8220;expanding [their] platform’s capabilities,&#8221; in ways that will include &#8220;new areas of monetization.&#8221;</p>
<p>That Public is being more quiet about revenue than user growth is not a huge surprise. Recall that Public <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/trading-app-public-drops-payment-for-order-flow-in-favor-of-tips/">made the choice to stop collecting payment for order flow</a> (PFOF) revenue last year, setting up a clear contrast to Robinhood&#8217;s largest top-line generator. The company at the time said that it would instead accept tips from its users.</p>
<p>Public&#8217;s strong fundraising history gave it the room to avoid a monetization focus last year, but 2022 will likely become a proving ground for the company to build out its revenue model. In conversation with TechCrunch, Abraham and Malling were clear that they were content with their choice to not collect PFOF incomes. Why? In their view, transactional revenue streams are inherently volatile, and as they want to position Public as more of an investing application than a trading platform, collecting incomes based on the pace at which users bought and sold securities was a bit counter to their ethos.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="seZLmbAwgB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/crypto-volatility-continues-to-flummox-wall-street/">Crypto volatility continues to flummox Wall Street</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Crypto volatility continues to flummox Wall Street&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/crypto-volatility-continues-to-flummox-wall-street/embed/#?secret=seZLmbAwgB" data-secret="seZLmbAwgB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Still, the company is a business, and one with material aspirations. The two CEOs are bullish on the scale of their market &#8212; that Public has a big TAM, to use venture-speak &#8212; implying that their choice to focus on building out community features and scaling their company&#8217;s technology will bear fruit as the company onboards more users.</p>
<p>On that front, one of the more interesting facts regarding Public is its customer acquisition is about half organic. And the company said that it wasn&#8217;t seeing its customer acquisition costs rise as it grew. That fact grants credence to the idea that there are still Americans in the market for an investing and trading home.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked how horizontal the company will go, given that many fintech products with a consumer focus wind up working to become financial super apps. Public&#8217;s leaders said that they don&#8217;t want to build a bank.</p>
<p>So Public is sticking to its guns, focusing on building a community-focused investing service. Let&#8217;s see how it works to grow its revenue per user this year now that it has attracted an audience of users at scale.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Wordle stands out in a world of in-app purchases and loot boxes because it&#8217;s free to play, has no advertising at all, and most importantly, <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/">is played on a simple website</a>, rather than requiring an app to be downloaded from Apple&#8217;s App Store or Google Play.</p>
<p>The choice to make Wordle a web app, rather than something downloaded from a store makes sense, given that it was developed as a passion project rather than by a business, and it&#8217;s a simple, fun game that isn&#8217;t really designed to make money.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A side effect of that choice, however, is that Wordle is suddenly being ripped off in app stores by other developers who smell a quick way to make money off of unsuspecting users that either don&#8217;t care or don&#8217;t know any better.</p>
<p>Part of Wordle&#8217;s charm is that the posts of colorful squares you see everywhere don&#8217;t really feel like advertising; there&#8217;s no link back to the game or cheesy copy trying to convince you to install it: you&#8217;re on your own to find it via a quick Google search.</p>
<p>As a result, the average iPhone or Android owner is likely to assume Wordle is an app and head right to their respective app store to find it—which is exactly what I did when I first discovered it, only to find a dead end when I started playing a month ago before realizing I should just Google it.</p>
<p>Now, however, opportunistic developers have smelled this and are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878752/wordle-app-store-review-copies-advertisements-in-app-purchase">creating almost exact clones of Wordle</a> in order to generate money where Wardle has eschewed doing so. One developer, <a href="https://twitter.com/zachshakked">Zach Shakked</a>, cloned the game in its entirety down to the exact game play and user interface, called it Wordle, and uploaded it to Apple&#8217;s App Store, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/wordle-the-app/id1604016922">charging $30-per-year to play a game that was intended to be free</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Shakked <a href="https://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/1480990948972658689">bragged on Twitter</a> about how many users he was converting to paid customers as well as running ads against the search term &#8220;Wordle&#8221; on the App Store. After widespread backlash, however, Shakked removed the game from sale, and late on Tuesday<a href="https://twitter.com/zachshakked/status/1481129425706143746"> published a lengthy apology and partial justification</a> for his actions via Twitter.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In the past, we&#8217;ve seen cloning behavior like this play out on app stores with viral games like </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://venturebeat.com/2014/03/30/threes-vs-2048-when-rip-offs-do-better-than-the-original-game/">Threes</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> and </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/16/5416774/apple-and-google-fighting-flappy-bird-clones">Flappy Bird</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, both of which were cloned by developers and rejigged </span><em style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">slightly </em><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">with extra fees or advertising on top in the hope of fooling a few users and making a quick buck.</span></p>
<p>Wordle is facing a threat we haven&#8217;t seen play out yet: the game&#8217;s developer is essentially being punished by app stores for choosing to build using open web technologies, rather than a native app. Not only is this type of behavior allowed by the Apple App Store, there&#8217;s little recourse—because as far as Apple is concerned, Wordle doesn&#8217;t exist, given it wasn&#8217;t built a native app.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way for a developer of a fully functional, capable web app like Wordle to claim their name in the App Store, nor is there a way for them to list their website to get users to the right place and defend themselves from copycats. Google actually does allow developers to <a href="https://chromeos.dev/en/publish/pwa-in-play">upload some kinds of progressive web apps to the Play Store</a>, though at time of writing Wardle doesn&#8217;t appear to have chosen to do this. If he wanted to defend his game on the Play Store when a clone does appear there, he&#8217;d at least have a choice to do so.</p>
<p>It <em>could </em>be argued that Wardle didn&#8217;t trademark Wordle—let alone invent the actual gameplay given that it&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/jherskowitz/status/1481015729944252418">based on a 70&#8217;s gameshow</a>—but that isn&#8217;t the point: because Wordle is a web-based, it&#8217;ll continually open itself up to clones until Wardle develops an official app.</p>
<p>Apple has a longstanding history of intentionally ignoring or degrading open web technologies that could compete with its incredibly successful, lucrative, closed app store. Progressive web apps (PWA), a set of standards that allow websites to function similarly to native apps, are only half-heartedly supported, broken, or plain ignored on iOS and iPadOS.</p>
<p>Web push, a standard that allows websites to send push notifications to users, <a href="https://caniuse.com/push-api">has been ignored by Apple for years with no explanation</a> despite support in almost every competing browser, including the desktop version of Safari. When Apple doesn&#8217;t ignore standards that would allow web apps to compete on an even playing field, it can intentionally delay them for years, <a href="https://infrequently.org/2021/04/progress-delayed/">a practice documented in this long, exhausting list by Alex Russell, an engineer at Google</a>.</p>
<p>The inability to claim a name and link to a website, rather than build a native app, is by design for this reason: Apple doesn&#8217;t want users to go to the web. Instead, the company intentionally harms the open web for its own gain to the detriment of users of its own App Store who might be tricked into paying for something that could be free, if only they&#8217;d searched the web instead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Web3 is seen as the future of the internet because it allows people to control their own data and digital assets, but crypto developers have been learning from the past when it comes to onboarding new users.</p>
<p>The current state of crypto onboarding is unwieldy and unnecessarily prolonged due to the seed phrase, a series of words created by the crypto wallet to regain access. On a technical level, seed phrases have contributed to the loss of nearly 20% of all bitcoins in circulation, roughly equivalent to the GDP of Hungary, according to Singapore-based crypto infra startup <a href="https://web3auth.io/">Web3Auth</a>, formerly known as <a href="https://tor.us/index.html">Torus</a>. The lengthy passwords that users are asked to store in a safe place can be a significant barrier to entry for non-technical users who are used to simple “forgot password?” workflows on nearly every traditional internet platform. There have also been security issues when it comes to platforms holding control of a user’s private keys.</p>
<p>Web3Auth, a non-custodial key infrastructure solution for Web3 apps and wallets, wants to solve these problems by leveraging social accounts and devices that mainstream users already own to enable users to manage their keys intuitively.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254392" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Users use keys as accounts to trade, hold assets, or just interact with blockchains, so control and security of those keys are important,” chief executive officer and co-founder Zhen Yu Young told TechCrunch. “Non-custodial wallets help you manage your key, spanning from solutions as simple as writing a phrase on a paper to more secure methods.”</p>
<p>Web3Auth is powered by the Torus Network, an open-source, non-custodial, distributed key management network. Web3Auth builds on this infrastructure to make Web3 authentication — including password-less auth, SMS auth, or other OAuth methods like Google, Twitter, Discord and Reddit – in apps and wallets simple and intuitive to use.</p>
<p><a href="http://web3auth.io/">Web3Auth</a> announced today it has closed a $13 million Series A led by <a href="https://india.sequoiacap.com/">Sequoia Capital India.</a> This round included participation from <a href="https://www.usv.com/">Union Square Ventures</a>, <a href="https://multicoin.capital/">Multicoin Capital</a>, <a href="https://ftx.com/">FTX</a>, Bitcoin.com, <a href="https://darma.capital/">DARMA Capital</a>, <a href="https://chainstry.com/">Chainstry</a>, <a href="https://www.hashed.com/">Hashed</a>, <a href="https://www.kosmos.vc/">KOSMOS Capital</a>, Kyros Ventures, LD Capital, Minted Labs, P2P Capital, Phoenix VC, Staking Facilities, YBB Capital, Moonwhale Ventures and Decentralab.</p>
<p>The fresh capital brings its total raised to $15 million since its inception in 2019. It will accelerate expansion into decentralized gaming, NFTs, and social applications and advance its mission to eliminate seed phrases and make blockchain authentication decentralized and accessible to all with the Series A funding. The company also plans to increase its headcount, Young told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Web3Auth’s authentication infrastructure is designed to make it easy for developers to build familiar login flows such as single sign-on with Google and Twitter, eliminating the need for users to directly interface with vulnerable public-private key pairs. It is also designed to give more advanced users the ability to connect the wallet or key management system.</p>
<p>“We designed Web3Auth to bypass the UX obstacles holding back mainstream crypto adoption. True to our focus on accessibility, we wanted Web3Auth to meet users wherever they are. Intuitive and familiar login flows are needed if we want to onboard the next wave of mainstream users into crypto,” said Young. “We’re encouraged that some of the best investors in the world care deeply about usability and accessibility in crypto. We’re extremely grateful for their support, and we’re going to use it to catapult Web3 into the future.”</p>
<p>In 2021, more than 300 applications and wallets selected Web3Auth to secure over four million users’ private keys. Its users have increased 30 times since the same time last year, Young noted.</p>
<p>“Our main users are Web3 wallets and applications. Many popular wallets in the ecosystems, such as Binance Extension, Kepler, Kukai, Skyweaver and Kash, are powered by Web3Auth”  in their core flows to boost conversion rates, reduce loss and support tickets, Young told TechCrunch. “On the application side, the NFT and gaming applications utilizing Web3Auth that are particularly popular include Skyweaver, Rarible MyCryptoHeros, and others.”</p>
<p>Young pointed out similar platforms like <a href="https://magic.link/">Magic Link</a>, which provides key management through a different infrastructure like AWS Cloud HSM to store user keys, and <a href="https://www.fireblocks.com/">Fireblock</a>’s underlying infrastructure that utilizes multi-party computation (MPC)/threshold cryptography. They’re, however, more enterprise and internal-facing authentication relative to the Torus platform being more external, Young said, adding that a similar analogy could be Okta and Auth0 in the web 2.0 authentication space.</p>
<p>“We think that the non-custodial nature of Web3, which allows users to control their own data and destiny, is a huge step forward in bringing power back to the users. This makes the data more portable and safer while continuing to enable existing login product features, giving users the best both worlds. Sequoia Capital India is excited to partner with a team and a product that is concentrating on making crypto more accessible not by adding more bells and whistles but by addressing a long-standing problem at its most fundamental level,” Anandamoy Roychowdhary, principal of Sequoia India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lime is finally making good on its promise to deliver its Gen4 e-bike to the streets after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/28/lime-unveils-new-ebike-as-part-of-50-million-investment-to-expand-to-more-25-cities/">first announcing plans to introduce the new hardware last March</a>. The new bikes will have a swappable battery that&#8217;s interchangeable with Lime&#8217;s latest generation of e-scooters.</p>
<p>The micromobility operator launched Wednesday 250 of its new bikes in Washington, D.C., where it plans to gradually replace the full fleet of 2,500 e-bikes by April, according Russell Murphy, senior director of corporate communications. Lime will continue to launch in cities globally, swapping out older generations for the new model in each city over the next year.</p>
<p>This move is part of a $50 million investment the company has directed towards the development the new e-bike and its expansion to another 25 cities in North American, Europe, Australia and New Zealand.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2255824" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The last generation of Lime e-bikes can be found in 50 markets globally, including London, Seattle, Paris, Denver and <a href="https://www.live5news.com/2022/01/11/bike-share-industry-giant-coming-charleston/">soon Charleston, South Carolina</a>. Lime had initially aimed to launch the Gen4 e-bike in the summer of 2021, but had to delay save for a few pilots last autumn due to supply chain issues, said Murphy.</p>
<p>The swappable battery is the most notable feature of Lime&#8217;s new green-and-white bike, which matches the appearance of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/lime-plans-for-modes-beyond-bikes-and-scooters-in-2021/">Lime&#8217;s latest Gen4 scooter.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;This is a potential leap forward for the industry,&#8221; Murphy told TechCrunch. &#8220;If you have one battery between vehicle types, you can operate a more streamlined multimodal fleet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lime expects the battery upgrade to lead to improved unit economics. Since vehicles won&#8217;t have to be taken in to charge, there will be fewer operational tasks, which tend to be one of the highest costs associated with running a shared micromobility business. At the same time, by only needing to swap out the battery, there will be more vehicles on the street for longer, providing better reliability to riders and a higher potential for earning revenue, said Murphy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It will also mean one team can do every charge task instead of having one charge team for bikes and one for scooters,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The new e-bike will also have an improved motor that will help riders climb hills more easily, a phone holder that charges smartphones, a new handlebar display that matches that of the Gen4 scooter and an automatic two-speed transmission that allows for a smoother start, rather than having to pedal a bit to get the motor going.</p>
<p>Lime&#8217;s plans to continue scaling its e-bikes are in line with the company&#8217;s stated goals to refresh a significant portion of its fleet, move into more cities and develop new technologies to win additional city requests for proposal. In November, the micromobility giant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/lime-raises-523-million-as-it-prepares-to-go-public/">closed a $523 million raise in convertible debt and term loan financing</a>, which is potentially the company&#8217;s last funding round before it plans to go public this year.</p>
<p>As Lime preps itself for public markets, it&#8217;s working on strengthening its considerable hold on the industry by becoming more operationally efficient and getting its hardware on point, and the introduction of this upgraded e-bike reinforces that. Meanwhile, as Lime tries to scoop up every permit it can get its hands on, competitor Spin, which is owned by Ford, shared plans last week to <a href="https://www.spin.app/blog-posts/spin-forwardhttps://www.spin.app/blog-posts/spin-forward">lay off a quarter of its staff</a> as part of its restructuring process to exit open permit markets. Spin is now winding down operations in a few U.S. markets, all markets in Germany and Portugal and could shut down in Spain as early as February.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SME-focused business travel booking platform, <a href="https://www.travelperk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TravelPerk</a>, has topped up the $160 million in equity and debt it raised last <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/travelperk-raises-160m-in-equity-and-debt-after-a-year-of-derailed-business-trips/">in a Series D last April </a>with an additional $115M &#8212; closing out the round at $275M.</p>
<p>TravelPerk said its business is now being valued at $1.3BN &#8212; meaning it&#8217;s achieved coveted &#8216;unicorn&#8217; status.</p>
<p>In total, it has raised $409M since being founded back in 2015.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256643" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company declined to disclose a valuation when it took in the earlier slice of equity and debt last year so the Barcelona-based startup is sounding more confident going into 2022 vs Spring 2021.</p>
<p>That said, it&#8217;s not clear how much of the $115M tranche is equity vs debt &#8212; a spokeswoman for the startup declined to provide a break down or a clear answer when we asked, saying only: &#8220;This round is a mix of equity and debt funding.&#8221;</p>
<p>The final tranche of the D round was led by US VC firm General Catalyst, a new investor in the business, along with existing backer Kinnevik.</p>
<p>Another investor in this slice of the Series D, Gillian Tans, ex-chairwoman and CEO of Booking.com &#8212; who is investing in a  personal capacity &#8212; is joining the board of directors alongside Joel Cutler, an early investor in Stripe, Airbnb, and Kayak.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Tans said: “I have been working in the travel industry for many years, and TravelPerk is the one company that never ceases to surprise me. It has solidified its leadership position over the last two years in challenging times for the travel industry, emerging stronger than ever. They are innovative and have been able to anticipate and address their customers’ changing needs through major acquisitions, new market entries, and product designs. I’m honored to be joining as an investor and the Board of Directors at TravelPerk and to help the company reach a global leadership position.”</p>
<p>General Catalyst MD Joel Cutler added in another supporting statement: “Hybrid and remote working is undoubtedly here to stay but a Zoom call will never be able to replicate the benefits of in-person, face-to-face interaction. We have no doubt that business travel will continue to grow and thrive in the years ahead, with TravelPerk as the clear leader in the space, and we’re thrilled to be participating in this funding round.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly been a tough couple of years for the travel sector generally &#8212; and for work trips in particular &#8212; given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which has led to scores of conference cancelations and accelerated tools and tech around virtual meetings, which offer a low friction, low cost alternative to business travel for physical meetings.</p>
<p>In person industry events did start to pick up again last year &#8212; with major tech conferences such as the GSMA&#8217;s Mobile World Congress, Web Summit and CES (earlier this year) taking place in some capacity &#8212; but it&#8217;s typically been with vastly reduced attendance vs pre-pandemic years.</p>
<p>Streaming continues to be a popular choice for workers and employers to avoid the risk and hassle associated with pandemic era business travel.</p>

<p>Despite obvious demand-side challenges for business travel, TravelPerk has continued to present a bullish front throughout this period &#8212; operating a no layoffs policy and splashing out on a number of acquisitions aimed at tooling up for COVID-19-triggered changes to how people are travelling for work.</p>
<p>It has also managed to tap investors to continue backing its platform as it reconfigures its feature mix to support changing business travel needs.</p>
<p>TravelPerk said the Series D will be used to double down on product development &#8212; with a focus on building tools for an era of hybrid working. Albeit, it&#8217;s focus is on trying to expand the portion of physically co-located working that&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p>A recent feature, added to TravelPerk&#8217;s platform in November, is an events organizing tool aimed at nudging customers to plan and book in-person get togethers, such as for an offsite, a party or a meeting of new starters. &#8220;TravelPerk Events enables remote and hybrid teams to connect in real life,&#8221; runs its marketing spiel for the tool.</p>
<p>“As time goes by, it is clear that there won’t be a replacement for the human touch. We are seeing data on our platform and we are feeling it ourselves,&#8221; argues CEO Avi Meir in a statement. “While some technologies are focused on virtual interactions, TravelPerk is building the technology that will help us get together in real life.”</p>
<p>The startup is also ploughing money into developing what it bills as &#8220;sustainable&#8221; travel solutions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.travelperk.com/blog/travelperk-acquires-susterra-to-usher-in-the-era-of-sustainable-business-travel/">Last fall</a> TravelPerk acquired a UK-based corporate responsibility consultancy, called Susterra, to beef up its ability to offer tools for customers to calculate a travel-related carbon footprint.</p>
<p>It was already offering carbon offsetting to try to grease bookings in spite of the existential challenge posed by climate change &#8212; which will require massive, swift global reductions in carbon emissions if humanity is to avoid environmental catastrophe, thereby presenting an obvious challenge to travel industry growth.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, TravelPerk is doing the opposite of talking down its growth prospects.</p>
<p>It said expanding in the US is another focus for the Series D &#8212; a market that became its largest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/business-trip-platform-travelperk-buys-yc-backed-rival-nextravel/">a year ago</a> when it acquired US-based rival NexTravel.</p>
<p>It also plans to use the funding to double down on growth in its other large market: Europe.</p>
<p>Since 2019 (so pre-pandemic), TravelPerk said its business has grown 4x in terms of annualised revenue. It also said it has doubled its customer acquisition rate &#8212; albeit a considerable chunk of recent onboarding is likely to have come from acquisitions over this period.</p>
<p>As well as buying US-based NexTravel at the start of last year, it also picked up the UK&#8217;s Click Travel <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/06/travelperk-buys-uk-based-click-travel-in-latest-pandemic-purchase/">last summer</a>, at the time the largest business travel platform in the country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Africa’s mobile-money sector remains the most active of any region in the world according to GSM Association (GSMA), an umbrella body representing the interests of players in the telecommunications industry. The <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GSMA_State-of-the-Industry-Report-on-Mobile-Money-2021_Full-report.pdf">report</a> shows that registered mobile money accounts in Africa stood at slightly over half a billion in 2020, a 12-percentage point growth from the previous year. The value of transactions hit $495 billion, up 23-percentage points.</p>
<p>East Africa accounts for the bulk of Africa’s mobile money transactions followed by West Africa. The GSMA report shows that the value of transactions in West Africa had the highest growth after increasing by 46 percentage points to $178billion (the second highest value after East Africa’s).</p>
<p>Fundamentally, mobile money enables users to send and receive money, as well as to pay utility bills — but in advanced situations like it is across Africa, the wallet turns subscribers’ phone numbers into a sort of proxy for bank accounts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256645" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As it grows, mobile money has come to be a launchpad for digital lenders, who use customers’ mobile money transaction history to determine the amount of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/fintechs-in-africa-continue-to-overshadow-all-other-startups-in-funding-gained/">instant credit to extend to borrowers</a> &#8212; monies that are then directly deposited into customers’ mobile money wallets.</p>
<p><strong>MTN Uganda&#8217;s mobile overdraft credit</strong></p>
<p>Innovative products grounded on mobile money include the newly-launched <a href="https://www.mtn.co.ug/mtn-momo/faqs/">MoMoAdvance</a>, an overdraft loan by MTN Uganda, the country’s biggest telco, and a subsidiary of the MTN Group &#8212; whose other affiliated companies have operations in southern, west and central regions of Africa.</p>
<p>MoMoAdvance was launched following a pilot program that started late 2020, and it allows MTN’s customers to overdraw on its MoMo (mobile money) wallet. Users will be charged an access fee of 2.75% of the amount borrowed, and a daily interest of 0.5% on the outstanding balance for a maximum of 45 days.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“MTN MoMoAdvance will offer the MTN MoMo customers the convenience of transacting beyond their MoMo wallet balance and pay back later… we believe that it will give them the convenience to transact seamlessly beyond their wallet balances during times of need then pay back later,” <a href="https://www.mtn.co.ug/mtn-momo-uganda-launches-momoadvance-an-overdraft-facility-that-enables-customers-transact-beyond-their-momo-wallet-balances/">said</a> MTN Mobile Financial Services, general manager, Stephen Mutana.</p>
<p>MoMoAdvance borrows heavily from a similar overdraft product, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/17/mobile-overdraft-facility-fuliza-outshines-silicon-valley-backed-lending-apps-in-kenya/">Fuliza, by Kenya’s biggest telco, Safaricom</a>, which was launched in January 2019, and allows subscribers to complete transactions even when they have insufficient funds in their M-Pesa mobile wallets.</p>
<p>The overdraft services are based on a borrowing limit that is defined by a customer&#8217;s transaction history, while the overdrawn amount and accrued interest are deducted from the customers’ wallets anytime they are topped up. Fuliza has grown in popularity over the last three years among M-Pesa users, with Safaricom now giving out about $12 million worth of overdraft loans every day.</p>
<p>Fuliza is offered in partnership with KCB and NCBA, both of which are Kenyan banks with a regional presence. MTN Uganda also partnered with NCBA for its MoMoAdvance credit, and it is now likely that the bank will establish such partnerships in other East African countries Rwanda and Tanzania, where it already has operations.</p>
<p>The mobile-money overdraft products are providing a competitive edge to telcos as lending apps continue to enter African markets. The apps have stepped up competition for telco-owned mobile lending services like MoKash by MTN Uganda and M-Shwari by Safaricom – which allow customers to borrow short-term loans and pay back within 30 days.</p>
<p>Such innovative and easily accessible digital lending services have made credit accessible to a majority of people in Africa, who were previously cut out by formal financial institutions for lack of a banking history. However, most of the emerging digital lenders charge predatory interests, often attributed to the high-risk environment that they work in. This is as the regulatory environment gradually adapts to formalize the sector, eventually leading to better pricing for users while shielding the service providers from losses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The sign of a true entrepreneur is someone who can look around and go &#8220;wait a minute, there <em>must be a better way.</em>&#8221; That approach worked well for <a href="https://livingoutlines.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outlines</a>&#8216; founders, who are tackling the unsexy but pretty serious recycling issue of shower curtain liners. The company just closed a $1 million pre-seed lead by <a href="https://social-impact-capital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social Impact Capital</a> to make sure that the giant water-splash-stopping sheets of plastic that are present in most of the 128 million households in the U.S. get sustainably recycled, rather than putting them in landfills.</p>
<p>&#8220;I moved to New York from London about six years ago. Like all New Yorkers I moved into like an old apartment that required me to have like a shower liner &#8212; one of those plastic shower curtains. Coming from Europe, like I was very used to a door or a plexiglass screen on the shower, or a separate shower unit. I was caught in this constant dilemma; I would pick up my shower liner, three or four months would go by it would get slimy and gross,&#8221; Outlines co-founder Luke Barkley Young explains. &#8220;I was in this really awkward position where I&#8217;d want to get a new one, but I had this plastic-guilt of throwing it away. I was used to being able to recycle everything, and I just hated this constant pain point.&#8221;</p>
<p>Long story short, Young and his co-founder Megan Murphy set out to solve the problem in a rather elegant way. The pair developed a shower curtain system where the top of the curtain, the weights and the shower curtain hooks are made from sturdy, long-lasting materials, and the shower liner itself is made from easy-to-recycle plastic. The company developed a business model where it can take the shower liner in return and recycle it responsibly, as it ships out replacement shower liners on a regular rotation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256256" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company started as a project called &#8220;Drip,&#8221; where the duo found 2,500 early adopter customers who, in addition to being early paying customers, gave a lot of feedback about their needs as consumers. After a while, the company decided that there was almost certainly a sustainable market there, and spun up the Outlines company to explore that direction further.</p>
<p>Of course, a single-product company rarely makes a great investment opportunity, so I pressed the founding team on what might happen next in their product portfolio.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2256528" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Clever.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2256528" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2256528" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Clever.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="475" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Clever.jpg 4240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Clever.jpg?resize=150,70 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Clever.jpg?resize=300,139 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Clever.jpg?resize=768,356 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Clever.jpg?resize=680,315 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Clever.jpg?resize=1536,713 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Clever.jpg?resize=2048,950 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Clever.jpg?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2256528" class="wp-caption-text">Outlines&#8217; shower curtain liner is full of clever details, including ensuring that all parts of the liner itself are recyclable, moving the weights and the metal clips to the parts of the curtain that are not designed to be refreshed. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Outlines</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t decided fully on what our second product will be. What we are interested in is bringing to market links to a much larger audience. We have a couple of ideas. Things like loofahs, potty scrubbers, dish scrubbers, these things that just by the sheer nature of what they do, are possible products for us. Nobody wants to clean their dishes with the same dish scrubber forever,&#8221; explained Young. &#8220;So we are working to really understand our customer base, to determine what we should release next. We definitely hope to do that in the first half of 2022.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the one hand, the cynic in me is wondering &#8220;wait, we are giving VC funding to shower curtains, now?&#8221; but on the other hand, if 10% of households in the U.S. replace their shower curtain liners once every other year, that&#8217;s still 6 million sheets of plastic that need to be dealt with every year, somehow. Ensuring that it&#8217;s recycled responsibly doesn&#8217;t seem so bad. Still, I found myself wondering if a washable shower liner wouldn&#8217;t make more sense than shipping recyclable sheets of plastic around.</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all, shipping in general &#8212; especially in the United States &#8212; is becoming less carbon-intensive. So if you look at all the major couriers, they are adding more electric vehicles to their fleet. So carbon cost of shipping things back and forth is reducing, which is far superior to constantly shipping new stuff from the Far East where typically these plastic products are made. Also, when you do recycle in the U.S., there&#8217;s a lot more legislation and regulation around how recycling can happen versus overseas. The other point on this is when we throw items away they go to landfills. As they decompose, they actually release methane, which is a far more heavy greenhouse gas than CO<sub>2</sub> from shipping back and forward,&#8221; Young argues. He further explains that washable solutions aren&#8217;t really an option: &#8220;Reusable, washable plastics would be a dream, but there are two problems with that. First of all, a lot of plastic-based materials that are waterproof, like polyester, when you put them in your washing machine, the friction of that actually really releases millions of microplastics. Municipal water systems just cannot get them out of the water supply. And then if you were to use a natural fiber, they&#8217;re covered in what&#8217;s called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durable_water_repellent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Durable Water Repellent (DWR)</a>. Over time, because of the heat of a shower, it actually corrodes off. When that happens, your shower liner doesn&#8217;t work. So for this use case, plastic is by far the best material to use.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company today announced it raised its $1 million round, and I wondered what&#8217;s possible now that wasn&#8217;t possible before they closed the round.</p>
<p>&#8220;We just closed the round of $1 million before our launch, which was very exciting. We&#8217;ve done a ton of development up until this point, both in the product and the design of the product, the website and the entire online experience. But we&#8217;re really excited about investing in our digital tools. The first part is a part of responsible replenishment, it&#8217;s all about serving you a plan that is highly personalized to your needs. Obviously what we&#8217;re trying to do with that isn&#8217;t ensure that we&#8217;re not sending you more than you need, but you&#8217;re also receiving enough so that you&#8217;re not standing next to mold every single morning,&#8221; explains Murphy. &#8220;We are investing in that piece to make sure that we are as smart as possible, and that we&#8217;re creating something that&#8217;s genuinely valuable to you as a customer. We are also really excited about further product development. As Luke said, we are already beginning work on the second product, but this is a big category with lots of space for innovation. So we are investing in future product development, to make sure that we&#8217;re rolling out new products at a relatively quick pace.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa’s appetite for cloud computing software continues to increase as connectivity and bandwidth opportunities push boundaries. Per reports, the continent’s cloud computing industry coupled with the Middle East </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to grow to $31.4 billion in 2026 from $14.2 billion last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://seamlesshr.com/">SeamlessHR</a>, a Nigeria-based company that wants to help African businesses “leverage the continent’s greatest asset: abundant human capital” with its cloud-based human resources (HR) and payroll software, has raised $10 million in Series A funding for its next phase of growth and regional expansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pan-African venture capital firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/tlcom-capital-closes-71m-africa-fund-with-plans-to-back-12-startups/">TLcom Capital</a> led the round. New investor Capria Ventures and existing investors Lateral Frontier Ventures, Enza Capital and Ingressive Capital participated.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256522" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s eponymous product is a cloud-based, end-to-end HR software that helps businesses manage and streamline their entire human resource processes and workflow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its product suite includes an HR management system, performance and competency management, HR analytics, leave management, payroll management and recruitment management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/dr-emmanuel-okeleji-722077b">Emmanuel Okeleji</a> and CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dejjy">Deji Lana</a> didn’t build SeamlessHR from the get-go</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was four years after several iterations of Insidify, an aggregator site for job seekers and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a review site for companies that they started SeamlessHR in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The natural client for our job sites was the HR,” CEO Okeleji told TechCrunch on a call. “So we thought, ‘how can we help HR to become more productive and successful so that they can run a better, more profitable company and hire more people in the process?’”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founder also said one of the reasons for the pivot from Insidify to SeamlessHR was because the former wasn’t profitable and lacked the flexibility to scale across Africa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With SeamlessHR, both goals could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be accomplished and a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> year after launching SeamlessHR’s MVP, revenues picked up and was 10 times more than Insidify’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company signed a couple of smaller companies to build its reputation. But over time, it began to focus on bigger clients and signed up a bank as its first main enterprise customer. The company said that</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its enterprise-grade solution caters to various companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They range from businesses with 100 employees or fewer to large enterprises with more than 10,000 employees; and from</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> multinationals and banks such as PwC, AXA and Sterling Bank to startups and investment firms like Flutterwave and TGI Group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 100,000 employees from these organizations use SeamlessHR monthly. “We have the largest aggregation of medium-to-very large companies in Africa,” Okeleji remarked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Four years in, SeamlessHR is now rich with human resources and payroll data after handling salaries for several hundreds of companies. Sitting on top of such data provides leverage to build out more vertical products; for this reason, SeamlessHR will venture into launching embedded finance products for employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s how it will work: Say a company is using SeamlessHR for its 5,000 employees; any one of them can tap into the platform’s earned wage access where they can get their salaries up until the point they’ve worked. It’s a typical salary structure in markets such as the U.S. but rarely used in markets like Nigeria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In Africa, the innovation that allows people to access credit from their jobs doesn’t happen</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And an HR payroll software is well-positioned to lead that innovation because we use finance, technology and HR to help people convert their employment into collateral to access safe credit,” stated the CEO, who believes the company’s cash advances will appeal more to employees than “predatory” loans offered by some lending companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa’s payroll and HR management market has witnessed the emergence of newer companies such as YC-backed <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/08/14/workpay-raises-seed-funding-kepple-africa-yc/">Workpay</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/nigerias-digital-payroll-platform-bento-expands-to-kenya-rwanda-and-ghana-to-enter-six-other-african-markets-in-2022/">Bento</a>. They help businesses with salary disbursement, taxes and pension, carving out a niche for themselves in a market that appears to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be dominated by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> SeamlessHR</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building an HR solution in Africa requires more workaround than in developed markets, where most small businesses can afford to pay for software. The opportunity in Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lies with large corporates, not SMEs. They have higher purchasing power and a greater need for HR solutions; they make up the bulk of SeamlessHR’s customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SeamlessHR has also eaten into the market share of legacy and “on-premise” systems like SAP and Oracle, commonly used by large companies </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">locally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Companies now know they can do without hiring employees who need certifications to manage software and concentrate on setting and onboarding cloud-based software solutions capable of serving their</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> needs, albeit cheaper. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Localization of software also plays a part in SeamlessHR replacing these legacy systems in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TLcom Capital partner Andreata Muforo said of the investment, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The strong execution shown by Emmanuel and his team is a vital ingredient required to build</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a successful business and as they expand their products to include embedded finance and launch their</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">solutions to new markets, we’re proud to partner alongside them and strengthen their push to unlock more value within Africa’s B2B space.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says its new funding will further strengthen its position as “Africa’s leading cloud HR and payroll platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” Okeleji, who had a brief stint as an investment banker and practised as a doctor, said on the call that SeamlessHR would take its business south of the continent with South Africa as operating hub, thus hiring more staff. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company currently has a presence in Nigeria and Kenya; it’ll also use the funds to expand further in the East African country and surrounding markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product-wise, SeamlessHR plans to build out its embedded finance offerings and provide </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> functionalities, especially around artificial intelligence, data analytics and machine learning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okeleji mentioned that SeamlessHR would move beyond human resources and payroll at some point into other departments that make organizations tick. He also hinted at the possibility of SeamlessHR scaling beyond Africa into other global markets, referencing the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/freshworks-aims-for-nearly-9-billion-valuation-in-us-ipo/">recent strides made by India’s Freshworks</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are building software solutions to optimize HR now, but in the future, we’ll go to other areas beyond HR. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are positioned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to build a global SaaS company because SaaS products can travel the world faster than, say, fintech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re beating global players in our local market and while we are not distracting ourselves now, we know we can play this game globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Consumer spending on mobile apps reached $170 billion in 2021, according to App Annie&#8217;s newly released &#8220;<a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/state-of-mobile-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State of Mobile 2022&#8243; report</a>, out today, which offers a comprehensive look at the app economy across iOS, Google Play and third-party Android app stores in China. That figure is up 19% year-over-year, which is down just one percentage point from the growth rate the firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">reported in its prior annual report</a>. Growth in app downloads, however, dipped a bit more. Though today&#8217;s consumers are installing more apps than ever &#8212; 230 billion were downloaded in 2021, setting another record &#8212; the growth rate itself is slowing.</p>
<p>In January 2021, App Annie reported year-over-year download growth of 7% during 2021, which has now dropped to just 5% in 2021.</p>
<p>Download growth today is being driven largely by emerging markets like India, as well as Pakistan, Peru, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia and Egypt.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2256377" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>What&#8217;s also clear is that consumers are spending more time in apps &#8212; even topping the time they spend watching TV in some cases.</p>
<p>The report noted the average American watches 3.1 hours of TV per day, for example, but over the course of the past year, they spent 4.1 hours on their mobile device. And they&#8217;re not even the world&#8217;s heaviest mobile users. In markets like Brazil, Indonesia and South Korea, users surpassed 5 hours per day in mobile apps in 2021.</p>
<p>Across the top 10 markets analyzed in the study, the average time spent in apps topped 4 hours, 48 minutes in 2021 &#8212; up 30% from 2019. This included the averages from Brazil, Indonesia, South Korea, Mexico, India, Japan, Turkey, Singapore, Canada, the U.S., Russia, the U.K., Australia, Argentina, France, Germany and China combined.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Much of this time was spent in social, photo and video apps, which accounted for 7 out of every 10 minutes spent on mobile in the past year. These categories, plus entertainment apps, also appeal to Gen Z users, particularly in the U.S.</p>
<p>Here in the U.S., Gen Z&#8217;s most-used apps included Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat and Netflix. Millennials meanwhile preferred Facebook, Messenger, Amazon and WhatsApp. Gen X, which has now been lumped into the Baby Boomer demographic (ack!), used The Weather Channel, Amazon Alexa, NewsBreak and Ring.</p>

<p>This increased time spent in apps has had a direct impact on consumer spending. In the U.S., the COVID-19 pandemic&#8217;s lingering effects have forced users to shop, work, learn, game and entertain themselves from home over the past year. This led to &#8220;phenomenal&#8221; growth in consumer spending, App Annie said, as the market added $43 billion in 2021, or $10.4 billion more than 2020, equating to 30% year-over-year growth &#8212; higher than the global average.</p>
<p>At the high end of consumer spending, there were 233 apps and games that pulled in more than $100 million in 2021, and 13 titles that generated over $1 billion. This is up 20% from 2020, when there were then 193 apps and games topping the $100 million mark, and only 8 titles making over $1 billion annually.</p>

<p>Outside the consumer spending that included paid apps, subscriptions and in-app purchases, the broader mobile app market topped $295 billion in 2021, up 23% year-over-year, despite fears from marketers over Apple&#8217;s privacy changes and IDFA crackdown. In 2022, the market is expected to grow to $350 billion, aided by big events including the Beijing Olympics and the U.S. mid-terms.</p>

<p>New mobile app releases also grew in 2021, as publishers launched 2 million new apps and games, bringing the total number of apps and games ever released across the App Store and Google Play to 21+ million. Of course, older apps and games have since been removed over the years either by the publishers themselves or the app stores during cleanups. Currently, there are 5.4 million &#8220;live&#8221; apps and games available on the app stores, 1.8 million of which are on iOS and 3.6 million on Google Play.</p>
<p>Google Play also accounted for 77% of all the new releases last year, while games made up 15% of all releases across both stores, the report noted.</p>

<p>App Annie&#8217;s full report took a deep dive into individual app categories, as well, including gaming, finance, retail, video streaming, food &amp; drink, health &amp; fitness, social, travel, dating and more.</p>
