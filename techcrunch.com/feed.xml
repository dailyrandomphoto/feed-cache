										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Product managers can only be successful if they can make effective use of both quantitative and qualitative data. But mapping the former to the latter, and collecting high-quality data, is a huge challenge to organizations looking to rapidly productize and innovate.</p>
<p><a href="https://userleap.com/">UserLeap</a>, a company founded by serial product manager <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanglasgow?lang=en">Ryan Glasgow</a>, thinks it has found a better way, and so do its investors. The company today announced the close of a $16 million Series A financing led by Accel (Dan Levine led the round), with participation from angels like Elad Gil, Dylan Field, Ben Porterfield, Akshay Kothari, Jack Altman, and Bobby Lo.</p>
<p>One of the main challenges of rapid product development is that the ratio of quantitative data to qualitative data isn&#8217;t equal. It can take weeks or even months to get results from user surveys, and that&#8217;s only if users actually respond. According to UserLeap, the average response rate for email surveys is between 3 percent and 5 percent. To add to the headache, PMs and data teams usually have to parse that information and organize it manually.</p>
<p>UserLeap offers product teams the ability to put a short line of code into their product that then delivers contextual micro-surveys to users right within the product. The company says that these micro-surveys usually see a 20 percent to 30 percent response rate, and sometimes that even pops all the way to 90 percent.</p>
<p>Plus, the UserLeap dashboard processes the natural language from respondents and organizes the data. For example, if one user references price and another references cost, those responses are grouped together.</p>
<p>Because the surveys are built right into the product and targeted to a specific action or flow, and because the data is parsed and automatically sorted, product teams usually have access to this data within a few hours.</p>
<p>UserLeap charges based on the number of end users tracked, plus the number of surveys sent out per month, offering tiers for those surveys in groupings of five. Glasgow says this is a bit of a differentiator when compared to other survey products like SurveyMonkey or TypeForm.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have a usage based pricing model, where our competitors often have a seat based pricing model,&#8221; said Glasgow. &#8220;We don&#8217;t care how many people have access to us. Really, our goal is to get you to use our product.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, the insights gleaned from UserLeap can be shared and used across the entire organization without affecting the price.</p>
<p>This latest funding brings UserLeap&#8217;s total funding to $20 million — First Round Capital previously led a $4 million seed round.</p>
<p>Customers include Square, Opendoor, And Codecademy. Thus far, the company has tracked more than 500 million visitors, and gotten 600,000 survey question responses.</p>
<p>The UserLeap team is currently made up of 15 people, with females representing 50 percent and people of color making up 33 percent of the leadership team. Across the company, women represent 32 percent of the team are people of color represent 42 percent.</p>
<p>&#8220;UserLeap cares deeply about diversity and inclusion,&#8221; said Glasgow. &#8220;Having a diverse team helps to ensure our employees feel comfortable and valued so that they can bring their whole selves to work. For that reason, UserLeap has a part-time recruiting sourcer dedicated to engaging underrepresented candidates and these efforts have contributed towards our diversity goals.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This week <a href="https://www.koan.co/">Koan</a>, a startup that provides objectives-and-key-results (OKR) and status-tracking software, announced that it has raised an additional $1 million, added a free tier to its service, and acquired a design firm that it has worked with.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/koan" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="koan">Koan, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/23/koan-launched-by-a-cofounder-of-jive-software-has-raised-3-million-in-seed-funding/">raised $3 million in Seed funding last October</a>, was co-founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/matttucker?lang=en">Matt Tucker</a>, who previously co-founded Jive. Jive focused on enterprise social networking, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/12/12/enterprise-software-company-jive-prices-ipo-at-12-per-share-valued-at-over-600m/">went public in 2011</a> and later <a href="https://www.jivesoftware.com/news-room/press-releases/jive-software-enters-into-definitive-agreement-to-become-part-of-the-aurea-family-of-companies-for-462-million-in-cash/#:~:text=Customer%20Login-,Jive%20Software%20Enters%20into%20Definitive%20Agreement%20to%20Become%20Part%20of,for%20%24462%20Million%20in%20Cash&amp;text=CAMPBELL%2C%20Calif.%2C%20May%201,%2F%20%E2%80%94%20Jive%20Software%2C%20Inc.">sold itself in 2017</a> for an all-cash deal worth $462 million.</p>
<p>The OKR-focused startup competes in a somewhat crowded space. The goals-tracking software market saw a wave of venture funding over the last year, including <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/ally-raises-15m-series-b-to-scale-its-okr-focused-service/">Ally&#8217;s $15 million Series B</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/11/gtmhub-raises-9m-from-crv-after-posting-400-arr-growth-in-the-last-year/">Gtmhub&#8217;s Series A</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/16/workboard-triples-again-in-2019-raises-30m-from-a16z-to-celebrate/">WorkBoard&#8217;s Series C</a>, among others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><em>For more on what OKRs are and how they work, I&#8217;ve written a bit of an explainer <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/workboard-raises-a-23m-series-b-after-tripling-last-year/">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Koan&#8217;s software is built around a single core philosophy, Tucker told TechCrunch in an interview, namely that small, positive actions done repeatedly will amount to a big impact in time.</p>
<p>In that vein, while Koan offers the OKR tools you&#8217;d imagine, it also has a check-in feature that helps individuals to report their performance and progress in a manner that is aggregated across teams to provide a clear picture of how individuals across teams are feeling about any particular KR. If individual workers keep updating their progress, the company&#8217;s picture of how it is progressing towards goals will sharpen.</p>
<h2>Growth plans</h2>
<p>Koan is pursuing a growth strategy called product-led growth, also known as product-led selling. OpenView Partners <a href="https://openviewpartners.com/blog/what-is-product-led-growth/">defines</a> the go-to-market method as follows: &#8220;[A]n end user-focused growth model that relies on the product itself as the primary driver of customer acquisition, conversion and expansion.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2085180" style="width: 446px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085180" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2085180 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-4.20.36-PM.png?w=436" alt="" width="436" height="324" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-4.20.36-PM.png 436w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-4.20.36-PM.png?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-4.20.36-PM.png?resize=300,223 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-09-at-4.20.36-PM.png?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2085180" class="wp-caption-text">Via a Koan deck that TechCrunch reviewed, here how individual reports of progress against a KR can be viewed in its software.</p></div></p>
<p>It&#8217;s cheap, and if it works, very effective.</p>
<p>Software products that entice individuals to sign up, who then invite colleagues aboard can benefit from product-led growth strategies. The method has proven popular with collaboration-focused software, so it could make sense for Koan; if one team at a company uses the startup&#8217;s software, its use could spread to other teams. That would mean more revenue for Koan.</p>
<p>So to juice the number of folks using its product in hopes of it spreading widely, Koan is adding a free tier to its service. In marketing-speak, the startup wants to widen the top of its funnel.</p>
<p>If the move works, Koan could progress from Seed maturity to Series A preparedness. Its new capital will help in the same effort, with the new funds earmarked to help it staff up on the engineering side of its business and to help &#8220;accelerate [its] product led growth,&#8221; in the words of its CEO.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bmnt.com/">BMNT</a> put the new monies into the company.</p>
<p>And to top its news dump off, Koan has purchased <a href="https://horrible.co/">Horrible Design Co</a>, which it has worked with. Horrible has traditionally helped small startups with product and design related projects.</p>
<p>The OKR space is red-hot, and competitive. Some startups charge, others don&#8217;t, some have a freemium model. Koan has now cast its lot in with the third category. Let&#8217;s see if the 2021 planning cycle can help the company snag new users as its CEO hopes, and drive the revenue growth that its new investor expects.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I&#8217;ve had Apple&#8217;s AirPod Max headphones for less than 24 hours, so there is no way I would attempt to write a review of any sort. But I do have some of those oh so popular these days &#8220;first impressions&#8221; to share. Mostly on build quality, but I&#8217;ll throw a few first listen thoughts at you too.</p>
<p>These are thoughts that I have now that may change or get reinforced as I continue to evaluate them over the next week or so. So consider the below a sort of draft review that I&#8217;m publishing my early notes on. A &#8216;proto review&#8217;.</p>
<p>First, they&#8217;re gorgeous. The earcups are beautiful. The band is incredibly sturdy. The netting feels like a high-end piece of furniture. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The stems are very well done, with a precision pull out mechanism that acts like a precision milled car piston. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The netting, the ear pads, the clever (though now somewhat common) magnetic centering and clasp. The tuck and roll of the earcup covers providing an invisible seam as they attach to the body. The single piece of aluminum each of the ear cups is made of. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How high quality is the build here? Like, t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">his shouldn’t ship for $550 high. Judging from materials execution alone, the AirPod Max feels like it should be <em>more</em> expensive if anything. </span></p>
<p>[gallery ids="2085477,2085471,2085472,2085473,2085474,2085475,2085476,2085478,2085479,2085480,2085481,2085482,2085469,2085470"]</p>
<p>There is a tradeoff here that I feel I must mention even in this early review, though: These things are <em>heavy. </em>If you do not like heavy headphones, do not buy the AirPod Max. They are intense, definitely demand being listened to while sitting essentially straight up or leaning back (if you&#8217;re actively walking around the house picking up kid&#8217;s clothes and toys from the floor, for instance, they tend to want to shift forward from their own weight). These clock in at 386g &#8212; over 100g heavier than a pair of Beats over ears. If you have very high end headphones, you may be expecting this kind of weight, most people I think will not be. More on this as I keep using them and trying out adjustments.</p>
<p>There is also a distinct dearth of articulation present here. The piston-style extruding earcups are clever and have wow factor, but there is a limited spring back style articulation of the cup itself which means no folding them inward on themselves like the Bose QCII or Sony MX headphones are capable of. Hence that case I guess.</p>
<p>The controls are fine so far, the crown feels almost exactly like an Apple Watch crown, with maybe slightly more tension. The Siri functions work totally fine, either with a long press of the crown or a &#8216;Hey Siri&#8217;. The earcups have precision detection of position so you can pause by simply lifting one cup.</p>
<p>Taking the headphones off and setting them down turns them off, there is no power button. This feels super natural and nicely Apple-ey. Just put them on to use and take them off to stop.</p>
<p>They charge from any power brick though none is included. Apple says that you&#8217;ll get 1.5 hours for 5 minutes of charging but there is no overall fast charge. It&#8217;s basically two hours with any USB brick no matter the wattage.</p>
<p>The lack of an included 3.5mm cable means that you have to add $35 to the price to get to a place where you&#8217;re comparing these with a Bose or Sony option for seat-back systems on planes and general capability. Speaking of travel&#8230;</p>
<p>The lack of real folding options on these, the material in the netting and the pretty definitive &#8216;one way&#8217; these are meant to articulate means that I do not see these being a regular travel companion for me, on initial pass. Oh, and the case is just as ridiculous as it looks. Sorry. The construction here is just as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/apple-magsafe-duo-charger-review-useful-but-expensive-and-underwhelming/">dodgy as the MagSafe Duo</a>. It feels cheap, and like it will dirty easily, not exactly what you want from a &#8216;travel case&#8217;. And it looks like a butt.</p>
<p>The sound is impressive. Don&#8217;t worry about this being in the Beats region of a bass-heavy crowd pleaser. Though there is plenty of low end, this is a more nuanced affair, with crisp delivery across the spectrum. I&#8217;ve watched movies, listened to music and had phone conversations, all sounded great. The spatial audio feature, for one, is greatly improved by the larger drivers and enclosed environment. Audio panning and positioning from Atmos content is very cleverly done and if you&#8217;re watching from an iOS device it really does feel like you&#8217;re in a large sound environment with a strong center positioning at the screen. They feel like you&#8217;re listening in a room with no headphones on at all, it is really beyond impressive.</p>
<p>Ok, that&#8217;s it for now, more as I continue to check them out. Shortly: super high quality, very heavy, sound solid so far.</p>
<p>For those of you interested, I will test latency with a corded setup but I haven&#8217;t been able to yet.</p>

<p>Capping a 16-month investigation, a Democratic-controlled House committee recently identified <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/amazon" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="amazon">Amazon, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as <a href="http://www.apple.com">monopolies that snuff out competition and innovation</a>, equating the Big Four to oil barons and railroad tycoons of the late 19th century.</p>
<p>Only days later, the Trump administration sued Google to stop it from <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-monopolist-google-violating-antitrust-laws">“unlawfully maintaining monopolies”</a> by seeking court orders that could include its breakup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And yesterday, in separate but coordinated lawsuits, the Federal Trade Commission and 48 attorneys generals from blue and red states alike <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/ftc-seeks-to-break-up-facebook-alleging-illegal-monopoly/">sued Facebook</a> to undo its “predatory” and “illegal” acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. When President-elect Joe Biden takes office next month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/tech-biden-era-cabinet-antitrust-transition/">his administration is widely expected</a> to proceed with both federal antitrust cases against Google and Facebook.</p>
<p>Big Tech, both parties agree, has become too big for our good.</p>
<p>The typical American doesn’t always see it the same way. Their assessment changes based on how the issue is framed.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			As consumers, Americans generally see technology as a positive, based on our research.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>When we at The Harris Poll asked directly whether Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are monopolies that limit competition and innovation, American adults overwhelmingly side with the House Judiciary Committee’s findings. Most also say Google should be broken up, with nearly half saying dismantling Facebook would also encourage innovation and protect consumers. Go get ‘em trust-busters, they seem to cheer.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/big-doesnt-mean-bad-americans-split-with-government-on-tech-monopolies/">when asked broadly</a> about categories of digital services the Big Four lead in — web search, e-commerce, streaming services or social media — Americans just as overwhelmingly tell us their favorite providers are not monopolies at all.</p>
<p>In the view of most Americans, there’s abundant competition and choice throughout the digital marketplace. Lowercase big tech, the majority says, promotes innovation and boosts the nation’s standing around the world. Big, in other words, doesn’t automatically mean bad.</p>
<p>Most Americans, of course, are not antitrust lawyers or macroeconomists expert at detecting monopolies and quantifying their market impact. They view Big Tech primarily as consumers, making judgments based on their own experiences and feelings rather than court-admissible data. As consumers, Americans generally see technology as a positive, based on our research.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/big-doesnt-mean-bad-americans-split-with-government-on-tech-monopolies/">our survey of 2,069 representative adults in the U.S.</a>, almost two-thirds say that every day they use a search engine like Google and go to social media like Facebook. At least once a week, almost half shop on Amazon or another online general store and two-thirds stream video through apps such as Google’s YouTube, Apple TV+ and Amazon Prime Video.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has only increased their loyalty. Cooped-up day after day, half of American adults say they’re streaming more video than they did a year ago, for instance, while a third is shopping more online. If consumers are feeling abused by Big Tech — and more than half do say big tech companies fail to always do right by their customers — they’re not riled up enough to click elsewhere.</p>
<p>American consumers also don’t feel like captives without options. Google’s <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/511358/market-share-mobile-search-usa/#:~:text=In%20July%202020,%20Google%20accounted,apps%20in%20the%20United%20States.">market share in internet search</a> on mobile devices is 94%, which probably fits anyone’s definition of a monopoly. Yet even though 55% of Americans agree that Google has too much power and should be severed from YouTube and Gmail, four of five say there are adequate alternatives.</p>
<p>Nearly twice as many survey respondents, in fact, say there are too many choices for search engines (19%) than too few (11%). Americans judge the markets for social media, video and audio streaming, e-commerce and other digital services like Apple Pay and Google Pay as similarly competitive.</p>
<p>Despite Big Tech’s market dominance, American consumers don’t think these companies are hurting their rivals, either. Though three-quarters of Americans see Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook as monopolies, four of five people say tech giants promote innovation in their industries and two-thirds say these companies promote competition and enhance the nation’s global reputation.</p>
<p>College grads and those 45 years old and up are slightly more likely to see Big Tech as a driver of innovation and competition, though all demographic groups share these high opinions.</p>
<p>Because I’m also not an antitrust lawyer or macroeconomist, I’m in no position to say whether the bipartisan legal crusade against Big Tech is warranted. But based on our polling, I can offer insights on how Americans will react to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1328941/download">the Justice Department’s antitrust case</a> against Google as it goes to trial and other actions Congress or regulators may take to reduce Big Tech’s dominance.</p>
<p>When we separate Americans’ narrow take on individual companies from their perceptions of the digital realms consumers inhabit daily, we see little reason for the federal government to blow up Big Tech. Another cautionary finding: Barely half of the representative American adults in our poll even think regulators and lawmakers are the right groups to determine whether a company is too big.</p>
<p>If these companies eventually are downsized, though, the typical American consumer probably won’t mourn for the Not-Quite-As-Big Tech that results, as long as their trusted apps, search engines, shopping sites, streaming services and social media sites are still freely — and, in their minds, abundantly—available.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Planet FWD, the climate-friendly food startup founded by Zume co-founder <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/julia-collins" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="julia-collins">Julia Collins, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is today launching its first product, <a href="https://moonshotsnacks.com/">Moonshot Snacks. </a>The climate-friendly snack is carbon neutral, organic, kosher, plant-based, non GMO and has no sugar added.</p>
<p>The crackers come in three flavors: sourdough sea salt rosemary garlic and tomato basil. A box of crackers costs $5.99.</p>
<p>Planet FWD is also announcing an additional $2.5 million in funding led by Emerson Collective, Concrete Rose, MCJ Collective and Arlan Hamilton, as well as existing investors, including BBG Ventures, January Ventures,  and Kapor Capital among others. This is on top of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/12/zume-co-founder-goes-from-pizza-to-climate-friendly-food-with-2-7-million-in-funding/">$2.7 million the startup announced earlier this year</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What&#8217;s unique about Planet FWD&#8217;s Moonshot Snacks is that it uses ingredients from farmers that use regenerative agriculture practices. Regenerative agriculture is a farming technique that aims to reverse the effects of climate change by capturing carbon in soil and aboveground biomass, which ultimately increases biodiversity, enriches soils and improves watersheds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to engage customers and show them they have the power to address climate change just with the way they eat,&#8221; Collins told TechCrunch. &#8220;We can use our food choices as a way to promote better farm management practices and company practices that can help decarbonize the environment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ideally, Planet FWD will be able to show there’s consumer demand for climate-friendly products, Collins said. From there, she hopes that would encourage more farmers to implement these regenerative agriculture practices.</p>
<p>Unlike organic foods, where those specific farms are relatively well-known and identified, that can’t be said for regenerative agriculture. This is where the software element of Planet FWD comes in.</p>
<p>Additionally, Planet FWD is alpha testing a carbon impact assessment. So, if a brand wanted to determine what its current greenhouse gas impact is for its products, the tool could breakdown where it comes from &#8212; whether that&#8217;s the packaging, the ingredients, the distribution, etc. From there, the tool would recommend how to reduce the product&#8217;s greenhouse gas impact.</p>
<p>&#8220;Frankly, I think it&#8217;s a privilege to be alive and aware during this time where this is this window of opportunity to address climate change,&#8221; Collins said. &#8220;We can&#8217;t stop it. We can&#8217;t reverse it. But we can address it so it&#8217;s still possible for people to live on this planet. But the window is closing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moonshot Snacks begins shipping today via its website. On December 16, it will be available via <a href="https://zerogrocery.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=zero-waste-sf&amp;utm_content=hp&amp;utm_term=%2Bplastic%20%2Bfree%20%2Bgrocery&amp;keywordid=kwd-823832479196&amp;e_ad_id=479362281518&amp;e_adset_id=111992599606&amp;e_campaign_id=11599715757&amp;_bm=b&amp;_bn=g&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAiML-BRAAEiwAuWVgggTESu77HTvJvOq9kRQJTXpFbm4FAWBGK4GGe8_o6OGhXMVDocJV3hoCl58QAvD_BwE">plastic-free grocery store Zero</a> and will have a more traditional retail launch next year.</p>
<p>Planet FWD will create other products down the line, like cookies and chips. But first and foremost, the company&#8217;s roadmap is driven by the supply chain and understanding where there are opportunities to convert farms to regenerative practices.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through its sustainable and climate-friendly ingredient platform, Planet FWD is building a movement of more climate-conscious farmers and producers who can lead us toward a better, more sustainable future,&#8221; Fern Mandelbaum, Managing Director at Emerson Collective, said in a statement. &#8220;Through Julia’s inclusive leadership and passion, Planet FWD is helping create a new standard for the food industry and its role in being part of climate solutions.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nobody likes dealing with taxes &#8212; until the system works in your favor. In many countries, startups can receive tax credits for their R&amp;D work and related employee cost, but as with all things bureaucracy, that&#8217;s often a slow and onerous task. <a href="https://boastcapital.com/">Boast.ai</a> aims to make this process far easier, by using a mix of AI and tax experts. The company, which currently has about 1,000 customers, today announced that it has raised a $23 million Series A round led by Radian Capital.</p>
<p>Launched in 2012 by co-founders Alex Popa (CEO) and Lloyed Lobo (president), Boast focuses on helping companies &#8212; and especially startups &#8212; in the U.S. and Canada claim their R&amp;D tax credits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Globally, over $200 billion has been given in R&amp;D incentives to fund businesses, not only in the U.S. and Canada, but the U.K., Australia, France, New Zealand, Ireland give out these incentives,&#8221; Lobo explained. &#8220;But there&#8217;s huge red tape. It&#8217;s a cumbersome process. You got to dive in and figure out work that qualifies and what doesn&#8217;t. Then you&#8217;ve got to file it with your taxes. Then if the government audits you, it&#8217;s like a long, laborious process.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2085158" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Boast.AI-Product-Shot.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085158" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2085158" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Boast.AI-Product-Shot.png" alt="" width="1024" height="369" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Boast.AI-Product-Shot.png 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Boast.AI-Product-Shot.png?resize=150,54 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Boast.AI-Product-Shot.png?resize=300,108 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Boast.AI-Product-Shot.png?resize=768,276 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Boast.AI-Product-Shot.png?resize=680,245 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Boast.AI-Product-Shot.png?resize=1536,553 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Boast.AI-Product-Shot.png?resize=50,18 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2085158" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Boast.ai</p></div></p>
<p>After working on a few other startup ideas, the co-founders decided to go all-in on Boast. And in the process of working on other ideas, they also realized that AI wasn&#8217;t going to be able to do it all, but that it was getting good enough to augment humans to make a complex process like dealing with R&amp;D tax credits scalable.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way I think to bootstrap a company is three things,&#8221; Lobo explained. &#8220;One, customers are looking for an outcome. Get them that outcome in the fastest, cheapest way possible. Two, when you&#8217;re doing that, you may have to do a lot of manual work. Figure out what those manual touch points are and then build the workflow to automate that. And once you have those two things, then you&#8217;ll have enough data to start working on artificial intelligence and machine learning. Those are the key learnings that we learned the hard way.&#8221;</p>
<p>So after doing some of that manual work, Boast can now automatically pull in data using tech tools like JIRA and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/github" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="github">GitHub <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and a company&#8217;s financial tools like QuickBooks and (soon) ADP. It then uses its algorithms to cluster this data, figure out how much time employees spend on projects that would qualify for a tax credit and automate the tax filing process. Throughout the process &#8212; and to interact with the government if necessary &#8212; the company keeps humans in the loop.</p>
<p>&#8220;So all our [customer success] team is engineers,&#8221; Lobo noted. &#8220;Because if you don&#8217;t have engineers they can&#8217;t inform the decision-making process. They help figure out if there are any loose ends and then they deal with the audits, communicating with the government and whatnot. That&#8217;s how we&#8217;re able to effectively get SaaS-like margins or more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ideally, a tool like Boast pays for itself and the company says it has secured more than $150 million in R&amp;D tax credits since launch. Currently, it&#8217;s also doubling growth year over year, and that&#8217;s what made the founders decide to raise outside money for the first time. That funding will go toward increasing the sales team (which is currently only four people strong) and improving the platform, but Lobo was clear that he doesn&#8217;t want to be too aggressive. The goal, he said, is not to have to raise again until Boast can hit the $30 to $50 million revenue mark.</p>
<p>Once fully implemented, Boast also effectively becomes a system of record for all R&amp;D and engineering data. And indeed, that&#8217;s the company&#8217;s overall vision, with the tax credits being somewhat of a Trojan horse to get to this point. By the middle of next year, the team plans to offer a new product around R&amp;D-based financing, Lobo tells me.</p>
<p>Over the years, the Boast team also focused on not just growing its customer base but also the overall startup ecosystem in the markets in which it operates, with a special focus on Canada. The Boast team, for example, is also the team behind the popular <a href="https://www.tractionconf.io/">annual Traction conference</a> in Vancouver, Canada (Disclosure: I&#8217;ve moderated sessions at the event since its inception). A thriving startup ecosystem creates a larger client base for Boast, too, after all &#8212; and coincidently, the team met its investors at the event, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.leaflink.com">LeafLink</a> is today announcing it raised a $40 million Series C financing round, led by Founders Fund with participation from Thrive Capital, Nosara Capital, and Lerer Hippeau. This round of financing brings the total amount raised by the company to over $90 million.</p>
<p>This financing round is Founder Fund&#8217;s largest technology investment in the cannabis space.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 2015 <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/leaflink" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="leaflink">LeafLink <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has become a significant player in legal cannabis. With a 130 employees and operating in 27 markets, the company says it has 32% of the U.S. wholesale cannabis market, resulting in an annualized gross merchandise value of over $3 billion. LeafLink sees the Series C in helping grow the business through new processes and services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;This fundraising round is monumental for a technology company like LeafLink as we continue to define a space that shows no signs of slowing down,&#8221; said Ryan G. Smith, Co-founder, and CEO of LeafLink, said in a released statement. &#8220;We&#8217;re honored to partner with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/founders-fund" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="founders-fund">Founders Fund <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> as we scale our marketplace technology across the growing cannabis industry. Our eyes are set on bringing efficiency and innovation to the supply chain, and we&#8217;re excited for cannabis to serve as a model for more legacy industries in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right now, LeafLink serves as a critical service for the cannabis market by connecting retailers with suppliers and providing supply chain liquidity through its e-commerce marketplace. With the additional $40m, the company expects to expand its offering with new brands and retailers and expand into the new markets opened up by the 2020 election.</p>
<p>&#8220;The U.S. appears to be on a path to full federal legalization over the next few years,&#8221; said Founders Fund partner Napoleon Ta. &#8220;We believe we&#8217;ll start to see some massive success stories in the cannabis space as regulations change and that LeafLink will be one of the winners.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a statement to TechCrunch, Ta says LeafLink is a tech-enabled wholesale marketplace connecting thousands of wholesalers and retail buyers. He sees the investment as a great opportunity to work with a company he and Founders Fund see has the potential to bring an entire industry onto one platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We invested in LeafLink because the team is merging best practices from e-commerce marketplaces with B2B technology to streamline an entire industry&#8217;s supply chain and operations,&#8221; said Ta. &#8220;We&#8217;re excited to make our largest investment in the cannabis space to date in LeafLink.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Only a few months after announcing its $15 million Series A round, Tel Aviv-based cybersecurity firm Hunters today announced that it has received additional growth funding from Snowflake Ventures. With this, Snowflake&#8217;s venture arm joins existing investors <a href="https://m12.vc/">M12</a> and <a href="https://www.usvp.com/">U.S. Venture Partners</a>, which led the Series A round, as well as <a href="https://www.ylventures.com/">YL Ventures</a>, <a href="https://blumbergcapital.com/">Blumberg Captial</a> and <a href="https://www.okta.com/okta-ventures/">Okta Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>The fact that Snowflake Ventures is investing in the company is maybe no surprise, given that Snowflake was one of Hunters&#8217; first customers and its design partner for its threat-hunting service. Hunters provides enterprises with the tools to automate the threat-hunting process, something that has traditionally been a manual task. With the data it gathers from an enterprises&#8217; networking and security tools, Hunters can then detect stealth attacks against the company&#8217;s infrastructure and data estate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Snowflake and Hunters share the same vision of empowering organizations to fully mobilize their data in a secure way,&#8221; Snowflake’s Head of Corporate Development Stefan Williams said. &#8220;Snowflake’s Data Cloud coupled with Hunters’ breakthrough technology in security operations, empowers joint customers with best-in-class automated threat detection at cloud-scale.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Snowflake Ventures only <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/blog/introducing-snowflake-ventures/">launched a month ago</a>. The fund&#8217;s goal is to foster innovation &#8220;through investing in growth-stage companies that demonstrate a commitment to mobilizing data, provide value to our customers, and expand opportunities for the Data Cloud.&#8221; Its first investment was in <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/blog/snowflake-ventures-invests-in-datarobot-to-supercharge-machine-learning-in-the-snowflake-data-cloud/">machine-learning platform DataRobot</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aira" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="aira">Aira <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is the company behind one of the most exciting wireless power innovations, and now this technology could be headed into vehicles. The wireless power company just announced a strategic investment from Motherson, a Tier 1 global auto parts supplier.</p>
<p>Aira&#8217;s technology allows companies to build a better wireless charger. Instead of a wireless charger that forces users to use a specific location, Aira&#8217;s technology allows users to place their device anywhere on the surface. It&#8217;s the magic behind the curtain of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/nomads-base-station-pro-with-aira-freepower-tech-finally-realizes-the-promise-of-wireless-charging/">Nomad&#8217;s Base Station Pro</a> and fulfills the promise of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/apple-cancels-airpower-product-citing-inability-to-meet-its-high-standards-for-hardware/">Apple&#8217;s canceled AirPower charging station</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Motherson is one of the world&#8217;s largest and most forward-thinking automotive suppliers, and we share a common goal of enhancing the wireless charging experience and value proposition for vehicles,&#8221; said Jake Slatnick, Aira&#8217;s co-founder and CEO. &#8220;Motherson&#8217;s expertise and relationships will greatly accelerate our efforts to provide validated and certified wireless charging modules for vehicles worldwide.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Through this new deal, Motherson and Aira will develop, manufacture, and supply automotive-grade charging modules. What cars will have this technology? At this point, it&#8217;s unclear if there are any automakers signed on to integrate these modules into their vehicles.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/aira.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2085460" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/aira.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/aira.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/aira.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/aira.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/aira.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/aira.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/aira.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Air&#8217;s solution would be a welcomed upgrade to the charging pads currently found throughout the auto industry. Like their desktop counterparts, the pads found in today&#8217;s vehicles require the user to place their device in a specific location. Keeping the device on this pad is even more tricky as the vehicle moves around. Some manufacturers have taken to building clips into their design to keep the phone in place. Aira&#8217;s technology would allow for a larger pad and imprecise placement that should be better suited for in-car use.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our core mission is to find, support, and deploy the best technology solutions to global automakers and Tier 1 suppliers,&#8221; explained Edward Saenz de Viteri, Global Director of Business Development at Motherson Innovations. &#8220;We believe that FreePower represents the best-in-class Qi solution for in-vehicle wireless charging. It has already been deployed successfully in consumer devices, and its benefits for automotive are even more compelling. We look forward to making Aira&#8217;s free-position technology a global standard for in-vehicle wireless charging.&#8221;</p>
<p>Terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>

<p>The tech giant raised the hackles of the VR community this summer when it <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/a-single-way-to-log-into-oculus-and-unlock-social-features/">announced</a> it would be merging users of the latest Oculus kit onto a single Facebook account &#8212; and would end support for existing <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/oculus-vr" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="oculus-vr">Oculus <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> account users by 2023.</p>
<p>New users were immediately required to have a Facebook account in order to log in and access content for the virtual reality kit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/facebook-changes-name-of-its-annual-vr-event-and-its-overall-ar-vr-organization/">August</a> Facebook also announced that it was changing the name of the VR business it acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/25/facebook-to-buy-oculus-vr-maker-of-the-rift-headset-for-around-2b-in-cash-and-stock/?_ga=2.118783051.351571251.1607268348-1757155993.1533833482">back in 2014</a> for around $2BN &#8212; and had allowed to operate separately &#8212; to &#8220;<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook-reality-labs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook-reality-labs">Facebook Reality Labs</a>&#8220;, signalling the assimilation of Oculus into its wider social empire.</p>
<p>(Related: The last of Oculus&#8217; original co-founders left the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/13/facebook-is-losing-its-last-oculus-co-founder/">last year</a>.)</p>

<p>In recent years Facebook has been pushing to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/facebook-is-building-a-new-social-layer-for-oculus-headsets/">add a &#8216;social layer&#8217; to the VR platform</a> &#8212; but the heavy-handed requirement for Oculus users to have a Facebook account has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/08/19/oculus-vr-headsets-will-soon-require-a-facebook-account-and-that-sucks/">not proved popular with gamers</a>.</p>
<p>Now antitrust authorities are taking an interest in the move.</p>
<p>Germany&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bundeskartellamt.de/SharedDocs/Meldung/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2020/10_12_2020_Facebook_Oculus.html">Federal Cartel Office</a> (aka, the Bundeskartellamt) said today that it&#8217;s instigated abuse proceedings against Facebook to examine the linkage between Oculus VR products and its eponymous social network.</p>
<p>In a statement, its president, Andreas Mundt, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the future, the use of the new Oculus glasses requires the user to also have a Facebook account. Linking virtual reality products and the group’s social network in this way could constitute a prohibited abuse of dominance by Facebook. With its social network Facebook holds a dominant position in Germany and is also already an important player in the emerging but growing VR (virtual reality) market. We intend to examine whether and to what extent this tying arrangement will affect competition in both areas of activity.</p></blockquote>
<p>The FCO has another &#8216;abuse of dominance proceeding&#8217; ongoing against Facebook &#8212; related to how it combines user data for ad profiling in a privacy-hostile way which the authority contends is an abuse of Facebook&#8217;s market dominance.</p>
<p>That <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/antitrust-case-against-facebooks-super-profiling-back-on-track-after-german-federal-court-ruling/">case</a> is seen as highly innovative in how it combines privacy and antitrust concerns so is being closely watched.</p>

<p>The latest FCO proceeding against Facebook comes at an awkward time for the tech giant, which has been hit with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/facebook-antitrust-state-attorneys-general/">massive antitrust lawsuit from 46 U.S. States</a> &#8212; accusing it of suppressing competition through monopolistic business practices.</p>
<p>As antitrust regulators have stepped up their scrutiny of Zuckerberg&#8217;s empire in recent years, Facebook has responded aggressively: Announcing a plan to consolidate its messaging products onto a single technical backend, as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/facebook-branding/">adding Facebook branding to its acquisitions</a> &#8212; in an apparent bid to make it harder for competition regulators to order a break up.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/05/facebook-is-pivoting/">PR has also sought to cloak the &#8216;single backend&#8217; move by claiming it will increase user privacy</a>.</p>
<p>Yet the states&#8217; antitrust case against the company includes filings that show a Facebook executive discussing using moments of perceived increased competition for its business as an opportunity to decrease user privacy.</p>
<p>So, uh, awkward&#8230;.</p>

<p>Reached for comment on the FCO Oculus proceeding, a Facebook spokesperson sent us this statement: “While Oculus devices are not currently available for sale in Germany, we will cooperate fully with the Bundeskartellamt and are confident we can demonstrate that there is no basis to the investigation.”</p>
<p>The tech giant has used a series of legal tactics to block the FCO&#8217;s earlier order against &#8216;superprofiling&#8217; users.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/26/facebook-succeeds-in-blocking-german-fcos-privacy-minded-order-against-combining-user-data/">Last year</a> Facebook successfully applied to block the order banning it from combining user data. However Germany&#8217;s Federal Court of Justice reversed the decision of the Higher Regional Court &#8212; confirming the FCO&#8217;s order.</p>
<p>Although the hearing on the main proceeding is still pending at the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court &#8212; currently scheduled for March 26, 2021 (after being postponed from a date in November).</p>
<p>Facebook also responded to the Federal Court of Justice ruling by filing another emergency appeal against the FCO&#8217;s order &#8212; succeeding for a second time in blocking the order against combining user data.</p>
<p>The FCO says it does not have a route to appeal this preliminary block on points of law &#8212; meaning it&#8217;s had to lodge a complaint with the Federal Court of Justice, which it did on December 2.</p>
<p>In a statement, Mundt criticized Facebook for resorting to &#8220;legal remedies&#8221; to block the order which he said is delaying relief for consumers and competitors vis-a-vis Facebook&#8217;s abusive practices.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that Facebook has resorted to various legal remedies is not surprising in view of the significance which our proceedings have for the group’s business model. Nevertheless, the resulting delay in proceedings is of course regrettable for competition and consumers,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the second time that the Higher Regional Court has preliminarily granted an emergency appeal filed by Facebook. The deadline imposed on Facebook for implementing our demands has again been suspended. As in our view the reasons for this are not sustainable, we have immediately filed a complaint with the Federal Court of Justice. We want the clock to be ticking again for Facebook.”</p>
<p>Facebook using courts to block attempts to hold its business model accountable for violating regional laws is par for the course in Europe.</p>
<p>The tech giant has recently succeeded in blocking a preliminary order from Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission to suspend personal data transfers to the US by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/facebook-seeks-fresh-legal-delay-to-block-order-to-suspend-its-transatlantic-data-transfers/">applying for a judicial review of the regulator&#8217;s process</a>, for example.</p>
<p>It also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/30/facebook-is-trying-to-block-schrems-ii-privacy-referral-to-eu-top-court/">sought to block</a> Irish courts from referring the Schrems II case, which underpins that decision, to the CJEU in the first place &#8212; though it did not succeed.</p>
<p>In public remarks in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/facebook-denies-it-will-pull-service-in-europe-over-data-transfer-ban/">September</a>, Facebook VP Nick Clegg claimed it&#8217;s taking that legal action not to defend its own business model but to &#8220;try to send a signal that this is a really big issue for the whole European economy, for all small and large companies that rely on data transfers&#8221; &#8212; which he suggested would be &#8220;absolutely disastrous&#8221; for the EU as a whole.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More than one billion people in India today have a mobile connection, thanks in part to the proliferation of low-cost Android smartphones and the world&#8217;s cheapest mobile data plans in recent years.</p>
<p>This scale was unimaginable just three decades ago, when India had fewer than <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/soc.culture.indian/browse_thread/thread/c0e823d72686cd64/6bb8fa00c1d2790f?pli=1">2.5 million telephones</a> in the country. One of the earliest and most pivotal efforts that expanded the reach of telephones in the country took place in the late 1980s.</p>
<p>That was when the Indian government backed the idea of setting up telephone booths, or public call offices, across cities and towns. No longer did people need to buy expensive telephones, or pay exorbitant fees and bills. A person could just walk to a nearby mom and pop store, place a call for a couple of cents and move on.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On Wednesday, India’s cabinet approved a proposal that seeks to replicate the decades old strategy &#8212; and its success &#8212; with democratizing Wi-Fi in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>India’s IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that the government will launch PM WANI (Prime Minister Wi-Fi Access Network Interface) to &#8220;unleash a massive network in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>The neighborhood stores that served as public call offices could now be public data offices, he said. To make the program a success, the government will not charge any license or registration fee, he said.</p>
<p>These public data offices will work in tandem with public data aggregators that are tasked to collaborate with small and large telecom companies to utilize their optical fibre network.</p>
<p>The program will &#8220;create millions of inter-operable Wi-Fi hotspots in the country and democratise content distribution and broadband access to millions at affordable rates,&#8221; said R.S. Sharma, former chairman of Indian telecom regulator TRAI. He likened the program to UPI, a payments infrastructure built by retail banks, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/upi-india-growth-startups-business-model/">become the most popular way Indians pay digitally today</a>.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of people came online in India for the first time in the last decade. But just as many are still unconnected. The new program from the Indian government, in part, aims to bridge this gap.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is expected to be more business friendly and in line with efforts for ease of doing business.COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated delivery of stable and high speed Broadband Internet (data) services to an increasingly large number of subscribers in the country including areas which do not have 4G mobile coverage. This can be achieved by deployment of Public Wi-Fi,&#8221; the cabinet <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1679342">said in a statement</a>. &#8220;Further, the proliferation of public Wi-Fi will not only create employment but also enhance disposable incomes in the hands of small and medium entrepreneurs and boost the GDP of the country,&#8221; it added.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s announcement is the latest effort to bring more people online in India. Global giants <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/facebook" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="facebook">Facebook, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> both of which are counting on emerging markets such as India to sustain their growth, have previously attempted to make internet access more affordable in the country. While Facebook’s marquee effort, Free Basics, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/02/08/india-blocks-facebook-freebasics-net-neutrality/">banned in the country over net neutrality violation charges</a>, Google voluntarily <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/17/google-ends-its-free-wi-fi-program-station/">shut down its free Wi-Fi program at 400 railway stations this year</a>.</p>
<p>As mobile data prices got cheaper in many markets, including India, Google Station was no longer necessary, Caesar Sengupta, VP of Payments and Next Billion Users at Google, said at the time.</p>
<p>Jayanth Kolla, chief analyst and founder of consulting firm Convergence Catalyst, told TechCrunch that the Indian government should have launched this program seven to eight years ago.</p>
<p>He said the launch of Jio Platforms, which has become the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/19/how-reliance-jio-platforms-became-indias-biggest-telecom-network/">largest telecom operator in India in just four years</a> thanks to its cutrate mobile data tariffs, solved much of the challenges that PM WANI seeks to address.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/instagram" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="instagram">Instagram <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> today is launching Shopping in Reels, its TikTok competitor. The new feature <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/05/instagram-expands-shopping-on-igtv-plans-test-of-shopping-on-reels/">was announced in October</a> as something the company had in the works, as part of a ongoing series of shopping-related updates to the Instagram app. With today&#8217;s launch, both businesses and creators will be able to tag products when they create Reels &#8212; the short-form videos that now have their own tab in Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/instagram-redesign-puts-reels-and-shop-tabs-on-the-home-screen/">following last month&#8217;s redesign.</a></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>The company says many Reels already feature shopping content, like fashion looks, makeup and skincare, or other product how-tos. When people view an Instagram Reel with this content, they&#8217;ll be able to now tap a &#8220;View Products&#8221; button to either buy, save or learn more about the featured products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2085234" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085234" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2085234" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Shopping-in-Reels.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Shopping-in-Reels.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Shopping-in-Reels.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Shopping-in-Reels.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Shopping-in-Reels.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Shopping-in-Reels.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Shopping-in-Reels.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2085234" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, creators can add a &#8220;Branded Content&#8221; tag to their Reels to be transparent about when they&#8217;re working with a brand to promote their products, which is a form of paid promotion.</p>
<p>The update makes shopping an even larger focus for Instagram than it already was, and arrives at a time when video-based shopping is seeing increased adoption. In particular, a growing number of startups focused on live-stream video shopping are finding traction. In recent months, investors have backed companies like live shopping platforms <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/08/popshop-live-gets-3-million-to-bring-live-streaming-to-shopping/">Popshop Live </a>and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/01/bambuser-live-video-shopping/">Bambuser</a>, for example, while major tech companies, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/alibaba-aliexpress-influencer-recruitment/">Alibaba</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/08/amazon-live-is-the-retailers-latest-effort-to-take-on-qvc-with-live-streamed-video/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/googles-latest-rd-project-is-shoploop-a-mobile-video-shopping-platform/">Google</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/chinas-top-short-video-apps-and-e-commerce-giants-pally-up/">JD.com</a>, have also joined the video shopping trend in various ways.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2085237" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085237" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2085237" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Product-Page-Checkout.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Product-Page-Checkout.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Product-Page-Checkout.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Product-Page-Checkout.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Product-Page-Checkout.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Product-Page-Checkout.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Product-Page-Checkout.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2085237" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>Most importantly, perhaps, is that Instagram rival <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/tiktok-invests-in-social-commerce-via-new-shopify-partnership/">TikTok recently partnered with Shopify </a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/tiktok-invests-in-social-commerce-via-new-shopify-partnership/">on e-commerce</a> and today caters to brands that either advertise directly or work with influencers on its platform, eating into Instagram&#8217;s market. TikTok had also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/tiktok-deal/">fielded interest from Walmart</a>, when the Trump ban had forced the company to enter negotiations around a U.S. exit. And TikTok&#8217;s app in 2020 beat out Instagram as one of the world&#8217;s most downloaded apps, indicating a seismic shift in how younger users interact with social media.</p>
<p>Hoping to not be left behind, Instagram has revamped its app &#8212; to much user criticism when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/instagram-redesign-puts-reels-and-shop-tabs-on-the-home-screen/">relocated key home screen features</a> &#8212; with the goal of becoming a top online shopping destination, as well. The company generates revenue when customers checkout in the app using Facebook Pay, which will allow it to make money outside of running ads.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.meetcleo.com/">Cleo</a>, the London founded &#8220;financial assistant&#8221; that takes the form of an app and chatbot and now counts the U.S. as its largest market, has raised $44 million in Series B funding.</p>
<p>Leading the round, which I understand actually closed earlier this year, is EQT Ventures. Also participating are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/20/cleo-meet-balderton/">existing investors</a> Balderton Capital, LocalGlobe and SBI.</p>
<p>They join much earlier investors such as Entrepreneur First, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/01/taavet-meet-cleo/">Taavet Hinrikus</a>, Matt Robinson, Errol Damelin, Niklas Zennstrom, Alex Chesterman, and Ian Hogarth &#8212; all well-known names in London&#8217;s tech investment community.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Targeting &#8220;Gen Z&#8221; and with a rather lofty sounding mission to &#8220;fight for the world&#8217;s financial health,&#8221; <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cleo-communications" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cleo-communications">Cleo&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> AI/machine learning-powered app connects to your bank accounts and gives you proactive advice and information on your finances, including timely nudges, to help you stay on top of your spending. Over time, the idea is that Cleo can help change your financial behaviour for the better.</p>
<p>The broader premise is that Cleo can replace your bank&#8217;s own app, and by speaking to you in a more human and user-friendly way, improve your financial health. In addition, and crucially &#8212; as Cleo founder Barney Hussey-Yeo is fond of arguing  &#8212; the company can do all of this without having the same cost base or misaligned incentives of an actual bank.</p>
<p>The assumption made in 2017, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/26/emoji-banking/">when Cleo really got off the ground</a>, was that through a combination of data science and machine learning, delivered in a fun and openly gamified way, the company’s financial assistant chatbot could attract and retain gen z and millennial users. Then, after engaging with the app, users would have experienced enough value to upgrade to a paid subscription or various financial services offered through Cleo now or in the future. With 4 million registered users &#8212; 96 percent of whom are in the U.S. &#8212; the first part appears to be panning out.</p>
<p>Hussey-Yeo tells me the new funding round gives him a “mandate” to take some big product bets in order to move forward the financial health of Cleo’s users. “[Those product bets] won’t all work out, but if one or two of them connects, we’ll fundamentally change the game in some of the most broken areas in financial services”.</p>
<p>In addition, the company will expand its operations in the U.S., including building out executive and product teams in San Francisco.</p>
<p>“When we launched in the U.S it became quickly apparent that it would be our dominant market,” says the Cleo founder. “We were signing up about 1,000 users per day in the U.K. at the time. After [just] a week, we were at 10,000 per day in the U.S. and kept growing”.</p>
<p>Hussey-Yeo attributes a lot of the success state-side to better banking APIs in the U.S. with Plaid, which he says “dramatically drove up” conversion rates and lowered customer acquisition costs. “This combined with a much larger market focused us 100% on winning in the U.S. first. This race is far from played out”.</p>
<p>Hussey-Yeo says Cleo will always offer a free version &#8220;because everybody needs the ability to make smarter decisions about their financial lives&#8221;. In contrast, the premium product costs $5.99 per month and is intended for people who &#8220;need a little extra help,&#8221; providing features such as gamified savings, and &#8220;levelled up&#8221; credit scores with coaching. Premium users can also trigger a $100 salary advance designed to stop them dipping into a costly bank overdraft.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="WMTx95pk81"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/17/cleo-meet-triplepoint/">Cleo, the London-based fintech, has quietly taken debt financing from US-based TriplePoint Capital</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Cleo, the London-based fintech, has quietly taken debt financing from US-based TriplePoint Capital&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/17/cleo-meet-triplepoint/embed/#?secret=WMTx95pk81" data-secret="WMTx95pk81" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Meanwhile, Cleo says it has grown revenue by 400 percent in the last twelve months, and Hussey-Yeo tells me the company is now doing $10 million-plus ARR. In a further nod towards stronger unit economics, the cost to acquire a user is now less than $2 with the vast majority of users acquired organically.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we’re definitely not in growth at all costs mode,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We’ve worked hard over the last 12 months to bring our payback period comfortably under 12 months which is an incredibly rare feat at scale for fintech”.</p>
<p>One interesting aspect of Cleo’s mission and the strong “personality” its chatbot exhibits, is that the problem space the company is tackling is potentially based on behavioural science as much as it is data science. Hussey-Yeo doesn’t disagree.</p>
<p>“This is where the idea of a conversational interface came from,” he says. “I realised you could break the complexity down into a language anyone could engage with, and I mean actually look forward to engaging with it, to ultimately change their behaviour.</p>
<p>“Today we have an outstanding machine learning department but just as importantly is the behavioural researchers and writers at Cleo. We know this is the combination that makes Cleo special and, I hope, will eventually lead to us being the financial advisor for a billion people”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UK-based Orbex has raised a new $24 million funding round, led by BGF and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/octopus-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="octopus-ventures">Octopus Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and including participation from existing investors High-Tech Gründerfonds, Heartcore Capital, and Elecnor S.A. This new investment help &#8220;secure the roadmap&#8221; that Orbex was already working towards regarding its launch vehicle development and deployment, which is currently targeting 2022 for its first commercial launches.</p>
<p>Orbex is set to launch its Orbex Prime rocket from the new <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/space-ecb7" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="space-ecb7">Space <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Hub Sutherland spaceport in Scotland, and has six launch contracts on the books already. Its debut launch vehicle is a small payload rocket, which is unique in the industry in that it makes use of bio-propane, a fuel source that offers 90% emissions reduction vs. the traditional kerosene-based rocket fuels generally used for liquid rockets, and which is a renewable fuel source. Orbex also aims to reduce its impact in other ways, including through recoverability and reusability, and says that Prime&#8217;s design is intended to leave no post-launch debris either in the ocean on Earth, or even in orbit.</p>
<p>The startup is already in the process of building out its first Prime rockets, at two<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/heres-the-first-look-inside-orbexs-scotland-rocket-factory/"> factories it operates in Scotland and in Denmark</a>. The company uses 3D-printing heavily in its rocket facbbrication process. It has raised around $63 million to date, with its last round of around $39 million announced in 2018.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Productivity software has been getting a major re-examination this year, and human resources platforms &#8212; used for hiring, firing, paying, and managing employees &#8212; have been no exception. Today, one of the startups that&#8217;s built what it believes is the next generation of how HR should and will work is announcing a big fundraise, underscoring its own growth and the focus on the category.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hibob.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hibob</a>, the startup behind the HR platform that goes by the name of &#8220;bob&#8221; (the company name is pronounced, &#8220;Hi, Bob!&#8221;), has picked up $70 million in funding at a valuation that reliable sources close to the company tell us is around $500 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our mission is to modernize HR technology,&#8221; said Ronni Zehavi, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/hibob" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="hibob">Hibob&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> CEO, who cofounded the company with Israel David. &#8220;We are a people management platform for how people work today. Whether that&#8217;s remotely or physically collaborative, our customers face challenges with work. We believe that the HR platforms of the future will not be clunky systems, annoying, giant platforms. We believe it should be different. We are a system of engagement rather than record.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Series B is being led by SEEK and Israel Growth Partners, with participation also from Bessemer Venture Partners, Battery Ventures, Eight Roads Ventures, Arbor Ventures, Presidio Ventures, Entree Capital, Cerca Partners, and Perpetual Partners, the same group that also backed Hibob in its last round (a Series A extension) in 2019. It has raised $124 million to date.</p>
<p>The company has its roots in Israel but these days describes its headquarters as London and New York, and the funding comes on the back of strong growth in multiple markets. In an interview, Zehavi said that Hibob specialises in the mid-market customers and says that it has over 1,000 of them currently on its books across the US, Europe and Asia, including Monzo, Revolut, Happy Socks, Ironsource, Receipt Bank, Fiverr, Gong, and VaynerMedia. In the last year Hibob has had &#8220;triple digit&#8221; year-on-year growth (it didn&#8217;t specify what those digits are).</p>
<p>Human resources has never been at the more glamorous end of how a company works, and it can sometimes even be looked on with some disdain. However HR has found itself in a new spotlight in 2020, the year when every company &#8212; whether one based around people sitting at desks or in more interactive and active environments &#8212; had to change how it worked.</p>
<p>That might have involved sending everyone home to sign in from offices possibly made out of corners of bedrooms or kitchens, or that might have involved a vastly different set of practices in terms of when and where workers showed up and how they interacted with people once they did. But r<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">egardless of the implementations, they all involved a team of people who needed to be linked together and still feeling connected and managed; and sometimes hired, furloughed, or let go.</span></p>
<p>That focus has started to reveal the strains of how some legacy systems worked, with older systems built to consider little more than creating an employee identity number that could then be tracked for payroll and other purposes.</p>
<p>Hibob &#8212; Zehavi said they chose the name after the person who owned the bob.com domain wanted too much to sell it, but they liked bob for the actual product &#8212; takes an approach from the ground up that is in line with how many people work today, balancing different software and apps depending on what they are doing, and linking them up by way of integrations: its own includes S<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">lack, Microsoft Teams, and Mercer and other packages that are popular with HR departments. </span></p>
<p>While it covers all of the necessary HR bases like payroll and further compensation, onboarding, managing time off, and benefits, it further brings in a variety of other features that help build out bigger profiles of users, such as performance and culture, with the ability for peers, managers and workers themselves to provide feedback to enhance their own engagement with the company, and for the company to have a better idea of how they are fitting into the organization, and what might need more attention in the future.</p>
<p>That then links into a bigger organizational chart and conceptual charts that highlight strong performers, those who are possible flight risks, those who are leaders and so on. While there have been a number of others in the HR world that have built standalone apps that cover some of these features (for example, <a href="https://www.15five.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15five</a> was early to spot the value of a platform that made it much easier to set goals and provide feedback), what&#8217;s notable here is how they are all folded into one system together.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2085416,2085417,2085418,2085419"]</p>
<p>The end effect, as you can see here, looks less like word salad and more interactive, graphic interfaces that are presumably a lot more enjoyable and at least easier to use for HR people themselves.</p>
<p>The importance for investors has been that the product and the startup has identified the opportunity, but has delivered not just more engagement, but a strong piece of software that still provides the essentials.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is certainly not a Workday,&#8221; said Adam Fisher, a partner at Bessemer, in an interview. &#8220;Our overall thesis has been that HR is only growing in importance. And while engagement is super important, that opportunity is not enough to create the market.&#8221;</p>
<p>The end result is a platform that has a significant shot at building in even more over time. For example, another large area that has been seeing traction in the world of enterprise and B2B software is employee training. Specifically, enterprise learning systems are creating another way to help keep people not only speed on important aspects of how the work, but also engaged at a time when connections are under strain.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Training, a SuccessFactors-style offering, is definitely in our roadmap,&#8221; said Zehavi, who noted they are adding new features all the time. The latest has been compensation, sometimes known as merit increase cycles. &#8220;That is a very complex issue and requires deeper integrations finance and and the CFO&#8217;s office. We streamlined it and made it easy to use. We launched two months ago and it’s on fire. After learning and development the are other modules also down the road.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two months ago, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kubernetes" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kubernetes">Kubernetes <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> observability platform Pixie Labs launched into general availability and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/pixie-labs-raises-9-15m-series-a-round-for-its-kubernetes-observability-platform/">announced</a> a $9.15 million Series A funding round led by Benchmark, with participation from GV. Today, the company is announcing its acquisition by <a href="https://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a>, the publicly traded monitoring and observability platform.</p>
<p>The Pixie Labs brand and product will remain in place and allow <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/new-relic" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="new-relic">New Relic <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to extend its platform to the edge. From the outset, the Pixie Labs team designed the service to focus on providing observability for cloud-native workloads running on Kubernetes clusters. And while most similar tools focus on operators and IT teams, Pixie set out to build a tool that developers would want to use. Using <a href="https://ebpf.io/">eBPF</a>, a relatively new way to extend the Linux kernel, the Pixie platform can collect data right at the source and without the need for an agent.</p>
<p>At the core of the Pixie developer experience are what the company calls &#8220;Pixie scripts.&#8221; These allow developers to write their debugging workflows, though the company also provides its own set of these and anybody in the community can contribute and share them as well. The idea here is to capture a lot of the informal knowledge around how to best debug a given service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re super excited to bring these companies together because we share a mission to make observability ubiquitous through simplicity,&#8221; Bill Staples, New Relic&#8217;s Chief Product Officer, told me. &#8220;[&#8230;] According to IDC, there are 28 million developers in the world. And yet only a fraction of them really practice observability today. We believe it should be easier for every developer to take a data-driven approach to building software and Kubernetes is really the heart of where developers are going to build software.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that New Relic already had a solution for <a href="https://newrelic.com/platform/kubernetes">monitoring Kubernetes clusters</a>. Pixie, however, will allow it to go significantly deeper into this space. &#8220;Pixie goes much, much further in terms of offering on-the-edge, live debugging use cases, the ability to run those Pixie scripts. So it&#8217;s an extension on top of the cloud-based monitoring solution we offer today,&#8221; Staples said.</p>
<p>The plan is to build integrations into New Relic into Pixie&#8217;s platform and to integrate Pixie use cases with New Relic One as well.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Zr5SV0CryU"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/pixie-labs-raises-9-15m-series-a-round-for-its-kubernetes-observability-platform/">Pixie Labs raises $9.15M Series A round for its Kubernetes observability platform</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pixie Labs raises $9.15M Series A round for its Kubernetes observability platform&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/01/pixie-labs-raises-9-15m-series-a-round-for-its-kubernetes-observability-platform/embed/#?secret=Zr5SV0CryU" data-secret="Zr5SV0CryU" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Currently, about 300 teams use the Pixie platform. These range from small startups to large enterprises and as Staples and Asgar noted, there was already a substantial overlap between the two customer bases.</p>
<p>As for why he decided to sell, Pixie co-founder (and former <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> AI CEO Zain Asgar told me that it was all about accelerating Pixie&#8217;s vision.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started Pixie to create this magical developer experience that really allows us to redefine how application developers monitor, secure and manage their applications,&#8221; Asgar said. &#8220;One of the cool things is when we actually met the team at New Relic and we got together with Bill and [New Relic founder and CEO] Lou [Cirne], we realized that there was almost a complete alignment around this vision [&#8230;], and by joining forces with New Relic, we can actually accelerate this entire process.&#8221;</p>
<p>New Relic has recently done a lot of work on open-sourcing various parts of its platform, including its agents, data exporters and some of its tooling. Pixie, too, will now open-source its core tools. Open-sourcing the service was always on the company&#8217;s roadmap, but the acquisition now allows it to push this timeline forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be taking Pixie and making it available to the community through open source, as well as continuing to build out the commercial enterprise-grade offering for it that extends the New Relic one platform,&#8221; Staples explained. Asgar added that it&#8217;ll take the company a little while to release the code, though.</p>
<p>&#8220;The same fundamental quality that got us so excited about Lew as an EIR in 2007, got us excited about Zain and Ishan in 2017 &#8212; absolutely brilliant engineers, who know how to build products developers love,&#8221; Bessemer Ventures General Partner Eric Vishria told me. &#8220;New Relic has always captured developer delight. For all its power, Kubernetes completely upends the monitoring paradigm we’ve lived with for decades.  Pixie brings the same &#8212; easy to use, quick time to value, no-nonsense approach to the Kubernetes world as New Relic brought to APM.  It is a match made in heaven.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.candu.ai/">Candu</a>, a software startup that provides no-code web tools for SaaS apps, announced a $5 million funding round.</p>
<p>TechCrunch caught up with founder <a href="https://twitter.com/jonaappleseed">Jonathan Anderson</a> and lead investor <a href="https://twitter.com/villi">Villi Iltchev</a>, a partner at Two Sigma Ventures, to chat about the deal.</p>
<p>First thing: This round, a bit like Scotch, has aged. It&#8217;s from March. And while it is very common for venture capital rounds to get announced after the fact, a nearly nine-month delay would normally be a stretch. However, Anderson explained that he wanted to hold off on releasing the news until Candu&#8217;s product was in the market. That&#8217;s a valid reason, so we&#8217;re going to chat about the investment despite its age.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The round we&#8217;re discussing today is not Candu&#8217;s first, as the startup previously raised around $1 million after its graduation from <a href="https://www.joinef.com/">Entrepreneur First</a>, an accelerator with a global footprint.</p>
<p>The $5 million investment began like many venture investments do, with an investor getting in touch with a young company months before a transaction is put together. Iltchev reached out to Candu in September of 2019 after hearing about the startup and liking its effort to allow for far-greater personalization of onboarding experiences inside of SaaS apps.</p>
<p>Anyone who has fired up a new business service, only to be given a walkthrough of how a few of the buttons work &#8212; a set of directions that I am sure you also skip &#8212; knows that the help can be generic, and annoying. Candu wants to work on the problem, offering no-code development tools to help non-engineers at companies build tailored pages to help with onboarding. What does that mean? With Candu, a SaaS app could offer different user cohorts nigh-personalized onboarding experiences.</p>
<p>So what? For SaaS companies big and small, effective onboarding is an important method of driving user engagement, a key metric for any modern software company. Why? Active users are less likely to churn, and more likely to expand spend on a service over time. So getting users activated well is no small task.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.walkme.com/">WalkMe</a> and <a href="https://www.pendo.io/">Pendo</a> have built material business by approaching the issue from a different angle. WalkMe last <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/walkme-raises-90m-for-dap-eyes-latin-american-market/">raised $90 million last December</a>, while Pendo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/17/pendo-scores-100m-series-e-on-1-billion-valuation/">picked up $100 million last October</a>.</p>
<p>Candu&#8217;s project was interesting, and it had an obvious market, but the deal didn&#8217;t come together for a few months after the investor and startup met each other. Iltchev asked Candu to stay in touch, and toward the end of 2019 Anderson reached out to alert the investor that some of his peers were circling. That call led to the round that was announced today.</p>
<h2>Superpowers</h2>
<p>No-code startups have the potential to empower workers at companies who have to fight for engineering resources. If more groups in a company can build and deploy product, they will be able to move more quickly, and get more done. And they won&#8217;t have to beg the engineering team for help.</p>
<p>For that reason no-code startups &#8212; and other no-code and low-code projects &#8212; are incredibly interesting. In the case of Candu, if its service finds adoption, marketing and customer success teams may be able to create and tweak onboarding experiences without needing help from other teams. That would not only save time, but could lead to better results as more iterations would be possible.</p>
<p>Candu is not done figuring itself out, however. Co-founder Anderson told TechCrunch that his company is still working on solidifying its product-market fit. That is perfectly reasonable for a startup that is still grinding its way through early seed checks.</p>
<p>Asked what the company expects its annual contract value (ACV) to average out to, Anderson said that the market would guide the company, which only launched its service <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/candu">in late October</a>. For now, Candu lists its prices starting from around $200 per month on up. Those targets provide some context about who it expects to sell to.</p>
<p>Regardless, it&#8217;s now up to the startup to scale its customer base, and turn those early customers into both revenue and learnings, which it can furrow back into its operations and product. Let&#8217;s see how far it can get with its March-era seed investment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The worldwide shift to virtual workplaces has been a blessing and a curse to people with hearing impairments. Having office chatter occur in text rather than speech is more accessible, but virtual meetings are no easier to follow than in-person ones — which is why <a href="https://www.ava.me/">real-time captioning startup Ava</a> has seen a huge increase in users. Riding the wave, the company just announced two new products and a $4.5 million seed round.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ava-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ava-3">Ava <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/21/ava-gives-the-hearing-impaired-a-more-present-voice-in-group-conversations/">previously made its name</a> in the deaf community as a useful live transcription tool for real-life conversations. Start the app up and it would instantly hear and transcribe speech around you, color-coded to each speaker (and named if they activate a QR code). Extremely useful, of course, but when meetings stopped being in rooms and started being in Zooms, things got a bit more difficult.</p>
<p>&#8220;Use cases have shifted dramatically, and people are discovering the fact that most of these tools are not accessible,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Thibault Duchemin told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And while some tools may have limited captioning built in (for example Skype and Google Meet), it may or may not be saved, editable, accurate, or convenient to review. For instance Meet&#8217;s ephemeral captions, while useful, only last a moment before disappearing, and are not specific to the speaker, making them of limited use for a deaf or hard of hearing person trying to follow a multi-person call. And the languages they are available in are limited as well.</p>
<p>As Duchemin explained, it began to seem much more practical to have a separate transcription layer that is not specific to any one service.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2085271" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-header.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085271" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2085271" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-header.jpg" alt="Illustration of a laptop and phone transcribing audio." width="1024" height="560" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-header.jpg 1163w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-header.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-header.jpg?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-header.jpg?resize=768,420 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-header.jpg?resize=680,372 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-header.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2085271" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ava</p></div></p>
<p>Thus Ava&#8217;s new product, a desktop and web app called Closed Captioning, which works with all major meeting services and online content, captioning it with the same on-screen display and making the content accessible via the same account. That includes things like YouTube videos without subtitles, live web broadcasts, and even audio-only content like podcasts, in more than 15 languages.</p>
<p>Individual speakers are labeled, automatically if an app supports it, like Zoom, or by having people in the meeting click a link that attaches their identity to the sound of their voice. (There are questions of privacy and confidentiality here, but they will differ case by case and are secondary to the fundamental capability of a person to participate.)</p>
<p>The transcripts all go to the person&#8217;s Ava app, letting them check through at their leisure or share with the rest of the meeting. That in itself is a hard service to find, Duchemin pointed out.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s actually really complicated,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Today if you have a meeting with four people, Ava is the only technology where you can have accurate labeling of who said what, and that&#8217;s extremely valuable when you think about enterprise.&#8221; Otherwise, he said, unless someone is taking detailed notes — unlikely, expensive, and time-consuming — meetings tend to end up black boxes.</p>
<p>For such high quality transcription, speech-to-text AI isn&#8217;t good enough, he admitted. It&#8217;s enough to follow a conversation, but &#8220;we&#8217;re talking about professionals and students who are deaf or hard of hearing,&#8221; Duchemin said. &#8220;They need solutions for meetings and classes and in-person, and they aren&#8217;t ready to go full AI. They need someone to clean up the transcript, so we provide that service.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2085272" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-app-all.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2085272" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2085272" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-app-all.png" alt="Features of the Ava app." width="1024" height="317" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-app-all.png 8694w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-app-all.png?resize=150,46 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-app-all.png?resize=300,93 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-app-all.png?resize=768,237 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-app-all.png?resize=680,210 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-app-all.png?resize=1536,475 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-app-all.png?resize=2048,633 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ava-app-all.png?resize=50,15 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2085272" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ava</p></div></p>
<p>Ava Scribe quickly brings in a human trained not in direct transcription but in the correction of the product of speech-to-text algorithms. That way a deaf person attending a meeting or class can follow along live, but also be confident that when they check the transcript an hour later it will be exact, not approximate.</p>
<p>Right now transcription tools are being used as value-adds to existing products and suites, he said — ways to attract or retain customers. They aren&#8217;t beginning with the community of deaf and hard of hearing professionals and designing around their needs, which is what Ava has striven to do.</p>
<p>The explosion in popularity and obvious utility of their platform has led to this $4.5M seed round, as well, led by Initialized Capital and Khosla Ventures.</p>
<p>Duchemin said they expected to double the size of their team with the money, and start really marketing and finding big customers. &#8220;We&#8217;re very specialized, so we need a strong business model to grow,&#8221; he said. A strong, unique product is a good place to start, though.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.papercup.com/">Papercup</a>, the U.K.-based AI startup that has developed speech technology that translates people’s voices into other languages and is already being used in the video and television industry, has raised £8 million in funding.</p>
<p>The round was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/localglobe" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="localglobe">LocalGlobe <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Sands Capital Ventures, alongside Sky, GMG Ventures, Entrepreneur First (EF) and BDMI. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/papercup-ai" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="papercup-ai">Papercup <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> says the new capital will be used to invest further into machine learning research and to expand its &#8220;human-in-the-loop&#8221; quality control functionality, which is used to improve and customise the quality of its AI-translated videos.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Papercup’s existing angel investors include William Tunstall-Pedoe, the founder of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/17/sources-say-amazon-acquired-siri-like-evi-app-for-26m-is-a-smartphone-coming/">Evi Technologies</a> &#8212; the company acquired by Amazon to create Alexa &#8212; and Zoubin Ghahramani, former chief scientist and VP of AI at Uber and now part of the Google Brain leadership team.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2017 by Jesse Shemen and Jiameng Gao while going through EF’s company builder program, Papercup is building out an AI and machine learning-based system that it says is capable of translating a person’s voice and expressiveness into other languages. Unlike a lot of text-to-speech, the startup claims the resulting voice translation is “indistinguishable” from human speech, and, perhaps uniquely, it attempts to retain the characteristics of the original speaker&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>Initially, the tech is being targeted at video producers, including already being used by Sky News, Discovery and YouTube stars Yoga with Adriene, along with DIY content creators. It is pitched as a much more scalable and therefore lower-cost alternative to pure human dubbing.</p>
<p>“Most of the world’s video and audio content is shackled to a single language,” says Papercup co-founder and CEO Shemen. “That includes billions of hours of videos on YouTube, millions of podcast episodes, tens of thousands of classes on Skillshare and Coursera, and thousands of hours of content on Netflix. Almost every content owner is scrambling to go international, but there is yet no simple and cost-effective way to translate content beyond subtitling”.</p>
<p>For “deep pocketed studios,” there is of course the option to employ high-end dubbing via a professional dubbing studio and voice actors, but this is far too expensive for most content owners. And even wealthy studios are often constrained in terms of how many languages they can accommodate.</p>
<p>“That leaves the mid and long tail of content owners &#8212; literally 99% of all content &#8212; stranded and incapable of reaching international audiences beyond subtitling,” says Shemen, which, of course, is where Papercup comes into play. “Our aim is to generate translated voices that sound as close to the original speaker as possible”.</p>
<p>To do that, he says that Papercup will need to tackle four things. First up is creating “natural sounding” voices, i.e. how clear and human-like the synthetic voices sound. The second challenge is retaining emotion and pacing to reflect how the original speaker expressed themselves (think: happy, sad, angry etc.). Third is capturing the uniqueness of someone’s voice (e.g. Morgan Freeman, but in German). Lastly, the resulting translation needs the correct alignment of the audio to the video itself.</p>
<p>Explains Shemen: “We started off by making our voices as human-like and natural sounding as possible, where we’ve made quite a significant leap in terms of quality by honing our technology to the task, and today we have one of the best Spanish speech synthesis systems in production.</p>
<p>“We’re now focusing on better retainment and transfer of the original emotion and expressiveness in the original speaker across languages, and meanwhile figuring out what it is exactly that makes for quality dubbing”.</p>
<p>The next challenge and arguably the toughest nut to crack is “speaker adaptation,” described as capturing the uniqueness of someone’s voice. “This is the last layer of adaptation,” notes the Papercup CEO, “but it was also one of our first breakthroughs in our research. While we have models that can accomplish this, we’re focusing more of our time on emotion and expressiveness”.</p>
<p>That’s not to say Papercup is entirely machine-powered, even if it might be one day. The company also employs a “human-in-the-loop” process to make corrections and adjustments to the translated audio track. This includes correcting for any speech recognition or machine translation errors that come up, making adjustments to the timings of the audio, as well as enforcing emotions (e.g. happy, sad) and changing the speed of the generated voice.</p>
<p>How much human-in-the-loop is required depends on the type of content and priorities of the content owners, i.e. how realistic or perfect they need the resulting video to be. In other words, it isn’t a zero-sum game, as good enough will be more than enough for a swathe of content owners at scale.</p>

<p>Asked about the technology’s beginnings, Shemen says Papercup started with research conducted by co-founder and CTO Jiameng Gao “who is incredibly smart and oddly obsessed with speech processing”. Gao completed two Masters at University of Cambridge (in machine learning and speech language technology) and wrote a thesis on speaker adaptive speech processing. It was at Cambridge that he realised that something like Papercup was possible.</p>
<p>“When we started working together at Entrepreneur First at the end of 2017, we built our initial prototype systems that showed that this technology was even possible despite there being no precedent for it,” says Shemen. “Based on early conversations, the demand was clearly overwhelming for what we were building &#8212; it was just a function of actually building something that could be used in a production environment”.</p>
