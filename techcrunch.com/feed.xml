										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rani Therapeutics, a San Jose-based company developing a pill to replace medical injections, went public on Friday. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to</span><a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-223596/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> S-1 filings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, shares were estimated to price between $14 and $16 last week. On Friday, shares debuted slightly lower, around $11. Rani raised about $73 million in its debut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rani’s debut comes amidst a flurry of IPO activity in therapeutics. In 2020, </span><a href="https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/biotech-ipo-performance-tracker/587604/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">71 biotech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> companies went public. Already in 2021, 59 companies have IPO&#8217;ed and even more are on the way. On July 30 alone, </span><a href="https://www.biopharmcatalyst.com/calendars/ipo-calendar"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eight different biotech companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are expected to begin trading, including Rani Therapeutics. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rani Therapeutics, is, as Imran puts it “laser focused” on itself, rather than the IPO activity around it. The decision to go public was partially bolstered by the results of a phase I study– early evidence that the RaniPill, the company’s flagship product could be brought into the clinic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are already in humans, and clearly on a strong path to make oral biologics [a] reality. This is a hot and unique market for life science direction and we’re excited to be driving innovation in this area,” Imran tells TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rani Therapeutics flagship product is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/how-rani-therapeutics-robotic-pill-could-change-subcutaneous-injection-treament/">RaniPill, essentially, a capsule designed to deliver medicines that would usually be delivered via injections</a>. TechCrunch covered the pill in more detail </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/how-rani-therapeutics-robotic-pill-could-change-subcutaneous-injection-treament/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but it works according to a few basic steps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pill is covered by a coating resistant to stomach acid. Once the pill enters the small intestine, the coating dissolves, allowing for a small balloon to inflate. Once that small balloon inflates, medication is delivered by a microneedle (which dissolves after the drug is administered). Then, the rest of the balloon is “excreted through normal digestive processes,” per the company’s S-1 filing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This whole process occurs in a pill that, on the outside, looks like a gel capsule. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is evidence for some conditions suggesting patients prefer oral drugs to injections: for example, studies on cancer patients </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003561/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have illuminated patient preference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for oral therapies rather than regular injections. That&#8217;s not the case for every condition. Some patients show preference long-acting medicines delivered via injection rather than having to take lots of pills (this is the case in for some <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00721-w">HIV patients)</a>. </span></p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s fair to say that needles aren&#8217;t exactly pleasant. <span style="font-weight: 400;">A </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jan.13818"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 review and meta analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 35 studies found that between 20 and 30 percent of young adults are afraid of needles, a fear which can lead some people to avoid medical treatments or vaccines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rani Therapeutics has been developing capsules for drugs that have already been approved by the FDA, but are often administered via regular injections. They include: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Octreotide for acromegaly or neuroendocrine tumors in the GI tract (NETs) </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TNF-alpha inhibitors for psoriatic arthritis </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parathyroid hormone (PTH) for osteoporosis </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human growth hormone (HGH) for HGH deficiency </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parathyroid hormone for hypothyroidism </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The product furthest along in the research cycle is the pill developed to administer octreotide (called RT-101), which was tested in a phase</span><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03798912"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I clinical trial</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on 62 participants. The trial results, partially reported in the S-1 filing, showed 65 percent bioavailability of the octreotide drug, compared to an injection. That suggests that the pills can get the drugs into the body efficiently, though these results are early. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next year, the company plans to initiate two additional Phase I studies on PTH for osteoporosis, and human growth hormone. Studies on the rest of the drugs in the pipeline are scheduled for 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, the company’s goal is to validate the RaniPill independently of specific drugs. The company is pursuing an </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/how-study-and-market-your-device/investigational-device-exemption-ide"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investigational Device Exemption</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (IDE), which would allow the company to test RaniPill in a clinical study without a drug involved. This study aims to establish how safe the product is for repeated dosing, and is slated to begin next year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think we want to continue to generate data with drugs, because we will be making drugs. But nonetheless, it’s important to establish what the platform’s safety and tolerability is,” said Imran.  So that’s quite important as well.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s leadership does have a track record of successful exits in the biotech space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rani Therapeutics was founded in 2012 by Mir Imran, a founder who has already overseen several exits and acquisitions of medical device companies. In 1985, Imran developed an implantable cardiac defibrillator as part of his first company, Intec Systems, which was later acquired by Eli Lilly. Since, he has started 20 different medical device companies, of which 15 have either IPOed or been acquired. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, for now, Rani Therapeutics financials report significant losses. Net losses for 2019 and 2020 totaled $26.6 million and $16.7 million, respectively. As of March 2021, the company was running a deficit of $119.6 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, the company has raised about $211.5  million in funding since inception, without counting cash generated from today’s IPO. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">RaniTherapeutics  has plans to use the $73 million raised during the IPO to fund the IDE study and pursue additional clinical trials. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube earlier this year announced its plans to significantly invest in original creator content for its TikTok competitor, YouTube Shorts, with the introduction of a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/youtube-announces-a-100m-fund-to-reward-top-youtube-shorts-creators-over-2021-2022/"> $100 million YouTube Shorts Fund</a>. The fund will reward creators for their most engaging and most viewed short-form videos over the course of 2021 to 2022, with the goal of quickly scaling creator activity on YouTube&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/youtube-expands-tiktok-rival-shorts-to-the-uk-canada-latin-america-lets-users-tap-all-of-youtube-for-tunes/">new short-form video platform</a>, Shorts, to better rival TikTok. Today, YouTube announced the fund is officially launching and creators will begin to receive their first payouts in August.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2184972" style="width: 321px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184972" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2184972" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shorts-logo.png?w=680" alt="" width="311" height="311" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shorts-logo.png 1215w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shorts-logo.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shorts-logo.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shorts-logo.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shorts-logo.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shorts-logo.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shorts-logo.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shorts-logo.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shorts-logo.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/shorts-logo.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 311px) 100vw, 311px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2184972" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>Every month, YouTube will invite thousands of eligible creators to claim a payment from the fund. These payouts may range anywhere from $100 to $10,000, based on viewership and engagement with their Shorts videos. Reached for comment, YouTube declined to share the exact viewership thresholds creators will have to reach to earn the payouts, saying that those numbers may change from month to month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company told TechCrunch it will determine how it calculates the thresholds by analyzing the best-performing channels and then calculating their bonus based on a number of factors, which includes views, where their audience is located and more. The company also said it wanted to make sure it was rewarding as many creators as possible, which is why it set a minimum payment of $100.</p>
<p>To qualify, creators must produce original content &#8212; not videos that were re-uploaded from other channels or those with watermarks from other social services. That was a problem that Instagram&#8217;s TikTok competitor Reels has faced &#8212; creators often re-used the same content they&#8217;re sharing on TikTok when they publish to Reels. To fight the problem, Instagram even had to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-reels-repost-tiktoks-best-practices-200536658.html">adjust its algorithm to downrank the recycled content. </a></p>
<p>While there are plenty of tools that allow creators to strip the watermark from a video, as well as those that let you edit videos for upload to multiple short-form video platforms, YouTube says it will be using a combination of automation and human reviewers to ensure creators meet its guidelines around original content.</p>
<p>Creators will also need to be 13 or older in the U.S., or the age of majority in other countries and regions, to quality. Those ages 13 to 18 will also need to have a parent or guardian set up their AdSense account, link it to the creator&#8217;s channel and accept the terms, as this is where payments will be directed. All of a creator&#8217;s Shorts videos will count toward their bonuses each month they receive views &#8212; not just the month they were uploaded, YouTube notes.</p>

<p>The channels also need to have uploaded at least one eligible Short in the last 180 days and must follow YouTube’s Community Guidelines, copyright rules and monetization policies. While YouTube Partner Program members can participate in the fund, creators don&#8217;t have to already be monetizing on YouTube to quality for the new Shorts bonuses.</p>
<p>At launch, the fund will support creators in the U.S., Brazil, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Nigeria, Russia, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Over time, it will expand to more markets.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2184973" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184973" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2184973" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-shorts-bonus.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-shorts-bonus.png 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-shorts-bonus.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-shorts-bonus.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-shorts-bonus.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-shorts-bonus.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-shorts-bonus.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/youtube-shorts-bonus.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2184973" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> YouTube</p></div></p>
<p>The company also told us it&#8217;s not looking for any specific types of video to reward, as the fund gets off the ground. Instead, it&#8217;s only looking at the metrics, like the total monthly performance a channel’s Shorts received.</p>
<p>On the one hand, not specifying any video categories or subject matter to lean into gives creators a lot of freedom to experiment when producing Shorts. But on the other, it could also lead creators to simply make more TikTok-like content, but publish it to YouTube instead in hopes of cashing in. That could result in YouTube Shorts feeling a lot like the TikTok clone that it is, rather than allowing it to differentiate itself by the nature of its content.</p>
<p>For comparison, other TikTok rivals, like Pinterest&#8217;s Idea Pins or Snapchat&#8217;s Spotlight aim to leverage what makes their platform unique and deliver that as short-form, public videos. Pinterest&#8217;s Idea Pins are often focused on tutorials or recipe-making, which are popular searches on its service. Spotlight, meanwhile, can feature Snaps &#8212; including those from private accounts, not professionals. That makes some Spotlight videos feel less polished and produced, compared with TikTok or Reels, which fits in with its more casual aesthetic.</p>
<p>YouTube says it will begin reaching out to creators starting next week to let them know if they&#8217;ve qualified for a bonus. The company will send a notification in the YouTube app, which includes the amount of the bonus and details on how to claim it. Creators will then have until the 25th of the month to claim the bonus payment before it expires.</p>

<p>TikTok&#8217;s <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-3-billion">growth</a> and popularity has encouraged a number of social platforms to invest directly in the creator community in hopes of winning back some of their audience. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/facebook-creator-bonuses/">Facebook recently announced</a> its own $1 billion-plus bonus system for videos across both Facebook and Instagram through the end of 2022, including but not limited to Reels videos. Snap initially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/snapchat-launches-a-tiktok-like-feed-called-spotlight-kick-started-by-paying-creators/">said it would distribute</a> $1 million per day through the end of 2020 for top Snaps on Spotlight, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/20/media/snapchat-spotlight/index.html">but later dialed that back</a>. Pinterest announced a much smaller <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/pinterest-announces-500k-creator-fund-creator-code-content-policy-moderation-tools-and-more/">($500,000) creator fund</a> that runs through 2021.</p>
<p>And to counteract all the challenges, TikTok last month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/tiktok-creator-fund-200-million-us/">introduced a $200 million fund</a> for U.S. creators.</p>
<p>With the official launch of the Shorts Fund, YouTube notes it now has 10 ways creators can make money on its platform, including ads, YouTube Premium subscription revenue shares, channel memberships, Super Chat, Super Thanks, Super Stickers, merchandise, ticketing and YouTube BrandConnect.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Substack <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/sit-right-down-and-write-yourself-a-letter">announced</a> last week that it acquired Letter, a platform that encourages written dialogue and debate. The financials of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed, but this acquisition follows Substack&#8217;s recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/substack-confirms-65m-raise-promises-to-rapidly-expand-its-financial-backing-of-newly-independent-writers/">$65 million raise</a>.</p>
<p>Newsletters are all the rage &#8212; Facebook launched its exclusive, celeb-studded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/facebooks-newsletter-platform-bulletin-is-now-live/">Bulletin</a> platform last month, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/twitters-acquisition-strategy-eat-the-public-conversation/">Twitter acquired</a> the newsletter startup Revue earlier this year. Letter doesn&#8217;t publish email newsletters like Substack, but rather, it allows writers to engage in epistolary exchanges about fraught topics like <a href="https://letter.wiki/conversation/968">Brexit</a>, <a href="https://letter.wiki/conversation/789">dating </a>and the <a href="https://letter.wiki/conversation/956">2020 U.S. Presidential election</a>. The idea behind Letter makes sense. Complicated conversations require nuance, yet these online debates too often happen on platforms like Twitter, where short-form tweets make it harder to have nuanced conversations.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could see that Letter, like Substack, was working in opposition to the ad-driven attention economy, attempting to change the rules of engagement for online discourse,&#8221; Substack wrote in its acquisition announcement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But this acquisition may be cause for concern among those already troubled by the controversy Substack faced earlier this year, when <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/why-we-pay-writers">news came out</a> that the platform offered some writers up to six-figure advances as part of its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/11/business/media/substack-newsletter-competition.html">Substack Pro program. </a>The problem wasn&#8217;t that Substack was incentivizing writers to join the platform, but rather, who Substack had hand-picked to pay an advance. Plus, Substack says that it&#8217;s up to the writer to <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/why-we-pay-writers">disclose</a> whether or not they&#8217;re part of Substack Pro, which creates a lack of editorial transparency.</p>
<p>As Substack grew, writers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/substack-backlash/">left jobs</a> at Buzzfeed and the New York Times, lured by pay raises and cautious optimism. But as more writers came forward as part of the Substack Pro program, Substack was criticized for <a href="https://doyles.substack.com/p/in-queers-we-trust-all-others-pay">subsidizing</a> anti-trans rhetoric, since some of these writers used their newsletters to share such views. Substack admits it&#8217;s <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/substacks-view-of-content-moderation">not entirely apolitical</a>, but the choices of which writers to subsidize, and its decision to use only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/substack-explains-its-hands-off-approach-to-content-moderation/">lightweight moderation tactics</a>, are a strong political choice in an era of the internet when content moderation has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/trump-banned-from-twitter/">tangible effect</a> on global politics. Some writers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/substack-backlash/">even chose</a> to leave the platform.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="OMM0Onzvsh"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/substack-backlash/">Substack faces backlash over the writers it supports with big advances</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Substack faces backlash over the writers it supports with big advances&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/substack-backlash/embed/#?secret=OMM0Onzvsh" data-secret="OMM0Onzvsh" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Annalee Newitz, a non-binary writer who since left the platform, <a href="https://thehypothesis.substack.com/p/heres-why-substacks-scam-worked-so">wrote on Substack</a>, &#8220;Their leadership are deciding what kinds of writing and writers are worthy of financial compensation. [&#8230;] Substack is taking an editorial stance, paying writers who fit that stance, and <a href="https://on.substack.com/p/why-we-pay-writers">refusing to be transparent</a> about who those people are.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, when Substack described its new acquisition<a href="https://on.substack.com/p/sit-right-down-and-write-yourself-a-letter"> Letter</a> as a platform that encourages people to &#8220;argue in good faith instead of dropping bombs for retweets,&#8221; it made the acquisition worthy of a deeper examination. Statements like this sound agreeable, yet this kind of language often appears in arguments that deem social justice a threat to free speech. But free speech shouldn&#8217;t mean <a href="https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/you-cant-censor-away-extremism-or">endorsing hate speech</a>.</p>
<p>Substack wants to position itself as a neutral platform, and for many writers, it&#8217;s a valuable way to make money, especially in an unstable journalism industry. But given that some users have already become skeptical of who Substack chooses to financially incentivize, it&#8217;s worth examining the implications of buying Letter, a platform that includes writers associated with the so-called <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/5/10/17338290/intellectual-dark-web-rogan-peterson-harris-times-weiss">intellectual dark web</a> in its group of twenty &#8220;<a href="https://letter.wiki/members">featured writers</a>.&#8221; On Letter, some of these writers question the <a href="https://letter.wiki/conversation/893" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://letter.wiki/conversation/893&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627744096461000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFRSn278lAxFPQQsNtJicj7vWmROw">validity of childhood transgender identity</a> and refer to the statement &#8220;trans women are women&#8221; as <a href="https://letter.wiki/conversation/1082" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://letter.wiki/conversation/1082&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1627744096461000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHg4z74k3wV3d-On5MFzQ06kWdwFQ">propaganda</a>, for example. Substack has already <a href="https://gen.medium.com/substack-is-not-a-neutral-platform-8fc5bdf8e5f2">lost the trust</a> of some trans and gender non-conforming writers, and the content on its newly acquired Letter won&#8217;t help rebuild that trust.</p>
<p>In addition, Letter co-founder Clyde Rathbone <a href="https://letter.wiki/conversation/825">wrote in support</a> of a controversial <a href="https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/">letter published in Harper&#8217;s Magazine</a>, which called for the &#8220;concerted repudiation of cancel culture.&#8221; But critics of the letter point out that free speech isn&#8217;t really at stake here.</p>
<p>The open letter had been<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> signed by over 150 prominent writers </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8212; like Gloria Steinem, Noam Chomsky (a Letter author), and Malcolm Gladwell (a Bulletin author). It argued:</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8220;We need to preserve the possibility of good-faith disagreement without dire professional consequences.&#8221; These &#8220;professional consequences&#8221; echoed the predicament that J.K. Rowling &#8212; who also signed the letter &#8212; <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/j-k-rowling-faces-backlash-after-tweeting-support-transphobic-researcher-n1104971">had put herself in.</a> After denying that trans women are women, her reputation suffered. Some might call that &#8220;cancel culture,&#8221; but others might call it the refusal to continue to platform people who perpetuate harmful beliefs.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The panic over &#8216;cancel culture&#8217; is, at its core, a reactionary backlash,&#8221; <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cancel-culture-harpers-jk-rowling-scam_n_5f0887b4c5b67a80bc06c95e">wrote</a> journalist Michael Hobbes. &#8220;Conservative elites, threatened by changing social norms and an accelerating generational handover, are attempting to amplify their feelings of aggrievement into a national crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>Substack says it plans to use the acquisition of Letter to help writers collaborate, and that it won&#8217;t integrate Letter into its platform. Rather, the Letter team will relocate from Australia to San Francisco to &#8220;bring their expertise to help build more of the infrastructure and support.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Substack if the anti-trans content on Letter is cause for concern within the company, given the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/substack-backlash/">recent backlash</a> against the platform.</p>
<div dir="auto">&#8220;We think that open debate and disagreement are absolutely part of having free press, and that includes views that you or I may not like,&#8221; a representative from Substack said. &#8220;Anyone could browse Substack and find things they agree with and things they don’t agree with. Substack has no ad-driven feeds pushing content based on virality and outrage, and there is a direct relationship between writers and readers who can opt out of that anytime. So the bar for us to intervene in that relationship and tell writers what they should be saying is really high, and the fact that Letter allowed writers to openly debate and discuss is consistent with that philosophy.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div dir="auto">We don&#8217;t know yet how or if Letter will change Substack &#8212; but given the existing discourse around the kind of content Substack pays for, Substack isn&#8217;t demonstrating &#8220;good faith&#8221; with this acquisition.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Thoma Bravo-owned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/sophos/">Sophos</a> has announced its second takeover in as many weeks with the acquisition of Seattle-based <a href="http://DevSecOps">DevSecOps</a> startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/refactr-inc">Refactr.</a></p>
<p>Refactr was founded in 2017 and offers an automation platform that helps cybersecurity and DevOps teams to collaboratively operate. The platform, which is used by the nonprofit Center for Internet Security and the U.S. Air Force’s Platform One, features a drag-and-drop low-code pipeline builder and DevOps-friendly features that encourage disparate teams to collaborate on the same agile workflow process, according to the company.</p>
<p>“Our mission is to enable DevSecOps to become the modern approach to automation, where cybersecurity use cases like Security Operation, Automation and Response (SOAR), Extended Detection and Response (XDR), compliance, cloud security, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/identity-access-management/">Identity and Access Management</a> (IAM) become building blocks for DevSecOps solutions,” said Michael Fraser, CEO and co-founder of Refactr.</p>
<p>The deal, the terms of which were not disclosed, will see Refactr’s entire team of developers and engineers join Sophos. While Sophos says it will continue to develop and offer Refactr’s DevSecOps automation platform to existing customers, it will also embed its SOAR capabilities to its own managed threat response (MTR) and XDR solutions.</p>

<p>&#8220;With Refactr, Sophos will fast track the integration of such advanced SOAR capabilities into our adaptive cybersecurity ecosystem, the basis for our XDR product and MTR service,” said Joe Levy, chief technology officer at Sophos.</p>
<p>Sophos’ acquisition of Refactr lands shortly after it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/sophos-acquires-braintrace-to-supercharge-its-threat-detection-capabilities/">announced plans to buy Braintrace</a>, a cybersecurity startup that provides organizations visibility into suspicious network traffic patterns. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/thoma-bravo-completes-3-9b-sophos-acquisition/">Thoma Bravo completed its $3.9 billion takeover of Sophos in 2020</a> as the company continues to increase its reach in the cybersecurity space.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.marvell.com/">Marvell</a> announced this morning it has reached an agreement to acquire <a href="https://www.innovium.com/">Innovium</a> for $1.1 billion in an all-stock deal. The startup, which raised over $400 million according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/innovium-inc">Crunchbase data</a>, makes networking ethernet switches optimized for the cloud.</p>
<p>Marvell president and CEO Matt Murphy sees Innovium as a complementary piece to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/more-chip-industry-action-as-marvell-is-acquiring-inphi-for-10b/">the $10 billion Inphi acquisition</a> last year, giving the company, which makes copper-based chips, more ways to work across modern cloud data centers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Innovium has established itself as a strong cloud data center merchant switch silicon provider with a proven platform, and we look forward to working with their talented team who have a strong track record in the industry for delivering multiple generations of highly successful products,&#8221; Marvell CEO Matt Murphy said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Innovium founder and CEO Rajiv Khemani, who will remain as an advisor post-close, told a familiar tale from a startup CEO being acquired, seeing the sale as a way to accelerate more quickly as part of a larger organization than it could on its own. &#8220;As we engaged with Marvell, it became clear that our data center optimized portfolio combined with Marvell’s scale, leading technology platform and complementary portfolio, can accelerate our growth and vision of delivering breakthrough switch silicon for the cloud and edge,&#8221; he wrote <a href="https://www.innovium.com/blog-post/marvell-to-acquire-innovium-for-1-1-billion-on-to-next-phase-of-growth/">in a company blog post</a> announcing the deal.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cwxxQpUZk7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/semiconductors-in-2021/">2021 will be a calmer year for semiconductors and chips (except for Intel)</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;2021 will be a calmer year for semiconductors and chips (except for Intel)&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/semiconductors-in-2021/embed/#?secret=cwxxQpUZk7" data-secret="cwxxQpUZk7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company, which was founded in 2014, raised more than $143 million last year on a post-money valuation of $1.3 billion, <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/117920-17/company/profile#deal-history">according to PitchBook data</a>. The question is, was this a reasonable deal for the company given that valuation?</p>
<p>No company wants to sell for less than it was last valued by its investors. In some cases, such deals can still be accretive for early backers of the selling concern, but not always. In this case TechCrunch is not privy to all the details of the Innovium cap table and what its later investors may have built into their deals with the company in the form of downside protection; such measures can tilt the value of the sale of a company more toward its later and final investors. This is usually managed at the expense of its earlier backers and employees.</p>
<p>Still, the Innovium deal should not be seen as a failure. Building a company that sells for north of $1 billion in equity value is impressive. The deal appears to be slightly smaller in enterprise value terms. In the business world, enterprise value is a useful method of valuing the true cost of an acquisition. In the case of Innovium, a large cash position, what was described as “Innovium cash and exercise proceeds expected at closing of approximately $145 million,” lowered the cost of the transaction to a more modest $955 million in net outlays.</p>
<p>Our general perspective is that the sale is probably not the outcome that Innovium’s backers had hoped for, but that it may still prove lucrative to early workers and early investors, and still works at that lower figure. It’s also notable how in today’s market of mega-rounds and surfeit unicorns, an exit north of the $1 billion mark in equity terms can be viewed as a disappointment in any terms. Innovium is selling for around the price that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/facebook-to-acquire-instagram-for-1-billion/">Facebook paid for Instagram</a> in 2012, a deal that at the time was so large that it dominated technology headlines around the world.</p>
<p>But with so much capital available today, private valuations are soaring and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">mega deals abound</a>. And recent rounds north of $100 million, much like Innovium’s 2020-era, $143 million round, can set companies up with rich valuations and a narrow path in front of them to beat those heightened expectations.</p>
<p>What likely happened? Perhaps Innovium found itself with more cash than opportunities to spend it; perhaps it simply needed a large partner to help it better sell into its market. With expected revenues of $150 million in Marvell’s fiscal 2023, its next fiscal period, Innovium did not fail to reach scale. It may have simply grown well as a private, independent company, and stalled out after its last round.</p>
<p>Regardless, a billion-dollar exit is a billion-dollar exit. The deal is expected to close by the end of this year. While both company boards have approved the deal, it still must clear regular closing hurdles, including approval by Innovium&#8217;s private stock holders.</p>

<p><em><strong>Update 08/03/2021 @ 10:44 AM EST:</strong> The launch attempt has been officially scrubbed for today, and a new timeline for the next attempt is set to be confirmed. We&#8217;ll provide updates as they become available.</em></p>
<p>Boeing is all set to make a second attempt at flying its Starliner CST-100 commercial crew spacecraft to the International Space Station, performing a key demonstration ahead of actually putting astronauts on board for the final big launch before it can claim the spacecraft is certified for regular flight by NASA. Today&#8217;s &#8216;Orbital Flight Test 2&#8217; (OFT-2) mission is a re-do of one that Boeing and NASA first performed in December, 2019.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That first try was meant to be the only one, but it didn&#8217;t go quite as planned, with software errors resulting in a mistaken fire of the craft&#8217;s engines, exhausting the fuel required to get to the Space Station for automated docking as planned. Boeing instead looked to salvage the test with a landing attempt, which also encountered a problem that was corrected before a good touchdown.</p>
<p>While Boeing originally wanted to re-fly the mission sometime last year, the schedule was pushed out for a variety of reasons, and a global pandemic occurring in the interim can&#8217;t have helped. Both Boeing and NASA conducted extensive investigations into not just the cause of the specific problem that the OFT-1 mission encountered, but the culture and processes of Boeing&#8217;s software development as well.</p>
<p>Space industry enthusiasts may already know that Boeing&#8217;s Starliner is one of two commercial spacecraft NASA contracted to ferry its astronauts to the International Space Station, the other being SpaceX. Elon Musk&#8217;s private launch company succeeded with its orbital flight test, and subsequently flew humans aboard its final demonstration launch, and is now a regular service provider for NASA, having carried two groups of astronauts to the ISS for standard tours of duty.</p>
<p>Accordingly, all eyes will be on Boeing to see if it can pull this off cleanly, especially given how much time it&#8217;s had since the last flight to correct any errors and prepare. The launch is set for 1:20 PM ET, with live coverage via the stream above kicking off around 12:30 PM ET.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Draper Esprit, another British venture capital firm, moved from the AIM to the LSE proper, with a secondary listing on Euronext Dublin.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We cover a lot of venture capital news here at TechCrunch. New funds, partner changes, the funding rounds themselves &#8212; the list is long. Lately, we&#8217;ve had to touch on rolling funds, solo GPs and a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/"> faster-than-ever investing cadence</a> that has rewritten the rules of venture investing. Gone are the days when investors can take weeks, let alone months, to get into a hot deal in today&#8217;s turbocharged private markets.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s another venture capital trend worth discussing: venture capital firms going public. This July, for example, London-based Forward Partners<a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/discover/news-and-insights/london-stock-exchange-welcomes-forward-partners-aim"> went public on the AIM</a>, a sub-market of the well-known London Stock Exchange. Augmentum Fintech is another example of a<a href="https://augmentum.vc/investors/results-and-analyst-coverage/#announcements"> London-listed venture capital firm</a>. The investing group focuses on European fintech.</p>
<p>Most recently, Draper Esprit, another British venture capital firm,<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/other/draper-esprit-floats-to-become-largest-tech-vc-on-londons-main-market/ar-AAMsV6K"> moved</a> from the AIM to the LSE proper, with a secondary listing on Euronext Dublin. TechCrunch has cited Esprit partners in our explorations of the European venture capital scene in the past, especially<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/late-stage-capital-is-having-a-cascading-effect-on-european-vc-activity/"> in our regular digs</a> through the startup hub&#8217;s numbers.</p>
<p>To understand why Draper Esprit not only decided to stay public but doubled down on its structure by moving to the main boards in London and Dublin, we got on the horn with the firm&#8217;s co-founder,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stuart-chapman-22a10a/"> Stuart Chapman</a>. What follows is an edited and condensed transcript of our call. Coming up, The Exchange has analysis and further interviews about whether the trend of floating venture capital firms may spread, and why other investing groups opted in. But first, highlights from our chat with Chapman.</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch: We have a bunch of questions about the change in listing, but let&#8217;s start with how long ago you began this transition.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stuart Chapman: </strong>I co-founded Esprit with<a href="https://draperesprit.com/news/thank-you-simon"> Simon Cook</a> back in 2006, and after a 10-year journey of raising conventional funds, we were coming to the point of raising our fourth fund. But we were having frustrating meetings with limited partners who were trying to pigeonhole us, and at the same time, the London market was getting more and more frustrated that private companies were staying private longer and they would not have access to them. I think we were down to ARM as the last true bastion of tech companies on the London Exchange, so we were approached by a group of City funds to raise our fourth fund through a public market listing.</p>
<p>The junior market in London was very helpful for that, and we spent five happy years on AIM, raising money annually &#8212; until we crossed over the billion [sterling] capitalization mark. By then, it was quite obvious that if we want to fulfill the same ambition and growth over the next five years, we were going to need to step up onto a bigger market that was going to give us wider access to funds and [expand our] attraction to a much larger group of people. Part of our mission at Draper Esprit is to democratize venture capital, as Simon would say; and [being listed on the main market] increases that opportunity.</p>
<p>When we started out on the AIM, we raised capital from professional funds&#8217; tech enthusiasts, who were positively biased. Unfortunately, there&#8217;s not very many of them, and once you have exhausted that, then you move down into the more general funds &#8212; maybe funds with an angle on the U.K., funds with an angle on technology. But by their very nature, they tend to be small-cap funds, and there&#8217;s not that many of them in the U.K. So, by stepping up, we enable ourselves to go into more generous funds as well as tech funds [that] have a minimum bar.</p>
<p><strong>And should we now expect to see Draper Esprit raise more capital per annum?</strong></p>
<p>In a perfect world, the answer is no, because realizations equal investments, so you are self-sustaining. The one thing I would say about Draper Esprit is that we are trying to be innovative. It shocks me that venture capital backs some of the most mind-blowing tech advances in our history over the last 70 years using the same legal structure as a 1958 property vehicle in New York. I don&#8217;t get it! Surely, we can reinvent and push ourselves forward as much as we push our entrepreneurs. So long story short, Simon and I never opted to rest. We always wanted to see if we could create the next thing that would help entrepreneurs be more successful.</p>
<p><strong>Talking about innovation in venture capital models, what&#8217;s the main motivation for your use of retail investment platform PrimaryBid? Is it to open the door for more regular folks to invest, or is it a really material way to add capital to Draper Esprit?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the former. If you go back to 2010, we launched our [Enterprise Investment Scheme] product &#8212; in the U.K., the EIS is a tax wrapper, where private individuals can invest into tech businesses and receive 30% tax credit; and then, if it goes well, it&#8217;s tax-free. It&#8217;s a great government initiative. However, whenever a government interferes in a market, it goes to the lowest denominator, and most people in the industry were using it to enable investors to gain tax credit. Whereas we said: That&#8217;s silly; you should use it to enable people to back the best possible businesses, and then the tax credit is just a bonus.</p>
<p>So what we did back in 2010 [was] we enabled X entrepreneurs, X people in the tech ecosystem, to participate in the Draper Esprit EIS program to be part of this democratizing equity. Today, that&#8217;s about £150 million in the EIS vehicle, and about £50 million in the VCT, which is another U.K. tax-related vehicle where you get the same benefits &#8212; so it&#8217;s now over £200 million from small individuals. The idea for us is to extend our ecosystem out into influential people.</p>

<p><strong>How do you feel about having opened the way for other funds to go public?</strong></p>
<p>Personally, and at Draper Esprit, we are big supporters of innovation, so we have helped Mark Boggett at Seraphim [and shared information and] our path. And then Nic Brisbourne &#8230; was an ex-colleague of mine and Simon&#8217;s, so we actually helped Nic, but we also invested in Forward Partners as a way of showing our support to what he was doing through our fund of funds program.</p>
<p>I think where we are very different is where we get confused with the more technology transfer shops. IP Group [for example is] a great model and it&#8217;s got real longevity [and has been] in the market much longer than us. But that&#8217;s not what we do. They’re looking to back computer science from an early stage in universities. And so, yes, we&#8217;re supportive of others following in our footsteps and we will be big fans of having much wider diversity.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you investing in other funds, and does it open up your capital’s geographic footprint? </strong></p>
<p>Two reasons, to be very honest with you. One is consistent with the previous point, which is [that] Europe wins when it has a really strong ecosystem. And, historically, Europe has founded seed funds in a haphazard way. Finland, for example, had 80 programs to raise early-stage capital. Regions were granted seed funds, but they had no follow-on capital.</p>
<p>No one realized that venture capital was an escalator, and unless you could pass the baton to the next person, [startups] have to do it themselves. But if you have to do it yourself, you don’t create an ecosystem.</p>
<p>The first point was how do we build an ecosystem, consistent with how we get more people into venture capital. If you have a solid ecosystem, then you bring in headhunters, you bring in talent, you bring in bankers, lawyers, you bring in advisers, you bring in the geniuses.</p>
<p>The second reason is that venture capital is quite constrained. If you raise a fund, it is very, very rarely permissible to invest it in other funds. Going back to Simon and I and our quest to be innovative, [we asked] well, why can&#8217;t we invest in early-stage funds, and work with them as partners, and [be their] go-to Series A, Series B fund.</p>
<p><em>[<strong>TechCrunch note</strong>: The firm then drew up a 2&#215;2 matrix, with geography on one side, and skillset on the other. Draper Esprit divided the world into niches where it was strong and weak, and geographies where it was strong and weak. Where it was weak twice, it would partner with other funds, perhaps investing in them. This helped ensure ready deal flow.]</em></p>
<p>By partnering, we put ourselves into an area where we could benefit from their talent [and geographic focus], and they benefit from our capital, and it has been a phenomenal success. We are now in about 42 funds across Europe. The first commitment was with £75 [million] and we&#8217;ve just committed a second £75 [million] to the program. So, we’re at £150 million, [making us] one of the largest private commercial investors.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your take on Ireland, and do you see it as more than a gateway to Europe? </strong></p>
<p>The Irish story has a very long heritage. They always used to be our largest shareholder, the Irish government, through the<a href="https://isif.ie"> Ireland Strategic Investment Fund</a>. They might be the second or third largest shareholder that we still have, but there is a very long relationship between Simon and I and the investment group over there.</p>
<p>And Ireland is renowned for great education, whether that be in the south through Trinity and UCD [in Dublin], or whether that be the north through Queen&#8217;s [University Belfast]. So, there&#8217;s been a great education system, great engineering infrastructure. They have greatly benefited from the Facebooks of the world, and the Googles of the world having [offices] in Ireland. That&#8217;s all the positives, and we have two investors in Ireland.</p>
<p>The downside is that it is relatively small. The numbers of Series A and later-stage growth deals that come out of Ireland are still a lot less than other cities. So we are fans of Ireland; the talent there is fantastic, but it’s a part of an ecosystem instead of another London or another Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>Where is Draper Esprit hoping to find the next great startups? Is there a sector or two that you find particularly exciting?</strong></p>
<p>In fintech, we&#8217;re taking an unfashionable approach. You have large incumbents with very outdated systems, but a very loyal and a very high degree of trust customer base. And then you have the regulators in Europe which are very positive towards innovation and incumbents and challengers. I hear my American colleagues are less complimentary about the SEC.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re in an environment where people are being encouraged to challenge the big banks. But they don&#8217;t have trust, and they don&#8217;t have the balance sheet. So, where we are currently attacking &#8212; we genuinely believe that the big guys need to update these legacy systems, and they&#8217;re not going to throw them away. And so, the only way you can update is you have to take off slivers of your book, of your market, and update it bit by bit. These projects are, if not tens, hundreds of millions [of pounds]. [It’s a] lucrative customer base that needs to adopt technology.</p>
<p><strong>But updating that old tech would likely require fintech startups?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s our strategy. The reason why I say it is not fashionable is because it doesn&#8217;t touch the consumer. It&#8217;s quite dull, and [it has] very long sales cycles. When you look at the genius within the teams that we&#8217;re backing, it&#8217;s that very in-depth [knowledge] where the sector views them as experts, the sector views and as the go-to people. So it&#8217;s a very high barrier to entry, which is why I think Europe does very well compared to [the U.S.] in this area because to actually try and attack those European startups from an overseas perspective is quite difficult.</p>
<p><em>More to come shortly; stay tuned.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Three-and-half months after launching <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-brings-touch-id-to-the-magic-keyboard/">the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID</a>, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/mac/accessories">is finally breaking it out from its iMac bundle</a>. The accessory is now available as a standalone through Apple Stores and the company’s site.</p>
<p>There are two versions: the standard and a longer model with a numeric keypad (pretty much what the company offers with all of its Magic Keyboards), running $149 and $179, respectively. There’s also a $99 version that keeps the new rounded, compact design, but drops the Touch ID in favor of a key that locks the system. But where’s the fun in that?</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2184950" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184950" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2184950" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="183" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png 3674w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png?resize=150,27 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png?resize=300,54 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png?resize=768,138 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png?resize=680,122 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png?resize=1536,275 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png?resize=2048,367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/MagicKeyboard_TouchID1.png?resize=50,9 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2184950" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All of the models have keys devoted to Spotlight, Dictation, Do Not Disturb and Emoji (I ended up disabling the latter on mine, because I couldn’t avoid accidental presses <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />).</p>
<p>An important caveat in all of this: Touch ID only works on Macs running the M1 chip, which disqualifies a pretty massive chunk of the Macs currently on the market. If you do own one of those fancy new systems, the feature can be used for secure logins, purchases and the like. The limitation appears to be a result of Touch ID&#8217;s use of the Secure Enclave found on Apple&#8217;s new chip.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After months of testing with upwards of 100,000 beta testers, Citizen today is launching its premium Protect offering for all users. The subscription service runs $20 a month and opens up a number of features on the app.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Chief among the new paid features is a “Get Agent” button, which offers access to a Citizen operator for a number of different scenarios. The company says it exists for instances where a user “may not want to be seen calling 911.” </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Whether that’s a matter of personal safety or other issues around calling the police no doubt depends on both the user and situation. The agents effectively work as a conduit to emergency operators.</span></p>
<p>For many, Citizen&#8217;s various controversies have overshadowed its features in recent years. Initially after its launch as &#8220;Vigilante,&#8221; the app made news earlier this year for launching a private <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7evbx/citizen-app-private-security-leaked-emails">&#8220;personal rapid response service&#8221;</a> fleet of vehicles and a<a href="https://twitter.com/cerisecastle/status/1393797781056225280"> reward for a person wrongly accused</a> of starting a Los Angeles wildfire.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our Protect Agents are highly trained safety experts who are equipped to help in a variety of stressful or uncertain situations,” the company write about the new service. “They personalize your experience to your situation. They can escalate to 911, provide first responders with your precise location, alert your designated emergency contacts, navigate you to a safe location or simply stay connected with you and monitor you until you feel safe again.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="h3rVoIwpm1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/10/banned-crime-reporting-app-vigilante-returns-as-citizen-says-its-report-incident-feature-will-be-pulled/">Banned crime reporting app Vigilante returns as Citizen, says its &#8216;report incident&#8217; feature will be pulled</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Banned crime reporting app Vigilante returns as Citizen, says its &#8216;report incident&#8217; feature will be pulled&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/10/banned-crime-reporting-app-vigilante-returns-as-citizen-says-its-report-incident-feature-will-be-pulled/embed/#?secret=h3rVoIwpm1" data-secret="h3rVoIwpm1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The other key feature here is a new Protect Mode, which again, offers quick access to the aforementioned agent. When enabled in a questionable situation, the app will live monitor the user’s audio feed, using AI to detect for things like screams, offering up a connection to the agent. If you don’t respond, it will auto connect you. Users can also shake the phone twice to access the agent directly.</p>
<p>A recent<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90639153/citizen-public-safety-surveillance"> job listing notes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this role, you will be communicating with users who are in need of assistance in potentially unsafe conditions. You will be responsible for guiding difficult conversations and using your best judgement in determining the severity of these situations in real-time. You will be at the frontlines of helping users who feel unsafe in their surroundings and offer direct assistance and escalation to 911.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s a potentially useful service for those looking for a panic button app of sorts &#8212; akin to an offering like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/23/match-group-invests-in-noonlight-to-power-new-safety-features-in-tinder-and-other-dating-apps/">Noonlight</a>. But the question remains whether Citizen is the service best positioned to provide such an offering, given the red flags in its history.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Launched in 2016, the app was initially</span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/02/controversial-crime-reporting-app-vigilante-banned-from-app-store/"> banned from the App Store</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> over concerns about vigilantism (perhaps not a stretch, given its original name/positioning). As it has expanded beyond New York, the rebranded app has continued to raise flags on a national level.</span></p>
<p>Earlier this year, its crime-spotting crowdsourcing was expanded to include branded vehicles, which patrolled Los Angeles. &#8220;The broad master plan was to create a privatized secondary emergency response network,&#8221; a source <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7evbx/citizen-app-private-security-leaked-emails">told Motherboard</a> at the time. The company later added that it had no plans to extend the service after its initial pilot.</p>
<p>That same month, the service’s CEO offered a $30,000 reward for someone suspected of starting a Los Angeles wildfire. The service later apologized for sending out a photo of the wrong person that raked in more than 800,000 views. &#8220;We deeply regret our mistake and are working to improve our internal processes to prevent this from happening again,” the company <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/21/citizen-app-reward-falsely-accused/">wrote in a statement</a>.</p>
<p>Citizen is currently available in 20 U.S. cities. The new Protect Mode service launches today for iOS. An Android version is in the works.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founded in 2017, Arizona-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/aira/">Aira</a> didn’t waste any time proving out its technology. We’ve written about the company’s wireless charging a few times over the years, including the “FreePower” technology it has baked into Nomad’s charging pads, which brings a more streamlined version of the Apple’s abandoned AirPower. The tech allows for users to charge up to three objects at once, without having to futz with their precise placement on the pad.</p>

<p>Today, the startup announced that it has raised a $12 million seed round, primarily led by private investors, including Jawad Ashan, Lori Greiner and Robert Herjavec.  The funding will go toward expanding the company’s reach beyond consumer device charging, into the worlds of enterprise, automotive and hospitality, as well as the development of a 2.0 version of its charging tech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“This new round of funding is a game changer when it comes to accelerating our capacity for innovation,” co-founder and CEO Jake Slatnick said in a release. “With so many partnerships in our pipeline, a 2.0 version of FreePower on the horizon, and Jawad having just joined our board, this is an inflection point for Aira.”</p>

<p>As we noted late last year, Aira has already made some headway in automotive. Late last year, it announced funding from auto parts supply giant Motherson, which is also part of this round. The deal was a pretty clear indication that the firm was pushing into integrating its wireless modules into cars &#8212; a welcome addition, as many automakers have traditionally lacked consumer electronics-friendly amenities.</p>
<p>Neither party announced any specific car partners at the time &#8212; or now, for that matter. But Aira notes that it and Motherson are teaming up to create automotive-grade FreePower modules.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2184829" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2184829" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2184829" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Aira-FreePower-Bedside-Table-Integration-Close-Up.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Aira-FreePower-Bedside-Table-Integration-Close-Up.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Aira-FreePower-Bedside-Table-Integration-Close-Up.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Aira-FreePower-Bedside-Table-Integration-Close-Up.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Aira-FreePower-Bedside-Table-Integration-Close-Up.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Aira-FreePower-Bedside-Table-Integration-Close-Up.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Aira-FreePower-Bedside-Table-Integration-Close-Up.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Aira-FreePower-Bedside-Table-Integration-Close-Up.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Copy-of-Aira-FreePower-Bedside-Table-Integration-Close-Up.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2184829" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Aira</p></div></p>
<p>“Current wireless charging technology is not built for moving environments, leaving consumers and automakers underwhelmed,” Aira says in a release issued today. “In-car charging surfaces with FreePower, on the other hand, are able to support devices shifting around while driving, multi-device charging, surfaces of any size, and firmware updates for future enhancements and compatibility. They can also deliver high-power charging while maintaining stringent safety and regulatory standards.”</p>
<p>The news also sees Axon  CFO Jawad Ashan joining Aira’s board of directors.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Constance Freedman and Liza Benson have built up a network of more than 700 executives across the real estate, finance, insurance and home services industries.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Since 2015, Constance Freedman, founder and managing partner of <a href="https://www.moderneventures.com/">Moderne Ventures</a>, and partner Liza Benson have built up a network of more than 700 executives across the real estate, finance, insurance and home services industries.</p>
<p>Today, their early-stage venture capital firm buttoned up an oversubscribed second fund, raising $200 million this time, to infuse capital into startups in and around those industries. Moderne’s newest fund includes new and returning high-profile strategic partners like AvalonBay Communities, Camden Property Trust, Greystar, JBG SMITH, Leading Real Estate Companies of the World, funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management and Realogy. The Chicago-based firm now has $350 million in assets under management.</p>
<p>Freedman’s background is in real estate, technology and venture, spending three years in sales and leasing before the “dot-com” days. After getting her MBA at Harvard, she turned toward investing, launching a fund in 2008 that focused on information and media, as well as working with the National Association of Realtors, which wanted to invest in real estate tech. That $20 million fund became the predecessor fund to Moderne Ventures and where a lot of what the firm does now came from, Freedman told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In fact, a big part of their strategy is looking at companies outside and bringing them in, Freedman said.</p>
<p>“Industries like real estate are cyclical, so you don’t want to be beholden to one industry,” she added. “If a company has that as its beachhead, but can expand into other industries, the bigger the market and bigger the returns for investors. We will also have a stronger fund as a result.”</p>
<p>Moderne Ventures writes first checks of between $4 million and $7 million, and its sweet spot is companies with revenue of $2 million to $10 million. Most of its investments are late seed to early Series B.</p>
<p>To date, the firm has investments in more than 100 companies, including five unicorns, three IPOs and dozens of accretive financing events in the past year, Freedman said. Notable investments in the portfolio include ICON, Porch, Better Mortgage, Hippo Insurance, Homesnap (acquired by Costar), MotoRefi, Super, EasyKnock and Kaiyo. For its new fund, Moderne Ventures has invested in seven companies so far.</p>
<p>In addition to its fund, Moderne runs an industry immersion program called the Moderne Passport, to connect startups with that network of over 700 industry executives and corporate partners that can benefit from their services.</p>
<p>The program includes about 80 companies, and Freedman said Moderne will “make meaningful investments in about a third of them.” There is a class open right now, and the firm will have another one in seven to 10 months.</p>
<p>The firm offers a hands-on approach aimed at affecting a company’s growth, including go-to-market strategy. Moderne facilitates over 1,000 meetings between companies and its network each year, often turning into pilot programs.</p>
<p>Speaking about the ton of artificial intelligence technology applications within its core focus industries, Freedman said more than $30 million is spent on marketing to people who aren’t real buyers, but are just looking. Rather, Moderne Ventures is using AI and data analytics to help companies market to the right people.</p>
<p>“We create a lower or no-cost way for partners to try before they buy to remove the sales friction,” she added. “In return, companies get exposure opportunities that they can’t buy to accelerate their growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/04/22/world-bank-predicts-sharpest-decline-of-remittances-in-recent-history">World Bank</a>, it is more expensive to send money to sub-Saharan Africa than to any region in the world</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is also the most expensive region to send money from. In Q1 2020, people spent an average of 8.9% to send money to the region, much higher than the global average of 6.8%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s much talk around sending money from Africa to the West, which has led to many startups using traditional (fiat) and nontraditional (crypto) means to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilitate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cross-border payments between the two corridors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there&#8217;s little noise about the corridors between Africa and other regions like Latin America or Asia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Asia, for instance, has the lowest average remittance costs across all regions at 4.95% (these percentages </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are reported</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a standard $200 transfer); therefore, it makes sense to tap into the opportunities the market presents. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://wapipay.com/">Wapi Pay</a>, a Kenyan startup with offices in China and Singapore, is carrying out this play and has carved a market for itself by facilitating payments between both extreme remittance worlds of Africa and Asia.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2019 by brothers <a href="https://sg.linkedin.com/in/mwaura-ndichu-paul-71060445">Paul Ndichu</a> and <a href="https://sg.linkedin.com/in/eddie-ndichu-%E4%B8%87%C2%A0-wan-7191a519">Eddie Ndichu</a>, Wapi Pay </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">provides a payments gateway for African businesses to receive and send money from Asia via mobile money platforms and bank accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the focus on remittance has been the flow of money into Africa for sustenance. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, digitizing has been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mostly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> around delivery rather than building new infrastructure and payment processing models for African individuals and businesses to make</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cross-border payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial institutions </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are left</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with traditional systems and correspondence models to offer service to their customers. These transactions are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inherently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> complex in nature, given their compliance requirements. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of new infrastructure or processes make them further opaque, longer to process and far too expensive</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto remittance startups claim to solve this problem, but no one has successfully scaled to effective usage</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We started Wapi Pay having seen how fragmented the payment infrastructure is and how horrifying the experience and expense of making or receiving a payment to and from Asia,&#8221; Paul Ndichu told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We spent some time in Asia, given the growing trade relationship between the two corridors [Africa and Asia], and saw the growing need to make this more efficient, faster and cheaper, evolving from remittances to global payments. These transactions are already complex in nature; how do we make them as simple and easy as mobile money?&#8221; he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Q1 2021, Africa-China trade jumped 27%, to $52.1 billion compared, with 2020. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the economic recovery from the pandemic, African merchants still find it expensive to send and receive money</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In some cases, these costs can be as high as 20%, especially in Southern African regions. The wait time can also be ridiculous, with some spending up to a week before payment </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is processed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Wapi Pay says it can process payments within a day and charges as low as 3%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wapi Pay bypasses traditional payment networks, optimizing efficiency and cost for our customers. Users choose the delivery channels they want, such as bank to bank, wallet to wallet, bank to wallet and wallet to bank options to transfer funds as well as make merchant payments, with settlement done within 24 hours,” said CEO Eddie in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Wapi Pay works with local banks and platforms in China, Indonesia, India, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. The company claims to be growing at 396% year-on-year since 2019 and has hopes to continue in that fashion. By the end of next year, Wapi Pay wants to process $500 million in remittances and increase the number of African merchants and Asian suppliers to half a million and 100,000, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">respectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $2.2 million pre-seed investment announced today will be vital to meeting those targets to scale up global payments and remittances between Africa and Asia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The round is one of the largest of its kind in East Africa and the continent. The venture firms that took part include China-based fund MSA Capital, known to have invested in unicorns Meituan, Nubank and Klarna; Pan-African and Africa-focused firms EchoVC, Kepple Africa and Future Hub; and Pan-Asian firms Transsion Holdings and Gobi Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wapi Pay will use the investments to engage regulators for licensing across Africa and for scale, product and geographical expansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These funds will help Wapi Pay diversify our products range and drive growth so that we can evolve remittances into real-time global cross-border payments, starting with Africa and Asia. All while minimising the cost of transactions, it needs to be as easy as sending M-PESA,” Eddie added.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Africa to Asia is a large trading corridor overlooked and underserved by tech today. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Wapi Pay is the best team to build the necessary infrastructure to support its growing trade volumes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are excited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to support them with our extensive China fintech network and playbook,” <a href="https://cn.linkedin.com/in/timothychen">Tim Chen</a>, vice president at MSA Capital, said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Neobanks, other financial startups and the basic concept of &#8220;finance anywhere&#8221; are seeing huge gains at the moment, and today one of the key companies building the infrastructure that powers services like these is announcing a major growth round of funding to double down on the opportunity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rapyd.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rapyd</a> &#8212; which provides a range of financial services like payments, mobile wallets, money transfers, card issuing, fraud protection and more, all by way of an API for third parties to integrate quickly into their own services &#8212; has raised $300 million, a Series E that TechCrunch understands from reliable sources values the company at $8.75 billion.</p>
<p>The company has been on a fast pace of growth in the last year, spurred in no small part by the global shift to carrying out life and business online in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Rapyd&#8217;s total payment volume is on target to pass $20 billion this year, a four-fold increase on 2020&#8217;s volume of $5 billion. The company has some 12,000 small and medium-sized businesses using its services, with another 650 large enterprise clients.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Target Global &#8212; the European VC that has been making some big bets on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/kuda-the-african-challenger-bank-raises-55m-at-a-500m-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fintech</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commerce</a> lately &#8212; is leading this round, with new backers Fidelity Ventures, Altimeter Capital, Whale Rock Capital, BlackRock and Dragoneer, and previous backers General Catalyst, Latitude, Durable Capital Partners, Tal Capital, Avid Ventures and Spark Capital also participating. Past strategic investors in the startup have included the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/13/rapyd-nabs-40m-led-by-stripe-and-gc-for-fintech-as-a-service-a-single-api-for-payments-money-transfer-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">payments behemoth Stripe</a>.</p>
<p>Rapyd&#8217;s CEO and co-founder Arik Shtilman said in an interview that the plan will be to use part of the investment for acquisitions, and part for R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Rapyd has been starting the M&amp;A march in earnest already this year, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rapyd-to-acquire-valitor-expanding-access-to-global-payments-for-its-european-customers-301324467.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquiring payments and card issuing company Valitor</a> in July for $100 million to expand deeper into Europe, and starting an investment arm called Rapyd Ventures. Acquisitions will likely be to continue getting deeper into its current markets.</p>
<p>On the R&amp;D front, the company already has some 900 different services that cover 100 countries within its API. I&#8217;ve likened Rapyd&#8217;s approach in the past to being akin to a &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Swiss Army knife&#8221; of services, and Shtilman says that these roughly fall into several distinct categories. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;At the end of the day there are five things on planet earth for financial services, whether you are a bank or a mom-and-pop shop: payment collection, money dispersing, funds storage, card issuing and foreign exchange. From these you can build endless capabilities,&#8221; he said. One priority now, he added, will be to focus on expanding its technology related to identity management and fraud to complement what it already does. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Know your customer [KYC] and compliance tools will help us bring on more customers even faster,&#8221; Shtilman said.</span></p>
<p>The timing of this latest round is a big deal for Rapyd. For starters, it&#8217;s coming <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/rapyd-raises-300m-on-a-2-5b-valuation-to-boost-its-fintech-as-a-service-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just seven months</a> after Rapyd announced <em>another</em> $300 million round, its Series D (that round actually closed in November, I&#8217;ve found out). Notably, that last round was at a $2.5 billion valuation, and while the company is not disclosing its funding, Shtilman told me that revenues have grown 3.5 times since then. A source very close to the company told me that the valuation was, simply, the multiple of those two figures: $8.75 billion.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rapyd raises $300M on a $2.5B valuation to boost its fintech-as-a-service API&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/rapyd-raises-300m-on-a-2-5b-valuation-to-boost-its-fintech-as-a-service-api/embed/#?secret=f0tejT8tS7" data-secret="f0tejT8tS7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Secondly, it&#8217;s important in the context of the wider market and where Rapyd fits into it.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re currently seeing a huge profusion of companies tapping into the potential of so-called embedded finance &#8212; financial services that are built and operated by one party and integrated by APIs into another party&#8217;s service &#8212; to build new products, ranging from neobanks around the world, to e-commerce companies building checkout services, or companies only tangentially in the business of commerce who are now launching products to improve customer engagement or make their first moves into the space.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s meant a lot of competition for Rapyd, with some other big players including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/fast-raises-102m-as-the-online-checkout-wars-continue-to-attract-huge-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fast</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/checkout-com-raises-450-million-and-reaches-15-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Checkout</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mambu-raises-135m-at-a-2b-valuation-for-an-saas-platform-that-powers-banking-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mambu</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/railsbank-raises-70m-to-build-out-its-fintech-as-a-service-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Railsbank</a>, all of which have also raised huge rounds.</p>
<p>In other words, not only is this round a sign of Rapyd&#8217;s own growth, but a signal to the market of how it is positioning itself and faring in what is shaping up to be an interesting and competitive field.</p>
<p>Rapyd &#8212; which is now based in Silicon Valley but has its R&amp;D and CEO based in Tel Aviv &#8212; was one of the earlier players in this space, and Shtilman likes to recall how, when he first started the company, he was met with a lot of skepticism from others in the financial services community, not just because the idea sounded too hard to execute but because they saw financial infrastructure as essentially the crown jewels of most financial services companies.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we started in 2016 everyone thought we were crazy because the concept was too big and too wide,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Then, like mushrooms after the rain, everyone saw it. Everyone understands now that the future of fintech is fintech infrastructure. Like cloud computing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, it&#8217;s taken a little while, but these days most acknowledge that the basics of these services are, yes, super hard to build, but essentially work the same for everyone, so they can be built once, and then packaged and turned into something you can tap by way of cloud services, and thus turned into commodities that you can spend your resources, time and strategy to personalize.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="369yRSQvzT"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/maybe-neobanks-will-break-even-after-all/">Maybe neobanks will break even after all</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Maybe neobanks will break even after all&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/maybe-neobanks-will-break-even-after-all/embed/#?secret=369yRSQvzT" data-secret="369yRSQvzT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Meanwhile, the crown jewels are, in fact, your customers. And therefore, building transactional services that either complement what you already do as a business, or augment it in an interesting and useful enough way, is how you end up deepening your engagement with them, and commitment from them.</p>
<p>The fact that this is something that might apply to just about any business online today means that the opportunities are vast as well, one reason investors are so keen to be in this market. (And that goes for more than just Rapyd, as it&#8217;s big enough not to be a winner-takes-all market.)</p>
<p>“Rapyd has built a borderless embedded fintech infrastructure critical to all digital businesses that operate globally. Their platform incorporates payments, compliance, FX, fraud management, escrow, virtual account and card issuing, and more. But now, as the world sees growing traction across global eCommerce, Gig Economy, Fintech Solutions and Technology platforms, Rapyd must take the next step,&#8221; said Mike Lobanov, general partner at Target Global, in a statement. &#8220;There is currently an unprecedented need for a single partner serving as a bridge between a vast array of local payment services and merchants, providing them access to the flexible, fast-to-integrate, and scalable solutions they need to thrive. Having led Rapyd&#8217;s Series A in 2018, we are confident that Rapyd can be such a partner, and are now renewing our bet in this round.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In “Macbeth,” Shakespeare described sleep as the “chief nourisher in life’s feast.” But like his titular character, many adults aren’t sleeping well. <a href="https://reverylab.com/">Revery</a> wants to help with an app that combines cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for insomnia with mobile gaming concepts.</p>
<p>Founded in March 2021, Revery is currently in beta stealth mode and plans to launch its app in the United States later this year. The company announced today it has raised $2 million, led by Sequoia Capital India’s Surge program. Participants included GGV Capital, Pascal Capital, zVentures (Razer’s corporate venture arm) and angel investors like MyFitnessPal co-founder Albert Lee; gaming entrepreneur Juha Paananen; CRED founder Kunal Shah; Mobile Premier League founder Sai Srinivas; Carolin Krenzer; and Josh Lee.</p>
<p>Lee, a mutual friend, first introduced Revery’s founders, Tammie Siew and Khoa Tran, to one another. Before launching the startup, Siew worked at Sequoia Capital India, Boston Consulting Group and CRED, while Tran was a former product manager at Google.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Revery plans to focus on other mental health issues in the future, but it’s starting with sleep because “it has such a strong correlation with mental health and we’re leveraging protocols, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, that’s robust and have been tried and tested for 30 years,” Siew told TechCrunch. “That is the first indication, but the goal is to build multiple games for other wellness indications as well.”</p>

<p>For Revery’s team, which also includes former Zynga and King lead game designer Kriti Sawa and software engineer Stephanie Wong, their focus on sleep is personal.</p>

<p>“Everyone on our team has a deeply personal connection to the mission, because everyone on our team has experienced, or had a family member or friends go through challenges in mental health,” said Siew. “They’ve seen how late intervention creates consequences that could have been avoided if they had gotten help earlier.”</p>
<p>When Tran was 15, he was diagnosed with hypertension and several other health conditions that needed medication. It wasn’t until he was 26 that Tran found out that sleep apnea was at the root of his medical issues. After getting surgery, Tran’s blood pressure became normal and many of his other conditions also improved.</p>
<p>“When I finally got treatment for my sleep disorder, only then did I realize the impact of sleep on mental health,” Tran said. “For me, I was really lucky that a doctor caught my sleep disorder and super lucky to have the time and resources to get treatment. For many people, it’s incredibly inaccessible.”</p>
<p>Revery&#8217;s medical advisory team includes the doctor who performed Tran&#8217;s surgery, Stanford Sleep Surgery Fellowship director Dr. Stanley Liu; Stanford professor and behavioral sleep medicine expert Dr. Fiona Barwick; and Dr. Ryan Kelly, a clinical psychologist <a href="https://variety.com/2019/gaming/features/clinical-psychologists-see-positive-potential-in-video-games-as-therapy-1203175911/">who researches how video games can be used in therapy</a>.</p>

<p>When people think of sleeping apps, ones that focus on meditation (Calm and Headspace, for example) or soothing noises usually come to mind. The Revery team isn’t sharing a lot of details about its app before launch, but says it draws from casual mobile games, which are designed to get people to return for short play sessions over a long period of time. The goal is to use gamification to make CBT practices interactive and fun, so it becomes part of users’ daily routines.</p>
<p>“That’s the same kind of gameplay that Zynga and King have used, which is why Kriti’s experience is super helpful,” said Siew. Casual games revolve around rewarding people for small actions, and for the Revery app, that means positive reinforcement for habits that contribute to better sleep. For example, it will reward people for putting down their phones.</p>
<p>“I think a lot of people have the misconception that solving sleep is only at the time you fall asleep. They don’t realize that sleep is impacted by what you do throughout the day,” Siew said. “A big part is also what are your thoughts, behavior and the other things that you do, so in order to effectively and sustainably improve sleep, we also have to change your thoughts and behaviors outside of the time you’re trying to fall asleep.”</p>
<p>In a statement, GGV Capital managing director Jenny Lee said, “We are excited about the growing mental wellness market, and believe that Revery’s unique mobile game-based approach has the opportunity to create immense impact. We are happy to back such a mission-driven team in this space.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Inequalities between women and men in the workplace have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, and are likely to persist in the near future, according to the <a href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---gender/documents/publication/wcms_814499.pdf">International Labour Organization</a> (ILO). The World Economic Forum estimates globally it will take 267.6 years to close the gender gap in economic participation and opportunity.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s even more crucial that the global gender and ethnicity pay gap be &#8220;squared away&#8221; by entrepreneurs passionate about the issue.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gapsquare.com/">Gapsquare</a>, a U.K. startup that&#8217;s been addressing this issue since 2017, has been among a handful of startups addressing these concerns via machine learning around the issue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Its analytics software, which analyses and tracks pay disparity, pay equality and pay gap data, has now been acquired by <a href="https://www.xperthr.co.uk/">XpertHR</a>, a part of RELX, for an undisclosed sum. TechCrunch understands from sources that Gapsquare never raised institutional venture funding.</p>
<p>The Gapsquare platform &#8212; along with co-founders Dr. Zara Nanu and Ion Suruceanu &#8212; will be joining the XpertHR team. Gapsquare previously counted Vodafone, Condé Nast and Serco as clients, amounting to data from tens of thousands of employees.</p>
<p>Gapsquare’s model is to provide HR and Reward professionals with actionable insights about their company’s existing pay gaps.</p>
<p>Through its &#8220;FairPay Pro&#8221; platform, Gapsquare says it can identify variables for employee demographics such as gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation and disability, identifying the causes of pay gaps, and proposing and tracking remedial actions.</p>
<p>In a statement, Nanu said: “We know for many businesses transparency around compensation fairness and pay reporting is high on the agenda. Gartner research indicates that over 80% of businesses globally are driven to take action around pay equity and pay gaps as the workforce is changing and younger generations entering the workforce are increasingly interested in transparency, sustainability, and equality. By joining forces, XpertHR and Gapsquare are better equipped to support our customers’ evolving needs and those of the businesses around the globe.”</p>
<p>Scott Walker, managing director at XpertHR, said: “I am excited to bring Gapsquare into the XpertHR family. Our mission is a simple one: to create purposeful workplaces for every person in every organization. Both businesses are dedicated to improving the experiences of millions of working professionals around the globe. By combining Gapsquare’s advanced technology with XpertHR’s expertise in reward data, we can better equip employers to build a world where work is inclusive, where pay meets value and diverse talent thrives.”</p>
<p>The child and grandchild of teachers, Nanu was inspired to look more deeply into the issue of the gender pay gap after working with a female trafficking prevention program in Moldova, a small country in Central Europe. She realized women were being thrown into sweatshops and paid a minimum wage, thus trapped in poverty.</p>
<p>After growing up in Chișinău, the capital of Moldova, she relocated to Bristol, U.K., and started Gapsquare. Nanu has previously talked about how Soviet attitudes to gender equality &#8212; where the Communist system dictated that men and women should be equally treated &#8212; made her realize that Western practices had actually become retrograde by comparison.</p>
<p>Speaking to The Guardian in 2018 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2018/nov/28/can-software-bring-womens-pay-up-to-mens-this-tech-entrepreneur-thinks-so">she said</a>: “We had quotas around women in parliament, quotas around the representation of women in any sector. Childcare was free, so my mum could go back to work six months after giving birth. When I came to the UK [in 2007] it felt like, to some extent, I was going back in time in terms of gender equality.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, the background to the Gapsquare story is reflective of the environment in which Nanu operated. Raising venture capital to highlight gender disparity in a male-dominated corporate and venture environment was a tough gig. Perhaps one of the toughest. It&#8217;s a testament to Nanu&#8217;s persistence that she bootstrapped, got this far, and exited with her team. But it&#8217;s also an indictment of the VC industry. We haven&#8217;t seen the last of this entrepreneur.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Infra.Market, an Indian startup that is helping construction and real estate companies in the world’s second-most populated nation procure materials and handle logistics for their projects, said on Tuesday it has secured its third financing round in the past nine months.</p>
<p>Tiger Global, which led <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/infra-market-becomes-newest-indian-unicorn-with-100-million-fundraise/">the startup’s Series C round in February</a> this year, has led the $125 million Series D financing round in the five-year-old startup. The new round valued Mumbai-headquartered Infra.Market at $2.5 billion (post-money), up from $1 billion in February and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/09/infra-market-raises-20-million-for-its-b2b-marketplace-in-india/">$200 million in December last year</a>. The startup, which counts Nexus, Foundamental and Accel Partners among its investors, has raised about $275 million to date.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to double-down on our investment in Infra.Market. The team has demonstrated exceptional growth and continues to disrupt the construction materials industry. Over the past year, Infra.Market has become the go-to partner, especially during the pandemic when the traditional supply chains were disrupted,” said Scott Shleifer, partner, Tiger Global Management, in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Infra.Market, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/zetwerk-raises-120-million-to-scale-its-b2b-marketplace-for-manufacturing-parts/">competes with Lightspeed-backed Zetwerk</a>, helps small businesses such as manufacturers of paints and cements improve the quality of their production and meet various compliances.</p>
<p>The startup adds its load cells to the manufacturing facilities of these small businesses to ensure there is no lapse in quality, and also helps them work with other businesses that can provide them with better raw material and provide guidance on pricing. It also works closely with businesses to ensure that their deliveries are made on time.</p>

<p>These improvements, explained co-founder Souvik Sengupta, help small manufacturers land larger clients that have higher expectations from the businesses with which they engage. He said the startup has helped small manufacturers reach customers outside of India as well. Some of its clients are in Bangladesh, Malaysia, Singapore and Dubai.</p>
<p>“We continue to build on our vision of creating India’s largest multiproduct construction materials brand and transform the construction materials supply chain, not only in India, but also globally,” he said.</p>
<p>“We are also embarking on new business verticals within the construction ecosystem beyond materials to enable us to provide end to end solutions to our customers across the life cycle of a construction project. We are seeing huge growth in buyer wallet share as we are rapidly expanding our product portfolio and market presence and the launch of new verticals will help us fulfill our vision of creating a technology backed end to end construction solutions company.”</p>
<p>The startup, which said it expects to surpass $1 billion in sales by the end of this calendar year, plans to deploy the fresh fund to expand to new markets and also expand into new categories. It&#8217;s also looking to acquire younger firms, the startup said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The myriad challenges faced by farmers in Africa &#8212; inadequate financing, education and input distribution &#8212; persist and greatly affect the agricultural output on the continent. But startups are providing innovative solutions to these problems, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">South Africa&#8217;s <a href="https://www.khula.co.za/">Khula</a> is an example. The startup, launched in 2018, is finding its niche in the ever-growing industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, it announced a $1.3 million seed round to scale operations across the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the surface, it would seem agritech in Africa hasn&#8217;t taken off as exponentially as</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> other tech-operated industries. But it has: The agritech sector grew 44% year-on-year between 2016 and 2019, and the continent has the highest number of agritech services in the developing world, reaching more than 33 million smallholder farmers, according to a <a href="http://farmersreviewafrica.com/africa-to-become-a-global-hub-for-agritech/">report</a> from Farmers Review Africa. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/karidas-tshintsholo-0301bb78">Karidas Tshintsholo</a>, <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/matthew-piper">Matthew Piper</a> and <a href="https://za.linkedin.com/in/jackson-dyora-169362189">Jackson Dyora</a> founded Khula three years ago. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Khula provides small-scale and commercial size farmers with software and a marketplace to grow their business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this description doesn&#8217;t do justice to the painstaking problem Khula is solving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Khula, Tshintsholo and Piper were school and business partners. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They worked on consulting gigs after dropping out of college a year before graduation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But while it allowed them to meet with clients in various disciplines, the consulting business wasn&#8217;t exhilarating enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We always wanted something to do something more impactful, something more meaningful, something that could </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> change the way that the world works,&#8221;  Tshintsholo told TechCrunch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As time went on, agritech seemed like the path to take due to both founders&#8217; experiences</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa is home to 60% of the world&#8217;s arable land. <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/en-xm/2021/06/15/africa-is-set-to-become-a-global-hub-for-agritech/">Research</a> also shows agritech in Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is projected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reach a value of $1 trillion by 2030. But a trip to Israel made Piper wonder why the country &#8212; although half of its land is considered a desert &#8212; had more agricultural produce than African countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It didn&#8217;t make sense that we have more land than any other continent,&#8221; Tshintsholo said. &#8220;And pretty much everyone on the continent is a farmer and we&#8217;re buying food more than we were selling. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We wondered how that was possible, considering how big of competitive advantage agriculture is</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further research and spending time with farmers exposed another problem: how intermediaries ripped off farmers in the country.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The agricultural industry in South Africa </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to favor industrial agriculture. And like most parts of Africa, smallholder farmers have it rough as they face a plethora of challenges, from marketing and selling to transportation of their goods and produce.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, farmers take their produce to a large warehouse where big aggregators pick up the produce and sell it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem here is that most products </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are sold</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on consignment, which means there are no guarantees farmers will make a sale</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goods, mostly perishable, are also bound to experience drops in price, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd there&#8217;s a huge lack of transparency, allowing middlemen to rip off farmers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the penny dropped for us was when we started playing detective. We followed these farmers and noticed what big companies listed on the stock exchange did: Go to these physical markets, pick up the produce and then sell to the formal market. They&#8217;d pick it up for R3.50 and sell it for R11.00. They </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">literally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> added nothing to the value chain other than </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> picking it up and dropping it off.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some cases, farmers could sell their produce</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a processor who subsequently sells it to a supermarket at a much higher price. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The supermarket also makes a profit by selling to individual consumers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So what a farmer sold for R3.50 ($0.24) might end up at R30 ($2.07) in an individual consumer&#8217;s hands. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s not all; farmers must also pay commissions to these middlemen and municipalities they operate in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This was when we knew that this was a struggle, and this was the problem we wanted to address,&#8221; Tshintsholo said. &#8220;But then, in addressing that problem, we didn&#8217;t go live </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">initially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Agriculture can be very complex. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we have now is something that we call the Khula ecosystem, and this is because the industry is very interconnected.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Khula wants to tackle all these issues at once and provide farmers with liquidity, access and a market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The platform is an ecosystem made with three products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Inputs App allows farmers to access approved agricultural inputs and services from local and international suppliers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second is the Fresh Produce Marketplace, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">targeted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at farmers with challenges cited earlier</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It allows farmers to sell produce </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to local and international formal bulk buyers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. By allowing farmers to engage and negotiate prices with suppliers, the platform aims to reduce the access middlemen have that has led to the exploitation of farmers.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, the Funder Dashboard connects institutional investors with farmers who meet their funding mandates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The reason we&#8217;ve gone with this ecosystem approach is that it&#8217;s more of a sticky business model,&#8221; Tshintsholo said. &#8220;So we want to allow farmers to use our ecosystem to buy the products they need and get the services they need.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Khula has seen reasonable traction since launching. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has signed up more than 3,000 farmers, and over 100 suppliers now work with the company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This year, the startup </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2021/06/21/15-startups-selected-for-6th-google-for-startups-accelerator-africa/">accepted</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the Google for Startups Accelerator Class 6 alongside 14 other African companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the company is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announcing this investment, it closed the round last year. It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was led by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.aeciworld.com/"> AECI</a>, one of the continent&#8217;s biggest agrochemical companies. South African impact investor E Squared Investments also participated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the financial firepower Khula receives from its lead investor, it will also get access to AECI&#8217;s wide distribution network to scale its inputs app. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With 132 depots across the country, Khula says it can deliver products in every province, in every major agriculture region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tshintsholo says AECI is the kind of investor Khula hopes to have as it progresses: a long-term partner interested in execution and not quarterly updates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We did not want an investor at the table who was only going to ask us how we’d performed in a specific quarter. We wanted a long-term partner that would execute with us. A partner with a great reputation in the industry and an incredible distribution network, a partner whose long-term success </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was tied</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a business model like ours. And AECI fits that description </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">perfectly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Khula has very attractive fundamentals, a sizable addressable market, app development capabilities, key agri-business networks and a management team that wishes to work with AECI as their preferred agri-input and technical advisory partner,&#8221; Quintin Cross, the managing director of AECI Plant Health, said in a statement. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.creoate.com/">Creoate</a>, a startup that lets independent retailers buy sustainable products from brands and wholesalers, has raised a $5 million seed round led by Fuel Ventures, with participation from Vinted founder Justas Janauskas.</p>
<p>Its competitors include traditional wholesalers that have supplied independent retailers for decades, and other startups such as Faire (U.S., raised $696 million) and Ankorstore (France, raised €115 million).</p>
<p>Founders Ashley Horn and Fahad Khan say the company aims at helping independent businesses and &#8220;reclaims the supply chain from global giants&#8221;. Khan says &#8220;Mom and Pop&#8221; are “faced with poor information, discriminatory pricing and unpredictable cash flows.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Creoate, which doesn’t own inventory, says it helps retailers forecast which products will sell well so they can buy and manage inventory levels more easily. It says its cataloging software allows retailers to deal with fewer middlemen.</p>
<p>Launched in January 2020, the platform now claims 25,000 retailers across the U.K., France and Netherlands.</p>
<p>Creoate co-founder Horn said: “Sourcing brands as an independent retailer is close to impossible… We could see that this system was not sustainable and there had to be a better way”.</p>
<p>Mark Pearson, founder and managing partner at Fuel Ventures, said: “Unless you’re in the world of retail, it can be difficult to truly grasp just how broken the system is for the 2.5 million retailers and 30 million emerging brands that Creoate serves. We are captivated by Creoate’s technology which is inspired by the founding team’s real-world experience and empathy.”</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for Monday, August 2, 2021. What a day. Square kicked off this week’s news cycle with a megadeal, Google popped up with new hardware, and there are new VC funds aplenty. It’s busy, but before we get started, there’s a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/hear-startup-alley-companies-pitch-expert-vc-judges-on-the-next-episode-of-extra-crunch-live/">special summer edition of Extra Crunch Live this week that’s 100% pitch-off</a>. It’s on Wednesday, so be there or be square. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/google-is-building-its-own-chip-for-the-pixel-6/"><strong>Google pursues custom silicon:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Alphabet’s Google subsidiary is getting into the custom silicon game, TechCrunch reports. Akin to what Apple did with its A and M chips, Google hopes that its Tensor SoC (system on a chip) “will differentiate itself in a crowded smartphone field,” Brian Heater writes. For more on Google’s new hardware, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/google-gives-the-world-its-first-glimpse-of-the-pixel-6/">head here</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/01/square-to-buy-buy-now-pay-later-giant-afterpay-in-29b-deal/"><strong>Square buys Afterpay:</strong></a> U.S. fintech giant Square is buying the Australian buy now, pay later company Afterpay for $29 billion in stock. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/why-square-is-shelling-out-29b-to-snag-bnpl-player-afterpay/">dug into the deal’s numbers</a>, but the gist is that Afterpay brings merchants, global users and a new fintech product to Square. The deal isn’t cheap, but it does make sense.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/cloud-infrastructure-market-kept-growing-in-q2-reaching-42b/"><strong>Cloud infra spend accelerates:</strong></a> Want to know why investors are so hot and bothered by the tech industry these days? In part because demand just keeps accelerating. TechCrunch covered new data today indicating that the cloud infra market &#8212; which underpins so very many services that consumers and corporates depend on alike &#8212; saw spending grow 39% in Q2 2021 compared to the year-ago quarter. The total for the second quarter? $42 billion.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/reese-witherspoons-hello-sunshine-sold-to-new-media-firm-from-former-disney-execs/"><strong>Reese Witherspoon’s media company sells for $900M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>This is not our usual startup fare, but when a media company sells for nearly $1 billion, we have to pay attention. Per TechCrunch, the company, Hello Sunshine, made content for major streaming firms. What’s weird is who bought it. A “yet-unnamed new media firm run by former Disney execs,” TechCrunch writes. Mysterious.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/the-next-generation-of-global-payments-afterpay-square/"><strong>Afterpay investor bullish on Afterpay:</strong></a><strong> </strong>TechCrunch published an op-ed by Dana Stalder, an investor at Matrix Partners and self-described “only institutional venture investor” in Afterpay. Their take? That Square + Afterpay will be greater as a sum than the mere addition of their parts. We’ll see.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/singapore-based-nektar-ai-gets-6m-to-help-b2b-sales-team-collaborate-more-effectively/"><strong>Nektar.ai wants to consolidate B2B sales data:</strong></a> Selling software is no easy game, and there are myriad tools that every SDR and AE is expected to use. Nektar wants to be the central collection point <em>and</em> brain for all that data, and it just raised $6 million to grow its operation. Frankly, the salesops market is big, and I am surprised we don’t hear about even more companies pursuing similar lines of work.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/yaydoo-secures-20m-aims-to-simplify-b2b-collections-payments/"><strong>Investors back startups making B2B payments simpler:</strong></a> Sticking to the B2B world, Yadoo has raised a $20 million round to power business-to-business payments. In short, while Venmoing your friend beer money is as easy as drinking said beer, it’s not the same with corporations. Yadoo is one of the startups looking to take the problem on, in this case from the startup’s Mexico City HQ.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now, some venture capital news:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/element-ventures-pulls-in-130m-to-double-down-on-the-fintech-enterprise-trend/"><strong>Element Ventures raises $130M:</strong></a> It’s a sign of the times that I am not at all surprised that a B2B-focused fintech venture capital firm just raised nine figures. Of <em>course</em> that’s a big enough problem space to deploy that amount of capital. And of <em>course</em> there are enough startups that fit its parameters to fill its book with deals. Element will invest in 15 companies each year, focusing on deals in Europe, the U.S. and Asia.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/singapore-based-nektar-ai-gets-6m-to-help-b2b-sales-team-collaborate-more-effectively/"><strong>More money for</strong><strong> LatAm:</strong></a> Newtopia is a new fund focused on Latin America that just put together a fresh $50 million fund. It will invest in pre-seed companies ($100,000 checks) and larger rounds ($250,000 to $1 million) in startups scaling toward their Series A. Early-stage investing is its own beast, so it’s nice that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/why-latin-american-venture-capital-is-breaking-records-this-year/?tpcc=ECTW2020">the burgeoning Latin American market</a> is getting its own dedicated vehicles to tackle the task.</li>

<h2>Demand Curve: Questions you need to answer in your paid search ads</h2>
<p>At some point, almost every early-stage startup will use paid search ads to connect with customers and throw down the gauntlet with their competitors.</p>
<p>Most of these initial attempts at paid search are unsuccessful. There&#8217;s a steep learning curve when it comes to transforming passive searchers into paying customers, and almost no one gets it right the first time.</p>
<p>In a comprehensive guest post, growth marketing expert Stewart Hillhouse identified &#8220;14 questions your paid search should answer to ensure you&#8217;re only paying for the highest-intent shoppers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Question 1? “What’s in it for <strong>me</strong>?”</p>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/zoom-reaches-85m-settlement-in-zoombombing-lawsuit/"><strong>Zoombombing costs Zoom $85M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Today’s immaterial technology fine comes via Zoom, the video product that became ubiquitous during the pandemic. It was sued by users claiming that it was “violating users’ privacy by sharing their data with third parties without permission and enabling ‘Zoombombing’ incidents,” per TechCrunch. The settlement is worth a total of 0.07% of the company’s $112 billion market cap. Oh no.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/amazon-credit-palm-biometrics/"><strong>Amazon will pay you $10 for your palm print:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Speaking of sums of money so small that they should not induce any sort of behavioral changes, Amazon wants to give people $10 in credit if they give the company their palm print so that they can better check out at the e-commerce giant’s physical stores. Hard pass on this one.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/salesforce-steps-into-rpa-buying-servicetrace-and-teaming-it-with-mulesoft/"><strong>Salesforce buys Mulesoft an RPA firm:</strong></a> CRM giant Salesforce is investing in Mulesoft, a company that it bought a ways back, in the form of German RPA company Servicetrace. Servicetrace will link up with Mulesoft, not Salesforce proper.</li>
<li><strong>I asked TechCrunch reporter and genial human </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller"><strong>Ron Miller</strong></a><strong> why the deal matters</strong>. He said that the deal, “while not on par with the Slack megadeal, is probably the kind of smaller deals the company will make in the next year.” He explained that the Servicetrace acquisition gives SFDC an “entry into the growing RPA market without spending a ton of money.” Ron’s also bullish on the planned Mulesoft integration.</li>
