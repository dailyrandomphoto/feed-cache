										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Former Facebook employee and current <a href="https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1lw211ts92n62/The-Unusual-Ambitions-of-Chamath-Palihapitiya">enfant terrible of high finance</a> Chamath Palihapitiya is making news again with<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210125005213/en/%C2%A0Sunlight-Financial-LLC-a-Premier-Residential-Solar-Financing-Platform-to-List-on-NYSE-Through-Merger-With-Apollo-Affiliated-Spartan-Acquisition-Corp.-II"> a $1.3 billion twofer SPAC and PIPE deal</a> into the solar energy financing company, Sunlight Financial.</p>
<p>Sunlight Financial is essentially a lending company that gives solar installers a way to provide loans to homeowners to finance solar power and battery installations and other home improvement projects.</p>
<p>While it may be another indication of the <a href="https://twitter.com/web/status/1353749263654805504?s=20">Roaring &#8217;20s come back to haunt global financial markets</a> in the lead-up to a catastrophic meltdown of the global financial system, there&#8217;s at least some method to the madness with Sunlight.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s because there&#8217;s a lot of tailwinds behind a business that&#8217;s lending money <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/a-biden-presidency-doesnt-need-a-green-new-deal-to-make-progress-on-climate-change/">to provide better access to solar power, energy storage and energy efficiency upgrades</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;A Biden presidency doesn&#8217;t need a Green New Deal to make progress on climate change&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/a-biden-presidency-doesnt-need-a-green-new-deal-to-make-progress-on-climate-change/embed/#?secret=tAXBxplDvB" data-secret="tAXBxplDvB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The investment, alongside Coatue, Franklin Templeton and BlackRock, will value the lender at $1.3 billion. A healthy figure, but one that&#8217;s not astronomical, especially given the $705 million in financing that Sunlight Financial has raised over its history, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sunlight-financial/company_financials">according to Crunchbase</a>.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/unpacking-chamath-palihapitiyas-spac-deals-for-latch-and-sunlight-financial/">Alex Wilhelm noted earlier today</a>, Sunlight Financial would have likely tapped public markets sooner or later, given a pretty solid financial performance &#8212; even during the pandemic:</p>
<blockquote><p>Looking at the numbers, it’s somewhat clear that the company could have gone public in a year or two; another year’s growth, and it would have had enough revenue to pursue a traditional debut. Via this SPAC-led deal it will get out sooner and have more cash while it scales. Perhaps that is the value of the SPAC here for Sunlight.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sunlight also has the benefit of being a publicly traded renewable energy play at a time when those companies are in short supply and high demand from institutional investors.</p>
<p>Over the course of 2020, big money moved to find ways to support businesses that can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/whats-behind-this-years-boom-in-climate-tech-spacs/">help mitigate the effects of climate change or slow the rapidly warming temperatures</a> on the planet.</p>
<p>“Industry commitments to mitigate climate change risk is providing investors with visibility that there is momentum among decision-makers to drive change,” said Richard Manley, the managing director and head of sustainable investing at <a href="https://www.cppinvestments.com/about-us/our-investment-teams/team-active-equities/active-equities-sustainable-investing#:~:text=Richard%20Manley&amp;text=Richard%20leads%20the%20team%20responsible,opportunities%20across%20our%20investment%20programs.">CPP Investments</a>, in an interview last year. “There’s an appreciation within the public markets that the exciting transition solutions either within core operating subsidiaries or investments in the VC arms of corporate companies haven’t provided public equity investors the really focused opportunities they’ve wanted.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What&#8217;s behind this year&#8217;s boom in climate tech SPACs?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/whats-behind-this-years-boom-in-climate-tech-spacs/embed/#?secret=ixiGWLSvFa" data-secret="ixiGWLSvFa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With the launch of Palihapitiya&#8217;s latest SPAC, that trend seems set to continue in 2021. As Rob Day, a longtime investor in climate tech wrote in a direct message late last year:</p>
<blockquote><p>“[The] current wave [of SPACs] is because over the past 24 months the institutional investor universe has come fully into believing that climate solutions are going to be a major growth area in the 2020s and beyond, but they weren’t seeing options available to them for investing into,” according to Day.</p>
<p>“The available publicly traded ‘green’ companies were already getting really bought up, and the private equity options were underwhelming as well (smallish in the case of VC, low returns in the case of large-format projects). Throw in a Robinhood market of retail investors with a lot of enthusiasm for EVs and such, and you have a nice recipe for this to happen.”</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is launching what it calls &#8220;a community-based approach to misinformation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Birdwatch project <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/twitter-is-building-birdwatch-a-system-to-fight-misinformation-by-adding-more-context-to-tweets/">first came to light last fall</a> thanks to product sleuth <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane">Jane Manchun Wong</a>. Now Twitter has launched a pilot version via <a href="https://twitter.com/i/birdwatch">the Birdwatch website</a>.</p>
<p>The goal, as explained in <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-birdwatch-a-community-based-approach-to-misinformation.html">a blog post</a> by Twitter&#8217;s Vice President of Product Keith Coleman, is to expand beyond the labels that the company already applies to controversial or potentially misleading tweets, which he suggested are limited to &#8220;circumstances where something breaks our rules or receives widespread public attention.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Coleman wrote that the Birdwatch approach will &#8220;broaden the range of voices that are part of tackling this problem.&#8221; That has brings a broader range of perspectives to these issues and goes beyond the simple question of, &#8220;Is this tweet true or not?&#8221; It may also take some of the heat off Twitter for individual content moderation decisions.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="33b4rhpqt3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/twitter-is-building-birdwatch-a-system-to-fight-misinformation-by-adding-more-context-to-tweets/">Twitter is building &#8216;Birdwatch,&#8217; a system to fight misinformation by adding more context to tweets</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter is building &#8216;Birdwatch,&#8217; a system to fight misinformation by adding more context to tweets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/twitter-is-building-birdwatch-a-system-to-fight-misinformation-by-adding-more-context-to-tweets/embed/#?secret=33b4rhpqt3" data-secret="33b4rhpqt3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Users can sign up on the Birdwatch site to flag tweets that they find misleading, add context via notes and rate the notes written by other contributors, based on whether they&#8217;re helpful or not. These notes will only be visible on the Birdwatch site for now, but it sounds like the company&#8217;s goal is to incorporate them to the main Twitter experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe this approach has the potential to respond quickly when misleading information spreads, adding context that people trust and find valuable,&#8221; Coleman said. &#8220;Eventually we aim to make notes visible directly on Tweets for the global Twitter audience, when there is consensus from a broad and diverse set of contributors.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given the potential for plenty of argument and back-and-froth on contentious tweets, it remains to be seen how Twitter will present these notes in a way that isn&#8217;t confusing or overwhelming, or how it can avoid weighing in on some of these arguments. The company said Birdwatch will use rank content based on algorithmic &#8220;reputation and consensus systems,&#8221; with the code shared publicly. (All notes contributed to Birdwatch will also be available for download.) You <a href="https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch/about/ranking-notes/">read more about the initial ranking system here</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know there are a number of challenges toward building a community-driven system like this — from making it resistant to manipulation attempts to ensuring it isn’t dominated by a simple majority or biased based on its distribution of contributors,&#8221; Coleman said. &#8220;We’ll be focused on these things throughout the pilot.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a year defined by economic and civil unrest, it should come as little surprise that workplace organizing has been on the upswing. The COVID-19 pandemic in particular (coupled with the ever-present effects of late capitalism) has brought long-standing questions of employment stability and safety to the forefront of many.</p>
<p>Of course, much of this dates to well before the pandemic was in full swing. In February, we noted that both scooter startup Spin and food delivery service Instacart voted to unionize. That same month, Kickstarter became one of the most prominent tech companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/kickstarter-workers-vote-to-unionize/">to form a union</a>, with online code collaboration tool <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/13/online-code-collaboration-tool-glitch-votes-to-unionize/">Glitch</a> following suit in March.</p>
<p>Work place organizing is a broad and expansive topic in the world of technology. It’s a concept that is beginning to take hold in a diverse array of workplaces, ranging from contractors and factory workers at places like Amazon to salaried office jobs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The subject was a no-brainer for this year’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-justice-2021/?utm_medium=editpost&amp;utm_campaign=justice2021&amp;utm_content=pocecosystems&amp;utm_source=tc&amp;promo=workplaceorgpost&amp;display=TRUE">TC Sessions: Justice on March 3</a>, and we’ve pulled together some great speakers to discuss their experiences, while giving some guidance to those interested in potentially organizing at their own workplaces.</p>
<p>Clarissa Redwine is a fellow at NYU&#8217;s Engelberg Center on Innovation Law &amp; Policy. A former senior design and technology outreach lead at Kickstarter, she now hosts Kickstarter Union Oral History, a series of interviews with union organizers. Grace Reckers is the lead Northeastern union organizer for the OPEIU (Office and Professional Employees International Union). Parul Koul, who joined Google as a software engineer in 2019, is the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/google-alphabet-employees-union/">executive chair of the Alphabet Workers</a>.</p>

<p>However the proposal has alarmed advertisers who argue it&#8217;s anti-competitive. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/googles-plan-to-replace-tracking-cookies-goes-under-uk-antitrust-probe/">earlier this month</a> the UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opened an investigation of the Privacy Sandbox proposal after complaints from a coalition of digital marketing companies and others from newspapers and technology companies alleging Google is abusing a dominant position by depreciating support for third party trackers.</p>
<p>On the privacy front Google&#8217;s self-styled Privacy Sandbox isn&#8217;t exactly attracting effusive plaudits, either.</p>
<p>T<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/08/dont-play-googles-privacy-sandbox-1">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> has, for example, dubbed FLoCs &#8220;the opposite of privacy-preserving technology&#8221; &#8212; warning in 2019 that the approach is akin to a &#8220;behavioral credit score&#8221;. It said then that the proposals risk sustaining discrimination against vulnerable groups of people, whose online activity would be pattern-matched with others without their say-so; and could also lead to leaking sensitive info about them to third parties &#8212; without offering web users any way to escape being put in a &#8216;interest based&#8217; ad targeting bucket. </span></p>
<p>With objections piling up from on sides of the aisle (advertiser vs user) &#8212; and now active regulatory scrutiny of the competition issue &#8212; Google has its work cut out to sell its preferred replacement for tracking cookies to all the relevant stakeholders. Though advertisers (and competition regulators) currently seem front of mind for the tech giant.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/2021-01-privacy-sandbox/?">update about the Privacy Sandbox proposals</a> today, Google appears to be hoping to alleviate advertisers&#8217; concerns that the demise of tracking cookies will degrade their ability to lucratively target Internet users &#8212; writing that tests of the FLoC technology suggest advertisers will continue to see &#8220;at least 95% of the conversions per dollar spent when compared to cookie-based advertising&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear how much test data was involved in Google generating that percentage, however. (We asked and Google did not have an immediate response.) So there&#8217;s zero meat on the bone of the &#8216;95% minimum&#8217; claim.</p>
<p>Its spokesman did note that it will be opening up public testing in March &#8212; and expects advertisers to join in kicking FLoC&#8217;s tires then. So there&#8217;s clearly going to be more detail to come on this front.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chrome intends to make FLoC-based cohorts available for public testing through origin trials with its next release in March and we expect to begin testing FLoC-based cohorts with advertisers in Google Ads in Q2,&#8221; writes Chetna Bindra, group product manager for user trust and privacy in the blog post, adding: &#8220;If you’d like to get a head start, you can run your own simulations (as we did) based on the principles outlined in this <a href="https://github.com/google/ads-privacy/blob/master/proposals/FLoC/FLOC-Whitepaper-Google.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/google/ads-privacy/blob/master/proposals/FLoC/FLOC-Whitepaper-Google.pdf&quot;}">FLoC whitepaper</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unsurprisingly that Google continues to emphasize the relative openness with which it&#8217;s developing the Privacy Sandbox proposals &#8212; as that may help it fight antitrust accusations. But it&#8217;s also noteworthy being as the adtech industry, which has been fighting to block/delay its depreciation of third party cookies, is busy spinning up its own contenders to replace trackers &#8212; and developing those competing proposals typically with a lot less transparency than Google.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google proposes new privacy and anti-fingerprinting controls for the web&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/embed/#?secret=LHPGFn3xox" data-secret="LHPGFn3xox" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Nonetheless, Google seems a whole more comfortable quantifying FLoC&#8217;s potential impact on ad revenue (tiny, per its latest claim) vs articulating what privacy gains Internet users might expect from the proposed shift from individual tracking to run behavioral ads to being stuck in labelled buckets to run behavioral ads.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s blog post has a few fuzzy mentions &#8212; like &#8220;viable privacy-first alternatives&#8221; and &#8216;hiding individuals “in the crowd”&#8217; &#8212; but there&#8217;s no metric or data offered on how much privacy users stand to gain if its preferred post-cookie future comes to pass.</p>
<p>Test results it published in <a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/privacy/google-releases-results-from-early-tests-of-cohort-based-advertising/">October</a> also focused on seeking to demonstrate to advertisers that FLoCs can deliver on other relevant ad metrics. Funnily enough, Internet users&#8217; privacy &#8212; and what happens when <em>degrees</em> of privacy are lost &#8212; is rather harder for Google&#8217;s computer scientists to measure.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&#8220;The idea is to make it so that no one can reconstruct your cross-site browsing history,&#8221; said the company&#8217;s spokesman when we asked about how the proposal will improve users&#8217; privacy standing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to address non-transparent forms of tracking, across websites, with privacy-safe mechanisms for consumers, and make it so it can&#8217;t happen. And to do so while still enabling opportunity and fair compensation for publishers and advertisers. So it&#8217;s really not even a matter of trying to approximate a kind of privacy: We&#8217;re trying to address a root critical concern of users, full stop,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>FLoCs are just one part of Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox proposals. The company is working on a slew of aligned efforts to simultaneously replace various other key components of the adtech ecosystem. And it gives an overview of some of these in the blog post &#8212; covering proposals for (post-cookie) conversation measurement; ad-fraud prevention; and anti-fingerprinting.</p>
<p>Here it dwells briefly on retargeting/remarketing &#8212; referring to a new Chrome proposal (called Fledge) that it says it&#8217;s considering for a &#8216;trusted server&#8217; model &#8220;specifically designed to store information about a campaign’s bids and budgets&#8221;. This will also be made available for advertisers to test later this year, Google adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last year, several members of the ad tech community have offered input for how this might work, including proposals from Criteo, NextRoll, Magnite and RTB House. Chrome has published a new proposal called <a href="https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/blob/master/FLEDGE.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/WICG/turtledove/blob/master/FLEDGE.md&quot;}">FLEDGE</a> that expands on a previous Chrome proposal (called <a href="https://github.com/WICG/turtledove" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/WICG/turtledove&quot;}">TURTLEDOVE</a>) and takes into account the industry feedback they’ve heard, including the idea of using a &#8216;trusted server&#8217; &#8212; as defined by compliance with certain principles and policies &#8212; that’s specifically designed to store information about a campaign’s bids and budgets. Chrome intends to make FLEDGE available for testing through origin trials later this year with the opportunity for ad tech companies to try using the API under a “bring your own server” model,&#8221; it writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Technology advancements such as FLoC, along with similar promising efforts in areas like measurement, fraud protection and anti-fingerprinting, are the future of web advertising — and the Privacy Sandbox will power our web products in a post-third-party cookie world,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>Discussing Fledge&#8217;s potential, <a href="https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik">Dr Lukasz Olejnik</a>, an independent researcher and consultant, said there&#8217;s still a lot of uncertainty over how it might impact user privacy. &#8220;The Fledge experiment looks potentially interesting but it mixes in various proposals in this test. Such a mix would need to get a specific privacy assessment as the offered privacy qualities might be different than original claimed. Furthermore, the current tests will have many privacy precautions intended for the future, turned off initially. It will be tricky to gradually turn them on,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is embarking on a major project to <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey</a> the venture capital investors of Europe and their cities.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey of VCs in Stockholm, and Sweden generally,</a> will capture how the country is faring, and what changes are being wrought amongst investors by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>The deadline is the end of this week.</strong></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We’d like to know how Sweden&#8217;s startup scene is evolving, how the tech sector is being impacted by COVID-19, and, generally, how your thinking will evolve from here.</p>
<p>Our survey will only be about investors, and <strong>only the contributions of VC investors will be included.</strong> More than one partner is welcome to fill out the survey. (Please note, if you have filled the survey out already, there is no need to do it again).</p>
<p>The shortlist of questions will require only brief responses, but the more you can add, the better.</p>
<p><a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6"><strong>You can fill out the survey here.</strong></a></p>
<p>Obviously, investors who contribute will be featured in the final surveys, with links to their companies and profiles.</p>
<p>What kinds of things do we want to know? Questions include: Which trends are you most excited by? What startup do you wish someone would create? Where are the overlooked opportunities? What are you looking for in your next investment, in general? How is your local ecosystem going? And how has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy?</p>
<p>This survey is part of a broader <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys/">series of surveys</a> we’re doing to help founders find the right investors.</p>
<p>For example, here is the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/14-vcs-discuss-covid-19-and-londons-future-as-a-tech-hub/">survey of London</a>.</p>
<p>You are not in Sweden, but would like to take part? That&#8217;s fine! Any European VC investor can STILL fill out the survey, as we probably will be putting a call out to your country next anyway! And we will use the data for future surveys on vertical topics.</p>
<p>The survey is covering almost every country on in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_for_the_Mediterranean">Union for the Mediterranean</a>, so just look for your country and city on the <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey</a> and please participate (<em>if</em> you&#8217;re a venture capital investor).</p>
<p>Thank you for participating. If you have questions you can email <a href="mailto:mike@techcrunch.com">mike@techcrunch.com.</a></p>
<p>(Please note: Filling out the survey is not a guarantee of inclusion in the final published piece).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Latch is an enterprise SaaS company that makes keyless-entry systems for buildings; Sunlight Financial offers point-of-sale financing for residential solar systems.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning, investor and SPAC raconteur Chamath Palihapitiya <a href="https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1353674959789256705">announced two new</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1353673101901369345">blank-check deals</a> involving Latch and Sunlight Financial.</p>
<p>Latch, an enterprise SaaS company that makes keyless-entry systems, has raised $152 million in private capital, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/latch/company_financials">according to Crunchbase</a>. Sunlight Financial, which offers point-of-sale financing for residential solar systems, has <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sunlight-financial/company_financials">raised north of $700 million</a> in venture capital, private equity and debt.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to chat about the two transactions.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no escaping SPACs for a bit, so if you are tired of watching blind pools rip private companies into the public markets, you are not going to have a very good next few months. Why? There are <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-spacs-attack-a-new-force-is-invading-wall-street-11611378007?mod=djemalertNEWS">nearly 300 SPACs</a> in the market today looking for deals, and many will find one.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Think of SPACs are increasingly hungry sharks. As a shark get hungrier while the clock winds down on its deal-making window, it may get less choosy about what it eats (take public). There are enough SPACs on the hunt today that they would be noisy even if they were not time-constrained investment vehicles. But as their timers tick, expect their deal-making to get all the more creative.</p>
<p>This brings us back to Chamath&#8217;s two deals. Are they more like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/2021-a-spac-odyssey/">the Bakkt SPAC</a>, which led us to raise a few questions? Or more akin to the Talkspace SPAC, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/23/how-vcs-and-founders-see-2021-differently/">we found pretty reasonable?</a> Let&#8217;s find out.</p>
<h2>Keyless locks = Peloton for real estate</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the Latch deal.</p>
<p>New York-based Latch sells &#8220;LatchOS,&#8221; a hardware and software system that works in buildings where access and amenities matter. Latch&#8217;s hardware works with doors, sensors and internet connectivity.</p>
<p>The company has raised a number of private rounds, including a $126 million deal in August of 2019 that valued the company at $454.3 million on a post-money basis, <a href="http://pitchbook.com">according to PitchBook</a> data. The company raised another $30 million in October of 2020, though its final private valuation is not known.</p>
<p>As Chamath tweeted this morning, Latch is <a href="https://www.latch.com/news/latch-announces-planned-merger-with-tishman-speyer-sponsored-spac">merging with TS Innovation Acquisitions Corp</a>, or $TSIA. The SPAC is associated with Tishman Speyer, a commercial real estate investor. You can see the synergies, as Latch&#8217;s products fit into the commercial real estate space.</p>
<p>Up front, Latch is not a company that is only reporting future revenues. It has a history as an operating entity. Indeed, here&#8217;s its financial data per <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1826000/000119312521015400/d73403dex992.htm">its investor presentation</a>:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100002" style="width: 387px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100002" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2100002 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-25-at-10.03.29-AM.png?w=377" alt="" width="377" height="170" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-25-at-10.03.29-AM.png 377w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-25-at-10.03.29-AM.png?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-25-at-10.03.29-AM.png?resize=300,135 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-25-at-10.03.29-AM.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 377px) 100vw, 377px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100002" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Latch</p></div></p>
<p>Doing some quick match, Latch grew booked revenues 50.5% from 2019 to 2020. Its booked software revenues grew 37.1%, while its booked hardware top line expanded over 70% during the same period.</p>
<p>That could be due to strong hardware installation fees, which could later result in software revenues; the company claims an average of a six-year software deal, so hardware revenues that are attached to new software incomes could low key declaim long-term SaaS revenues.</p>
<p><em>Update: Adding some clarity here, the above are &#8220;booked&#8221; revenues, which I&#8217;ve made more clear, not actual revenues. Its net revenues, better known as actual revenues, were $18 million, with $14 million of that coming from hardware. So, today, the company is certainly more hardware-heavy than I first thought. Damn non-S-1 filings!</em></p>
<p>While <a href="https://twitter.com/loganbartlett/status/1353684437775638529">some were quick to note</a> that the company is far from pure-SaaS &#8212; correct &#8212; I suspect that the model that could get some traction amongst investors is that this feels a bit like Peloton for real estate. How so? Peloton has large hardware incomes up front from new users, which convert to long-term subscription revenues. Latch may prove similar, albeit for a different customer base and market.</p>
<p>Per the deal&#8217;s reported terms, Latch will be worth $1.56 billion after the transaction. The combined entity will have $510 million in cash, including $190 million from a PIPE &#8212; a method of putting private money into a public entity &#8212; from &#8220;BlackRock, D1 Capital Partners, Durable Capital Partners LP, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC, Chamath Palihapitiya, The Spruce House Partnership, Wellington Management, ArrowMark Partners, Avenir and Lux Capital.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.goalsetter.co/">Goalsetter</a>, a platform that helps parents teach their kids financial literacy, announced the raise of a $3.9 million seed round this morning, led by Astia.</p>
<p>PNC Bank, Mastercard, U.S. Bank, Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures, Elevate Capital, Portfolia&#8217;s First Step and Rising America Fund and Pipeline Angels also participated in the round. The round also saw participation from a handful of individual investors including Robert F. Smith, Kevin Durant, Chris Paul, Baron Davis, Sterling K. Brown, Ryan Bathe, CC Sabathia and Amber Sabathia.</p>
<p>Goalsetter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/12/goalsetter-gives-parents-a-way-to-teach-their-kids-how-to-save-money/">launched in 2019</a> out of the Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator. Founded by Tanya Court, who lost over $1 million in the 2001 bubble burst, the platform teaches financial literacy to children of all ages, helping them learn economic concepts, lingo and the principles of financial health.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After long stints at Nickelodeon and ESPN, Court understands deeply how kids learn and what keeps their attention. She vowed to make sure that her children were never ignorant of what it takes to protect their wealth and create more.</p>
<p>The app also allows parents to give allowances through the app, and even pay out their own specified amount for every quiz question the kid gets right in the app. Plus, family and friends can give &#8220;goal cards&#8221; instead of gift cards, helping kids save for the things they really want in the future.</p>
<p>The company recently launched a debit card for kids, as well, letting parents control the way the card is used and even lock it until their kids have passed the week&#8217;s financial literacy quiz.</p>
<p>Families save an average of $120 a month on the platform, and Court says that two families saved over $10,000 in the last year.</p>
<p>The company is also launching a massive campaign next week for Black History Month with the goal of closing the wealth gap among Black children and kids of color through financial education.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one thing to put a debit card into your teenager&#8217;s hands,&#8221; said Court. &#8220;That&#8217;s great. That teaches them how to spend money. It&#8217;s another thing to teach kids the core concepts about how to build wealth, or to know the difference between putting your money into an investment account, or putting your money into a CD versus a mutual fund versus a savings account. We teach what interest rates are, and what compound interest means. Our focus is on financial education because it&#8217;s not enough to teach kids how to spend.&#8221;</p>
<p>Goalsetter raised $2.1 million in 2019 and now adds this latest round to that for a total of $6 million raised. This latest round was oversubscribed, giving Court the opportunity to be super selective about her investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every single one of these investors has a demonstrated commitment prior to people marching in the streets in April, to social justice and to investing in diversity and inclusion initiatives and people,&#8221; said Court. &#8220;Every single one of them. That was really important because we were oversubscribed and we had the luxury of being able to pick who our investors were. Every one of the investors that we invited to our table were investors who we knew invited folks who look like us in 2019 and 2018 and 2017 to their table.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Liz Meyerdirk made a name for herself at Uber as the Senior Director &amp; Global Head of Business Development for the company&#8217;s Uber Eats business and she&#8217;s now turning her attention to women&#8217;s health as the new chief executive of <a href="https://thepillclub.com/">The Pill Club</a>.</p>
<p>The move comes at a perilous time for the remote delivery of women&#8217;s healthcare as the Supreme Court has taken steps to limit the provision of sexual healthcare to women in recent months.</p>
<p>&#8220;Women’s health care has never been more tested than right now,&#8221; Meyerdirk noted in a blog post announcing her new role. &#8220;COVID-19 has upended access to care; dozens of states have—and continue—to try and limit women&#8217;s choice; and last year, the Supreme Court voted to uphold the rollback of the ACA contraceptive mandate decision, a stunning move that could end up impacting as many as 126,000 women who previously received covered contraception through employer-based health insurance.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A seasoned corporate executive, Meyerdirk is hoping to navigate The Pill Club through these treacherous times. &#8220;These events have shown that reliable, safe, and affordable access to women’s health and birth control is<br />
just one more vulnerability in our health care system,&#8221; Meyerdirk wrote.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100041" style="width: 372px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100041" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2100041" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Liz_Meyerdirk.jpg" alt="" width="362" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Liz_Meyerdirk.jpg 3800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Liz_Meyerdirk.jpg?resize=120,150 120w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Liz_Meyerdirk.jpg?resize=240,300 240w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Liz_Meyerdirk.jpg?resize=768,960 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Liz_Meyerdirk.jpg?resize=544,680 544w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Liz_Meyerdirk.jpg?resize=1229,1536 1229w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Liz_Meyerdirk.jpg?resize=1638,2048 1638w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Liz_Meyerdirk.jpg?resize=40,50 40w" sizes="(max-width: 362px) 100vw, 362px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100041" class="wp-caption-text">Liz Meyerdirk, chief executive of The Pill Club: Image Credit: The Pill Club</p></div></p>
<p>As it faces an uncertain legal environment on some fronts, the company couldn&#8217;t be in a better position financially.</p>
<p>The Pill Club, which is profitable and now has a $100 million run rate, is now ready for its closeup with Meyerdirk at the helm.</p>
<p>The company has managed to make its mark in the crowded world of online prescriptions and refill fulfillment by focusing specifically on women&#8217;s health and ensuring that those services are available to as many potential patients as possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re now serving hundreds of thousands of women nationwide with 20% on Medicaid,&#8221; says Meyerdirk. &#8220;We prescribe in 43 states and the District of Columbia.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Meyerdirk, the background she had in logistics and fulfillment from her time at Uber Eats made the transition to the pill prescription and delivery service natural.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a heavy logistics element to it,&#8221; said Meyerdirk.</p>
<p>As Meyerdirk takes the reins of the company, she said there&#8217;s a few areas that The Pill Club will expand into beyond its focus on birth control and contraception. &#8220;There are areas that our customers are asking for,&#8221; Meyerdirk said.</p>
<p>These areas include, initially, dermatology. Last year the company launched a delivery service for contraceptives and women&#8217;s hygiene products like pads and tampons.</p>
<p>As it continues to expand its product suite, it&#8217;s also growing its executive staff. The company not only added Meyerdirk, but also David Hsu as chief financial officer and Jeremy Downs as senior vice president of growth. Hsu joins the company from Honey, where led the $4 billion acquisition negotiations with PayPal, and Downs comes from Uber Eats, where he spent five years leading growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need sustained, long-term access to women’s health care, not just a bridge while the pandemic persists; and we need coverage for essential health services like birth control and prenatal care, regardless of whether or not you’re insured,&#8221; Meyerdirk wrote. &#8220;Reproductive care has and continues to be an essential part of our business, but there are countless opportunities to serve women in all of their life stages from puberty to menopause.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Virgin Orbit isn&#8217;t slowing down after joining the exclusive club of small launch companies that have made it to orbit – the company just announced that it&#8217;s flying a payload on behalf of customer the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNAF). This is the first ever satellite being put up by the Dutch Ministry of Defense, and it&#8217;s a small satellite that will act as a test platform for a number of different communications experiments.</p>
<p>The satellite is called &#8216;BRIK-II&#8217; – not because it&#8217;s the second of its kind, but rather because it&#8217;s named after Brik, the first airplane ever owned and operated by the RNAF. This mission is one of Virgin Orbit&#8217;s first commercial operations after its successful test demonstration, and will fly sometime later this year. It&#8217;s also being planned as a rideshare mission, with other payloads expected to join – likely from the U.S. Department of Defense, which is working with Virgin Orbit&#8217;s dedicated U.S. defense industry subsidiary VOX Space on planning what they&#8217;ll be adding to the mission load out.</p>
<p>This upcoming mission is actually a key demonstration of a number of Virgin Orbit&#8217;s unique advantages in the launch market. For one, it&#8217;ll show how the U.S. DOD and its ally defense agencies can work together in the space domain when launching small communications satellites. Virgin Orbit is also going to use the mission as an opportunity to show off its &#8220;late-load integration&#8221; capabilities – effectively, how it can add a payload to its LauncherOne rocket just prior to launch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For this particular flight, there&#8217;s no real reason to do a late-load integration, since there&#8217;s plenty of lead time, but part of Virgin&#8217;s appeal is being able to nimbly add satellites to its rocket just before the carrier jet that flies it to its take-off altitude leaves the runway. Demonstrating that will go a long way to help illustrate how it differentiates its services from others in the launch market including Rocket Lab and SpaceX.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A startup called <a href="https://blackcart.com/">BlackCart</a> is tackling one of the key challenges with online shopping: an inability to try on or test out the merchandise before making a purchase. That company, which has now closed on $8.8 million in Series A funding, has built a try-before-you-buy platform that integrates with e-commerce storefronts, allowing customers to ship items to their home for free and only pay if they choose to keep the item after a &#8220;try on&#8221; period has lapsed.</p>
<p>The new round of financing was led by Origin Ventures and Hyde Park Ventures Partners, and saw participation from Struck Capital, Citi Ventures, 500 Startups, and several other angel investors including Christian Sullivan of Republic Labs, Dean Bakes of M3 Ventures, Greg Rudin of Menlo Ventures, Jordan Nathan of Caraway Cookware, and First National Bank CFO Nick Pirollo, among others.</p>
<p>The Toronto-based company <a href="https://www.struckcapital.com/press/2020/10/1/fashion-e-commerce-startup-blackcart-raises-28-million-cad-to-fast-track-platform-launch#:~:text=Fashion%20E%2DCommence%20Startup%20Blackcart,Track%20Platform%20Launch%20%E2%80%94%20Struck%20Capital&amp;text=BlackCart%2C%20a%20Toronto%2Dbased%20fashion,date%20to%20%243%20million%20CAD.">last year had raised</a> a $2 million seed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2100017" style="width: 419px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100017" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2100017" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/donny.png?w=594" alt="" width="409" height="468" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/donny.png 2340w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/donny.png?resize=131,150 131w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/donny.png?resize=262,300 262w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/donny.png?resize=768,880 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/donny.png?resize=594,680 594w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/donny.png?resize=1341,1536 1341w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/donny.png?resize=1788,2048 1788w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/donny.png?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100017" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BlackCart</p></div></p>
<p>BlackCart founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/donnyouyang/?originalSubdomain=ca">Donny Ouyang</a> had previously founded online tutoring marketplace Rayku before joining a seed stage VC fund, Caravan Ventures. But he was inspired to return to entrepreneurship, he says, after experiencing a personal problem with trying to order shoes online.</p>
<p>Realizing the opportunity for a &#8220;try before you buy&#8221; type of service, Ouyang first built BlackCart in 2017 as a business-to-consumer (B2C) platform that worked by way of a Chrome extension with some 50 different online merchants, largely in apparel.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a> of sorts proved there was consumer demand for something like this in online shopping shopping.</p>
<p>Ouyang credits the earlier version of BlackCart with helping the team to understand what sort of products work best for this service.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, in general, for try-before-you-buy, anything that&#8217;s moderate to higher price points, lower frequency of purchase, where the customer makes a considered purchase decision &#8212; those perform really well,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Two years later, Ouyang took BlackCart to 500 Startups in San Francisco, where he then pivoted the business to a B2B offering it is today.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100020" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100020" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2100020" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/product3.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="329" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/product3.png 1189w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/product3.png?resize=150,73 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/product3.png?resize=300,145 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/product3.png?resize=768,372 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/product3.png?resize=680,329 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/product3.png?resize=50,24 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100020" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BlackCart</p></div></p>
<p>The startup now provides a try-before-you-buy platform that integrates with online storefronts, including those from Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, Big Commerce, SalesForce Commerce Cloud, WordPress, and even custom storefronts. The system is designed to be turnkey for online retailers and takes around 48 hours to set up on Shopify around a week on Magento, for example.</p>
<p>BlackCart has also developed its own proprietary technology around fraud detection, payments, returns, and the overall user experience, which includes a button for retailers&#8217; websites.</p>
<p>Because the online shoppers aren&#8217;t paying upfront for the merchandise they&#8217;re being shipped, BlackCart has to rely on an expanded array of behavioral signals and data in order to make a determination about whether the customer represents a fraud risk. As one example, if the customer had read a lot of helpdesk articles about fraud before placing their order, that could be flagged as a negative signal.</p>
<p>BlackCart also verifies the user&#8217;s phone number at checkout and matches it to telco and government data sets to see if their historical addresses match their shipping and billing addresses.</p>

<p>After the customer receives the item, they are able to keep it for a period of time (as designated by the retailer) before being charged. BlackCart covers any fraud as part of its value proposition to retailers.</p>
<p>BlackCart makes money by way of a rev share model, where it charges retailers a percentage of the sales where the customers have kept the products. This amount can vary based on a number of factors, like the fraud multiplier, average order value, the type of product and others. At the low end, it&#8217;s around 4% and around 10% on the high-end, Ouyang says.</p>
<p>The company has also expanded beyond home try-on to include try-before-you-buy for electronics, jewelry, home goods, and more. It can even ship out makeup samples for home try-on, as another option.</p>
<p>Once integrated on a website, BlackCart claims its merchants typically see conversion increases of 24%, average order values climb by 51%, and bottom-line sales growth of 27%.</p>
<p>To date, the platform been adopted by over 50 medium-to-large retailers as well as e-commerce startups, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/koio-the-d2c-luxury-sneaker-brand-raises-6-million/">luxury sneaker brand Koio</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/15/diaco-gets-another-70m-from-sequoia-usv/">clothing startup Dia&amp;Co</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/29/helix-sleep-raises-7-4-million-to-sell-made-to-order-mattresses-online/">online mattress startup Helix Sleep</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/28/caraway-seed-funding/">cookware startup Caraway</a>, among others. It&#8217;s also under NDA now with a top 50 retailer it can&#8217;t yet name publicly, and has contracts signed with 13 others who are waiting to be onboarded.</p>
<p>Soon, BlackCart aims to offer a self-serve onboarding process, Ouyang notes.</p>
<p>&#8220;This would be later, end of Q2 or early Q3,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But I think for us, it will still be probably 80% self-serve, and then larger enterprises will want to be handheld.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the additional funding, BlackCart aims to shift to paying the merchant immediately for the items at checkout, then reconciling afterwards in order to be more efficient. This has been one of merchants&#8217; biggest feature requests, as well.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100015" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100015" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2100015" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blackcart-team.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="392" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blackcart-team.png 2040w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blackcart-team.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blackcart-team.png?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blackcart-team.png?resize=768,443 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blackcart-team.png?resize=680,392 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blackcart-team.png?resize=1536,886 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/blackcart-team.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100015" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> BlackCart; team photo</p></div></p>
<p>The funding will also allow BlackCart to expand its remotely distributed 10-person team to around 50 by year-end, including engineers, product specialists, customer support staff, and sales.</p>
<p>More broadly, it aims to quickly capitalize on the growth in the e-commerce market, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;[We want to] take advantage of the favorable macroeconomic situation to scale as quickly as possible,&#8221; Ouyang explains. &#8220;We&#8217;re hoping to get to around $250 million in transactions through our platform by the end of 2021. And this would be driven by both engineering and sales hires, and just pushing it up,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Longer-term, Ouyang envisions adding more consumer-facing features to BlackCart&#8217;s platform, like on-demand returns where a courier comes to the house to pick up your return, for example.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our firm is excited to partner with BlackCart as it makes try-before-you-buy the standard in online shopping,&#8221; said Prashant Shukla of Origin Ventures, who now sits on BlackCart&#8217;s board, as result of the new financing. &#8220;Its underwriting technology provides merchants with peace of mind, and its best-in-class consumer experience delivers significant sales and conversion lifts. Digital Native generations expect to be able to shop online exactly as they would in a retail store, and BlackCart is the only company providing this experience,&#8221; he adds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Payments for consumers have made a huge shift to the online world in the last year, a time when they have moved more of their purchasing to the internet to minimize in-person transactions in the midst of a virus-based health pandemic. Today, a startup that has built a similar kind of payments infrastructure &#8212; but specifically targeting small businesses and the payments they need to make &#8212; has raised a big round of funding to double down on its own slice of the market.</p>
<p><a href="http://melio.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Melio</a>, which provides a platform for SMBs to pay other companies electronically using bank transfers, debit cards or credit &#8212; along with the option of cutting paper checks for recipients if that is what the recipients request &#8212; has closed $110 million in funding at a valuation that the company said was now $1.3 billion.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s focus to date has been building and growing system to replace the paper invoices, snail mail, and bank transfers that might take multiple days to clear and still dominate payments for small and medium enterprises. The company was founded in Israel but has to date focused a lot of its attention on the U.S. market, where it saw growth of 2,000% last year (it doesn&#8217;t disclose the actual number of customers that it has). CEO Matan Bar said that this is where the company will continue to focus for now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This latest round was led by Coatue and also included participation from previous backers Accel, Aleph, Bessemer Venture Partners, Corner Ventures, General Catalyst, and Latitude. It caps off a huge year for the company, which raised $130 million in 2020 (and $256 million overall), with other recent backers including others like American Express and Salesforce.</p>
<p>The latter two are strategic backers: AmEx is one of the options given to customers paying other businesses through Melio&#8217;s rails.</p>
<p>Salesforce, meanwhile, is not yet an integration partner, but Bar &#8212; who co-founded the company with Ilan Atias and Ziv Paz (respectively CTO and COO) &#8212; described its interest as similar to that of Intuit-owned accounting giant Quickbooks. Quickbooks connects with Melio so that users of one can seamlessly import activity from one platform into the other, and Bar hinted that there is an interest from the CRM giant, which provides a number of other business and productivity tools, to work together in a similar fashion.</p>
<p>Bar came to found Melio on the heels of years of experience in peer-to-peer payments focused on the consumer market. He previously ran PayPal&#8217;s business unit focused on peer-to-peer payments, which included Venmo in the US and equivalent services (not branded Venmo) outside of it. He came to PayPal, which at the time was a part of eBay, through eBay&#8217;s acquisition of his previous startup, a social gifting platform called <a href="https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-1000681080" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Gifts Project</a>.</p>
<p>As Bar describes it, PayPal &#8220;was the first time I experienced what the digitization of payments looked like as they were shifting from cash to mobile payments. Consumers were buying online instead of at brick-and-mortar stores, and even when they were getting physical items, they were paying online.&#8221; What he quickly realized, though, was that the same was not applying to the businesses themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are still trillions being transferred via paper checks in the B2B space,&#8221; he said, with paper invoices and paper checks dominating the market. &#8220;The space is way behind other payment areas. I would be talking with SMB owners who would be using fancy Square or PayPal point of sale devices, but when they had to pay, say, a coffee bean supplier, they stuffed checks in envelopes. That’s very intriguing obviously, and it triggered our interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interestingly this isn&#8217;t a problem that hasn&#8217;t been identified before, but many of the solutions, such as Bill.com or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/tipalti-receives-150m-at-a-2b-valuation-after-its-accounts-payable-platform-sees-a-surge-in-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tipalti</a>, are really designed for larger enterprises. &#8220;They are too overwhelming for SMBs,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Even their names say it all: Accounts Payable Automation Solutions. It’s about tens of thousands of payments, and accounting departments, not an order from a wine shop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That formed the basis of what the startup started to build, which has been, in essence, a very pared-down version of these other payments platforms with SMB needs in mind.</p>
<p>The first of these is a focus on cashflow, Bar said. Specifically, the Melio platform lets payments be made automatically but businesses themselves can delay the timing on when money actually leaves their accounts: &#8220;Buyers keep cash longer, vendors get paid faster&#8221; is how Bar describes it.</p>
<p>This is in part enabled by the tech that Melio has built, which builds in risk assessment, as well as fraud management, and balances payments across the whole of its platform to send money in and out without the need for the company to raise debt to back up those payments.</p>
<p>&#8220;We leverage data to assess risk,&#8221; said Bar. &#8220;Every dollar in this round is going towards R&amp;D and sales and marketing. We don’t need the capital in our model.&#8221; It also works with the likes of AmEx and its own credit system in cases where people are paying on credit, but Bar also noted that currently most of the transactions that happen on its platform are not credit based. Most are bank transfers.</p>
<p>While others like Stripe have also built B2B payment services to pay out suppliers, Bar points out that what it has created is unique in that it is a standalone service: no need to be a part of Stripe&#8217;s wider ecosystem of services to use this if you already use another payments provider you are happy with.</p>
<p>Given that focus on cashflow for SMBs, what&#8217;s also interesting is the low bar to entry that Melio has built into its platform. Specifically, the service is completely free for businesses to use &#8212; that is, no fee is charged &#8212; as long as companies are making bank transfers or using debit cards. It takes a 2.9% fee when a business elects to use a credit card for a transaction (and even then Melio says that the fee is tax deductible in the US).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">He noted that one of the reasons that Melio has to date targeted the US market is because of how antiquated it still is. &#8220;The average bank transfer still takes three to four business days, if you don’t want to take any risk,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have developed models to do it same day. We take the risk that the buyer might not have the funds in that account but think about how that impacts cash flows. With Melio you still pay in three days, but money will be delivered the same day. That is how you can keep cash longer, without a payments risk.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Targeting a market that remains very underserved at a time when so much has gone virtual in payments is why investors are also interested.</p>
<p>“Melio has identified both the opportunity and duty to help small businesses manage their finance remotely and improve cash flow, in normal times as well as during this crisis, as physical payments supply chains are interrupted and overwhelmed,&#8221; said Michael Gilroy, a general partner at Coatue, in a statement. &#8220;Going digital is the only way small businesses can compete against larger rivals and stay ahead of the curve.”</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In terms of more product development, Bar said that the company has </span>received &#8220;a lot of incoming interest from partners to enable B2B payments within their products on their product,&#8221; similar to what Quickbooks is doing and Salesforce is likely to do. &#8220;Payments are contextual and they want to enable a quicker way to get there. The SMB is underserved. And yes, from a unit economics it’s much better to go after Nike. But this is also to really create some financial inclusion. We want to enable services for the small shop that the big guys already have.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a year marred by the coronavirus pandemic, it seems that early-stage startups on the African continent are continuing to see some notable growth, both in terms of their business and from investors looking to back them. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.microtraction.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microtraction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an early-stage venture capital firm based in Lagos, Nigeria, saw funding nearly quadruple for its portfolio.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://opentraction.com/microtraction-2020-in-review-2e2a24ed6c3d"><span style="font-weight: 400;">review of the year published</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> last week, the firm noted that 21 companies in its portfolio have raised more than $33 million in funding. This represents nearly four-fold growth over a year ago, when its portfolio raised $6 million (and just $3 million in 2018). The companies’ combined valuation stands at more than $147 million, according to the firm.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by </span><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/yelebademosi"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yele Bademosi</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2017, Microtraction arrived on the continent&#8217;s early-stage investment scene with all intent to be &#8220;the most accessible and preferred source of pre-seed funding for African tech entrepreneurs.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bademosi, who returned to Nigeria from the U.K. in 2015, worked as the general manager for Starta Africa, an online community for African tech entrepreneurs. After his stint there, he saw the need to plug the gap of early-stage funding in Nigeria and the continent at large with Microtraction.</span></p>
<p>Microtraction does not specify the size of its fund, but what is more clear is that <span style="font-weight: 400;">it has attracted a great deal of attention and has built a strong network in part because of who backs it. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mwseibel?lang=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Seibel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the CEO of Y Combinator, is a global advisor and an investor in the firm, and so is </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andyvolk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andy Volk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the head of ecosystem for Google Sub-Saharan Africa. Other investors include Pave Investments and U.S.-based angel investor </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cbschultz"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chris Schultz</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being entrepreneurs in the past, some of these investors know what it takes to build a startup in the U.S. But it&#8217;s completely different in Africa. With no on the ground know-how as to which startups to fund but an interest to do so, for portfolio diversification and other personal reasons, Microtraction and a few other early-stage investors present the best bets to accomplish this goal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At first, Microtraction&#8217;s standard deal was to offer portfolio startups $15,000 in exchange for a 7.5% equity. But as a sign of how the market is firming up, that changed last year, and now the firm invests $25,000 for 7% equity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microtraction revealed that it accepted more than 500 applications from startups in Nigeria, Ghana, Zambia and Mauritius in its first full year of operation (though, just eight of those companies got investments).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The introductory batch was all Nigerian: four fintech startups &#8212; </span><a href="https://cowrywise.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cowrywise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://riby.me/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Riby</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://wallets.africa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wallets Africa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://thankucash.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ThankUCash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; a crypto-exchange startup, </span><a href="https://buycoins.africa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BuyCoins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; a SaaS platform, Accounteer; an edtech startup, </span><a href="https://schoolable.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schoolable</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; and healthtech startup, </span><a href="https://54gene.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">54gene</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 saw the local VC firm invest in six companies. This time there was a representative outside Nigeria &#8212; Ghanaian fintech startup </span><a href="https://bitsika.africa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitsika</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Nigerian startups included social commerce startup </span><a href="https://sendbox.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sendbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; events startup </span><a href="https://twitter.com/festivalcoins?lang=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Festival Coins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; and communications-as-a-service platform </span><a href="https://termii.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Termii</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The rest were unannounced.</span></p>
<h2>Half of its portfolio companies are backed by YC and other global accelerators</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year (the one this latest review covers), Microtraction announced seven startups. The latest selection includes Nigerian fintech startups </span><a href="https://www.evolvecredit.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evolve Credit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://chaka.ng/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chaka</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; edtech startup </span><a href="https://gradely.ng/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gradely</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; bus-hailing platform </span><a href="https://www.plentywaka.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PlentyWaka</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; and Kenyan credit data marketplace </span><a href="https://carmachain.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CARMA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of the total investments raised in 2019 and 2020, 54gene contributed more than half of those numbers by raising $4.5 million in seed and a </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/14/african-genomics-startup-54gene-raises-15m-led-by-adjuvant-capital/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$15 million Series A investment</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With an ingenious solution to solve the underrepresentation of African genomics data in global genomics research, 54gene got accepted into the winter batch in January 2019, the same month it officially launched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Excluding 54gene, there were </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/20/seven-africa-focused-startups-present-at-y-combinators-demo-day/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">six other African-focused startups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the YC W19 batch. Two out of the six, Schoolable and Wallets Africa, were Microtraction portfolio companies. Others accepted into YC before and after include BuyCoins, Cowrywise, Termii and two unannounced startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microtraction-backed ThankUCash and a second unannounced startup have also joined cohorts at 500 Startups. On the other hand, Festival Coins is the only startup to be selected into Google for Startups Accelerator. With all accounted for, 11 out of the 21 startups are either backed by Y Combinator, 500 Startups or Google for Startups.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting into these global accelerators is a surefire way to receive follow-up investment, ranging from $125,000 to $150,000. From the outside in, startups see Microtraction and other early-stage VC firms like Ventures Platform as a means to that end. There have also been arguments that these firms build startups to be &#8220;YC or any global accelerator ready.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, </span><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/natekorl"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dayo Koleowo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a partner at Microtraction alongside <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chidinma-iwueke-b1b8491a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chidinma Iwueke</a>, debunks it saying there&#8217;s no formula behind the numbers we see. He believes YC and other accelerators share the same fundamentals with Microtraction, which revolves around the team, the market and traction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We love super technical teams, understand the industry they are in and are likely to succeed without us. We are always looking for companies that are solving huge problems that a lot of people face,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;Also, the tech and startup world moves fast, so we like teams that understand that and can show in real-time that they can execute. I believe that these global accelerators look for these same things.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically, YC and other accelerators may perform extended due diligence and risk assessments before cutting cheques for any African startup without a local backer. Koleowo points out that this might be why Microtraction portfolio companies get accepted quicker. &#8220;The icing on the cake is that there is a level of de-risking that has been done by Microtraction and other local investors on the ground before these global accelerators step in,&#8221; he added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, there&#8217;s no denying the significance of Microtraction&#8217;s advisory board in playing a part as to why half the firm&#8217;s portfolio are in global accelerators. Besides the names mentioned earlier, Lexi Novitske, PIO at Singularity Investments and Dotun Olowoporoku, managing partner at Starta act as regional advisors, and Monique Woodward, a venture partner at 500 Startups, is a global advisor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And with the growing trends of globalization, plus the acceptance of a more decentralised approach to building and operations in the tech industry because of COVID-19, it&#8217;s a trend that might continue for a while.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Here’s a bit of a curve ball from Apple. A month-and-a-half or so after launching the Fitness+ app premium workout service, the company’s offering up an add-on intended to offer an exercise dimension beyond the confines of iOS (and your living room). Arriving today for Fitness+ subscribers, Time to Walk is a new, guided walking tour hosted by a rotating cast of celebrity guests.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a pretty diverse cast, as evidenced by the first round of names, which are dropping via a software update today. Included in the first five are Dolly Parton &#8212; who is probably about as universally beloved a celebrity as exists in 2021 &#8212; and Warriors power forward Draymond Green, who is no doubt less universal, because, well, sports. Also included in the first round are musician Shawn Mendes and &#8220;Orange Is the New Black&#8221; star Uzo Aduba.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2099964" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2099964" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2099964" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-draymond-green_01252021.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2099964" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are five episodes up front, which will be available as activity cards on the Apple Watch Workout app. In fact, they should start showing as cards in the app&#8217;s feed shortly. Going forward, they’ll be updated at a pace of one a week.</p>
<p>The experience is straightforward on the face of it. Essentially, Apple asks guests to record themselves on a walk, telling stories and sharing three songs. Music is played through the app and images are delivered to the small screen in an effort to build a semi-immersive (but not distracting) accompaniment for your own walk. You can save the songs on an Apple Music playlist or save the episode for later, if you want to listen again. For those who utilize wheelchairs for mobility, the feature will appear as &#8220;Time to Push,&#8221; which builds on top of the wheelchair-based fitness tracking Apple introduced several years back.</p>
<p>An Apple Fitness+ subscription is required to follow along. That&#8217;s due, in part, to a deeper integration with the premium fitness service. Both are also tied directly into other Apple services, like Music, which the company has made a kind of foundational element of its workouts.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been a big walker &#8212; trying to avoid driving or public transit when time and distance allow. But the past year has really prioritized the activity for me as both an excuse to leave my one-bedroom apartment and a way to get in a workout with all of the gyms closed for months on end. It is, frankly, a pretty big factor in keeping me going throughout the pandemic.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2099965" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2099965" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2099965" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/apple_time-to-walk_apple-watch-uzo-aduba_01252021.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2099965" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>When I walk, I do so with music or podcasts. I&#8217;ve tried some &#8220;walking meditations&#8221; in the past, but found that the experiences have revolved around notions of &#8220;quiet reflection,&#8221; which doesn&#8217;t quit do the trick when you&#8217;re walking over the 59th street bridge into midtown Manhattan. Time to Walk turns the idea on its head a bit, by approximating the experience of walking along with someone. As they walk, they relate a kind of stream-of-consciousness, relating often personal stories in the process. The idea, of course, being that walking is a head-clearing tool for many &#8212; creatives especially.</p>
<p>“Walking is the most popular physical activity in the world, and one of the healthiest things we can do for our bodies. A walk can often be more than just exercise: It can help clear the mind, solve a problem, or welcome a new perspective,” Apple&#8217;s Jay Blahnik <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/01/time-to-walk-an-inspiring-audio-walking-experience-comes-to-apple-fitness-plus/">said in a release</a>. “Even throughout this challenging period of time, one activity that has remained available to many is walking. With Time to Walk, we’re bringing weekly original content to Apple Watch in Fitness+ that includes some of the most diverse, fascinating, and celebrated guests offering inspiration and entertainment to help our users keep moving through the power of walking.”</p>
<p>Like Fitness+ before it, the new feature is well-timed, as many parts of the world (the U.S. in particular) are still very much in the throes of pandemic-fueled shutdowns. It seems there&#8217;s a new story every day about a new potential mutation warning us off the sorts of things we used to do. Time to Walk is an effort to give you some interesting company for those walks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Moderna has detailed some of the steps it&#8217;s taking to ensure that its vaccine remains effective in the face of emerging strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that leads to COVID-19. These include testing how adding a second booster, for a total of three shots, works with its existing COVID-19 vaccine, and also developing a strain-specific variant designed to target spike proteins on the new variants of the virus that were first identified in the U.K. and in South Africa.</p>
<p>The company is pursuing these measures &#8220;out of an abundance of caution,&#8221; the biotech firm said in <a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-retains-neutralizing-activity-against">a press release</a>, since early studies show that the existing vaccine continues to prove effective against these new strains, albeit with some loss of efficacy specifically with the B.1.351 variant, which was first identified in patients in South Africa. Even so, it&#8217;s heartening to see the company moving quickly to address the virus&#8217; mutation, since it&#8217;s likely that similar adaptations will be required longer term to keep COVID-19 in control even once the current pandemic is ended.</p>
<p>Further, Moderna says that in fact, it expects both its forthcoming candidate and its existing booster vaccine should be able to provide additional immunity-boosting capabilities when used in combination with &#8220;all of the leading vaccine candidates&#8221; on the market. That means the company believes it could be used in combination with the Oxford or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines to boost immunity, which could be helpful in cases where supplies of one or the other are low and there&#8217;s an urgent need to provide a booster in a timely manner.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The best news of all of this is, of course, that Moderna now has evidence that suggests the mRNA-based vaccine it&#8217;s already providing to people globally will still provide protection against SARS-CoV-2, and by extension, COVID-19. Specifically for the U.K. variant in particular, the study data shows no reduction in immune performance in patients who received the vaccine. As for the South African variant, that reduction in efficacy mostly translates to a potential of quicker waning of immunity provided by the jab &#8212; which hopefully just means people will need another jab sooner than expected, but shouldn&#8217;t lead to any dramatic changes in our combined global approach to providing inoculations, especially initially.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A third class action lawsuit has been filed in Europe against Apple seeking compensation &#8212; for what Italy&#8217;s Altroconsumo consumer protection agency dubs &#8220;planned obsolescence&#8221; of a number of iPhone 6 models.</p>
<p>The action relates to performance throttling Apple applied several years ago to affected iPhones when the health of the device&#8217;s battery had deteriorated &#8212; doing so without clearly informing users. It later apologized.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="mg1YYnNjqv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/28/apple-apologizes-for-not-being-clearer-about-slowing-down-iphones-with-older-batteries/">Apple apologizes for not telling customers iPhones with older batteries would slow over time</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple apologizes for not telling customers iPhones with older batteries would slow over time&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/28/apple-apologizes-for-not-being-clearer-about-slowing-down-iphones-with-older-batteries/embed/#?secret=mg1YYnNjqv" data-secret="mg1YYnNjqv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The class action suit in Italy is seeking €60 million in compensation &#8212; based on at least €60 in average compensation per iPhone owner. Affected devices named in the suit are the iPhone 6, 6s, 6 Plus and 6s Plus, per a <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/iapmw8ie3ije/4zMgaeXbZ5sZEqwiSNyVck/dea9914bb631761645b034b120ec7f9f/Euroconsumers_Class_Action_Apple_-_Italy_.pdf">press release</a> put out by the umbrella consumer organization Euroconsumers, which counts Altroconsumo as a member.</p>
<p>The suit is the third to be filed in the region over the issue &#8212; following suits filed in Belgium and Spain <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/iapmw8ie3ije/6m97Djfmp1oq0sur5Jj3jk/99eae93b117925fd204ebe341131a76c/Euroconsumers_Press_release_Apple_Class_Action_Lawsuits.pdf">last month</a>.</p>
<p>A fourth &#8212; in Portugal &#8212; is slated to be filed shortly.</p>
<p>The tech giant settled similar charges in the U.S. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/02/apple-agrees-to-settlement-of-up-to-500-million-from-lawsuit-alleging-it-throttled-older-phones/">last year</a> &#8212; where it was accused of intentionally slowing down the performance of older iPhones to encourage customers to buy newer models or fresh batteries &#8212; shelling out $500 million, or around $25 per phone, to settle that case (while denying any wrongdoing).</p>
<p>&#8220;When consumers buy Apple iPhones, they expect sustainable quality products. Unfortunately, that is not what happened with the iPhone 6 series. Not only were consumers defrauded, and did they have to face frustration and financial harm, from an environmental point of view it is also utterly irresponsible,&#8221; said Els Bruggeman, Euroconsumers&#8217; head of policy and enforcement, in a statement.</p>
<p>“This new lawsuit is the latest front in our fight against planned obsolescence in Europe. Our ask is simple: American consumers received compensation, European consumers want to be treated with the same fairness and respect.”</p>
<p>Euroconsumers has produced a video (embedded below) to drum up wider support for the class actions in which it satirizes Apple&#8217;s &#8220;genius&#8221; in coming up with clever ways to accelerate its products&#8217; end of life&#8230;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/TsJ0quKrMqY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Apple has been contacted for comment on the European class actions.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/apple-fined-27-million-for-throttling-old-iphones-without-telling-users/">Almost a year</a> ago the company was fined €25 million by France&#8217;s competition watchdog over an iOS update that capped performance of aging devices. It was also made to display a statement regarding the action on its website for a month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.yac.com/">Yac</a>, the Orlando, Florida-based startup that&#8217;s digitizing voice messages for remote offices, has raised $7.5 million in a new round of funding.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s service has garnered enough attention to pick up a pretty sizable new round from investors led by <a href="https://www.ggvc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ggvc.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1611662714445000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHtJNAUe7dFIqzHbxw3ZeCDgyOPwg">GGV Capital</a> and a return investment from <a href="https://slack.com/fund" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://slack.com/fund&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1611662714445000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEft9Wh-da_8gYkjWv9exVq8y27Uw">the Slack Fund</a>.</p>
<p>Apparently, reinventing voicemail is a multi-million-dollar endeavor.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The future of meetings will be asynchronous, in your ears and hands-free,” says Pat Matthews, the chief executive and founder of Active Capital, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/yac-is-reinventing-voicemail-for-the-slack-generation/">when the company announced its seed round nearly a year ago</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="CdsNVNJxjW"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/yac-is-reinventing-voicemail-for-the-slack-generation/">Yac is reinventing voicemail for the Slack generation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Yac is reinventing voicemail for the Slack generation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/yac-is-reinventing-voicemail-for-the-slack-generation/embed/#?secret=CdsNVNJxjW" data-secret="CdsNVNJxjW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Co-founded by Justin Mitchell, Hunter McKinley and Jordan Walker, Yac was spun out of the digital agency SoFriendly, and was developed as a pitch for Product Hunt&#8217;s Maker Festival. The voice messaging service won that startup competition at the event and attracted the interest of Boost VC and its founder, the third-generation venture capitalist Adam Draper.</p>
<p>About six months after that seed round, Yac received outreach from Slack thanks to a referral from another entrepreneur. Throughout their negotiations last year, the teams used Yac to conduct due diligence, according to Mitchell. At the time of the company&#8217;s August announcement that Slack had come on to finance the company, Yac had a bit over 5,000 users on its service; it charges per seat, in the same way Slack does.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok has until Friday to respond to an order by Italy&#8217;s data protection agency to block users whose age it cannot verify, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>The GPDP made an &#8220;immediate&#8221; order <a href="https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9524224">Friday</a> in response to the death of a 10-year-old girl from Palermo who died of asphyxiation after participating in a &#8220;blackout challenge&#8221; on the social network, according to reports in local media.</p>
<p>The agency said the ban would remain in place until February 15 &#8212; suggesting it would make another assessment about any additional action at that point.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At the time of writing it does not appear that TikTok has taken action to comply with the GPDP&#8217;s order.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman told us it is reviewing the notification. &#8220;We have received and are currently reviewing the notification from Garante,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Privacy and safety are top priorities for TikTok and we are constantly strengthening our policies, processes and technologies to protect all users, and our younger users in particular.&#8221;</p>
<p>The GPDP had already raised concerns about children&#8217;s privacy on TikTok, warning in <a href="https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9508923">December</a> that its age verification checks are easily circumvented and raising objections over default settings that make users&#8217; content public. On December 22 it also announced it had opened a formal procedure &#8212; giving TikTok 30 days to respond.</p>
<p>The order to block users whose age it cannot verify is in addition to that action. If TikTok does not comply with the GPDP&#8217;s administrative order it could face enforcement from the Italian agency, drawing on penalty powers set out in the GDPR.</p>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s spokeswoman declined to answer additional questions about the order &#8212; which prohibits it from further processing user data &#8220;for whom there is no absolute certainty of age&#8221;, per GPDP&#8217;s <a href="https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9524224">press release</a> Friday.</p>

<p>The company also did not respond when we asked if it had submitted a response to the agency&#8217;s formal procedure.</p>
<p>In a statement last week following the girl&#8217;s death the company said: &#8220;Our deepest sympathies are with the girl&#8217;s family and friends. At TikTok, the safety of our community &#8212; in particular our younger users &#8212; is our priority, and we do not allow content that encourages, promotes, or glorifies dangerous behaviour that might lead to injury. We offer robust safety controls and resources for teens and families on our platform, and we regularly evolve our policies and protections in our ongoing commitment to our community.&#8221;</p>
<p>TikTok has said it has found no evidence of any challenge involving asphyxiation on its platform.</p>
<p>Although, in recent years, there have been a number of <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/tiktok-challenge-boy-hangs-self-wearing-mangalsutra-bangles-kota-rajasthan-1553087-2019-06-20">previous</a> <a href="https://sg.style.yahoo.com/mum-finds-4-old-hanging-134436062.html">reports</a> of underage users hanging themselves (or attempting to) after trying to copy things they saw on the platform.</p>
<p>Users frequently create and respond to content challenges, as part of TikTok&#8217;s viral appeal &#8212; such as (recently) a trend for singing sea shanties.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, a search on the platform for &#8216;#blackoutchallenge&#8217; returns no user content but displays a warning that the phrase &#8220;may be associated with behavior or content that violates our guidelines&#8221;.</p>

<p>There have been TikTok challenges related to &#8220;hanging&#8221; (as in people hanging by parts of their body other than their neck from/off objects) &#8212; and a search for <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/hangingchallenge?lang=en">#hangingchallenge</a> does still return results (including some users discussing the death of the 10-year-old girl).</p>
<p>Last year a number of users also participated in an event on the platform in which they posted images of black squares &#8212; using the hashtag #BlackOutTuesday &#8212; which related to Black Lives Matters protests.</p>
<p>So the term &#8220;blackout&#8221; has similarly been used on TikTok in relation to encouraging others to post content. Though not in that case in relation to asphyxiation.</p>

<p>Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission, which has been lined up as TikTok&#8217;s lead data supervisor in Europe &#8212; following the company&#8217;s <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-gb/updates-we-are-making-to-our-terms-of-service-and-privacy-policy">announcement</a> last year that its Irish entity would take over legal responsibility for processing European users&#8217; data &#8212; does not have an open inquiry into the platform &#8220;at present&#8221;, per a spokesman.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But TikTok is already facing a number of other investigations and legal challenges in Europe, including an investigation into how the app handles users&#8217; data by France&#8217;s watchdog CNIL &#8212; announced </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/tiktok-is-being-investigated-by-frances-data-watchdog/">last summer</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.</span></p>
<p>In recent years, France&#8217;s CNIL has been responsible for handing out some of the largest penalties for tech giants for infringing EU data protection laws (including fines for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/19/french-court-slaps-down-googles-appeal-against-57m-gdpr-fine/">Google</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/">Amazon</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55497350">December</a>, it also emerged that a 12-year-old girl in the U.K. is bringing a legal challenge against TikTok &#8212; claiming it uses children&#8217;s data unlawfully. A court ruled she can remain anonymous if the case goes ahead.</p>
<p>Last month Ireland&#8217;s data protection regulator put out <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/index.php/en/news-media/consultations/children-front-and-centre-fundamentals-child-oriented-approach-data-processing">draft guidelines</a> on what it couched as &#8220;the Fundamentals for a Child-Oriented Approach to Data Processing&#8221; &#8212; with the stated aim of driving improvements in standards of data processing related to minors.</p>
<p>While the GDPR typically requires data protection complaints to be funnelled through a lead agency, under the one-stop-shop mechanism, Italy&#8217;s GPDP&#8217;s order to TikTok to cease processing is possible under powers set out in the regulation (Article 66) that allows for &#8220;urgency procedures&#8221; to be undertaken by national watchdogs in instances of imperative risk. Although any such provisional measures can only last for three months &#8212; and only applies in the country where the DPA has jurisdiction (Italy in this case).</p>
<p>Ireland&#8217;s DPC would be the EU agency responsible for leading any resulting investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;If TikTok does not comply with our order, the sanctions provided for in the GDPR are applicable,&#8221; a spokesperson for the Italian agency confirmed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://wolt.com/en">Wolt</a>, the Helsinki-based online ordering and delivery company that initially focused on restaurants but has since expanded to other verticals, has raised $530 million in new funding. The round was led by Iconiq Growth, with participation from Tiger Global, DST, KKR, Prosus, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/carolina-brochado-eqt-growth/">EQT Growth</a> and Coatue.</p>
<p>Previous backers 83North, Highland Europe, Goldman Sachs Growth Equity, EQT Ventures and Vintage Investment Partners also followed on. The new round takes the total amount of financing Wolt has raised to $856 million. Wolt declined to disclose the company&#8217;s latest valuation, although we know from the previous D round that the company is one of Europe&#8217;s so-called unicorns.</p>
<p>“We operate in an extremely competitive and well-funded industry, and this round allows us to have a long-term mindset when it comes to doubling down on our different markets,” says co-founder and CEO Miki Kuusi in a statement. “Despite the turbulence of 2020, we’ve remained focused on growth, tripling our revenue to a preliminary $330 against a net loss of just $38 million. Compared to the $670 million in new capital that we’ve raised during this year, this puts us into a strong position for investing in our people, technology, and markets when thinking about the next few years ahead”.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Former Atomico and SoftBank VC Carolina Brochado has joined EQT to help build its new growth fund&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/carolina-brochado-eqt-growth/embed/#?secret=eY9pf7rbSw" data-secret="eY9pf7rbSw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Since launching with 10 restaurants in its home city in 2015, five years on Wolt has expanded to 23 countries and 120 cities, mostly in Europe but also including Japan and Israel. More recently, like others in the restaurant delivery space, Wolt has expanded beyond restaurants and takeout food into the grocery and retail sectors. This, says the company, sees it offer anything from cosmetics to pet food and pharmaceuticals on its platform.</p>
<p>“This was mostly a primary raise,” Kuusi tells me when I ask if the new round includes secondary funding (i.e. shareholders that exited to new investors). “We&#8217;re not looking to disclose the valuation at this time, but we&#8217;ve previously shared that the Series D round that we raised in early 2020 valued the company at above €1 billion,” he adds.</p>
<p>Kuusi says that the latest funding round is based on the belief that local services in the offline world will gradually be brought online by players “that can execute and maintain a great customer experience”. “We started with an exclusive focus on the restaurant, as it&#8217;s the biggest local service with an underlying high-frequency use case,” he says. “We quickly learnt that the magical product market fit for bringing the restaurant online was to offer a quick and predictable delivery experience from restaurants that didn&#8217;t use to be available for delivery. We do this by handling the complexity of the delivery on the restaurant&#8217;s behalf”.</p>
<p>However, this was especially difficult to do efficiently and sustainably in a small and difficult home market in the Nordics. To solve this, Wolt needed to build an “optimization-heavy logistics setup for last-mile delivery” that Kuusi says lets the service operate even in “very small cities with low income disparity, limited population density and high labor costs”.</p>
<p>“This means that we can operate efficiently even with relatively low order volumes, enabling us to grow and expand rapidly with much less financing than some of the other players in the market. We simply had no other choice than to do it this way as we came from such a difficult home market”.</p>
<p>On this foundation, Wolt is expanding into other ordering and local delivery verticals, aiming to be what Kuusi dubs as “the everything app” of goods and services. “Today, Wolt is much more than a restaurant delivery service; you can order groceries, electronics, flowers, clothes and many other things on our platform,” he explains. “We believe that the future of how people buy Nike shoes is a few taps on Wolt and some 30 minutes later you get any pair of shoes brought to your door. This is what we strive to make into a reality with our team at Wolt”. (I’m an Adidas guy myself, steadfastly European.)</p>
<p>Asked what he thinks about all the money being pumped into the dark convenience store model, Kuusi says Wolt is investing into its own dark store operation called Wolt Market. “It&#8217;s not surprising to also see a growing amount of financing going into this sector&#8221;, he admits. &#8220;We&#8217;re huge believers in a hybrid model where there will be both offline/online retailers as well as focused online retailers in the mix. Obviously the latter category is only getting started, and we should see a massive amount of growth for the coming years ahead”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.taboola.com">Taboola</a> is the latest company seeking to go public via special purpose acquisition company — more commonly known as a SPAC.</p>
<p>To achieve this, it will merge with ION Acquisition Corp., which went public in 2020 with the aim of funding an Israeli tech acquisition (<a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/tech-news/.premium-exclusive-taboola-in-talks-for-ion-spac-merge-1.9395460">Haaretz reported last month that Taboola</a> was in talks with ION). The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter, and the combined company will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol TBLA.</p>
<p>Founded in 2007, Taboola powers content recommendation widgets (and advertising on those widgets) across 9,000 websites for publishers including CNBC, NBC News, Business Insider, The Independent and El Mundo. It says it reaches 516 million daily active users while working with more than 13,000 advertisers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company had previously planned to merge with competitor Outbrain before the deal was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/taboola-and-outbrain-call-off-their-850m-merger/">canceled last fall</a>, with sources pointing to the market impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, a &#8220;challenging culture fit&#8221; and regulatory issues to explain the deal&#8217;s end.</p>
<p>Taboola&#8217;s founder and CEO Adam Singolda (pictured above, left) told me that this didn&#8217;t lead directly to the SPAC deal. But he said, &#8220;I always wanted to go public,&#8221; which wasn&#8217;t possible while the merger was in the works. Once that deal was called off, and with 2020 turning out to be a strong year for Taboola — it&#8217;s projecting revenue of $1.2 billion, including $375 million ex-TAC revenue (revenue after paying publishers), with over $100 million in adjusted EBITDA — the time seemed right, and ION seemed like the right partner.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Taboola and Outbrain call off their $850M merger&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/taboola-and-outbrain-call-off-their-850m-merger/embed/#?secret=EP8OwCZ8HR" data-secret="EP8OwCZ8HR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We believe Taboola is an open web recommendation leader which is well positioned to challenge the walled gardens,&#8221; said ION CEO Gilad Shany in a statement. &#8220;We were looking to merge with a global technology leader with Israeli DNA and we found that in Taboola. The combination of long-term partnerships built by the company with thousands of open web digital properties, their direct access to advertisers, massive global reach and proven AI technology, allows Taboola to provide significant value to their partners while also achieving attractive unit economics as the company grows.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deal will value Taboola at $2.6 billion. Through this transaction, the company plans to raise a total of $545 million, including $285 million in PIPE financing secured from Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, Baron Capital Group, funds and accounts managed by Hedosophia, the Federated Hermes Kaufmann Funds and others.</p>
<p>Singolda said that the company plans to invest $100 million in R&amp;D this year, and that he hopes to expand the technology into areas like e-commerce and TV advertising, with the goal of moving &#8220;beyond the browser.&#8221; More broadly, he said he wants Taboola to be &#8220;a strong public company that champions the open web.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The open web is a $64 billion advertising market [according to Taboola estimates], but there&#8217;s no Google for the open web,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Yes, Google itself spends plenty of time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/22/google-proposes-new-privacy-and-anti-fingerprinting-controls-for-the-web/">talking about similar ideas</a>, but Singolda argued that while Google has consumer products like search and YouTube that compete with other publishers for time and attention, &#8220;Taboola is not in the consumer business &#8230; We serve our partners, and it&#8217;s in our identity to drive audience growth, engagement and revenue.&#8221;</p>
