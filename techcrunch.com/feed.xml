										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most fintechs pride themselves on digital everything, including customer acquisition strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But <a href="https://bankaya.com.mx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bankaya</a>, a Mexico City-based financial services startup, is attributing its early traction on the opposite model &#8212; going after target customers in person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2019 by CEO Mauricio Cordero, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ramón Chedraui and Diego Vargas</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Bankaya launched one year ago and boasted 450,000 customers as of year’s end. Impressively, and perhaps counterintuitively, most of that custom acquisition was via offline channels.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253329" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankaya’s target customers are the 50 million unbanked in Mexico. And the startup has made it its mission to drastically lower that number with what it believes is a unique approach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We realized we can’t reach this segment digitally. We have to go offline, face to face,” he told TechCrunch. “Especially because many of our target customers live in rural or remote areas, doing things like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">saving money under the mattress.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quite literally, Bankaya’s salesforce works the streets, even setting up shop at places like supermarkets and vaccination centers flanked by kiosks filled with debit cards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The underserved </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">need a lot of handholding, someone in front of them explaining how to use a card, for example, or how to send money to family,” Cordero said. “They are usually not active online and they are not going to download an app out of Facebook or Instagram.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That human engagement is working wonders. In December, Bankaya processed more than 800,000 transactions from customers, including purchases, deposits, withdrawals, bank transfers and payments of services. That’s up from over 500,000 in October.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Its target population has an inherent distrust of traditional banks, hence the strategy of talking to people face to face with the goal of easing some of that hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re working with the truly unbanked customer,” Cordero explained. “So we’re about building trust and financial education. The human element in these cases is so important. Just really critical. And that impact agenda is our competitive advantage.”</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="1skKmZndBb"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/why-latams-fintech-boom-is-more-than-hype-and-superlative-venture-investment/">Why LatAm&#8217;s fintech boom is more than hype and superlative venture investment</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why LatAm&#8217;s fintech boom is more than hype and superlative venture investment&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/why-latams-fintech-boom-is-more-than-hype-and-superlative-venture-investment/embed/#?secret=1skKmZndBb" data-secret="1skKmZndBb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cordero estimates that Bankaya’s CAC (customer acquisition cost) is about $4 per account opened &#8212; likely far lower than that of most fintechs and traditional banks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Every single digital bank in Mexico is spending millions on Facebook and Google ads, and that&#8217;s driving up their acquisition costs,” he told TechCrunch. “They’re all going after the same customer, and in a very expensive way that results in low-quality conversion rates and engagement.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another crucial differentiator for Bankaya is the fact that it is built via a BaaS (banking as a service) platform. There are only about 50 fully-licensed banks in all of Mexico and the country rarely awards new banking licenses, noted Cordero. &#8220;Then you have the IFPEs, or wallets, via the fintech law.<b>&#8220;</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re something in between,” explains Cordero. “We’re one of the first BaaS platforms connected to one of the 50 banks, and that has allowed us to have a really strong product. Fintech laws say that IFPEs are not allowed to touch consumer deposits &#8212; they can’t lend with them or share returns. But we are allowed to because we use the BaaS license of Consubanco.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its app has a digital card that is free for the user. The startup has a loyalty partnership with Chedraui, one of the country’s largest retailers. If Bankaya users buy goods in stores with their debit cards, they get 5% to 10% cash back on their Chedraui wallet. (Co-founder Ramón Chedraui is one of the family members that own <a href="https://www.grupochedraui.com.mx/">Grupo Chedraui</a>).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, 55% of Bankaya’s customers are women, and 59% earn an income below the national average of $600 a month. Sixty-nine percent don’t have a credit card. Over half of its customers are funded within the first three days of opening an account and all receive a digital card upon signing up, according to Cordero. The startup also offers a 2.5% return on deposits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Driving engagement is the name of the game for neobanks,” he told TechCrunch. “It can be hard to monetize if customers don’t see real value. For Bankaya, it doesn’t matter who you are or where you’re coming from, we want to help give people financial freedom so they don’t have to do things like walk two hours to pay a utility bill.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, over time, the startup will gather data that will only assist with future credit analysis.</span></p>
<p>To date, Bankaya is bootstrapped, funded by its founders, two of whom don’t participate in day to day operations. It has about 100 employees and a salesforce of about 300.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bankaya is also launching a buy now, pay later platform so that customers, through its app, can get credit installments. It won’t work as a credit card and the startup is not onboarding merchants. It works directly with the customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They use a debit card to buy a product and pay Bankaya over time,” Cordero said. Unlike with traditional buy now, pay later offerings, the startup does charge interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is not Germany or the U.S. where you can offer BNPL at 0% interest. That’s extremely hard to do here,” Cordero said. “We have to charge interest but the idea is to graduate customers so that once someone pays off an item, they can finance the second item with a lower interest rate.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon&#8217;s Fire TV streaming platform is coming to more cars, the company <a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/fire-tv-is-on-the-move-in-2022-e3f8860bc6b9">announced</a> today at CES. In the fourth quarter last year, Stellantis became the first automaker to integrate Fire TV for in-car entertainment with its new Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer, and is now bringing the entertainment experiences to Jeep Grand Cherokee and Chrysler Pacifica, as well. In addition, Fire TV will come built-in on Ford Explorer and Lincoln Navigator&#8217;s 2022 models, Amazon said.</p>
<p>Automakers are able to customize their Fire TV experience to do things like integrate with the car&#8217;s audio systems or its comfort controls in order to offer unique features designed for their vehicles.</p>
<p>The version of Fire TV for autos works to take advantage of Alexa&#8217;s hands-free options, so passengers &#8212; or parents looking to pull up a show for the kids in the back &#8212; can easily play content by speaking voice commands. Parents can also select content front the front seat that plays for the rear passengers. And if there are multiple screens in the back, that content can be mirrored across both at the same time. If, however, the kids can&#8217;t agree on a program to watch, Fire TV lets the rear passengers watch individual content on each display. Viewers can listen to their shows and movies through Bluetooth or wired headphones, or over the car&#8217;s speakers, if desired.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253764" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Users can also ask Alexa on Fire TV to show their Ring doorbell video, by saying things like &#8220;Alexa, show me the front door,&#8221; among other voice commands.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Fire TV users will have access to over 1 million TV episodes and movies, including those from Prime Video. And because cellular signals aren&#8217;t always reliable when traveling, Fire TV for autos will allow for offline viewing through support for downloads.</p>
<p>The system will also soon be updated to catch up to the consumer experience for Fire TV in the home where the company has rolled out support for personalized profiles with their own recommendations and an updated home screen experience. With this update, Fire TV customers will be able to pause their shows at home then pick up viewing in the car where they left off, notes Amazon.</p>
<p>Amazon has been working to bring Fire TV to more cars for some time. In 2020, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/fire-tv-edition-expands-to-more-soundbars-plus-cars-cable-boxes-and-more/">it partnered</a> with BMW and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) to offer hands-free Alexa and the ability to stream Fire TV in cars, while adding new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/amazon-drives-deeper-into-cars-with-new-alexa-partners-echo-auto-expansion/">auto-focused Alexa voice commands</a>, like &#8220;Alexa, pay for gas&#8221; which allows customers to pay for their gas at 11,500 Exxon and Mobil stations. The same year, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/amazon-backed-rivian-will-integrate-alexa-into-its-electric-pickup-and-suv/">announced</a> plans to bring both Alexa and Fire TV to Rivian&#8217;s EVs and others.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In detailing its further plans for Fire TV at today&#8217;s Consumer Electronics Show, Amazon also shared its latest Fire TV milestone, noting it&#8217;s sold more than 150 million Fire TV devices worldwide as of Q4 2021. Fewer people actually use the platform on a regular basis, of course. Previously, the company had shared Fire TV <a href="https://advertising.amazon.com/blog/amazon-advertisers-can-now-reach-up-to-50m-monthly-active-users-on-fire-tv">had 50 million monthly active users</a> as of Dec. 2020. That number should have inched up since, as Amazon reported that shoppers purchased a record number of Fire TV smart TVs during the week of Black Friday 2021, and its Fire TV Stick was the top-selling product on Black Friday itself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://xage.com">Xage</a> (pronounced Zage) is a startup working to keep critical infrastructure like oil and gas pipelines, water supplies and electrical grids up and running securely. Today, the company announced a $30 million Series B.</p>
<p>Piva led the round with participation from Momenta, Valor Equity Partners and OurCrowd, along with existing investors March Capital, City Light Capital, Saints Capital and Saudi Aramco Energy Ventures. The startup said it has raised $54 million to date.</p>
<p>Xage uses a bunch of complex technology to help keep critical infrastructure safe. Industrial infrastructure tends to be older and relies on fairly brittle security. Xage was designed to be a modern layer on top of that, which the company refers to as a fabric, CEO Duncan Greatwood said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253752" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;The fabric is a mesh of software nodes that overlays the operation to provide granular control of every digital interaction. It provides <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-zero-trust/">zero trust</a> protection that spans operations, IT and the cloud, underpinning both cybersecurity and digital transformation,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The solution uses digital ledger technology organized in nodes on a blockchain to limit the impact of an attack, so that getting control of one or two nodes would not compromise the entire network. But the company did not just jump on the blockchain bandwagon with the growing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/the-irrational-exuberance-of-web3/">popularity of web3</a> in 2021. It has been using this technology as a way to control access since its earliest days.</p>
<p>&#8220;The distributed ledger is still an important part of our software stack. It&#8217;s part of how we achieve this single point of failure in the Xage fabric, which is so important for protecting these exposed operational situations,&#8221; Greatwood told me.</p>
<p>Over the last year, he said that companies have begun to come around to a solution like Xage, driven by the increase in ransomware attacks and growing government regulations around critical infrastructure. This was also driven home by the attack last year on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/decrypted-hackers-attempt-to-poison-florida-towns-water-supply/">a Florida water supply</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Those factors, along with an increase in its partner network, fueled a big rise in interest in Xage, and that drove the need to seek additional funds to staff up. &#8220;Even with the right partners, which we have now, we still need staff to help support all of this rollout and the work that we&#8217;re doing, both bringing the customers on and the deployments, as well,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Today, the company has over 40 employees, a number that he said is increasing by the week. Greatwood expects to be close to 90 or more by the end of 2022. He said that from the earliest days, diversity and inclusion have been top of mind for the company. While it&#8217;s easy to look at the obvious places like MIT and Stanford for new staff, he said the key is looking beyond that pool to find hidden gems.</p>
<p>&#8220;​​What we found is that we find superstars and people with superstar potential with much less obvious backgrounds from their resumes, and we kind of grow them and help them fulfill their potential. Very often, frankly, that&#8217;s the key to finding the right recruits who come from all kinds of different diverse backgrounds and situations,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The other key is creating a welcoming culture, and he said that he and his team work consciously on creating a cooperative, collaborative and welcoming workplace.</p>
<p>&#8220;We spend time with the team talking about how we work together, and that goes above and beyond just the task-oriented work of the day, making sure that everybody is included and supported as they develop at Xage. The first step is to recruit a diverse workforce, and the second step is to enable the diverse workforce to succeed,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company intends to take a hybrid approach to work as they enter 2022, with some people in the office and some fully or partially remote, depending on their needs, but he believes some work requires people sometimes being together in the same room to build software this complex.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Italian startup <a href="https://www.filotrack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Filo</a> &#8212; better known in Europe for its Tile-like Bluetooth tracking devices &#8212; is showing off its shiny new product <a href="https://getmytata.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tata Pad,</a> a cushion that goes on top of a child seat, and can notify you if you&#8217;ve left your pride and joy strapped into the back seat as you saunter into the cool, refreshing, air-conditioned breeze of a mall. Already available in Italy, the company is announcing its U.S. launch at CES in Las Vegas this week.</p>
<p>At first glance, to a non-parent like myself, the Tata Pad seems like a pretty silly product. How likely are you to forget that there&#8217;s a toddler in the back seat? The company assures me that it&#8217;s a serious enough problem that <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3164/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there&#8217;s legislation coming down the pike in the U.S.</a> to make sure that children and pets left behind in vehicles need some sort of safety warning, after more than 900 children have died from being left behind in hot cars since the late 1990s &#8212; an average of 38 children per year. Under the mantra &#8220;one child is one too many,&#8221; it is offering a tech solution to forgetful parents.</p>
<p>The product is essentially a cushion that works much like a Tile device &#8212; if a child sits on the cushion, the device is activated. Walk away from it for more than three minutes and the Tata Pad will send a notification to your phone that you left something important behind. If that doesn&#8217;t inspire you to return to your car, the product initiates a call to your phone to give you a friendly reminder that, seriously, go get your kid. Ignore that call, and the Tata Pad escalates even further, sending SMS and/or calls to your emergency contacts, along with a location for your child so they can launch a rescue operation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253331" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>The company suggests that it is fully certified for sales in the U.S., and is starting to accept preorders following CES. The company&#8217;s CEO Giorgio Sadolfo told me that the company is looking for partners and distributors to make a big splash in the U.S. market. In Europe, the devices are sold for €60 (approx $68), and the company suggests that the pricing will be similar once the product hits U.S. shores.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Take the ability to connect to nearly all smart home devices, mix in some smart rules and sprinkle on a raft of security features and you&#8217;ve got a pretty decent idea of what <a href="https://homey.app/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homey</a> offers. Instead of beaming all your data to whoever your smart home provider is, Homey promises to keep your data safe and out of the grubby paws of advertisers.</p>
<p>The Homey company has been operating in Europe since 2014, and announced its U.S. expansion at CES today. The key issue it solves is that a lot of smart home solutions are very cobbled together, and in the process become huge data collectors that can be used for nefarious purposes. To date, customers have been made to accept that it&#8217;s just the cost of having a smart home, but this is where the company believes there is another way: The company claims it doesn&#8217;t listen in or sell any customer data, nor that it uses personal information to create user profiles or targeted advertisements.</p>
<p>In addition to blindfolding the smart home providers from each other, the company&#8217;s Homey Pro smart home hub brings some fun new features to the mix. If you&#8217;ve ever played with If This Then That (IFTTT), you&#8217;ve probably come up with some clever automation: Turn on the light when someone rings the doorbell, or turn the volume of the speakers down after 10 p.m., for example. Homey&#8217;s app builds a ton of this type of functionality into the core architecture of the apps. The company calls these automations &#8220;flows,&#8221; and gives a number of examples, including &#8220;Always dim lights in the bedroom when the drapes close,&#8221; or &#8220;Automatically turn the thermostat down, turn off the lights and enable the alarm when I lock the front door.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250662" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Flows can, of course, also be started using voice assistants, including as Google, Alexa and Siri Shortcuts. The company also offers widgets for mobile and Apple Watch.</span></p>
<p>In addition to voice controls, flows and the other obvious stuff you&#8217;d expect, the apps offer tools to analyze energy use in real time, and offers suggestions for how to save additional electricity. It can, for example, compare the energy consumption between a washing machine&#8217;s &#8220;hot&#8221; and &#8220;cold&#8221; cycles, or give insights into which are your most (and least) energy-efficient rooms.</p>
<p>Homey claims its smart hubs can connect to more than 50,000 smart home devices from more than 1,000 brands, and it offers iOS, Android and web apps to take control of, and configure, the whole experience. The hub itself has connectivity galore, with Zigbee, Z-Wave Plus, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 433MHz radios, plus infrared transmission LEDs to beam commands around the house.</p>
<p>The Homey app can be used to control smart home devices — either via <a href="https://homey.app/en-us/store/product/homey-bridge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the $69 Homey Bridge</a> or as <a href="https://get.homey.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an app-only solution</a> without the need for Homey hardware. The free version of the Homey app controls up to five devices, while a premium version enables an entire household to connect an unlimited number of smart devices. The premium version of the app would set you back $2.99 per month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Every home is unique; it’s not one-size-fits-all. Most of today’s smart home systems are centered around a single brand, technology or use case. For example, Philips Hue is great for lighting, but that’s all it does,&#8221; said Emile Nijssen, co-founder and creative director of Athom, makers of Homey. &#8220;As a result, your smart home can become complicated and cluttered quickly with all sorts of different apps. Our goal with Homey is to change the status quo and create an open, affordable, user-friendly system that unifies all smart devices and ensures consumer privacy at the same time.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Meez is a kitchen collaboration tool, recipe keeper and progression, training and prep all rolled into one.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.getmeez.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meez</a>, a company creating professional recipe software and a culinary operating system, brought in its first-ever funding round of $6.5 million to continue developing its tools to help chefs manage their recipes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2253419" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2253419" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2253419" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0-1.jpg" alt="Josh Sharkey,, Meez" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0-1.jpg 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0-1.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0-1.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0-1.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/0-1.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2253419" class="wp-caption-text">Josh Sharkey, CEO of Meez. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Evan Sung</p></div></p>
<p>CEO Josh Sharkey, a chef himself for most of his career, incorporated the New York-based technology company back in 2015. However, what touched off the search for a place to keep his recipes and processes came more like 15 years ago when he lost the notebook where he kept recipes and how to prepare dishes. Colleagues were using everything from the standard Google or Word documents to spreadsheets, but Sharkey wanted a more digital approach.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253406" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The idea of how to digitize everything stuck with me,” he told TechCrunch. “There are tools for things like inventory management or financial software, but there wasn’t anything built for the things we do in the kitchen or related to what we actually do.”</p>
<p>He and his team built Meez to be a collaboration tool, recipe keeper and progression, training and prep tool all rolled into one — Sharkey referred to it as a “Google Drive for chefs.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The technology has two components, the first being how users put their recipes into the system and then how to make them scalable and usable by both the user and their kitchen colleagues. It also includes resources that chefs tap into daily, like ingredient yields and unit conversion, a menu cost calculator and automated allergen tagging and nutrition analysis.</p>
<p>The software was launched in 2020, and Meez already counts as clients major restaurateurs, like Jose Andres and Jean-Georges Vongerichten, as well as culinary schools, including the Institute of Culinary Education.</p>
<p>Struck Capital led the funding round and was joined by Craft Ventures, Relish Works, Aurify Brands, Food Tech Angels and Branded Strategic Ventures. Angel investors backing the company include Snap’s former head of product Bobby Lo, Shef founders and Bento Box founder and CEO Krystle Mobayeni.</p>

<p>Meez started in December 2020 with 20 paying customers and has grown to more than 750 today among a diverse mix of restaurants, from fine dining to fast casual and culinary schools, an area that Sharkey plans to dig into in the next year. Also during that time, the company’s revenue grew steadily 22% month over month, which he attributed to the company’s unique approach and digital adoption making its way into the kitchen.</p>
<p>“The adoption curve hit the infancy stages of the food world,” Sharkey added. “Culinary professionals are starting to realize how to do more with less, and they can’t rely on their labor all the time. Things that worked before the pandemic don’t work now. This is a helpful tool and necessity because you can’t just rely on the recipe anymore, there are other things you have to do to it to be able to operationalize your content, and there was not a place to do that before.”</p>
<p>Sharkey intends to deploy the new capital into developing an iOS app and technology development, including menu planning, self-onboarding automation and to launch and test direct-to-consumer recipe engagement.</p>
<p>In addition, the company plans on attracting new restaurants this year and growing the team. Meez has 17 employees now, and Sharkey expects to add another 10 this year.</p>
<p>“Culinary professionals are some of the most creative and inventive people on the planet. But due to the physical nature of their work, very little attention has been paid to how digital technology can be leveraged to improve their workflows and systems for collaboration,” said Adam Struck, CEO of Struck Capital, in a written statement. “Josh is a unique founder in that he’s a professional chef, restaurant industry operator, and technology expert. He’s been able to synthesize the pain points that plague almost all kitchens into a platform that’s intuitive, beautifully designed and addresses major pain points for one of the world’s largest and oldest industries.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternative investments are having a moment. Their popularity has surged over the last decade, with the asset class growing from just over $3 trillion in 2008 to more than $10 trillion in 2019, </span><a href="https://www.preqin.com/academy/lesson-1-alternative-assets/past-present-future-of-the-alternative-assets-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to data provider Preqin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Institutions have fueled a large part of this growth, investing at record pace into alternatives like crypto, private companies and real estate. Some ultra-wealthy investors have made a windfall investing in alternatives using tax-advantaged accounts, a strategy billionaire Peter Thiel used to grow his Roth individual retirement account from $2,000 to $5 billion in 20 years, tax-free, </span><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/lord-of-the-roths-how-tech-mogul-peter-thiel-turned-a-retirement-account-for-the-middle-class-into-a-5-billion-dollar-tax-free-piggy-bank" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ProPublica reported last year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, average investors are seeking a slice of these markets, lured by the potential of making outsized returns, which are even more appealing if they come tax-free.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253465" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While investing dollars from one’s tax-advantaged retirement account in alternatives has long been legal, it has remained largely inaccessible to average retail investors. Veteran investor Eric Satz realized this in 2013 when he first tried to deploy money from his IRA into private companies and was met with pushback from his financial advisor, who was concerned about the potential risks, Satz told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 10 weeks of research and logistical hurdles, Satz was finally able to make his first tax-advantaged alternative investment through a self-directed IRA. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At the end of this 10-week process that seemed to have the goalposts constantly moving in terms of what was required in order to make the investment, I wrote the custodian that I was using a check for the privilege of making this investment that I discovered and did all the homework and research on,” Satz said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frustrated with these complexities, Satz tried to go through the same process using three different custodians, and found that his experience “got worse each time.” The onerous process, according to Satz, explains why less than 2% of the </span><a href="https://www.planadviser.com/35-trillion-retirement-savings-tells-tale-two-economies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$35 trillion in assets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sitting in individual retirement accounts is invested in alternatives. In contrast, most high-net-worth investors and institutions have much higher allocations to alternatives, ranging from anywhere between 15 to 80%, Satz said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retirement accounts are particularly suited to making early-stage investments in private companies because of their long duration and risk-return profile, Satz said. Using self-directed IRA companies to make such investments was costing Satz over $500 a year in fees, a problem he aimed to solve for others by launching <a href="https://www.altoira.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alto</a> in 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alto’s self-directed IRA platform provides a simpler, more affordable option for individuals to invest their retirement savings into alternatives, according to the company. The Nashville-based startup provides its users with access to a host of alternatives through its partnerships with over 70 investment platforms, including AngelList, Grayscale and Masterworks, the company says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alto hosts nearly 20,000 funded accounts representing close to $1 billion in assets, Satz said &#8212; and 40% of the accounts are dedicated to holding cryptocurrency, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alto announced today that it has raised $40 million in Series B funding led by <a href="https://www.avp.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advance Venture Partners</a>, whose founder and managing partner David T. ibnAle is set to join the company’s board of directors. Existing investors <a href="https://www.unusual.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unusual Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.acrewcapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Acrew Capital</a>, <a href="https://www.alphaedison.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpha Edison</a>, <a href="https://foundationcapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foundation Capital</a>, <a href="https://gaingels.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaingels</a> and <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/ventures" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase Ventures</a> also participated in the round. Alto last raised $17 million for its Series A in April 2021. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use the fresh funding to grow its team of product and engineering employees from 50 today to 120 by the end of 2022, Satz said. It also plans to grow its content offering to help investors educate themselves on alternatives, though the company is not a registered broker-dealer or investment advisor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While crypto is one of the fastest-growing areas of interest for Alto users, Satz said he expects demand to grow in other areas, including private company investing and artwork. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think what you&#8217;ll see from us in Q1 and Q2 is greater penetration into collectibles and collectibles marketplaces. There&#8217;s just some product innovation that we are coming out with that will make that a lot easier for most folks,” Satz said. “I [also] think we&#8217;ll see some innovation in 2022 in fund access, and the ability for more people to participate in fund investing.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As more and more people are wanting to leave a smaller footprint on the earth, many of us are living in smaller spaces. <a href="http://www.daan.tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daan Tech</a> is a startup we found at CES 2022 that is taking a fresh new look at tech aimed specifically at small households of one or two people.</p>
<p>I rarely cover washing machines or dishwashers here on TechCrunch, mostly because there&#8217;s rarely a startup angle, and, let&#8217;s face it, unless it is able to dance the Macarena, dishwashers are <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/dull--as--dishwater" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dull as dishwater</a>, as the Brits like to mumble into their cups of tea. Daan Tech&#8217;s Bob Global fits the bill; it&#8217;s ultra-compact and perfect for apartment dwellers, as it doesn&#8217;t have to be plumbed in. It comes with a built-in one-gallon integrated water tank, and the company claims it uses only a fifth of the water that regular hand-washing does.</p>
<p>&#8220;Living in a city where space is hard to come by, we wanted to provide an efficient solution for washing dishes in a cramped kitchen,&#8221; said Damian Py, president and CEO of Daan Tech. &#8220;We also wanted to create a product that has a positive impact on the environment and to keep our environmental footprint as small as possible.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251978" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2252006" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Bob_mini_dishwasher_watertank.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2252006" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2252006" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Bob_mini_dishwasher_watertank.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="577" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Bob_mini_dishwasher_watertank.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Bob_mini_dishwasher_watertank.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Bob_mini_dishwasher_watertank.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Bob_mini_dishwasher_watertank.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Bob_mini_dishwasher_watertank.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Bob_mini_dishwasher_watertank.jpg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Bob_mini_dishwasher_watertank.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2252006" class="wp-caption-text">Daan Tech&#8217;s Bob has its own integrated water tank, so it doesn&#8217;t need to be plumbed in. It also has a UV-C cleaning cycle that can kill bacteria without using water at all &#8212; perfect for sterilizing without using water. (<strong>Image Credits:</strong> Daan Tech)</p></div></p>
<p>The original version of the Bob design sold more than 35,000 units in Europe, and the new, updated version of the device is coming to a kitchen counter near you very soon. Daan Tech tells me that Bob Global will be available in most countries in 2022 and is currently available for preorder at <a href="http://www.daan.tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a discounted price at the company&#8217;s website</a>, with a $299 price tag and an estimated delivery by late Summer 2022.</p>
<p>The company has a fetching video of the original version of Bob, which gives a bit more context for what the company is up to:</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y66AjQUi7Nw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Bob also has an optional additional feature of <a href="https://daan.tech/us/discover-bob-mini-dishwasher/bob-ultraviolet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a UV-C cleaning cycle</a>. In this mode, the washer doesn&#8217;t use water, but instead uses UV-C rays to disinfect items that can&#8217;t get wet &#8211; think phones, keys, wallets, etc. The theory is sound &#8212; and it&#8217;s neat to see this wrapped into a tabletop appliance like a small dishwasher, rather than in a separate device.</p>
<p>Riding high on the success of its diminutive dishwasher, the company is now working on a suite of additional small home appliances, including a smart toaster oven and an autonomous washing machine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://tiktok.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok</a> &#8212; the hugely popular mobile video app with more than 1 billion users &#8212; has been taking its first steps to break into a new screen, the TV screen, launching and integrating a new app called TikTok TV first with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/tiktok-is-coming-to-amazon-fire-tv-in-the-u-s-and-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon Fire TV</a>, and <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-tv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">then</a> Google TV and other Android TV OS devices, LG Smart TVs, and Samsung Smart TVs. Today comes news of another front in that strategy: TikTok has inked a partnership with <a href="https://atmosphere.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atmosphere</a>, the startup that provides licensed and curated streamed video content for commercial venues like Westin, Taco Bell and Texas Roadhouse, as well as doctors&#8217; offices, gyms and other venues where people spend dwelling time.</p>
<p>Initially, the partnership will see Atmosphere develop a new channel on its platform dedicated to curated TikTok videos. It will be the first time that TikTok content is being used for an out-of-home video service.</p>
<p>“TikTok has become a destination for more than a billion people to be entertained, get inspired, and find community,” said Dan Page, head of global business development, new screens at TikTok, in a statement. “By partnering with Atmosphere, we’re excited to make it easy for people to experience TikTok together by bringing the joy and creativity of our platform to new screens, venues, and audiences.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253701" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Atmosphere has been using the CES tech event to announce a series of milestones. Earlier this week, it revealed that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/atmosphere-raises-100m-as-its-business-focused-streaming-tv-service-passes-19k-venues-and-20m-viewers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $100 million</a> on the back of very strong growth in the last year: it doubled the number of venues using its ad-supported streaming services to 19,000, covering some 20 million monthly unique users.</p>
<p>Although Atmosphere already repurposes content from platforms like YouTube in channels that it builds, this will be the company&#8217;s first channel dedicated to a single social media brand. Leo Resig, the co-founder and CEO of Atmosphere, said his company and TikTok have been working on this deal and how the channel would look for eight months.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are the largest internet social media platform right now, and so they are very particular about how their brand and content are distributed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But they see the power of our platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be clear, TikTok has confirmed to TechCrunch that the Atmosphere partnership is <em>not</em> another outlet for, or a repurposing of, TikTok TV, as TikTok&#8217;s consumer-focused TV app is called. Instead, it&#8217;s an example of how, as TikTok continues to mature, it&#8217;s diversifying in how to reach new audiences, and build different revenue streams to complement advertising and other revenue models in its main app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In this case, a team of people from Atmosphere will have access to a library of TikTok content, from which they will select videos they believe might work well on an Atmosphere channel. The team then connects with the individual creator to get the okay to use the video, and to work out how to credit said creator. Atmosphere then strips out all the audio, overlays it with its own optional audio (or none at all &#8212; many of the venues that are Atmosphere customers use the service on mute by default), adds its own captions, and collates all that into its own video stream. The commercial arrangement in this deal is between TikTok and Atmosphere, which will run ads in the channel. That is to say, creators themselves &#8212; at least for now &#8212; do not get paid.</p>
<p>The financial details are not being disclosed but generally it sounds like content providers are paid, and Atmosphere makes its revenues from the advertising it runs alongside the content. As as for a basic guideline on payouts to providers, Resig said that currently the company pays &#8220;low millions of dollars per year&#8221; to content creators, but, he added, &#8220;We get most of our content for free,&#8221; instead giving creators attribution to help them grow their audiences and brands. TikTok is not an investor in Atmosphere, the startup pointed out (it said that avoiding confusion is why it chose to separate its funding news from the TikTok news).</p>
<p>From what we understand, Atmosphere will be able to access a selection of TikTok videos &#8212; tens of thousands of videos &#8212; rather than the much bigger catalogue.</p>
<p>For a first foray into partnering with a social media company to bring content from that platform to Atmosphere, TikTok is something of a bullseye for the startup. TikTok was already looking for more opportunities to expand to a wider variety of screens (and specifically TV screens), and this gives it an opportunity to repurpose and give new life to the long tail of its back catalogue of videos that might no longer get picked up for viewing via TikTok&#8217;s algorithms on its main app. On top of that, TikTok already had some parallels with Atmosphere in terms of how the two are being used, starting with audio consumption.</p>
<p>Atmosphere&#8217;s Resig told TechCrunch that more than 99% of its customers were already streaming its services with the sound off, which led the company to building out more content with the audio removed altogether. TikTok, as it happens, also has an audience that consumes videos on its platform with the sound off, so much so that TikTok has <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-09-23/subtitles-once-a-barrier-to-foreign-film-have-found-a-home-on-tiktok" target="_blank" rel="noopener">built its own captioning technology</a> to let creators on the platform either add their own words as graphics or use TikTok&#8217;s AI to do this for them. Resig said that in the initial integration, the videos that Atmosphere will be curating from TikTok are not necessarily going to be these, and it will be overlaying its own captioning around them for TikTok&#8217;s Atmosphere channel.</p>
<p>TikTok last year scored a notable point during the US Olympics, where it carved out a place for itself not as a destination for official Olympic event streams, or even official clips (these could be found on there from official accounts, yet they were elsewhere, too); but as a place for user-generated content from people on the ground &#8212; athletes, audience, others involved in the Olympics &#8212; that was either a complement to the official coverage, or sometimes (such as with the news of <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-09-23/subtitles-once-a-barrier-to-foreign-film-have-found-a-home-on-tiktok" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Simone Biles facing challenges in her exercises</a>) ahead of it altogether.</p>
<p>Atmosphere also has carved out a place for itself in providing sports content that is complementary to what a bar or other venue might already be showing. In fact, so far it has eschewed trying to provide its customers with a direct replacement for premium sports channels, which comprise some of the most popular content that they broadcast in their venues, bringing in customers and often the driver for a venue paying a premium for a commercial pay-TV subscription in the first place. These days, an Atmosphere customer &#8212; such as a bar &#8212; that has TVs installed broadcasting sports on them will continue doing so even as they bring in Atmosphere on other TVs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, we coexist with sports,&#8221; Resig said, noting that on average, Atmosphere will be on 25% of a venue&#8217;s screens, with the other TVs broadcasting more traditional content. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be on every screen.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">That&#8217;s slowly changing. As Atmosphere scales, it is starting to have more conversations with sports media organizations &#8212; the companies that broadcast and manage the rights for teams, leagues, and so on &#8212; and is now thinking more about what shape Atmosphere premium sports content might take. Interestingly, it seems like this is precisely the place with TikTok is with sports, too.</p>
<p>This is just an early and first move into a partnership between the two. If it clicks, down the line there may also be more questions about how it will evolve as a business relationship. Right now, Resig confirmed that the commercial relationship it has here is with TikTok, not the creators on the platform, who are not being paid individually. Their compensation, such as it is, is currently coming in the form of promoting the creators and providing links to find them elsewhere.</p>
<p>One option down the line might be if creators one day start to build content specifically for TV rather than mobile formats. This would make some sense, considering how many of the videos now appear in awkward formats that need large areas of blurring on either side of the action to fill out the space on the horizontal TV screen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will creators create content specifically for TikTok&#8217;s TV activities in the future? Absolutely,&#8221; predicted Resig. &#8220;Once it becomes ubiquitous those who create content will see value in the native app, and separately the TV format.&#8221; He said this is not something being discussed right now, but with any platform, &#8220;you know you’ve made it when people are creating content specific for that platform.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tech is an increasingly important part of the complex drug discovery and testing process, and with advances in processing power and algorithms it is tapping new areas for analysis. Proteomics, the domain of proteins and their interactions is up next, and <a href="https://www.protai.bio/">Protai</a> is one startup getting to work on it after raising an $8M seed round.</p>
<p>Diseases cause a variety of phenomena in the body, at various levels of organization. Say a disease cause cell death in the liver — why? Because cells are producing too much of this compound. Why? Because the inhibitor molecules don&#8217;t bind to the proteins that activate the production mechanism. Why? Because the RNA coding the protein has been damaged. Why? And so on.</p>
<p>Where Protai fits into that stack is above the genome and transcription level, where genetic factors can be identified, and below the cells and systems layer, where problems become more obviously visible as symptoms.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253408" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To start, the company put together what it claims is the largest proteomic database, some 50,000 samples from 6,000 papers, and harmonized the chaotic data (natural language AI was helpful here) so it can act as a single source of information.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea is that instead of analyzing a small sample study, you want to analyze all of the data out there on a particular disease, but it’s apples and oranges because proteins were collected and sequenced from a variety of conditions, instruments, protocols, and controls,&#8221; explained CEO and co-founder Eran Seger.</p>

<p>The company hopes to be able to span the drug discovery and testing process from tissue testing all the way to final clinical testing.</p>
<p>A recent development in the proteomics world that may change how all this works is the use of AI-powered models to determine the structure and functionality of proteins generally known only by their signature sequence of amino acids.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/deepmind-puts-the-entire-human-proteome-online-as-folded-by-alphafold/">DeepMind&#8217;s AlphaFold</a> and the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/deepmind-puts-the-entire-human-proteome-online-as-folded-by-alphafold/">University of Washington&#8217;s RoseTTAfold</a> models are capable of accurately predicting the structure of proteins based on their sequence, something that was previously only possible with expensive lab testing. It&#8217;s shaking up entire disciplines that relied on the old methods.</p>
<p>CTO and co-founder Kirill Prevzner said the advance is welcome: &#8220;We are integrating structural proteomics tools, such as AlphaFold, into our solution in two main ways. One is to further improve the prediction of protein-protein interactions. The second is in drug-target interactions. Both allow us to develop and optimize the best drug solutions for our targets.&#8221;</p>
<p>The $8M seed round, led by Grove Ventures and Pitango HealthTech, will go (as seed rounds often do) toward the development of the new platform and building out partnerships and other programs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Stellantis is turning to Amazon to bring a slate of connected in-vehicle products and services to its vehicles by 2024 as part of the global automaker&#8217;s plan to generate $22.5 billion annually from software.</p>
<p>The collaboration, which was announced Wednesday at the 2022 CES tech trade show, is supposed to touch nearly every aspect of Stellantis&#8217; business. The companies said Amazon&#8217;s technology will be used to help Stellantis develop vehicles, build connected in-vehicle experiences and train the next generation of automotive software engineers.</p>
<p>As part of this multi-year deal, Stellantis has selected Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its preferred cloud provider for vehicle platforms. Stellantis, which recently launched a software academy for existing and new employees, is also working with AWS to create a curriculum that will cover software, data and cloud technology.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253603" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Stellantis laid out its software plan in December, but didn&#8217;t mention Amazon at the time. The automaker has said it will invest more than $33.7 billion through 2025 into software and electrification. That investment will include employing 5,000 software engineers by 2024.</p>
<p>The automaker&#8217;s end goal is to have 34 million connected cars on the road by 2030 that Stellantis can generate revenue from for years after they’re sold to consumers. Stellantis is leaning on partnerships with BMW, Foxconn, Waymo — and now Amazon — to reach that target.</p>
<p>Stellantis&#8217; plan to use software in its vehicles to sell passengers and drivers products and subscriptions involves three components that are already under development.</p>
<p>It starts with the underlying electrical and software architecture, which it&#8217;s calling STLA Brain. This system is integrated with the cloud and connects electronic control units within the vehicle to the vehicle&#8217;s central high performing computer via a high-speed data bus. It will allow the company to upgrade software to vehicles &#8220;over the air,&#8221; or wirelessly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On top of this &#8220;brain,&#8221; Stellantis has added its &#8220;SmartCockpit,&#8221; a platform built in partnership with Foxconn that will deliver applications to the driver such as navigation, voice assistance, e-commerce marketplace and payment services. Finally, a third automated driving platform called &#8220;AutoDrive,&#8221; developed with BMW, will complete the automaker&#8217;s software plan.</p>
<p>Stellantis said Wednesday that it is working with Amazon to further develop the SmartCockpit platform to include applications that can deliver personalized in-vehicle experiences for the driver and passengers. Occupants in any of Stellantis&#8217;s 14 vehicle brands will be able to access an app store to find services and entertainment. The Alexa voice assistant will also be included in the SmartCockpit.</p>
<p>Amazon&#8217;s AI technology will be used to tap into and adapt to customers&#8217; behaviors and interests. Stellantis said this might mean its Jeep vehicles might come with a digital off-road &#8220;coach&#8221; to help customers calibrate the vehicle and optimize performance before tackling tough terrain.</p>
<p>Vehicle software would also link up with other Amazon products such as smart home and services so users can monitor and manage their homes while in their car. It will also work in reverse. Users at home will be able to set the in-cabin temperature before getting into their vehicle by giving a command to their Alexa-enabled devices at home or their Alexa smartphone app.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon will add Stellantis&#8217; all-electric Ram ProMaster van to its fleet when the vehicle launches in 2023 as the e-commerce giant pushes to meet its pledge to be carbon neutral by 2040.</p>
<p>The companies said Wednesday that Amazon would be the first commercial customer of the upcoming all-electric van as part of a broader partnership announcement focused on software development and in-vehicle technology at the 2022 CES tech trade show.</p>
<p>Stellantis, the global automaker that includes the Ram brand, revealed in August 2021 that &#8220;due to customer demand&#8221; it would offer an electric Ram ProMaster van beginning in 2023. The electric van is part of the automaker&#8217;s $35.5 billion investment electric vehicles and new software over the next four years in an effort to shift away from internal combustion engines.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253549" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The automaker didn&#8217;t share many details in its<a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=22933&amp;mid="> August announcement</a> beyond the launch date. The customer announcement Wednesday provides one or two more bits of information, although it&#8217;s still scant and doesn&#8217;t include how many Ram Promaster vans will be ordered. The companies did say that the electric van was apparently designed with input from Amazon to include &#8220;unique last mile delivery features.&#8221; Neither company explained what those features are.</p>
<p>The vast majority of Amazon&#8217;s branded delivery fleet in the U.S. — which at last count stood at more than 70,000 — have internal combustion engines. Stellantis is one of its primary suppliers, with tens of thousands of light commercial vehicles making their way into Amazon since 2018. The light commercial vehicles, used for Amazon&#8217;s last mile operations in North America and Europe, includes Ram ProMaster, Fiat Ducato, and Peugeot and Citroën vehicles.</p>
<p>Amazon pledged in 2019 that it would become carbon-neutral by 2040 — 10 years earlier than is outlined by the United Nations Paris Agreement. To help hit that target, Amazon ordered 100,000 electric delivery trucks from electric startup-turned publicly traded company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/rivian/">Rivian</a>.</p>
<p>The 100,000 van order still stands, according to Amazon, which also has about a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/amazon-reveals-20-stake-in-rivian-ahead-of-ev-makers-ipo/">20% stake in Rivian</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><b>“</b>We always knew that our ambitious sustainability goals in our last mile operations would require multiple electric delivery van providers,&#8221; Amazon said in an emailed statement. &#8220;We continue to be excited about our relationship with Rivian, and this doesn’t change anything about our investment, collaboration, or order size and timing.”</p>
<p>Rivian is under contract to produce 100,000 electric vehicle delivery vans for Amazon through 2024. Rivian has said that it planned to deliver the first 10 of Amazon’s order by the end of 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a decision as significant as it is unexpected, German&#8217;s antitrust regulator has concluded that Google&#8217;s business meets the threshold for special abuse control which was established under an update to competition law targeted at digital giants and passed at the start of last year.</p>
<p>The finding that Google has &#8220;paramount significance across markets&#8221; is the first such decision taken by Germany&#8217;s Federal Cartel Office (aka the <em>Bundeskartellamt</em>) &#8212; which has ongoing procedures assessing the same vis-a-vis the market power of Amazon, Apple and Meta/Facebook &#8212; and it<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> stands for five years, paving the way for antitrust interventions which could prefigure incoming pan-EU ex ante rules also targeting tech giants&#8217; overbearing market power (aka, the </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/ep-imco-dma-vote/">Digital Markets Act</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;The <em><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bundeskartellamt</span></em> holds that Google is of paramount significance for competition across markets within the meaning of Section 19a(1) GWB [Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen; aka the German Act Against Restraints of Competition]. The company has an economic position of power which gives rise to a scope of action across markets that is insufficiently controlled by competition,&#8221; the FCO writes in a <a href="https://www.bundeskartellamt.de/SharedDocs/Meldung/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2022/05_01_2022_Google_19a.html">press release</a> today.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253722" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The regulator says its assessment factored in Google&#8217;s dominant market share of general search (80%+ in Germany); its market power in online advertising; its intermediating role as a gatekeeper of key services like YouTube and the Play Store on Android (which the FCO likens to &#8220;infrastructure&#8221;); its access to data as a result of holding so much market power &#8212; enabling it to further stoke competitive advantage via ad targeting and product development; and its market capitalization, which the regulator notes is &#8220;one of the highest worldwide and reflects Google’s large financial power&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The competitive advantage resulting from this access to data and other resources, such as the &#8216;Google&#8217; brand, can be used as shareable inputs in many ways across markets,&#8221; it added. &#8220;This makes it easier to operate, improve and expand existing services or develop entirely new ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <em>Bundeskartellamt</em> has two investigations in train related to Google&#8217;s business &#8212; one examining its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/googles-data-terms-are-now-in-germanys-competition-crosshairs/"> data terms</a> and another looking at its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/in-latest-big-tech-antitrust-push-germanys-fco-targets-google-news-showcases-fine-print/">News Showcase content licensing deals with publishers</a> &#8212; both of which were initiated last year.</p>
<p>Now that it has determined Google is subject to extended abuse controls these probes take on added significance &#8212; as the FCO will be able to immediately intervene against any anti-competitive behavior it identifies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Having worked on all these procedures in parallel the regulator can &#8212; in theory &#8212; shrink the timeframe needed to take action against Google. Although it has not provided any steer on when the two investigations might produce conclusions and actions as yet.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Andreas Mundt, president of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><em>Bundeskartellamt</em>, said</span>: <q>Since January 2021 we have a new instrument to monitor large digital companies. In less than a year, we have now taken the first official decision based on this provision and determined that Google is of paramount significance across markets. This is a very important step since based on this decision the <em>Bundeskartellamt</em> can now take action against specific anti-competitive practices by Google. We have already started to look into Google’s processing of personal data and to deal with the Google News Showcase issue in more detail. At the same time, we are vigorously conducting other proceedings against Amazon, Apple and Meta, formerly Facebook.</q></p>
<p>Google has been contacted for comment on the FCO&#8217;s finding of its paramount market significance.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>A Google spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;People who use our products and services expect that we operate a responsible business, and that we are regulated. We are confident that we comply with the rules and, to the extent that changes are necessary, we will continue to work constructively with the FCO to find solutions that enable people and businesses in Germany to continue to use our products.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Per the FCO, Google is not appealing the decision &#8212; nor will it &#8220;deny its status as norm addressee within the meaning of Section 19a(1) GWB&#8221; &#8212; however the regulator noted that that does not mean the tech giant &#8220;necessarily agrees with all the facts as established by the authority in its decision and the conclusions drawn from these facts&#8221;.</p>
<p>While pan-EU rules targeting tech giants are still in the process of being agreed and adopted &#8212; so likely a couple of years out &#8212; individual countries in the region are not waiting around for the bloc to update its rules.</p>

<p>The CMA isn&#8217;t standing still in the meanwhile &#8212; with a number of big tech investigations on its plate, including a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/cma-google-privacy-sandbox-revisions/">major intervention examining Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox</a> proposal to deprecate third party tracking cookies and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/">probe of Apple&#8217;s App Store rules</a>.</p>
<p>Late last year the CMA also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/30/faecbook-giphy-cma-order/">ordered Meta/Facebook to undo its acquisition of Giphy</a>.</p>
<p>So the age of tech giants operating with a very long rope to do as they please &#8212; which for years even included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/">getting to choose their own antitrust remedies</a> (!), in the case of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/google-ditches-pay-to-play-android-search-choice-auction-for-free-version-after-eu-pressure/">Google and the EU</a> &#8212; is finally, firmly on the wane in Europe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As a longtime photographer/videographer/audio nerd, charging all the devices at home is often a chaotic nightmare, and if you&#8217;re taking your equipment on the road, it gets worse. It doesn&#8217;t speak highly of me as a professional, but I&#8217;ve found myself without the right charger, a missing battery or a light that turns out to not be as fully charged as I had hoped more often than I&#8217;d care to admit. Needless to say, I got excited about the <a href="https://pwrboard.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pwrboard</a> charges-everything platform when they virtually showed me a prototype at CES.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Pwrboard is a modular universal charging device that promises to charge pretty much whatever you throw at it, no matter what your combination of cameras, microphones, accessory devices and other doo-dahs you may have kicking around as part of your &#8220;goodness, do I really need all of this stuff just to film some Instagram videos&#8221; equipment satchel.</p>
<p>The clever invention comes with a &#8220;base&#8221; that works like the switching station. It houses a high-efficiency power supply unit and negotiates the voltage and power delivery to each of the modules. Each module can be connected to the base with quick-release fasteners, so you can set up your charging station however you like, with any combination of chargers, for pretty much any battery type you can imagine.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2252353" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company is kicking off with a crowdfunding campaign early this year and shipping the product by the end of the year, although they don&#8217;t have more accurate timings available yet. At launch, Pwrboard claims it will ship with more than 30 modules, supporting more than 150 of the most popular SLR and mirrorless cameras, action cameras, drones and peripherals.</p>
<p>The Pwrboard base boards will be available on Kickstarter for around $250-$350, depending on the board size. The charger modules will be priced around $15 per module, the team told me. Given that most third-party chargers cost significantly less than this, you&#8217;re paying significantly over the odds for convenience, but I can absolutely see that making sense for the right kind of user.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Already a profitable company, Miro saw the venture capital market “favorable” right now, which gave it an opportunity to build an even stronger brand for customers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://miro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miro</a> is indeed still in the right place at the right time. With remote work continuing to rise, or a hybrid of that and in-person, the online workspace company finds itself with 30 million users and counts nearly all of the Fortune 100 companies as clients.</p>
<p>And now today, the company announced its largest round to date, $400 million in a Series C that propels its valuation to $17.5 billion. The new capital infusion gives Miro $476 million in total funding since the company was founded in 2011 by Andrey Khusid and Oleg Shardin.</p>
<p>CEO Khusid told TechCrunch he considers the company a “pioneer of visual collaboration,” with its early days as a digital whiteboard.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253228" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>“We’ve seen the market evolving over the last 10 years, and what started as an idea to bring a whiteboard into a browser has enabled us to understand the kind of value we can bring to organizations of all sizes,” he added. “Visual collaboration is something that allows teams in companies to better be on the same page. It’s a great opportunity to better explain ideas, problems and design solutions.”</p>
<p>Today, the company’s tools integrate with over 100 apps — including new partnerships with the likes of Atlassian, Cisco, Google Workspace, Microsoft Teams and Zoom — and offer nearly 1,000 templates designed to get users and their teams quickly working together no matter where they are.</p>
<p>The last time we checked in with Miro, co-headquartered in San Francisco and Amsterdam, was in 2020 when the company raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/miro-lands-50m-series-b-for-digital-whiteboard-as-demand-surges/">$50 million Series B</a> round led by Iconiq Capital. Since then, Khusid said the company grew its user base by 500%, from 5 million to 30 million users, and also its paying customer base by 550%. Among its Fortune 100 clients, 20 have more than $1 million in annual recurring revenue contract value, he added.</p>
<p>Iconiq Growth is back for the Series C round and is joined by Accel, Atlassian, Dragoneer, GIC, Salesforce Ventures and TCV. Individual investors involved include Airtable co-founders Howie Liu and Andrew Ofstad, Snowflake CEO Frank Slootman and DocuSign CEO Dan Springer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Since our initial investment, Miro has scaled with tremendous momentum, strong market leadership, and incredible product velocity,” said Matthew Jacobson, general partner at Iconiq Growth and Miro board member, in a written statement. “We believe Miro sits at a powerful intersection between asynchronous and synchronous work that captures and ignites creative processes everywhere. In our view, Miro’s culture of customer centricity makes it well-positioned to address a myriad of use cases across hybrid work for more than a billion knowledge workers globally. We are thrilled to continue our partnership with Andrey and the entire Miro team.”</p>
<p>Prior to the raise, Miro was already profitable and growing three times year over year before the global pandemic. However, with statistics showing that <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-06-22-gartner-forecasts-51-percent-of-global-knowledge-workers-will-be-remote-by-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">53% of the U.S. workforce is expected to be remote</a> by the end of this year, and with what Khusid expected to happen in 2022 actually happening in 2020, it created awareness around the problem of connectivity and collaboration in this new way of work.</p>
<p>In addition, with the venture capital market “favorable” right now, and given Miro’s vision of building a generational company, it made sense to go after additional funding to have the resources in place to build a strong brand for customers, he said.</p>
<p>Khusid plans to invest the new capital into product and technology development, getting its tools in front of more enterprise clients and expanding its global footprint. He is also looking at M&amp;A opportunities.</p>
<p>Over the past 12 months, the company doubled its headcount to just over 1,200 employees in 11 hubs around the world, including new ones opened in Berlin, Munich, London, Sydney and Tokyo.</p>
<p>“We need to make sure all of our people are in place in all functions from customer support to product engineering,” Khusid said. “We’ve tried to serve the demand and make sure every experience is good. We aim to increase the pace of innovation, and that will be a big area of investment. It’s a big challenge to scale at that pace, especially being fully remote. I call it ‘building a plane while flying.’”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are plenty of places where traditional speakers don&#8217;t have enough room to do their thing. The traditional solution is to just put more, smaller speakers into the spaces, but <a href="https://www.resonado.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resonado Labs</a> is taking a different approach, and showing off its Flat Core Speaker tech. The speakers are, in the first instance, going to find their way into Airstream RVs and cars from various car manufacturers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Traditional round speakers have been the industry standard for the past 100 years. As consumer electronics have become slimmer with a more minimalist aesthetic, the audio industry developed speaker types with an oval or racetrack form to better fit slim products,&#8221; explains Brian Youngil Cho, CEO at Resonado, summarizing the raison d&#8217;etre for his company. &#8220;The motors used to power these speakers never changed to accommodate the new speaker shape.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company has developed a driver with bar magnets and a flat voice coil attached to a flat racetrack diaphragm. It claims that the speakers offer a smoother force distribution, and posits that this gives a much better sound from a sleeker package.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250654" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>At CES, the company is showing off a demo it built for Hyundai, alongside products for the living room of the future. One such innovation is a slim soundbar with a &#8220;cinematic sound experience,&#8221; which the company claims means it doesn&#8217; require a separate subwoofer. It is also showing off an ultra-narrow side-firing speaker assembly aimed at premium televisions, a powerful smart speaker and an experiential armchair with immersive spatial audio.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Goldman Sachs are in talks to back Indian commerce startup ElasticRun, according to four people familiar with the matter. The proposed Series E financing round, whose size is about $200 million, values ElasticRun at over $1 billion, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the deliberations are ongoing and private.</p>
<p>The Pune-headquartered ElasticRun is helping <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/elasticrun-raises-75-million-to-grow-its-commerce-platform-for-neighborhood-stores-india/">hundreds of thousands of neighborhood stores across hundreds of Indian cities and towns</a> secure inventory from top brands and working capital. It collaborates with e-commerce firms and other big brands to help these stores boost their revenues. The e-commerce firms and brands, in turn, gain access to a large market that has historically proven difficult to penetrate.</p>
<p>The five-year-old startup, which counts Prosus Ventures and Avataar Ventures among its existing backers, has raised $130.5 million prior to the new round.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253705" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_1905690" style="width: 3010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1905690" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1905690 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019 10 30 at 2.18.53 PM" width="3000" height="1688" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-2.18.53-PM.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1905690" class="wp-caption-text">Sandeep Deshmukh, co-founder and CEO of ElasticRun, talks about the startup at a business conference in 2019.</p></div></p>
<p>ElasticRun has developed a crowdsourced, asset-light logistics network of partners who deliver the services to the neighborhood stores (popularly known as kiranas).</p>
<p>Some of the major firms that work with ElasticRun to tap this network include Amazon, Tata Consumer Products, CocaCola, PepsiCo, and Reliance Retail, India&#8217;s largest retail chain.</p>
<p>ElasticRun and SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On many fronts, ElasticRun competes with the Bengaluru-headquartered e-commerce startup Udaan, which on Wednesday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/indian-e-commerce-udaan-raises-250-million/">disclosed a $250 million investment</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If the proposed talks materialize into a deal &#8212; at the terms described in this report &#8212; ElasticRun will be the latest startup to join the coveted unicorn club.</p>
<p>A handful of investors including SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Tiger Global, Alpha Wave Global and Sequoia Capital have become unusually aggressive in recent quarters and have often fiercely competed to win deals with local young firms. Indian startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/31/record-number-of-unicorns-and-ipos-indian-startups-raised-39-billion-in-2021/">raised a record $39 billion in 2021</a>, a year that helped mint 44 local unicorns. SoftBank <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/softbank-has-deployed-3-billion-in-india-this-year-can-invest-up-to-10-billion-in-2022/">alone invested over $3 billion</a> in the South Asian market last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ghanaian health tech startup <a href="https://mpharma.com/">mPharma</a> is building a network of community pharmacies across Africa as it plans to be the go-to primary healthcare service provider for millions of people residing in the region.</p>
<p>mPharma plans to grow its community (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/mpharma-a-telehealth-pioneer-out-of-ghana-gets-physical-with-100-virtual-centers-across-africa/">Mutti</a>) pharmacies across eight markets in Africa to be the first point of care for patients. The startup’s Mutti pharmacies are essentially mini-hospitals offering a wide-range of services including medical consultation, diagnostic and telehealth services. All these while increasing access and affordability to quality medication.</p>
<p>The startup has now set out to activate more mutti pharmacies to widen its reach and to build out its tech-infrastructure as it readies itself for the next phase of growth after raising $35 million in Series D round.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253652" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new funding, mPharma co-founder and CEO Gregory Rockson told TechCrunch, will be used to build the startup’s data infrastructure, triple its talent pool over the next three years and support expansion plans in its current and new markets. It is also rolling out an e-commerce platform for pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>“We are hiring over 100 engineers to build all our technology in-house and this includes a massive data infrastructure we are creating. We are also investing in other skilled talent like doctors and nurses, professionals that are critical in the work we do,” Rockson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“​​Bloom our pharmacy management software will allow us to build structured population health datasets that enable Mutti pharmacies to provide better care pathways to the community they serve,” he said.</p>
<p>The financing raised comprises $30 million in equity and $5 million in debt from CitiBank, bringing the total amount raised by mPharma to $65 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Investors that participated in the round include <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1876840/000187684021000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">JAM Fund</a>; a venture capital firm founded by Tinder co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinmateen/">Justin Mateen</a>, Unbound; a growth investment firm by Shravin Mittal the managing director Bharti Global limited (Bharti family investment arm) and the first investment in Africa for Lux Capital; a New-York City based VC firm investing in science and tech ventures. Other investors include Northstar, Social Capital, Novastar and TO Ventures.</p>
<p>mPharma was originally founded in 2013 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gregory-rockson-43804449/?originalSubdomain=gh">Rockson</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-shoukimas-33933a35?originalSubdomain=il">Daniel Shoukimas</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-nishiyama-finucane-295ab768/">James Finucane</a> to manage prescription drug inventory for pharmacies and their suppliers, retail pharmacy operations and provide market intelligence to hospitals, pharmacies and patients.</p>
<p>In October last year, the startup added telehealth services to its portfolio, tapping into the telemedicine wave that took off after the Covid pandemic. During an interview with TechCrunch in October last year, Rockson said the startup was planning to have 100 virtual centers by the end of six months. The number of virtual centers is primed to grow further alongside mPharma’s plan to increase its community pharmacies by 10 times over the next three years, from the current 200 centers.</p>
<p>Patients in Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Zambia, Malawi, Rwanda and Ethiopia, where mPharma has a presence, now have access to the virtual services. mPharma is also present in Gabon where it has a contract with the government to build a drug supply chain infrastructure.</p>

Photo <strong>Credits: mPharma.</strong></p></div></p>
<p>Startups like mPharma are bridging gaps in healthcare provision by bringing vital services closer to communities through, among other channels, pharmacies and community health checks.</p>
<p>This is a needed involvement given that countries across sub-Saharan Africa have an average of 0.23 doctors for every 10,000 people against the best ratio of 84.2 doctors in some of the most developed countries, according to World Health Organisation <a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/medical-doctors-(per-10-000-population)">data</a>.</p>
<p>Besides a low doctor to patient ratio, healthcare infrastructure also remains critically underdeveloped.</p>
<p>“Covid showed us that the best form of care is local, it is in the community, and the closest thing in communities are pharmacies. We believe that the pharmacy of the future, which is what we are creating, is one built around longitudinal care not episodic care,” said Rockson.</p>
<p>“We are transforming community pharmacies into the foundation of a modern health system in Africa. We will have a Mutti pharmacy in every community on the continent. Guarantee the availability and safety of medicines for each community and utilize the physical infrastructure of Mutti pharmacies to expand Mutti Doctor (the telemedicine service) creating the largest network of doctor offices and diagnostic centers.”</p>
<p>To offer all-rounded services, mPharma rolled out an ecommerce platform &#8212; the Mutti Online Pharmacy &#8212; a few weeks ago allowing its members to shop for pharmaceutical products. Starting in Ghana, they are initially only dispensing over-the-counter medication, but with plans to include prescription drugs in the near future. mPharma’s Mutti Online Pharmacy is now among the handful of exclusively digital pharmacies, including Kenya&#8217;s MyDawa, with operations in Africa.</p>
<p>mPharma has also in recent months embarked on a diversification, partnerships and expansion strategies to grow the company. A few months ago it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/health-tech-startup-mpharma-acquires-vine-pharmacy-enters-uganda/">acquired a 55% stake in Uganda’s Vine Pharmacy</a>, which was previously held by the Abraaj Group. It also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/ghanas-mpharma-partners-with-ethiopian-conglomerate-to-enter-its-eighth-market/">entered Ethiopia in March last year</a> by signing a franchise agreement with Belayab Pharmaceuticals through its subsidiary, Haltons Limited.</p>
<p>mPharma enjoys expertise backing from well-experienced professions in the pharmaceutical industry including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/helena-foulkes-54316910">Helena Foulkes</a>, former president of CVS, the largest pharmacy retail chain in the U.S. and Daniel Vasella, ex-CEO and chairman of Novartis; both are members of the board. The startup&#8217;s other investors include U.K.&#8217;s development arm CDC Group, Breyer Capital and Golden Palm Investments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fractal has raised $360 million from TPG in a new financing round and entered the unicorn club as the Mumbai and New York-based AI startup, which counts Google and Wells Fargo among its customers, scales its offerings and begins preparation for an IPO.</p>
<p>The new financing round valued the 21-year-old startup &#8220;at well north of $1 billion,&#8221; said Srikanth Velamakanni, co-founder and group chief executive at Fractal, in an interview with TechCrunch. TPG invested in the startup through its TPG Capital Asia, its Asia-focused private equity platform. The new round, which brings the startup&#8217;s all-time raise to about $685 million, involves some secondary share purchase as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://fractal.ai">Fractal Analytics</a> provides artificial intelligence and analytics solutions to scores of Fortune 100 firms. (A typical customer of Fractal generates at least $10 billion in revenue.) The startup&#8217;s offerings include Qure.ai, which assists radiologists in making better diagnostic decisions. Theremin.ai helps firms improve investment decisions; Eugenie.ai assists in finding anomalies in high-velocity data; Samya.ai is fuelling next-generation enterprise revenue growth management, and Senseforth.ai helps automate customer interactions at scale to grow top-line and bottom-line.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253658" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We solve every human problem in the enterprise,&#8221; said Velamakanni.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our clients are all looking to digitize their businesses and offer more personalized solutions to their customers,&#8221; he said. A telecom operator, for instance, works with Fractal to remove friction that customers face in signing up for a multi-year contract. Consumer goods giant P&amp;G last year launched a new product called &#8220;Secret,&#8221; an underarm perspirant that it formulated using AI, for which it publicly acknowledged Fractal&#8217;s contribution.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also work with them on areas such as improving efficiencies, productivity, supply chain planning and forecasting. This is becoming more and more crucial to firms, especially amid the pandemic,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The startup, which employs over 3,500 individuals globally, also helps its clients with decision-making actions, Velamakanni said. &#8220;Many companies have developed expertise on their product and engineering sides. But on the commercial front, they need some assistance,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fractal also incubates and invests in AI projects, he explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;We continue to see great momentum in how clients are leveraging AI to accelerate digital transformation. Fractal is building a great workplace and an innovative culture that&#8217;s driving significant client outcomes through our ‘user focused, decision-backwards’ approach to solving problems,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;TPG&#8217;s capabilities across all our markets and their proven success in building and supporting top AI providers is the perfect complement to the partnership we&#8217;ve enjoyed with Apax, whose insight and expertise have been instrumental in accelerating our growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startup said it serves over 100 of the top 500 companies in the world and generates over $100 million in annual revenue. It&#8217;s started to prepare for an initial public offering, but Velamakanni declined to share exactly when it will make the move.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would like to become a public company sooner than later. How soon? That I won&#8217;t be able to share at this point of time. But certainly, we have scale, size, maturity and governance of a public company,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the growing market for data and analytics services, Fractal continues to stand out as one of the most well-established, differentiated providers and a clear leader in AI and advanced analytics,&#8221; said Puneet Bhatia, Co-Managing Partner of TPG Capital Asia, in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The quality of Fractal&#8217;s offering has enabled them to build a deep and loyal client -base, made up of some of the world&#8217;s largest and most respected companies. Srikanth and Pranay have built a highly respected and market leading company, and we are excited to partner with this proven management team to continue to enhance Fractal&#8217;s organic and strategic growth.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian commerce startup <a href="https://udaan.com">Udaan</a>, which helps merchants secure inventory and working capital, has raised $250 million as it accelerates its scaling efforts and prepares to explore the public markets.</p>
<p>The Bengaluru-headquartered startup has raised $200 million via a convertible note and an additional $50 million as debt, its chief financial officer Aditya Pande told employees in an internal email, seen by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited and glad to share that we have 5 new marquee investors coming onboard the Udaan juggernaut, as part of our recently concluded convertible note financing. This round was oversubscribed 2x and also saw participation from our existing investors, including those who bought into the company through the secondary (ESOP) round in H1 2021,&#8221; he wrote in the email.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253624" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The email did not reveal the names of the new investors, but a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch that Tor Investment and Arena Investors are among those who have invested. The startup, which counts Lightspeed Venture Partners and GGV Capital among its existing backers and was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/indian-b2b-e-commerce-startup-udaan-raises-280-million/">last valued at over $3 billion</a>, is engaging with a few more investors and is likely to raise more money in the coming months, a separate source familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p>The new financing &#8220;reflects our &#8216;broadening the capitalization strategy&#8217; as we architect our journey for public markets and thereafter. With this convertible offering, we, as a company, have started building a complete new muscle in our finance function &#8211; which we will continue to strengthen as we go forward. With this note, the total funds raised by Udaan through debt and convertible note through just the last quarter of 2021 has crossed USD 250 Million, setting us up well to continue executing our strategic agenda,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>An Udaan spokesperson declined to comment. The startup has raised $1.4 billion to date.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the business-to-business market in India remains unorganized. This means that merchants in the nation today have to travel to other cities — where all the major dealers operate — to stock up their inventory. But these merchants don’t have much leverage to negotiate, so they struggle to find best-value for money and access to a wider selection of catalog.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Udaan &#8212; co-founded by three former Flipkart executives Sujeet Kumar, Vaibhav Gupta, and Amod Malviya &#8212;  is solving this problem by connecting small retailers with wholesalers and traders. The startup today serves more than 3 million retailers and small and medium-sized businesses and it has signed up thousands of brands, including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Boat Lifestyle, Micromax, HP, LG, ITC, HUL and P&amp;G.</p>
<p>Other than the inventory problem, Udaan also helps merchants secure working capital. Small businesses, especially mom-and-pop shops, rely on money they secure from selling their existing inventory for buying their next batch. Because Udaan is able to see the engagement of different merchants on the platform, it is able to determine to whom it could safely grant working capital.</p>
<p>The startup appointed Gupta as its chief executive last year as it kicked off the work to get ready for an IPO. Prior to the move, it did not have a CEO.</p>
<p>Scores of firms including Reliance Retail, the nation&#8217;s largest retail chain, e-commerce giant Amazon as well as startups such as Jumbotail, Khatabook and Dukaan are also attempting to serve this large merchant base through a number of offerings such as access to working capital and point-of-sale terminals to accept money digitally.</p>
