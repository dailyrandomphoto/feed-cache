										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A few months back, robotic process automation (RPA) unicorn UiPath <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">raised a huge $750 million round</a> at a valuation of around $35 billion. The capital came ahead of the company&#8217;s expected IPO, so its then-new valuation helped provide a measuring stick for where its eventual flotation could price.</p>
<p>UiPath then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-ipo-filing-suggests-robotic-process-automation-is-booming/">filed to go public</a>. But today the company&#8217;s first IPO price range <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001734722/000119312521112457/d98556ds1a.htm">was released</a>, failing to value the company where its final private backers expected it to.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="58RC2jZsqI"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-ipo-filing-suggests-robotic-process-automation-is-booming/">UiPath&#8217;s IPO filing suggests robotic process automation is booming</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UiPath&#8217;s IPO filing suggests robotic process automation is booming&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/uipaths-ipo-filing-suggests-robotic-process-automation-is-booming/embed/#?secret=58RC2jZsqI" data-secret="58RC2jZsqI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In an S-1/A filing, UiPath disclosed that it expects its IPO to price between $43 and $50 per share. Using a simple share count of 516,545,035, the company would be worth $22.2 billion to $25.8 billion at the lower and upper extremes of its expected price interval. Neither of those numbers is close to what it was worth, in theory, just a few months ago.</p>
<p>According to IPO watching group Renaissance Capital, UiPath <a href="https://www.renaissancecapital.com/IPO-Center/News/80660/Software-maker-UiPath-sets-terms-for-$990-million-IPO">is worth</a> up to $26.0 billion on a fully diluted basis. That&#8217;s not much more than its simple valuation.</p>
<p>For UiPath, its initial IPO price interval is a disappointment, though the company could see an upward revision in its valuation before it does sell shares and begin to trade. But more to the point, the company&#8217;s private-market valuation bump followed by a quick public-market correction stands out as a counter-example to something that we&#8217;ve seen so frequently in recent months.</p>
<p>Is UiPath&#8217;s first IPO price interval <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/compass-ceo-hails-ipo-as-a-fundraising-event-amid-challenging-market/">another indicator</a> that the IPO market is cooling?</p>
<h2>Remember Roblox?</h2>
<p>If you think back to the end of 2020, Roblox decided to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/ipo-delays-are-bumming-me-out/">cancel its IPO</a> and pursue a direct listing instead. Why? Because a few companies like Airbnb had gone public at what appeared to be strong valuation marks only to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/airbnbs-first-day-pop-caps-off-a-stellar-week-for-tech-ipos/">see their values rocket</a> once they began to trade. So, Roblox decided to raise a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/robloxs-raises-at-29-5-billion-valuation-as-it-readies-for-direct-listing/">huge amount of private capital</a>, and then direct list.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">President Biden has named two former National Security Agency veterans to senior government cybersecurity positions, including the first national cyber director.</p>
<p>The appointments, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/12/president-biden-announces-his-intent-to-nominate-key-members-for-the-u-s-department-of-homeland-security/">announced Monday</a>, land after the discovery of two cyberattacks linked to foreign governments earlier this year — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/fbi-nsa-says-hacks-on-us-federal-agencies-likely-russian-in-origin/">the Russian espionage campaign</a> that planed backdoors in U.S. technology giant SolarWinds&#8217; technology to hack into at least nine federal agencies, and the mass exploitation of Microsoft Exchange servers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-says-china-backed-hackers-are-exploiting-exchange-zero-days/">linked to hackers backed by China</a>.</p>
<p>Jen Easterly, a former NSA official under the Obama administration who helped to launch U.S. Cyber Command, has been nominated as the new head of CISA, the cybersecurity advisory unit housed under Homeland Security. CISA has been without a head for six months after then-President Trump <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/trump-fires-us-cybersecurity-official-chris-krebs-for-debunking-false-election-claims/">fired former director Chris Krebs</a>, who Trump appointed to lead the agency in 2018, for disputing Trump&#8217;s false claims of election hacking.</p>
<p>Biden has also named former NSA deputy director John &#8220;Chris&#8221; Inglis as national cyber director, a new position created by Congress late last year to be housed in the White House, charged with overseeing the defense and cybersecurity budgets of civilian agencies.</p>
<p>Inglis is expected to work closely with Anne Neuberger, who in January was appointed as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/decrypted-with-more-solarwinds-fallout-biden-picks-his-cybersecurity-team/">the deputy national security adviser for cyber</a> on the National Security Council. Neuberger, a former NSA executive and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/04/nsas-anne-neuberger-to-talk-cybersecurity-at-disrupt-2020/">first director of cybersecurity</a>, was tasked with leading the government&#8217;s response to the SolarWinds attack and Exchange hacks.</p>
<p>Biden has also nominated Rob Silvers, a former Obama-era assistant secretary for cybersecurity policy, to serve as undersecretary for strategy, policy, and plans at Homeland Security. Silvers was <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/rob-silvers-biden-cisa-cyber-homeland-security/">recently floated</a> for the top job at CISA.</p>
<p>Both Easterly and Silvers&#8217; positions are subject to Senate confirmation. The appointments were <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/former-senior-nsa-officials-named-to-white-house-cyber-position-and-head-of-dhs-cyber-agency/2021/04/11/b9d408cc-9b2d-11eb-8005-bffc3a39f6d3_story.html">first reported</a> by The Washington Post.</p>
<p>Former CISA director Krebs <a href="https://twitter.com/c_c_krebs/status/1381437135153168389">praised</a> the appointments as &#8220;brilliant picks.&#8221; Dmitri Alperovitch, a former CrowdStrike executive and chair of Silverado Policy Accelerator, called the appointments the &#8220;cyber equivalent of the dream team.&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/DAlperovitch/status/1381430265378185218">In a tweet</a>, Alperovitch said: &#8220;The administration could not have picked three more capable and experienced people to run cyber operations, policy and strategy alongside Anne Neuberger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neuberger is replaced by Rob Joyce, a former White House cybersecurity czar, who returned from a stint at the U.S. Embassy in London earlier this year to serve as NSA&#8217;s new cybersecurity director.</p>
<p>Last week, the White House asked Congress for <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/white-house-cisa-funding-dhs-request/">$110 million in new funding</a> for next year to help Homeland Security to improve its defenses and hire more cybersecurity talent. CISA hemorrhaged senior staff last year after several executives were fired by the Trump administration or left for the private sector.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/establishing-twitter-s-presence-in-africa.html">statement</a>, Twitter says it is now actively building a team in Ghana &#8220;to be more immersed in the rich and vibrant communities that drive the conversations taking place every day across the continent<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Twitter indicated several roles from product and engineering to design, marketing, and communications for job openings in the company. However, individuals will fill these roles remotely as Twitter makes plans to establish an office in the country later.</p>

<p>Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo, enthused about the news said &#8220;the choice of Ghana as HQ for Twitter’s Africa operations is excellent news. Government and Ghanaians welcome very much this announcement and the confidence reposed in our country.”</p>
<p>He also revealed that he held a virtual meeting with Dorsey on the 7th of April, where the two parties might have finalized the deal.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I indicated to Jack in our virtual meeting on 7th April 2021, this is the start of a beautiful partnership between Twitter and Ghana, which is critical for the development of Ghana&#8217;s hugely important tech sector. These are exciting times to be in and to do business in Ghana,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>According to Twitter, the decision to kick off its African expansion with Ghana stems from the country&#8217;s dealings with AfCFTA and its openness towards the internet.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="hyphenate ">“As a champion for democracy, Ghana is a supporter of free speech, online freedom, and the Open Internet, of which Twitter is also an advocate. Furthermore, Ghana’s recent appointment to host The Secretariat of the African Continental Free Trade Area aligns with our overarching goal to establish a presence in the region that will support our efforts to improve and tailor our service across Africa,” the statement read.</p>
<p>The news comes almost eighteen months after Dorsey&#8217;s visit with his Twitter team to Africa for the first time in November 2019. During <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1180191189590392832">his tour on the continent</a>, he visited Ghana, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and South Africa, where he met with different industry leaders and tech stakeholders on matters concerning Twitter and bitcoin.</p>
<p>Dorsey <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1199774792917929984">stated</a> that he would return to the continent to live for six months in mid-2020, but the pandemic made sure that plan was soiled. Since then, not much was communicated by Dorsey or the Twitter team about the visit, although in September, the company subsequently made some mental health and cultural partnerships with local communities across the countries &#8212;  Afrochella and The HackLab Foundation in Ghana, Amref Health Africa in Kenya, and Mentally Aware Nigeria Initiative (MANI) in Nigeria.</p>
<p>In October 2020, the Twitter CEO showed solidarity in the protests against police brutality that rocked Nigeria and supported bitcoin usage throughout the demonstrations. For months, it seemed Dorsey was solely concerned about bitcoin activities on the continent. However, today&#8217;s news puts things into perspective and shows connecting Twitter and the continent was at the back of his mind after all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cybersecurity training startup <a href="http://hackthebox.eu">Hack The Box</a>, which emerged originally from Greece, has raised a Series A investment round of $10.6 million, led by Paladin Capital Group and joined by Osage University Partners, Brighteye Ventures, and existing investors Marathon Venture Capital. It will use the funding to expand. Most recently it launched Hack The Box Academy.</p>
<p>Started in 2017, Hack The Box specializes in using ‘ethical hacking’ to train cybersecurity techniques. Users are given challenges to “attack” virtual vulnerable labs in a simulated, gamified, and test environment. This approach has garnered over 500,000 platform members, from beginners to experts, and brought in around 800 organizations (such as governments, Fortune 500 companies, and academic institutions) to improve their cyber-adversarial knowledge.</p>
<p>Haris Pylarinos, Hack The Box Co-Founder and CEO said: “Everything we do is geared around creating a safer Internet by empowering corporate teams and individuals to create unbreakable systems.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Out the window, a fire is raging — and it’s moving ever closer. Confusion. Fear. A run for the car. Roads open and then suddenly closed by authorities. Traffic jams. A fire break that stalls the flames and then suddenly the flames jump, changing direction. Everyone has a plan for what to do — a plan that gets ripped up the second someone leaves their home to evacuate.</p>
<p>In the heat of the moment, everyone needs to know exactly what to do and where to go. Unfortunately, that information is rarely available in the format they need.</p>
<p>Bailey Farren’s family has experienced this four times living in California north of San Francisco. The wildfires are more common than ever with the aridness of climate change, yet the evacuations remain a pandemonium. While a student at Berkeley, she started investigating what was happening, and why her family constantly lacked the information they needed to get out safely and swiftly. “I thought that first responders had everything they need,” she said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>They don’t. Firefighters on the frontlines often lack the technology needed to relay accurate information to operations centers, which can then guide citizens on how to evacuate. With the pressing need to keep citizens up-to-date, most authorities rely on simple text messages to just tell everyone in, say, an entire county to evacuate, with nary more detail.</p>
<p>The Camp Fire in California in 2018, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/11/25/camp-fire-deadliest-wildfire-californias-history-has-been-contained/">the worst fire in California’s history</a>, triggered her to go beyond interviewing public safety officers to building a solution. She graduated in spring 2019, and at the same time, founded Perimeter with fellow Berkeley grad Noah Wu.</p>
<p><a href="https://perimeterplatform.com">Perimeter</a> is an emergency response platform designed to “bridge the gap between agencies and citizens” in Farren’s words by offering better two-way communication centered on geospatial data.</p>
<p>The company announced today that it has raised a $1 million pre-seed round led by Parade Ventures with Dustin Dolginow, social-impact organization One World, and Alchemist Accelerator participating. Alchemist was the first money into the startup.</p>
<p>Using Perimeter, citizens can upload geospatial-tagged information such as a new fire outbreak or a tree that has fallen and is now blocking a road. “Sometimes citizens have the most accurate and real-time information, before first responders show up — we want citizens to share that with … government officials,” Farren said. That information is not immediately disseminated to the public though. Instead, first responders can vet the information, ensuring that citizens are always using accurate information in planning their actions. “We do not want it to be a social-media platform,” she explained.</p>
<p>In the other direction, operations centers can use Perimeter to send citizens accurate and detailed evacuation maps with routes on where to go. Unlike with just a text message, Perimeter will send both the message and a URL, which can then display maps and real-time information on how a disaster is progressing.</p>
<p>Right now, the platform is distributed as a web app, so that citizens don’t need to have it pre-installed when a disaster strikes. Farren noted that the company is working on native apps as well, particularly for first responders who need robust offline capabilities due to intermittent cell signals that are typical in disaster zones.</p>
<p>Farren and her team have interviewed emergency management agencies extensively, and she says that her first customer is Palo Alto’s Office of Emergency Services. Over the past two fire seasons, “we had an R&amp;D focus in that we were building hand-in-hand with agencies … and we took two fire seasons to beta test our technology,” she said.</p>
<p>The company has four full-time employees working remotely, but all based in California.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Intel subsidiary Mobileye is ratcheting up its autonomous vehicle ambitions and getting into delivery.</p>
<p>The company said Monday it struck a deal with Udelv to supply its self-driving system to thousands of purpose-built autonomous delivery vehicles. The companies said they plan to put more than 35,000 autonomous vehicles dubbed Transporters on city streets by 2028. Commercial operations are slated to begin in 2023.</p>
<p>Donlen, a U.S. commercial fleet leasing and management company, has made the first pre-order for 1,000 of these Udelv Transporters.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The announcement is notable for both companies. Udelv, which initially launched as an autonomous vehicle delivery startup, has opted to adopt Mobileye&#8217;s self-driving system and focus on &#8220;creating the hardware and software that allows for autonomous deliveries,&#8221; its CEO Daniel Laury said in an emailed statement to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a hardcore engineering problem to solve when one understands the multiplicity of goods to deliver, the variety of ways to do it, and some other intricately complex issues linked to the automation of last and middle mile deliveries,&#8221; Laury said. &#8220;By partnering with Mobileye, Udelv can focus 100% of its resources and efforts to perfecting the business application while Mobileye provides the tool to scale fast. It is a win-win situation.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mobileye is bringing its autonomous vehicle test fleets to at least four more cities in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/mobileye-is-bringing-its-autonomous-vehicle-test-fleets-to-at-least-four-more-cities-in-2021/embed/#?secret=z2QI4vSW2I" data-secret="z2QI4vSW2I" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For Mobilieye it marks yet another expansion for a company that got its start as a developer of camera-based sensors, which are now used by most automakers to support advanced driver assistance systems. Today, more than 54 million vehicles have Mobileye technology.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a great combination of the two partners together and we expect some great scale,&#8221; Jack Weast, a senior principal engineer at Intel and the Vice President of Automated Vehicle Standards at Mobileye, said in a recent interview. &#8220;And this does kind of mark, officially, the first proof point of Mobileye&#8217;s technology getting into goods delivery in addition to all the other spaces that we&#8217;ve already announced.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company, which was acquired by Intel for $15.3 billion in 2017, has widened its scope in recent years, moving beyond its advanced driver assistance technology and toward the development of a self-driving vehicle system. More than two years ago, Mobileye announced plans to launch a kit that includes visual perception, sensor fusion, its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/08/intels-mobileye-will-have-2-million-cars-on-roads-building-hd-maps-in-2018/">REM mapping system</a> and software algorithms. And in 2018, the company made an unlikely turn and announced plans to become a robotaxi operator, not just a supplier. Mobileye also plans to deploy autonomous shuttles with Transdev ATS and Lohr Group beginning in Europe. Mobileye also plans to begin operating an autonomous ride-hailing service in Israel in early 2022.</p>
<p>This latest deal shows Mobileye&#8217;s ambition to see its self-driving systems used in other applications beyond robotaxis.</p>
<p>The self-driving system, now branded as Mobilieye Drive, is made up of a system-on-chip based compute, redundant sensing subsystems based on camera, radar and lidar technology, its REM mapping system and a rules-based Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) driving policy. Mobileye’s REM mapping system essentially crowdsources data by tapping into more than 1 million vehicles equipped with its tech to build high-definition maps that can be used to support in ADAS and autonomous driving systems.</p>
<p>Udelv will work with Mobileye to integrate the self-driving technology with its own delivery management system. Mobileye will also provide over-the-air software support throughout the lifetime of the vehicles.</p>
<p>These purpose-built vehicles won&#8217;t have the typical mechanical features one might find in a human driven truck or delivery van. It will be designed to be capable of so-called Level 4 self-driving, a designation by SAE that means the vehicle can handle all operations without a human under certain conditions. It will also come with four-directional four-way steering, LED screens to great the people picking up the delivery and special compartments for goods.</p>
<p>There will be a teleoperations system that will allow for the maneuvering of the vehicles in parking lots, loading zones, apartment complexes and private roads, according to Udelv.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Last month was Uber's best in history in terms of gross sales on its platform. That's good, but not as good as you might think.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After a short hiatus, The Exchange is back. We&#8217;ll spend part of this week digging into the global venture capital scene&#8217;s Q1 performance, but today, we&#8217;re kicking off with a quick dive into Uber, Lyft, Deliveroo and DoorDash &#8212; and the ability of on-demand companies of various stripes to generate profit.</p>
<p>Uber is our lodestone today because it dropped a <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001543151/84bcb1ae-108c-493b-a622-c8fcd2bb29b7.pdf">new SEC filing</a> that includes some notes on its recent performance. And, most critically, a piece of guidance for investors concerning its ability to make money this year.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>By &#8220;make money,&#8221; we don&#8217;t mean traditional net income on a GAAP &#8212; generally accepted accounting principles &#8212; basis. We mean Uber is providing its public investors with notes on its future <em>adjusted</em> profitability. Real profits are still somewhere out in the uncharted future.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s parse Uber&#8217;s latest, vet its profit promise, consider its rivals and their performance, and then ask ourselves if the great ride-hailing and food-delivery booms will ever make back the money they cost to scale.</p>
<h2>Uber&#8217;s planned profits</h2>
<p>In 2019, Lyft told investors to expect positive adjusted EBITDA by the final quarter of 2021; at the time, Uber said it would generate full-year positive adjusted EBITDA. Those are slightly different (if related) promises. Later, Uber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/07/unpacking-ubers-new-profitability-promise/">moved up its profitability promise to Q4 2020</a>, but that was not to be.</p>
<p>After Uber changed up its profitability timeline, COVID-19 came. The pandemic forced the American ride-hailing company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/08/uber-pushes-adjusted-quarterly-profit-target-to-2021/">to revert</a> to its previous adjusted profitability promises.</p>
<p>Uber and Lyft took huge revenue hits as their core ride-hailing businesses dried up faster than water on a Texas sidewalk after COVID-19 lockdowns took effect. In response, Uber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/huge-delivery-demand-fails-to-stop-ubers-revenue-from-shrinking-in-q3/">fell back on its Uber Eats business</a>, while Lyft had to get by without a second business line.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian, the Amazon-backed EV manufacturer aiming to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/rivian-raises-2-65-billion-in-new-capital-as-it-pushes-towards-production-of-its-electric-pickup/">bring an electric pickup to market later this year</a>, has partnered with Samsung SDI as its battery cell supplier, the company said Monday.</p>
<p>The two companies did not disclose the value of the deal or its term length, but in a statement released Monday Rivian said it had been working with Samsung SDI “throughout the vehicle development process.”</p>
<p>Rivian pointed out that its anticipated R1T pickup and R1S SUV, which Rivian calls “adventure vehicles,” require a battery module and pack that can handle extreme temperatures and durability use cases.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>South Korea-based Samsung SDI already supplies battery cells to other automakers. In 2019, the company signed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/bmw-locks-up-10-2-billion-euro-battery-order-ahead-of-ev-onslaught/">$3.2 billion deal with BMW Group for a 10-year supply agreement</a>.</p>
<p>“We’re excited about the performance and reliability of Samsung SDI battery cells combined with our energy-dense module and pack design,” Rivian CEO Rj Scaringe said in a statement. “Samsung SDI’s focus on innovation and responsible sourcing of battery materials aligns well with our vision.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Microsoft announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-is-acquiring-nuance-communications-for-19-7b/">it was acquiring Nuance Communications</a> this morning for $19.7 billion, you could be excused for doing a Monday morning double take at the hefty price tag.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s surely a lot of money for a company on a $1.4 billion run rate, but Microsoft, which has already partnered with the speech-to-text market leader on several products over the last couple of years, saw a company firmly embedded in healthcare and it decided to go all in.</p>
<p>And $20 billion is certainly all in, even for a company the size of Microsoft. But 2020 forced us to change the way we do business from restaurants to retailers to doctors. In fact, the pandemic in particular changed the way we interact with our medical providers. We learned very quickly that you don&#8217;t have to drive to an office, wait in waiting room, then in an exam room, all to see the doctor for a few minutes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead, we can get on the line, have a quick chat and be on our way. It won&#8217;t work for every condition of course &#8212; there will always be times the physician needs to see you &#8212; but for many meetings such as reviewing test results or for talk therapy, telehealth could suffice.</p>

<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says that Nuance is at the center of this shift, especially with its use of cloud and artificial intelligence, and that&#8217;s why the company was willing to pay the amount it did to get it.</p>
<p>&#8220;AI is technology’s most important priority, and healthcare is its most urgent application. Together, with our partner ecosystem, we will put advanced AI solutions into the hands of professionals everywhere to drive better decision-making and create more meaningful connections, as we accelerate growth of Microsoft Cloud in Healthcare and Nuance,&#8221; Nadella said <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-accelerates-industry-cloud-strategy-for-healthcare-with-the-acquisition-of-nuance/">in a post announcing the deal</a>.</p>
<p>Holger Mueller, an analyst at Constellation Research, says says that may be so, but he believes that Microsoft missed the boat with Cortana and this is about helping the company catch up on a crucial technology. &#8220;Nuance will be not only give Microsoft technology help in regards to neural network based speech recognition, but also a massive improvement from vertical capabilities, call center functionality and the MSFT IP position in speech,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Microsoft sees this deal doubling what was already a considerable total addressable market to nearly $500 billion. While TAMs always tend to run high, that is still a substantial number.</p>
<p>It also fits with Gartner data, which found that by 2022, 75% of healthcare organizations will have a formal cloud strategy in place. The AI component only adds to that number and Nuance brings 10,000 existing customers to Microsoft including some of the biggest healthcare organizations in the world.</p>
<p>Brent Leary, founder and principal analyst at CRM Essentials, says the deal could provide Microsoft with a ton of health data to help feed the underlying machine learning models and make them more accurate over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is going be a ton of health data being captured by the interactions coming through telemedicine interactions, and this could create a whole new level of health intelligence,&#8221; Leary told me.</p>
<p>That of course could drive a lot of privacy concerns where health data is involved, and it will be up to Microsoft, which just experienced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/hackers-exchange-servers-ransomware/">a major breach on its Exchange</a> email server products last month, to assure the public that their sensitive health data is being protected.</p>
<p>Leary says that ensuring data privacy is going to be absolutely key to the success of the deal. &#8220;The potential this move has is pretty powerful, but it will only be realized if the data and insights that could come from it are protected and secure &#8212; not only protected from hackers but also from unethical use. Either could derail what could be a game changing move,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Microsoft also seemed to recognize that when it wrote, &#8220;Nuance and Microsoft will deepen their existing commitments to the extended partner ecosystem, as well as the highest standards of data privacy, security and compliance.&#8221;</p>
<p>We are clearly on the edge of a sea change when it comes to how we interact with our medical providers in the future. COVID pushed medicine deeper into the digital realm in 2020 out of simple necessity. It wasn&#8217;t safe to go into the office unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>The Nuance acquisition, which is expected to close some time later this year, could help Microsoft shift deeper into the market. It could even bring Teams into it as a meeting tool, but it&#8217;s all going to depend on the trust level people have with this approach, and it will be up to the company to make sure that both healthcare providers and the people they serve have that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">“It’s a little bit of a messy story,” Adam Leeb says with a laugh. The story that landed <a href="https://astrohaus.com/">Astrohaus</a> in Detroit on two separate occasions is a bit tangled, certainly. The hardware startup’s cofounder and CEO isn’t the sort of hometown cheerleader you often encounter when speaking with executives who’ve opted to keep their organizations outside cities like San Francisco or New York.</p>
<p>Hailing from Detroit’s outer suburbs, Leeb cofounded the company in the Motor City in Fall 2014 with Patrick Paul. Astrohaus’s first – and best known – product was born as an attempt to offer users a “distraction-free writing experience.”</p>
<p>“I’m not even a writer,” Leeb says of the product’s inception. “What interests me about the product – what got me going – is yes, it’s about writing, but common among all of the things I’m interested in, is it’s more about process and productivity. That’s something I’m super passionate about. And making things easier that get out of your way and are really fun to use.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Leeb, an MIT mechanical engineering graduate and Paul a Michigan State graduate and software developer met through the Detroit startup community and got to work prototyping a word processing device that delivered the benefits of modern tech, without the sort of inherent distractions of computers and tablets that today’s writers know all too well.</p>

<p>The young company introduced itself to the world by way of Kickstarter, launching a campaign in 2014.</p>
<p>“The Hemingwrite combines the best features of all previous writing tools with the addition of modern technology,” the company wrote. “It is dedicated like a typewriter, has a better keyboard and battery life than your computer and is distraction free like a word processor. Finally, we sync your documents to the cloud in real-time so you never have to worry about saving, syncing or backing up your work.”</p>
<p>The product was greeted with excitement and some gentle-ribbing (and some not-so-gentle, including one review that called it <a href="https://mashable.com/2016/02/24/freewrite-word-processor/">&#8220;pretentious hipster nonsense&#8221;</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">) over a $500 reinvention of the typewriter. The crowdfunding community went wild, with nearly $350,000 raised. In June of 2015, the product was renamed.</span></p>
<p>“We are updating our brand with a more demonstrative name that also no longer ties us to the persona of a certain famous writer,” the company wrote in a June 2015 Kickstarter updated. Two months later, Astrohaus relocated to New York City.</p>
<p>“I was really itching to leave. I didn’t know how we were going to make it in Detroit,” Leeb says. “There’s not really a hardware scene and my connections were mostly in New York. I pushed Patrick – we had raised some money and gotten going, so I was like, ‘let’s move to New York.’ There’s definitely more of a hardware scene and we were definitely a part of it.”</p>
<p>Once again, life intervened. Paul left the company and Leeb married Kacee Must, a Detroit resident – and owner of local yoga chain, Citizen Yoga. In 2018, he found himself building Astrohaus up again in the city where it started life. Three years later, the team is still a fairly lean one, with five full time employees in Detroit and a more distributed team of contractors.</p>
<p>Leeb’s feelings about launching a hardware startup in Detroit are clearly mixed. He bemoans the difficultly in recruiting and finding funding locally, while acknowledging a sense of local cheerleading one really finds in larger cities. “With these smaller ecosystems, you really get to know people everywhere,” he says. “Everyone is so accessible. As far as anywhere I’ve ever been, Detroit companies really cheer for each other. There’s so much Detroit pride.”</p>
<p>For all of the talk of returning manufacturing to Detroit, Leeb says he’s had little luck in his pursuit to get the Freewrite and subsequent products created in the U.S.</p>
<p>“There’s a whole other world of advanced manufacturing startups that definitely get a lot of benefits from being in a manufacturing hub,” he says. “I think for software companies and for us it’s not so beneficial. We make our goods in China, and I don’t see that changing any time soon. I have good relationships with our factories and I spend a lot of time in China. That’s what they’re geared toward. They make consumer electronics.”</p>

<p>Leeb says he’s found the Andrew Yang-founded Venture for America nonprofit a useful source of hiring locally. In the years following Astrohaus’ launch, impressions of the city have changed radically from a depressed byproduct of rust belt boom and bust to a viable place to launch a business.</p>
<p>“The last 10 years, there’s a massive difference in the city,” Leeb says. “[Quicken Loans cofounder] Dan Gilbert almost single-handedly brought the city back. There are a lot of people who hate him, but the reality is that, while he wasn’t the only billionaire in town, he’s the only one who heavily invested in Detroit. He consolidated all of his suburban offices and put them in downtown and he convinced all of these companies to do the same.”</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic will no doubt continue to have repercussions, as remote work becomes the norm for many or most tech outlets. Though hardware startups will always have a compelling reason to keep things in close quarters, as companies develop and test products. For his part, Leeb says Astrohaus’ next device aims to address concerns about remote collaboration.</p>
<p>“I’m very aggressively starting to work on a new hardware product that is a collaboration and communication tool,” he says. “It was a problem before, and now it’s such a widespread problem that I feel we’re lacking in certain communication. There’s a lot to be done there. I don’t feel as connected as we could be, even with the technology we have.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Don&#8217;t sleep on Detroit. The city that put America in motion is quickly growing into a startup hub with a wide variety of successes. From sneakers to mortgages to houseplants, companies are finding success in Southeast Michigan thanks to welcoming investors, access to amazing engineering talent, and a deep history of creating lasting businesses. Throughout the coming days, TechCrunch is going to publish additional stories from Detroit including interviews with local heros and promising startups.</p>
<p>StockX is leading the way as explained in this multi-part feature that explores the company&#8217;s founding, strategies, and future. Located in the heart of downtown Detroit, StockX is leaving a lasting mark on the city as the company marches towards an initial pubic offering.</p>
<div>
<p>The StockX EC-1 comprises four main articles numbering 11,700 words and a reading time of 47 minutes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li><b>Part 1: Origin story</b> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1-origin/">How StockX became the stock market of hype</a>” (2,500 words/10 minute reading time) — Investigates how StockX evolved from a basic aggregation of price data into the multibillion dollar juggernaut we see today.</li>
<li><b>Part 2: E-commerce authentication</b> “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1-authentication/">Authentication and StockX’s global arms race against fraudsters</a>” (3,700 words/15 minute reading time) — A deeply nuanced analysis of StockX’s key product of authentication and the challenges of building a trusted market against an onslaught of scammers heavily incentivized to get a fake good sold.</li>
<li><b>Part 3: Competitive and consumer landscape </b>“<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stocks-ec1-business/">Where StockX fits in the business of sneakers</a>” (2,800 words/11 minute reading time) — Explores how the company connected buyers and sellers, as well as its long-term impact on both groups.</li>
<li><b>Part 4: Future and impact </b>“<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/stockx-ec1-culture/">The consequences of scaling up sneaker culture</a>” (2,700 words/11 minute reading time) — Looks at how StockX and the changes it has wrought have led to a massive change in the culture of sneakers and what that portends long term.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>On Thursday, April 15, we&#8217;re hosting a small virtual meetup in Detroit featuring a pitch-off with local startups, interviews with local investors, and we&#8217;ll chat with the author of the StockX EC-1. This event is free. <strong><a href="https://hopin.com/events/techcrunch-city-spotlight-detroit">Register here</a></strong>. We hope you can join us to learn more about the modern Detroit</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note Detroit&#8217;s success trails a larger, more important ecosystem in Southeast Michigan. Ann Arbor is located 45 minutes away, and should not be pushed aside. This university town has long produced world-class companies and products. The majority of the VC funding in Michigan goes to Ann Arbor-based startups. There are advantages to both areas, though, and TechCrunch loves the cooperation between the two regions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ionq.com/">IonQ</a>, the trapped ion quantum computing company that recently announced that it <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ionq-to-become-first-publicly-traded-quantum-computing-company-via-merger-with-spac-dmy-technology-group-2021-03-08">wants to go public</a> via a SPAC, today announced that it is integrating its quantum computing platform with the open-source <a href="https://qiskit.org/">Qiskit</a> software development kit. This means Qiskit users can now bring their programs to IonQ&#8217;s platform without any major modifications to their code.</p>
<p>At first glance, that seems relatively unremarkable, but it&#8217;s worth noting that Qiskit was founded by IBM Research and is IBM&#8217;s default tool for working with its quantum computers. There is a healthy bit of competition between IBM and IonQ (and, to be fair, many others in this space), in part because both are betting on very different technologies at the core of their platforms. While IonQ is betting on trapped ions, which allows its machines able to run at room temperature, IBM&#8217;s technique requires its machine to be supercooled.</p>
<p>IonQ has now released a new provider library for Qiskit that is available as part of the <a href="https://github.com/Qiskit-Partners">Qiskit Partner</a> repository on GitHub and via the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/qiskit-ionq/">Python Package Index</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;IonQ is excited to make our quantum computers and APIs easily accessible to the Qiskit community,&#8221; said IonQ CEO &amp; President Peter Chapman. &#8220;Open source has already revolutionized traditional software development. With this integration, we’re bringing the world one step closer to the first generation of widely-applicable quantum applications.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On the one hand, it&#8217;s hard not to look at this as IonQ needling IBM a bit, but it&#8217;s also an acknowledgment that Qiskit has become somewhat of a standard for developers who want to work with quantum computers. But putting these rivalries aside, we&#8217;re also in the early days of quantum computing and with no clear leader yet, anything that makes these various platforms more interoperable is a win for developers who want to dip their feet into writing for them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> agreed today to acquire <a href="https://www.nuance.com/index.html">Nuance Communications</a>, a leader in speech to text software, for $19.7 billion. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-11/microsoft-is-said-to-be-in-talks-to-buy-nuance-communications">Bloomberg broke the story</a> over the weekend that the two companies were in talks.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-accelerates-industry-cloud-strategy-for-healthcare-with-the-acquisition-of-nuance/">a post announcing the deal</a>, the company said this was about increasing its presence in the healthcare vertical, a place where Nuance has done well in recent years. In fact, the company announced the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare last year, and this deal is about accelerating its presence there. Nuance&#8217;s products in this area include Dragon Ambient eXperience, Dragon Medical One and PowerScribe One for radiology reporting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today’s acquisition announcement represents the latest step in Microsoft’s industry-specific cloud strategy,&#8221; the company wrote. The acquisition also builds on several integrations and partnerships the two companies have made in the last couple of years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company boasts 10,000 healthcare customers, according to information on the website. Those include AthenaHealth, Johns Hopkins, Mass General Brigham and Cleveland Clinic to name but a few, and it was that customer base that attracted Microsoft to pay the price it did to bring Nuance into the fold.</p>
<p>Nuance CEO Mark Benjamin will remain with the company and report to Scott Guthrie, Microsoft&#8217;s EVP in charge of the cloud and AI group.</p>
<p>Nuance has a complex history. It went public in 2000 and began buying speech recognition products including Dragon Dictate from Lernout Hauspie in 2001. It merged with a company called ScanSoft in 2005. That company began life as Visioneer, a scanning company in 1992.</p>
<p>Today, the company has a number of products including Dragon Dictate, a consumer and business text to speech product that dates back to the early 1990s. It&#8217;s also involved in speech recognition, chat bots and natural language processing particularly in healthcare and other verticals.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Microsoft has acquired GitHub for $7.5B in stock&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-has-acquired-github-for-7-5b-in-microsoft-stock/embed/#?secret=0ScQlhF99D" data-secret="0ScQlhF99D" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company has 6,000 employees spread across 27 countries. In its most recent earnings report from November 2020, which was for Q42020, the company reported $352.9 million in revenue compared to $387.6 million in the same period a year prior. That&#8217;s not the direction a company wants to go in, but it is still a run rate of over $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>At the time of that earnings call, the company also announced it was selling its medical transcription and electronic health record (EHR) Go-Live services to Assured Healthcare Partners and Aeries Technology Group. Company CEO Benjamin said this was about helping the company concentrate on its core speech services.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this sale, we will reach an important milestone in our journey towards a more focused strategy of advancing our Conversational AI, natural language understanding and ambient clinical intelligence solutions,&#8221; Benjamin said in a statement at the time.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Microsoft already has a number speech recognition and chat bot products of its own including desktop speech to text services in Windows and on Azure, but it took a chance to buy a market leader and go deeper into the healthcare vertical.</p>
<p>The transaction has already been approved by both company boards and Microsoft reports it expects the deal to close by the end of this year, subject to standard regulatory oversight and approval by Nuance shareholders.</p>
<p>This would mark the second largest purchase by Microsoft ever, only surpassed by the $26.2 billion<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/08/microsoft-officially-closes-its-26-2b-acquisition-of-linkedin/"> the company paid for LinkedIn</a> in 2016.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ethical investing remains something of a confusing maze, with a great deal of ‘greenwashing’ going on. A new UK startup is hoping to fix that with the launch of its new app and platform for retail investors.</p>
<p><a href="https://clim8invest.com/">Clim8 Invest</a>has raised $8 million from 7pc Ventures (early backers of Oculus, acquired by Facebook),  British Business Bank Future Fund and a numbers of technology entrepreneurs and executives including Marcus Exall (Monese), Marcus Mosen (N26),  Paul Willmott (Lego Digital, McKinsey), Doug Scott (Redbrain), Matt Wilkins (Thought Machine), Andrew Cocker (Skyscanner), Steve Thomson (Redbrain), Monica Kalia (Neyber, Goldman Sachs), Doug Monro (Adzuna), Erik Nygard (Limejump). </p>
<p>Consumers will be able to invest in companies and supply chains that are focused on tackling climate change. It will be competing with similar startups in the space such as London-based Tickr (backed by $3m from Ada Ventures), Helios in Paris, and Yova in Zurich.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Duncan Grierson, CEO of Clim8 said in a statement: “We are launching at an exciting time for sustainable investing. 2020 was an exceptional year for environmentally-focused investment offerings, as investors looked harder at climate-related opportunities. Sustainable investments have continued to outperform markets since the beginning of the Covid-19 Crisis and we believe this will continue.”</p>
<p>Grierson has 20 years of experience in the green space and was a winner of the EY Entrepreneur of Year Cleantech award.</p>
<p>The startup will take advantage of new, higher EU rules around the disclosure requirements for sustainable investment funds. Users can choose between either stocks and shares ISAs (up to £20k) or a taxable general investment account.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The details for Ant’s overhaul have arrived. Ant Group, the fintech affiliate of Alibaba controlled by Jack Ma, will become a financial holding company that will bring more regulatory scrutiny over how it lends and generates profits, China&#8217;s central bank <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2021-04/12/c_1127321490.htm">said on Monday</a>.</p>
<p>Ant started as an online payments processor for Alibaba marketplaces and has over time blossomed into an empire of payments, lending, wealth management and insurance. Its encroachment onto the existing financial industry had not been particularly welcome in China and a few years ago, the giant began positioning itself as a &#8220;technology provider&#8221; rather than one competing with big banks and conventional wealth managers.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, the government wanted to further rein in the fintech giant.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As part of what the government dubs a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/27/ant-group-financial-clampdown/">&#8220;rectification plan&#8221; for Ant</a>, of which initial public offering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/03/china-postpones-ants-colossal-ipo-after-closed-door-talk-with-jack-ma/">was called off in November</a> as regulators sought to curb the power of the country&#8217;s internet giants, Ant will &#8220;correct its anti-competitive practices.&#8221; That entails giving consumers more options in payment methods and removing unscrupulous tricks that lure users into getting loans.</p>
<p>Ant, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/alibaba-ant-ipo/">over 1 billion annual users</a> around the world, most of whom are in China, is also asked to end its monopoly on user data and ensure the information safety of individuals and the nation.</p>
<p>As a financial holding company, Ant will also need to control the liquidity risk of its financial products and shrink the size of its money-market fund, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/tencent-vs-alibaba-ant-fintech/">one of the world&#8217;s biggest</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.memicmed.com/">Memic</a>, a startup developing a robotic-assisted surgical <a href="https://www.memicmed.com/hominis/">platform</a> that recently received <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-first-robotically-assisted-surgical-device-performing-transvaginal-hysterectomy">marketing authorization</a> from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, today announced that it has closed a $96 million Series D funding round. The round was led by Peregrine Ventures and Ceros, with participation from OurCrowd and Accelmed. The company plans to use the new funding to commercialize its platform in the U.S. and expand its marketing and sales efforts outside of the U.S., too.</p>
<p>The company previously raised a total amount of $31.8 million, according to Crunchbase, including about $12.5 million raised through crowdsourcing platform <a href="https://www.ourcrowd.com/companies/memic">OurCrowd</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.memicmed.com/hominis/">Hominis</a>, as the company calls its platform, has been authorized for use in &#8220;single site, natural orifice laparoscopic-assisted transvaginal benign surgical procedures including benign hysterectomy.&#8221; It&#8217;s worth noting that the robot doesn&#8217;t perform the surgery without human intervention. Instead, surgeons control the device &#8212; and its robotic arms &#8212; from a central console. The company notes that the instruments are meant to replicate the motions of the surgeon&#8217;s arms. And while it&#8217;s currently only authorized for this one specific type of procedure, Memic is looking at a wide range of other procedures where a system like this could be beneficial.</p>
<p class="m_-2276881737938356463MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">“The Hominis system represents a significant advancement in the growing multi-billion-dollar robotic surgery market. This financing positions us to accelerate our commercialization efforts and bring Hominis to both surgeons and patients in the months ahead,” said Dvir Cohen, co-founder and CEO of Memic.<u></u><u></u></span></p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that there are a wide range of similar, computer-assisted surgical systems on the market already. Only last month, <a href="https://asensus.com/">Asensus Surgical</a> received FDA clearance for its laparoscopic platform to be used in general surgery, for example. Meanwhile, eye surgery robotics startup ForSight recently raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/eye-surgery-robotics-startup-forsight-raises-10m/">$10 million</a> in seed funding for its platform.</p>
<p>Memic&#8217;s Hominis is the first robotic device approved for benign transvaginal procedures, though, and the company and its investors are surely betting on this being a first stepping stone to additional use cases over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the broad potential of Hominis combined with a strong management team, we are proud to support Memic and execution of its bold vision,&#8221; said Eyal Lifschitz, managing general partner of Peregrine Ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is reportedly working on a couple of new options for a renewed entry into the smart home, including a mash-up of the Apple TV with a HomePod speaker, and an integrated camera for video chat, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-working-on-combined-tv-box-speaker-to-revive-home-efforts?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;sref=gni836kR">according to Bloomberg</a>. It&#8217;s also said to be working on a smart speaker that basically combines a HomePod with an iPad, providing something similar to Amazon&#8217;s Echo Show or Google&#8217;s Nest Hub in functionality.</p>
<p>The Apple TV/HomePod hybrid would still connect to a television for outputting video, and would offer similar access to all the video and gaming services that the current Apple TV does, while the speaker component would provide sound output, music playback, and Siri integration. It would also include a built-in camera for using video conferencing apps on the TV itself, the report says.</p>
<p>That second device would be much more like existing smart assistant display devices on the market today, with an iPad-like screen providing integrated visuals. The project could involve attaching the iPad via a &#8220;robotic arm&#8221; according to Bloomberg, that would allow it to move to accommodate a user moving around, with the ability to keep them in frame during video chat sessions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Bloomberg doesn&#8217;t provide any specific timelines for release of any of these potential products, and it sounds like they&#8217;re still very much in the development phase, which means Apple could easily abandon these plans depending on its evaluation of their potential. Apple just recently discontinued its original HomePod, the $300 smart speaker it debuted in 2018.</p>
<p>Rumors abound about a refreshed Apple TV arriving sometime this year, which should boast a faster processor and also an updated remote control. It could bring other hardware improvements, like support for a faster 120Hz refresh rate available on more modern TVs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ecocart.io/">EcoCart</a>, a company pitching consumers on ways to offset their carbon emissions for free at select merchants (<a href="https://ecocart.io/extension/">with a browser extension!</a>) has raised $3 million in financing from Base10 Partners.</p>
<p>Brands pay the company a commission to drive traffic to their websites under a standard affiliate marketing model and EcoCart uses a portion of the proceeds to offset a shopper&#8217;s carbon emissions.</p>
<p>About 10,000 companies work with EcoCart, either through direct partnerships, or passive affiliate marketing services. EcoCart also offers a carbon accounting tool for businesses and an offsetting offering for them as well, according to co-founders Peter Twomey and Dane Baker.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The San Francisco-based startup uses services like <a href="https://climeco.com/">ClimeCo</a> and <a href="http://www.bluesource.com/">BlueSource</a> to source and aggregate offset projects that companies can finance.</p>
<p>The two co-founders, who met at the University of San Diego previously founded a startup called Toyroom, which rented outdoor equipment to customers in an effort to reduce unnecessary consumption.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We live this problem ourselves. We realized it was incredibly difficult to maintain this sustainability ethos,&#8221; Baker said. </span></p>
<p>While the browser extension sets EcoCart apart from other offsetting services like Cloverly, the company does share some functionality in its business-facing offering where<a href="https://ecocart.io/business/"> an option to offset the carbon associated with a purchase</a> is integrated directly into the checkout flow.</p>
<p>EcoCart launched its business-to-business integration in June of last year and now counts 500 vendors as customers. So far, about a quarter of customers have chosen to offset their purchases at checkout amounting to the capture of an estimated 25 million pounds of CO2, the company said.</p>
<p>Investors backing the company include Base 10 Partners; PopSugar co-founder, Brian Sugar&#8217;s early stage venture fund and angel investors like Ben Jabbaway, the founder of Privy; Rich Gardner, the VP of global partnerships at Klaviyo; Kyle Hency, the co-founder of Chubbie; Bryan Meehan, the chair of Blue Bottle Coffee; and Carly Strife, the co-founder of BarkBox.</p>
<p>While online shopping gets a bad reputation, it&#8217;s actually sometimes a greener option than shopping in physical stores, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00562-y">according to one study published in Nature last year</a>.</p>
<p>Consumer offsets, while well-meaning, don&#8217;t have nearly the same impact as having the companies themselves actually rein in their greenhouse gas emissions and decarbonize their operations. In fact, the whole notion of the consumer carbon footprint and the personal responsibility of consumers for planetary pollution was <a href="https://mashable.com/feature/carbon-footprint-pr-campaign-sham/">dreamed up by advertising executives at the behest of oil and gas and consumer goods companies pushing products</a>.</p>
<p>But something is better than nothing, and offsets do help necessary projects get funding.</p>
<p>EcoCart said it spent months developing a proprietary algorithm to calculate the carbon footprint of online orders. For both the e-commerce plugin and browser extension, EcoCart uses the characteristics of each order including material inputs to the item, shipping distance, and package weight to estimate the emissions created from that order, the company said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe EcoCart is reinventing how brands interact with their customers while also managing and addressing their environmental impact at scale,” said Chris Zeoli, Principal at Base10 Partners, in a statement. “EcoCart represents a solution that is helping reverse decades of harmful climate change. Base10 is proud to be partnering with the EcoCart founders as they continue to make carbon neutral shopping the new checkout standard for industries including retail, micromobility, food delivery, and more.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Starting this week, some Domino&#8217;s customers in Houston can have a pizza delivered without ever interacting with a human.</p>
<p>The pizza delivery giant said Monday it has partnered with autonomous delivery vehicle startup Nuro to allow select customers to have their pizzas dropped at their door via Nuro&#8217;s R2 robot.</p>
<p>“There is still so much for our brand to learn about the autonomous delivery space,&#8221; Dennis Maloney, Domino’s senior vice president and chief innovation officer said in a statement. &#8220;This program will allow us to better understand how customers respond to the deliveries, how they interact with the robot and how it affects store operations.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On certain days and times, customers ordering from the Woodland Heights store on the Domino&#8217;s website can request R2, which uses radar, 360-degree cameras and thermal imaging to direct its movement. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">They&#8217;ll get texts to let them know where the robot is and what PIN they&#8217;ll need to access their pizza via the bot&#8217;s touchscreen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Over the course of the pandemic, the contactless, autonomous food delivery industry has accelerated quickly, and Nuro is currently poised to become a leader in this space.</span></p>
<p>“Nuro’s mission is to better everyday life through robotics,&#8221; Dave Ferguson, Nuro co-founder and president, said in a statement. “We’re excited to introduce our autonomous delivery bots to a select set of Domino’s customers in Houston. We can’t wait to see what they think.”</p>

<p>This is the first time meals will be delivered by an electric, self-driving, occupant-less vehicle on the roads in Houston. Woodland Heights, which is mainly residential, is one of the oldest historic neighborhoods in Houston, flanked by the I-45 and I-10 highways. The Domino&#8217;s there is right on Houston Avenue, a main thoroughfare, making this a substantially challenging space in which to pilot this technology.</p>
<p>Nuro originally <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/17/dominos-will-start-delivering-pizzas-via-an-autonomous-robot-this-fall/">announced the Domino&#8217;s partnership and began testing in Houston in 2019</a>. That same year, the company began deploying its vehicles to transport Kroger groceries in Houston and Phoenix. At the end of 2020, it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/nuro-can-now-operate-and-charge-for-autonomous-delivery-services-in-california/">approved to begin testing on public roads in California</a>, delivering goods from partners like Walmart and CVS. Nuro is the first company to be granted regulatory approval by the U.S. Department of Transportation for a self-driving vehicle exemption.</p>
