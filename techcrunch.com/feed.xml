					<description><![CDATA[After the transaction is consummated, the startup will sport an anticipated equity valuation of $1.6 billion.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.brightmachines.com/">Bright Machines</a> is going public via a SPAC-led combination, it <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210517005272/en/Bright-Machines-a-Leader-in-Intelligent-Software-Defined-Manufacturing-to-Become-a-Public-Company-via-Merger-with-SCVX">announced</a> this morning. The transaction will see the 3-year-old company merge with SCVX, raising gross cash proceeds of $435 million in the process.</p>
<p>After the transaction is consummated, the startup will sport an anticipated equity valuation of $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>The Bright Machines news indicates that the great SPAC chill was not a deep freeze. And the transaction itself, in conjunction with the previously announced Desktop Metal blank-check deal, implies that there is space in the market for hardware startup liquidity via SPACs. Perhaps that will unlock more late-stage capital for hardware-focused upstarts.</p>
<p>Today we&#8217;re first looking at what Bright Machines does, and then the financial details that it shared as part of its news.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Bright Machines?</h2>
<p>Bright Machines is trying to solve a hard problem related to industrial automation by creating microfactories. This involves a complex mix of hardware, software and artificial intelligence. While robotics has been around in one form or another since the 1970s, for the most part, it has lacked real intelligence. Bright Machines wants to change that.</p>
<p>The company emerged in 2018 with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/23/bright-machines-lands-179m-to-bring-smarter-robotics-to-manufacturing/">a $179 million Series A</a>, a hefty amount of cash for a young startup, but the company has a bold vision and such a vision takes extensive funding. What it’s trying to do is completely transform manufacturing using machine learning.</p>
<p>At the time of that funding, the company brought in former Autodesk co-CEO Amar Hanspal as CEO and former Autodesk founder and CEO Carl Bass to sit on the company board of directors. AutoDesk itself has been trying to transform design and manufacturing in recent years, so it was logical to bring these two experienced leaders into the fold.</p>
<p>The startup’s thesis is that instead of having what are essentially “unintelligent” robots, it wants to add computer vision and a heavy dose of sensors to bring a data-driven automation approach to the factory floor.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.ankorstore.com">Ankorstore</a> has raised a $102 million Series B funding round (€84 million). Tiger Global and Bain Capital Ventures are leading today’s funding round with existing investors Index Ventures, GFC, Alven and Aglaé also participating. This is a significant funding round as it comes just a few months after the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/ankorstore-raises-29-9-million-for-its-wholesale-marketplace/">raised</a> €25 million.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Ankorstore, the company is building a wholesale marketplace for independent shop owners. You may have noticed some highly Instagrammable shops with a selection of random items, such as household supplies, maple syrup, candles, headbands, bath salts and stationery items.</p>
<p>Essentially, Ankorstore helps you source those items for shop owners. It lets you buy a ton of cutesy stuff and act as a curator for your customers. Even if you’re already working with brands directly, the startup offers some advantageous terms. In addition to buying from several brands at once, Ankorstore withdraws the money from your bank account 60 days after placing an order.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the other side of the marketplace, brands get paid upon delivery. Even if you’re just getting started, the minimum first order is €100 per brand.</p>
<p>And metrics have been going up and to the right. There are now 5,000 brands on Ankorstore. 50,000 shops are buying stuff through the platform. And the best is likely ahead as stores begin to re-open across Europe and tourism picks up again.</p>
<p>Ankorstore is now live across 14 different markets. The majority of the company’s revenue comes from international markets — not its home market France. The company’s co-founder Nicolas Cohen mentions the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden as growth markets.</p>
<p>The total addressable market is huge as the company has identified 800,000 independent shops across Europe that could potentially work with Ankorstore. And the success of other wholesale marketplaces, such as <a href="https://www.faire.com">Faire</a>, proves that this relatively new market is still largely untapped.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab may have experienced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/15/rocket-labs-20th-electron-launch-ends-in-failure-with-the-loss-of-its-payload/">mission failure and total payload loss</a> during the company’s 20th planned mission on May 15, but it wasn&#8217;t all bad news, the company said in an update Monday.</p>
<p>Importantly, the Electron rocket’s first stage – which contain nine Rutherford engines – performed as designed and did not contribute to the flight failure. Rocket Lab further said the first stage completed a successful ocean splashdown using a parachute and that the company was able to retrieve it, and bring it back to its production complex.</p>
<p>Rocket Lab was also testing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/rocket-lab-prepares-to-recover-second-booster-at-sea-after-may-15-launch/">redesigned heat shield</a> on this mission made out of stainless steel, rather than aluminum, and that also seemed to function well. Testing these reusability system elements was a secondary objective here, since the primary goal is always to deliver the payloads of paying customers, but ultimately reusability could be absolutely crucial to the company&#8217;s long-term business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“The new heat shield debuted in this flight protected the stage from the intense heat and forces experienced while re-entering Earth’s atmosphere and the program took yet another major advancement towards reusability of the rocket,” the company said Monday.</p>
<p>This is great news for Rocket Lab’s reusability program, as the first stage and engines can be examined and evaluated for further reflight trials on future missions. The company still intends on conducting its third recovery mission later this year. Rocket Lab said it was leading flight review of the May 15 mission failure with the support of the Federal Aviation Administration and anticipates the full review to be complete in the coming weeks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every branch of science is increasingly reliant on big data sets and analysis, which means a growing confusion of formats and platforms — more than inconvenient, this can hinder the process of peer review and replication of research. <a href="https://codeocean.com/">Code Ocean</a> hopes to make it easier for scientists to collaborate by making a flexible, shareable format and platform for any and all datasets and methods, and it has raised a total of $21M to build it out.</p>
<p>Certainly there&#8217;s an air of &#8220;Too many options? Try this one!&#8221; to this (and here&#8217;s the requisite <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">relevant XKCD</a>). But Code Ocean isn&#8217;t creating a competitor to successful tools like Jupyter or Gitlab or Docker — it&#8217;s more of a small-scale container platform that lets you wrap up all the necessary components of your data and analysis in an easily shared format, whatever platform they live on natively.</p>
<p>The trouble appears when you need to share what you&#8217;re doing with another researcher, whether they&#8217;re on the bench next to you or at a university across the country. It&#8217;s important for replication purposes that data analysis — just like any other scientific technique — be done exactly the same way. But there&#8217;s no guarantee that your colleague will use the same structures, formats, notation, labels, and so on.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s <em>impossible</em> to share your work, but it does add a lot of extra steps as would-be replicators or iterators check and double check that all the methods are the same, that the same versions of the same tools are being used in the same order, with the same settings, and so on. A tiny inconsistency can have major repercussions down the road.</p>
<p>Turns out this problem is similar in a way to how many cloud services are spun up. Software deployments can be as finicky as scientific experiments, and one solution to this is containers, which like tiny virtual machines include everything needed to accomplish a computing task, in a portable format compatible with many different setups. The idea is a natural one to transfer to the research world, where you can tie up the data, the software used, and the specific techniques and processes used to reach a given result all in one tidy package. That, at least, is the pitch Code Ocean offers for its platform and &#8220;Compute Capsules.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/capsule-shape.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2153059" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/capsule-shape.png" alt="Diagram showing how a &quot;compute capsule&quot; includes code, environment, and data." width="918" height="656" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/capsule-shape.png 918w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/capsule-shape.png?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/capsule-shape.png?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/capsule-shape.png?resize=768,549 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/capsule-shape.png?resize=680,486 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/capsule-shape.png?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 918px) 100vw, 918px" /></a></p>
<p>Say you&#8217;re a microbiologist looking at the effectiveness of a promising compound on certain muscle cells. You&#8217;re working in R, writing in RStudio on a Ubuntu machine, and your data are such and such collected during an in vitro observation. While you would naturally declare all this when you publish, there&#8217;s no guarantee anyone has an Ubuntu laptop with a working Rstudio setup around, so even if you provide all the code it might be for nothing.</p>
<p><a href="https://codeocean.com/resources/blog/rna-seq-capsule/">If however you put it on Code Ocean, like this</a>, it makes all the relevant code available, and capable of being inspected and run unmodified with a click, or being fiddled with if a colleague is wondering about a certain piece. It works through a single link and web app, cross platform, and can even be embedded on a webpage like a document or video. (I&#8217;m going to try to do that below, but our backend is a little finicky. The capsule itself is <a href="https://codeocean.com/capsule/2520679/tree/v1">here</a>.)</p>
<p><script src="https://codeocean.com/widget.js?slug=2520679" async></script></p>
<p>More than that, though, the Compute Capsule can be repurposed by others with new data and modifications. Maybe the technique you put online is a general purpose RNA sequence analysis tool that works as long as you feed it properly formatted data, and that&#8217;s something others would have had to code from scratch in order to take advantage of some platforms.</p>
<p>Well, they can just clone your capsule, run it with their own data, and get their own results in addition to verifying your own. This can be done via the Code Ocean website or just by downloading a zip file of the whole thing and getting it running on their own computer, if they happen to have a compatible setup. A few more example capsules can be found <a href="https://codeocean.com/resources/blog/category/compute-capsules/">here</a>.</p>

<p>This sort of cross-pollination of research techniques is as old as science, but modern data-heavy experimentation often ends up siloed because it can&#8217;t easily be shared and verified even though the code is technically available. That means other researchers move on, build their own thing, and further reinforce the silo system.</p>
<p>Right now there are about 2,000 public compute capsules on Code Ocean, most of which are associated with a published paper. Most have also been used by others, either to replicate or try something new, and some, like ultra-specific open source code libraries, have been used by thousands.</p>
<p>Naturally there are security concerns when working with proprietary or medically sensitive data, and the enterprise product allows the whole system to run on a private cloud platform. That way it would be more of an internal tool, and at major research institutions that in itself could be quite useful.</p>
<p>Code Ocean hopes that by being as inclusive as possible in terms of codebases, platforms, compute services and so on will make for a more collaborative environment at the cutting edge.</p>
<p>Clearly that ambition is shared by others, as the the company has raised $21M so far, $6M of which was in previously undisclosed investments and $15M in an A round announced today. The A round was led by Battery Ventures, with Digitalis Ventures, EBSCO, and Vaal Partners participating as well as numerous others.</p>
<p>The money will allow the company to further develop, scale, and promote its platform. With luck they&#8217;ll soon find themselves among the rarefied air often breathed by this sort of savvy SaaS — necessary, deeply integrated, and profitable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Los Angeles-based electric vehicle startup Canoo is bringing its first vehicle to market next year. The company said Monday its electric microbus-slash-van will be available to buy in 2022 at a base price of $34,750 before tax incentives or add-ons. It’s now taking preorders in the United States for the “lifestyle” vehicle, as well as for its round-top pickup truck and multi-purpose delivery van.</p>
<p>While Canoo did not release pricing for the other two vehicles, it did said that deliveries for the pickup and production for the delivery van are slated to start as early as 2023. Customers can reserve a model by placing a $100 deposit per vehicle with the company.</p>
<p>The lifestyle van will come in four trims, including base, premium, adventure and so-called Lifestyle Vehicle Delivery The adventure variant, which is the top trim and comes with more ground clearance and beefier profile, does not yet have a price. The base, delivery (not to be confused with the bigger multipurpose delivery van) and premium models will be priced up to $49,950, the company said. The company said the lifestyle van is expected to be able to produce 300 hp and 332 pound-feet of torque with 250 miles of battery range.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Canoo is taking a different route than many other electric vehicle manufacturers. The company&#8217;s trio of vehicles all have the same proprietary “skateboard” platform architecture that houses the batteries and electric drivetrain in a chassis that sits under the vehicle’s cabin. This contributes to a similar design language between the vehicles, which all have the same wide front windshield and relatively low profile.</p>
<p>The company is especially deviating from competitors with its electric pickup, which is scheduled to go into production in early 2023. As opposed to rivals Ford and Rivian, which are emphasizing size and power in their respective F-150 Lighting and R1T pickup trucks, Canoo’s is smaller and more playful-looking. The Rivian R1T clocks in at 218 inches long, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/canoo-combines-work-and-play-in-its-new-electric-pickup-truck/">while the Canoo truck will be 184 inches</a>. Canoo is also claiming a battery range of 200+ miles, far less than the 300+ boasted by other EV truck manufacturers. None of these companies have posted what the range will be when towing.</p>
<p>Canoo has undergone many transformations since its founding as Evelozcity in 2017. It was rebranded as Canoo in 2019 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/18/electric-vehicle-startup-canoo-to-go-public-via-spac/">merged with special purpose acquisition company</a> Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. last December with a market valuation of $2.4 billion.</p>
<p>This year has been a bit bumpier for the company. The news on Monday comes less than a month after the company announced the resignations of its co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz and its general counsel Andrew Wolstan. Earlier this year, the company also lost its chief financial officer Paul Balciunas and its head of powertrain development.</p>
<p>Canoo’s skateboard architecture caught the eye of automaker Hyundai Motor Group, which last February said it would jointly develop an EV with Canoo based on the skateboard design. But during an investor call in March, Tony Aquila, who took over as company CEO following Kranz’s departure, said the deal was all but dead.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Once a fringe feature found only in luxury vehicles, voice recognition has moved into the mainstream as more automakers promise a seamless connection between your car, home and all the devices in between. The opportunity to reach consumers in their vehicles — and collect all that data — has automakers, tech giants like Amazon and Google, as well as investors scrambling for a share of the connected cars market.</p>
<p>But this is just the beginning. Voice recognition is expected to be an essential feature in future autonomous vehicles, which will see drivers ultimately surrendering the ability to control the car mechanically. Other applications for voice recognition are also emerging, including automated drones, two-wheelers and even air taxis.</p>

			Voice recognition is expected to be an essential feature in future autonomous vehicles, which will see drivers ultimately surrendering the ability to control the car mechanically.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The upshot? A market with significant growth potential and opportunities for investors and companies of all sizes.</p>
<h2>The opportunity</h2>
<p>The share of cars featuring in-car connected services, which voice recognition requires, grew to 45% in 2020 from 30% in 2018, and is expected to reach 60% by 2024, according to IHS Markit. Automakers keen to improve the consumer experience are driving that growth, said Kyle Davis, IHS Markit&#8217;s senior analyst for vehicle experience and connected car, noting that &#8220;one of the biggest aspects of the user experience is voice.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The global pandemic made some industries and utterly decimated others. The world of connected fitness falls firmly into the former. Along with top names like Peloton, Mirror had a banner year, including, most notably, sportwear company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/lululemon-set-to-acquire-home-fitness-startup-mirror-for-500m/">Lululemon’s acquisition of the brand</a> for $500 million in June.</p>
<p>It’s an impressive number for the five-year-old company, which came out of stealth at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2018. Three years later, CEO Brynn Putnam will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?promo=mirrorpost">return to the Disrupt stage on September 21-23</a> to chart how the company grew from a small-scale startup to one of the leading names in a home fitness industry that saw a massive surge over the past year and a half.</p>

<p>A former ballerina and founder of New York fitness chain Refine Method, Putnam’s career has been a fascinating one &#8212; up to and including her time at Mirror. We’ll discuss how the company embraced a boom in connected fitness, why the time was right for acquisition and what the landscape for the industry will look like going forward.</p>
<p>Stay at home orders have had a profound impact on the way we get fit, leading many frequent gym goers to embrace high-tech, at-home methods.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX successfully launched another 52 Starlink internet broadband satellites into orbit on Saturday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/spacex-launches-and-lands-a-falcon-9-rocket-booster-a-record-10th-time/">less than one week</a> after it sent up the last batch. A small satellite from startup Capella Space and a Tyvak observation satellite also hitched a ride on the launch, which took off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Saturday evening.</p>
<p>The launch used a veteran Falcon 9 booster that’s seen seven previous launch and landings, including during three Starlink missions. It departed from its launch pad at 6:56 PM ET (3:56 PM PT) and returned to Earth approximately nine minutes later. The rocket landed vertically on SpaceX’s autonomous drone ship “Of Course I Still Love You” in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>The launch company has now sent more than 530 Starlink satellites to space since March, and all of them on reused rockets. Reusability is a key factor toward making the launches as cost-effective as possible, a factor that is especially important as SpaceX is both the launch provider and customer of the Starlink service. As a consequence, SpaceX has been able to rapidly accelerate its Starlink launch program, with 28 launches under its belt so far. At least one additional launch is likely in the works for later this month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company said earlier this month that it had received <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/spacex-launches-60-more-starlink-satellites-claims-over-500000-service-pre-orders-so-far/">“over half a million”</a> pre-order reservations for Starlink broadband service so far. Starlink is available in beta to customers in six countries: Australia, New Zealand, the U.S., the United Kingdom, Mexico and Canada. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said the company aims to have its low Earth orbit broadband internet network operational across nearly the entire globe as early as the end of 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.merge.dev/">Merge</a>, a startup that helps its users build customer-facing integrations with third-party tools, today announced that it has raised a $4.5 million seed round led by NEA. Additional angel investors include former MuleSoft CEO Greg Schott, Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince, Expanse co-founders Tim Junio and Matt Kraning, and Jumpstart CEO Ben Herman.</p>
<p>Launched in 2020, the core focus of Merge is to give B2B companies a unified API to access data from what is currently about 40 HR, payroll, recruiting and accounting platforms, with plans for expanding to additional areas soon. But Merge co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shensiding/">Shensi Ding</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilfeig/">Gil Feig</a>, who have been lifelong friends and previously worked at companies like Expanse and Jumpstart, stress that the service isn&#8217;t aiming to replace workflow tools Workato or Zapier.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2152875" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Linking-Flow-Menu-Selection.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2152875" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2152875" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Linking-Flow-Menu-Selection.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="751" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Linking-Flow-Menu-Selection.jpg 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Linking-Flow-Menu-Selection.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Linking-Flow-Menu-Selection.jpg?resize=300,220 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Linking-Flow-Menu-Selection.jpg?resize=768,563 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Linking-Flow-Menu-Selection.jpg?resize=680,499 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Linking-Flow-Menu-Selection.jpg?resize=1536,1126 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Linking-Flow-Menu-Selection.jpg?resize=2048,1502 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Linking-Flow-Menu-Selection.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2152875" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Merge</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;What we built is more similar to Plaid than MuleSoft or other things,&#8221; Feig said. &#8220;We built a unified API, so we&#8217;re fully embedded in a customer&#8217;s product and they build one integration with us and can automatically offer all these integrations to their customers. On top of that, we offer what we call integrations management, which is a suite of tools to automatically detect issues where the customer would have to get involved &#8212; automatically detect that stuff and handle it without ever having to involve engineering again.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Merge&#8217;s systems detect issues with an integration, maybe because a data schema in an API response has changed without notice (which happens with some regularity), Merge&#8217;s engineers can fix that within minutes, in part because the teams also built an internal no-code tool for building and managing these integrations.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2152874" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Log.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2152874" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2152874" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Log.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="750" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Log.jpg 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Log.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Log.jpg?resize=300,220 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Log.jpg?resize=768,562 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Log.jpg?resize=680,498 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Log.jpg?resize=1536,1124 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Log.jpg?resize=2048,1499 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Log.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2152874" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Merge</p></div></p>
<p>As Ding also noted, B2B buyers today also simply expect their tools to feature integrations with the service they use. &#8220;Companies, when they purchase a vendor, they expect that vendor to have integrations with all the other vendors that they own,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They don&#8217;t want to have to purchase a vendor and then purchase a workflow product and then connect those products.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while Merge&#8217;s focus right now is squarely on a few verticals, the plan is to expand this to far more areas shortly, likely starting with CRM. &#8220;Salesforce has a pretty large market share, so we thought that it wasn&#8217;t going to be as interesting of a market,&#8221; Ding said. &#8220;But it turns out that their API is so complex that customers would still prefer to integrate with us instead if we simplify it for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ding and Feig tell me the company, which came out of stealth about two months ago, already has about 100 organizations on its platform, varying from seed-stage companies to publicly listed enterprises. The team credits its focus on security and reliability (and its SOC II compliance) with being able to bring on some of these larger companies despite being a seed-stage company itself.</p>
<p>To monetize the service, Merge offers a free tier (up to 10,000 API requests per month) and charges $0.01 per API request for additional usage. Unsurprisingly, the company also offers customized enterprise plans for its larger customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The time and expense associated with building and maintaining myriad API integrations is a pain point we hear about consistently from our portfolio companies across all industries,&#8221; said NEA managing general partner Scott Sandell, who will join the company&#8217;s board. &#8220;Merge is tackling this ubiquitous problem head-on via their easy-to-use, unified API platform. Their platform has broad applicability and is a massive upgrade for any software company that needs to build, manage, and maintain multiple API integrations.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Art </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Agrawal was growing up in India, a car ride was a rare treat, and car ownership was a dream. When he moved to the U.S. and bought his first car, he was shocked by how much it cost and how difficult it was to maintain a car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2012, he co-founded a company called YourMechanic (and won TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/12/techcrunch-disrupt-sf-2012-winner/">Disrupt</a> that year) that provides on-demand </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">automotive mobile maintenance and repair services. Over the years, the challenge of helping consumers more easily find car insurance was in the back of his mind. So in 2017, he teamed up with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lina Zhang</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Musawir Shah</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to found Jerry, a mobile-first car ownership “super app.” The Palo Alto-based startup launched a car insurance comparison service using artificial intelligence and machine learning in January 2019. It has quietly since amassed nearly 1 million customers across the United States as a licensed insurance broker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Today as a consumer, you have to go to multiple different places to deal with different things,” Agrawal said. “Jerry is out to change that.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And now today, <a href="http://getjerry.com">Jerry</a> is announcing that it has raised more than $57 million in funding, including a new $28 million Series B round led by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goodwater Capital. A group of angel investors also participated in the round, including Greenlight president Johnson Cook and Greenlight CEO Timothy Sheehan; Tekion CEO Jay Vijayan; Jon McNeill, CEO of DVx Ventures and former president of Tesla and ex-COO of Lyft; Brandon Krieg, CEO of Stash and Ed Robinson, co-founder and president of Stash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Agrawal says Jerry is different from other auto-related marketplaces out there in that it aims to help consumers with various aspects of car ownership (from repair to maintenance to insurance to warranties), rather than just one. Although for now it is mostly focused on insurance, it plans to use its new capital to move into other categories of car ownership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also believes it is set apart from competitors in that it doesn’t refer a consumer to an insurance carrier’s site so that they still have to do the work of signing up with them separately, for example. Rather, Jerry uses automation to give consumers customized quotes from more than 45 insurance carriers “in 45 seconds.” The consumers can then sign on to the new carrier via Jerry, which would even cancel former policies on their behalf.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With Jerry, you can complete the whole transaction in our app,” Agrawal said. “We don’t send you to another site. You don’t have to fill out a bunch of forms. You just give us some information, and we’ll instantly provide you with quotes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its customers save on average about $800 a year on car insurance, the company claims. Jerry also offers a similar offering for home insurance but its focus is on car ownership.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company must be doing something right. In 2020, Jerry saw its revenue surge by “10x.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some context, Jerry sold a few million dollars of insurance in 2019, according to Agrawal. This year, he said, the company is on track to do “three to four times” more than last year’s numbers.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no other automated way to compare and buy car insurance, because all the APIs are not easily accessible,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What we have done is we have automated the end to end journey for the consumer using our infrastructure, which will only scale over time.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jerry makes recurring revenue from earning a percentage of the premium when a consumer purchases a policy on its site from carriers such as Progressive.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the marketplaces are lead-gen. A very small percent of their revenue is reoccurring,&#8221; Agrawal said. &#8220;For us, it&#8217;s 100% of our revenues.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goodwater Capital’s Chi-Hua Chien notes that the insurance space has historically been a very challenging category from a customer experience perspective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“They took something that has historically been painful, intimidating and difficult for the customer and made it effortless,” he told TechCrunch. “That experience will more broadly over time apply to comparison shopping and maintenance, too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chien said he was also drawn to the category itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a competitive category because 100% of drivers need to have auto insurance 100% of the time,” he said. “That’s a large market that’s not going to go away. And since Jerry is powered by AI, it will only serve customers better over time, and just grow faster.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The countdown to this IPO filing has been ticking for several quarters, so seeing the document drop on a Monday morning was just good fun.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At long last, the Monday.com crew dropped <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1845338/000110465921067423/tm211978-4_f1.htm">an F-1 filing</a> to go public in the United States. TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/02/kicking-off-2020-with-4-new-members-of-the-100m-arr-club/">long known</a> that the company, which sells corporate productivity and communications software, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/25/monday-com-surpassed-130m-arr-before-the-remote-work-boom/">scaled north of $100 million</a> in annual recurring revenue (ARR).</p>
<p>The countdown to its IPO filing &#8212; an F-1, because the company is based in Israel, rather than the S-1s filed by domestic companies &#8212; has been ticking for several quarters, so seeing Monday.com drop the document on this Monday morning was just good fun.</p>

<p>The Exchange has been riffling through the document since it came out, and we&#8217;ve picked up on a few things to explore. We&#8217;ll start by looking at the company&#8217;s revenue growth on a historical basis to see if it has accelerated in recent quarters thanks to the pandemic. Then, we&#8217;ll turn to profitability, cash burn, share-based compensation expenses and product vision.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a lot to chew through, so no more dilly-dallying. Into the numbers!</p>
<p>As always, we&#8217;re starting with revenue growth because it&#8217;s still the single most important thing about any venture-backed company.</p>
<h2>Revenue adds are accelerating</h2>
<p>This is great news for the startup, its employees and its investors. From 2019 to 2020, Monday.com grew its revenues from $78.1 million to $161.1 million, or 106%.</p>
<p>From Q1 2020 to Q1 2021, the company&#8217;s revenues grew from $31.9 million to $59.0 million. That&#8217;s about 85% growth. So, by what measure do we mean that the company&#8217;s revenue growth is accelerating? Its sequential-quarter revenue growth is picking up. Observe the following:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2152833" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2152833" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2152833 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-17-at-9.58.13-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="283" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-17-at-9.58.13-AM.png 733w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-17-at-9.58.13-AM.png?resize=150,62 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-17-at-9.58.13-AM.png?resize=300,125 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-17-at-9.58.13-AM.png?resize=680,283 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-17-at-9.58.13-AM.png?resize=50,21 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2152833" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Monday.com F-1 filing</p></div></p>
<p>From Q2 2019 to Q3 2019, the company added around $4 million in revenue. From Q2 2020 to Q3 2020, that number was $6.1 million. More recently, the company&#8217;s revenue added $7.6 million from Q3 2020 to Q4 2020, which accelerated to $8.8 million from the final quarter of 2020 to the first quarter of 2021. Of course, from an ever-larger base, the company&#8217;s growth rate may decline. But the super-clean and obvious <em>expanding</em> sequential revenue gains at the company are solid.</p>
<p>The fact that it added so much top line in recent quarters also helps explain why Monday.com is going public now. Sure, the markets are still near record highs and the pandemic is fading, but just look at that consistent growth! It&#8217;s investor catnip.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hello and welcome back to The Station, a weekly newsletter dedicated to all the ways people and packages move (today and in the future) from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a crypto-meets-transportation story for you before we move on to the rest of the news.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Just weeks after Tesla CEO Elon Musk and CFO Zach Kirkhorn said they believe in the longevity of bitcoin, the company has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/elon-musk-technoking-of-tesla-orders-a-halt-to-bitcoin-car-payments/">changed its stance</a>. Musk, who has dubbed himself Technoking, tweeted that Tesla has suspended purchases of its electric vehicles with the cryptocurrency because of its concern about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels (especially coal) for bitcoin mining and transactions.</p>
<p>The tweet from Musk sent the price of bitcoin down. Ah, but wait, the crazy hijinks were just getting started. Musk&#8217;s tweet was clear that while bitcoin was out, other cryptocurrencies were in. &#8220;We are also looking at other cryptocurrencies that use &lt;1% of Bitcoin&#8217;s energy/transaction,&#8221; the tweet said. Anyone who has followed Musk&#8217;s cheerleading of Dogecoin could have predicted what would come next. On May 13, Musk tweeted &#8220;Working with Doge devs to improve system transaction efficiency. Potentially promising.&#8221;</p>
<p>So there you have it. Perhaps, Dogecoin — which Musk jokingly called a hustle on SNL — will soon be Tesla&#8217;s crypto of choice.</p>

<p>The big micromobility news of the past week is that <strong>Bird</strong>, the shared electric scooter startup that&#8217;s scootin&#8217; around in more than 200 cities across three continents, is going public via a SPAC. Bird is merging with blank-check company Switchback II in an attempt to get cash fast and achieve profitability by 2023, confirming earlier reports from dot.LA after the website had gotten its hands on Bird&#8217;s investor pitch deck.</p>
<p>Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company will lead the deal&#8217;s $160 million in private investment in public equity, with Apollo Investment Corp. and MidCap Financial Trust chucking in another $40 million in asset financing.</p>
<p>The SPAC deck reveals that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/bird-rides-spac-filing-shows-scooter-nomics-just-doesnt-fly/">Bird lost $387.5 million</a> in 2019 and $208.2 million in 2020, even as it laid off 400 people in 2020. As a company with a huge cost structure and unprofitable revenue, which was made more unprofitable as the pandemic took its toll, Bird really needs this deal to work. Shifting business models may be just the thing. Buying up scooter fleets and deploying them around the world is simply too costly to work. Its move to go &#8220;franchise&#8221; and get other smaller companies to build fleets under its brand name during the pandemic generated 94% of its &#8220;sharing&#8221; revenue in the second half of 2020. So maybe there&#8217;s hope for the company after all. It&#8217;ll certainly need it if it intends to sustain its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/bird-to-spend-150-million-on-european-expansion-plan/">expansion into Europe</a> in the coming years.</p>
<h3>Speaking of expansion &#8230;</h3>
<p>Singapore&#8217;s Neuron Mobility, the e-scooter sharing company that&#8217;s taken off in Australia and New Zealand, has announced plans to expand its reach deeper into the Commonwealth. Neuron recently won a contract to operate in Ottawa, so it&#8217;ll be heading to Canada in the coming month, with more cities in the country to come, according to the company. The company will give out free monthly passes to eligible Public Health and Emergency Service workers in the Canadian capital.</p>
<h3>Meanwhile in Africa</h3>
<p>Uganda-based, two-wheel ride-hailing platform SafeBoda announced that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/the-motorcycle-ride-hailing-wars-in-nigeria-and-uganda-is-safebodas-to-lose/">completed 1 million rides</a> in the Nigerian city of Ibadan. For reference, boda-bodas in Uganda, or okadas in Nigeria, are local motorcycle taxis, so SafeBoda is disrupting this offline market while also leading ahead of the big guns like uberBODA and Bolt boda. Given the money and reputation behind Uber and Bolt, it&#8217;s somewhat surprising, and heartening, to see SafeBoda outstripping its competition. The company completes about 80,000 rides a day in Uganda; Uber and Bolt only complete about 10,000 rides in the country.</p>

<h3>New product roundup</h3>
<p>Stromer&#8217;s new e-bike, the <a href="https://www.stromerbike.com/en/models/st2">ST2 S-Pedelec</a>, comes at a steep price of $5,699, but it&#8217;s got some serious power behind it. With a 750-watt rear-wheel CYRO motor and a 618kWh battery, it can go up to 28 mph and up to 75 miles in range. If someone steals the bike, 3G and Bluetooth connection has got you covered with GPS localization and Smartlock. And it comes in sport or comfort frames in royal blue or dark grey.</p>
<p>Razor scooter, those iconic early 2000s silver fold-up legends, has unveiled its new RipStik Rush, the electric RipStik 2.0. Sportier riders who like to flex their moves will love this scooter because the back end of the board allows you to fishtail, carve and drift like you would with a snowboard or wakeboard, according to the company. Razor will also be bringing their C25 e-scooter, which is more geared toward the daily commuter, to retail this summer.</p>

<p>Last year, we saw nearly two dozen transportation startups go public via a merger with special purpose acquisition companies. Most of those were electric vehicle and lidar companies. This year, we are starting to see other transportation-related companies, including autonomous trucking startup TuSimple and now <strong>Plus AI</strong>.</p>
<p>Plus announced this week plans to merge with Hennessy Capital Investment Corp. V in a transaction with a post-combination valuation of $3.3 billion. Plus is expected to trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol &#8220;PLAV.&#8221; The transaction is supported by $150 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE, from funds and accounts managed by BlackRock and the D. E. Shaw Group.</p>
<p>The company said the capital provided by the public market will help it begin mass production of its so-called PlusDrive autonomous vehicle platform in 2021 with heavy-truck manufacturer FAW. Plus is also working with IVECO to jointly develop autonomous trucks that will be deployed across China, Europe and other geographies, the company said.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Clarios</strong>, the Wisconsin-based battery maker that was acquired by Brookfield Asset Management in 2019, filed confidentially for an IPO, <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/brookfield-is-said-to-pick-bofa-jpmorgan-for-clarios-ipo">Bloomberg reported</a>. Brookfield reportedly is seeking to have the portfolio company valued at more than $20 billion in an IPO.</p>
<p><strong>ForU Worldwide</strong>, the Chinese freight-as-a-service transportation platform, filed for a<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1849633/000119312521160307/d935463df1.htm"> $100 million IPO</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Innovusion</strong>, a five-year-old lidar company and a supplier to Chinese electric car upstart Nio, just landed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/innovusion-64-millions-series-b/">Series B funding round of $64 million</a>. The new proceeds boost its total investment to more than $100 million. As TechCrunch&#8217;s Rita Liao notes, this is not a small amount, but the startup is in a race crowded with much bigger players that have raised hundreds of millions of dollars, like Velodyne and Luminar. Temasek, the Singaporean government&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund, led Innovusion&#8217;s latest financing round. Other investors included Bertelsmann Asia Investment Fund, Joy Capital, Nio Capital, Eight Roads Ventures and F-Prime Capital.</p>

<p><strong>Telkomsel</strong>, a unit of Indonesia&#8217;s largest telecom operator Telkom, invested an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/09/telkomsel-invests-an-additional-300-million-in-gojek/">additional $300 million</a> in ride-hailing and payments firm Gojek. The investment comes just months after the network provider wrote a $150 million check to the Southeast Asian firm. The announcement comes amid Gojek working to seal a proposed merger with e-commerce platform Tokopedia. The $18 billion deal would result in a new entity called GoTo, according to media reports. Telkomsel&#8217;s investment today likely makes it one of GoTo&#8217;s top eight investors.</p>
<p><strong>WeRide</strong>, the Chinese autonomous driving company, said it has achieved its Series C funding round that brings its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/chinas-weride-secures-more-funding-pushing-valuation-to-3-3-billion/">post-money valuation to $3 billion</a>. The round, which WeRide declined to provide details on beyond saying that it is in &#8220;the hundreds of millions,&#8221; comes  four months after securing Series B fundraising of $310 million. WeRide intends to use this funding round to invest in R&amp;D and commercialization as it works toward the next-generation of Level 4 driving, a term that means a vehicle can drive without human intervention in some environments and conditions. The company is also using the funds to prepare to commercialize its technology.</p>

<p>Waymo&#8217;s PR team most certainly had a busy week.</p>
<p>First up is an article from me on the departure of Waymo&#8217;s chief financial officer Ger Dwyer and its head of automotive partnerships and corporate development Adam Frost &#8212; two longtime executives at the autonomous vehicle company.</p>
<p>The exits come amid some executive shuffling following CEO John Krafcik&#8217;s exit earlier this year. Krafcik announced in April that he was stepping down as CEO. Chief Safety Officer Deborah Hersman left in December and Tim Willis, who was head of manufacturing and global supply and general manager of Waymo&#8217;s Laser Bear lidar business, departed in February. Sherry House, who had been at Waymo since 2017 and was most recently treasurer and head of investor relations, left the company in April. She is now CFO at Lucid Motors.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/waymos-cfo-and-head-of-automotive-partnerships-are-leaving-the-autonomous-vehicle-company/">I noted in my article</a>, some of the critical leaders, and the people directly below them, have remained. Tekedra Mawakana, who was COO, and Dmitri Dolgov, the CTO, are now co-CEOs of Waymo. Department heads directly below Mawakana and Dolgov are still at Waymo, with a few exceptions, according to LinkedIn profiles. In March, both David Twohig, who was director of Future Automotive at Waymo, and Qi Hommes, who was once head of system safety, left. Hommes is now director of system safety engineering and analysis at Zoox, according to LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Changes at the top oftentimes cause a ripple effect of shuffling positions and even exits. Expect more in the weeks and months to come.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a <a href="https://youtu.be/zdKCQKBvH-A">video was released</a> by a regular user of the company&#8217;s Waymo One ride-hailing service, which uses a mix of driverless vehicles and those with a safety operator behind the wheel. This individual captured the entire trip, which devolved into a suboptimal situation when the vehicle entered into a work zone with construction cones. The vehicle became confused and essentially paralyzed. Waymo then stepped in remotely to send path planning instructions, but then sent incorrect guidance, which compounded the problem. Eventually, a roadside assistance team physically arrived and completed the trip.</p>
<p>The incident is a reminder of how much work still needs to be done in autonomous vehicles. It also illustrates just how many humans it takes to support one driverless vehicle on the road. Expect more incidents like this across the industry. On a side note, rival Cruise <a href="https://twitter.com/Cruise/status/1393302375994064896?s=20">tweeted out a video</a> showing its vehicle navigating a construction zone. I&#8217;m sure the timing was completely coincidental.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m back with more policy news. This week, let&#8217;s kick things off with the U.S. Postal Service.</p>
<p>You might remember that in February, the U.S. Postal Service awarded a multibillion-dollar contract to OshKosh Corp. to replace between 50,000 to 165,000 aging trucks with a mix of diesel and electric powertrain delivery vehicles over the next 10 years. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy later specified to Congress that only around 10% of those new delivery trucks would be electric, a number that many in Washington and beyond argued was not high enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lack of commitment from the USPS to electrify its fleet directly contradicts the Biden administration&#8217;s goals and executive order to clean up pollution from the U.S. government&#8217;s vehicles,&#8221; said Gina Coplon-Newfield, the director of the Sierra Club&#8217;s Clean Transportation for All campaign.</p>
<p>Now, House lawmakers are <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3077?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22HR+3077%22%5D%7D&amp;s=6&amp;r=1">advancing a bill</a> that would, in part, authorize an additional $8 billion for the U.S. Postal Service to switch to electric vehicles. The language adding the funds was tacked onto a bill to improve mailed ballot tracking. Given that President Joe Biden said back in January that he is committed to replacing the federal government&#8217;s fleet of around 650,000 vehicles with electric models, it was definitely more than a little odd that USPS picked a mixed diesel-electric bid less than one month later.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Washington state Governor Jay Inslee vetoed a <a href="http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Amendments/Senate/1287-S2.E%20AMS%20ENGR%20S2584.E.pdf">section of a bill</a> that would have phased out the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles starting from model year 2030. This would have been the first time a state mandated all-electric auto sales via legislation, instead of executive order. Of states that have ICE phase-outs in place &#8212; California and Massachusetts &#8212; both were established via orders signed by their respective governors and start in 2035.</p>

<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Volkswagen Group</strong> and <strong>Argo AI</strong>, which is supplying the company with a self-driving system that will allow it to commercially transport people and goods by 2025, provided an update this past week. Much of the briefing covered old ground. But there were a few new details, notably that testing will begin on <span lang="EN-US">European roads later this year, which builds on initial work completed at a test track that was established next to the Munich airport.</span></p>
<h3>In-car tech</h3>
<p><strong>Ford Motor</strong> is beefing up its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/ford-is-bringing-significant-wireless-software-updates-to-its-vehicles/">in-vehicle software offerings</a> with built-in Alexa voice assistant and a wireless software update ecosystem. Ford&#8217;s over-the-air software updates, which it has branded Power-Up, will have the capability of updating &#8220;virtually all&#8221; of the computer modules in new Ford vehicles, not just the ones that focus on infotainment, the company said in a statement Thursday. Ford estimates that Power-Up will be able to update more than 80 computer modules on higher-end models. The automaker aims to manufacture 33 million vehicles equipped with this service and Alexa by 2028.</p>

<h3>Delivery</h3>
<p><strong>The Information&#8217;s</strong> Paris Martineau spent five months investigating <strong>Amazon</strong> and the more than <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-deadly-toll-of-amazons-trucking-boom">50 serious crashes</a> involving its semi-trucks used over the last three years.</p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><strong>Arrival</strong>, <strong>Canoo</strong>, <strong>Fisker</strong>, <strong>Lordstown Motors</strong> and <strong>Nikola Corp</strong> were flying high when they went public through mergers with special purpose acquisition companies. A <a href="https://www.autonews.com/automakers-suppliers/ev-startups-lose-more-40-billion-after-going-public">Bloomberg report</a> found these five companies were worth $60 billion when they first went public. But the last few months have delivered some harsh lessons. Three of the companies plunged to new lows this week as short-seller attacks, management turmoil and execution issues led investors to reconsider their prospects. They&#8217;ve lost more than $40 billion of market capitalization combined from their respective peaks.</p>
<p><strong>California</strong> <strong>Gov. Gavin Newsom </strong>debuted a new proposal that earmarks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/california-gov-newsom-proposes-3-2b-in-ev-investment-as-part-of-economic-recovery-package/">$3.2 billion to boost EV infrastructure and adoption</a> in the state. Under the proposal, more than half of the $3.2 billion budget would go toward replacing 1,150 trucks, 1,000 transit buses and 1,000 school buses with electric models. Another $800 million would be put toward the state&#8217;s Clean Cars 4 All program, which aims to help lower-income drivers upgrade to a zero- or near-zero car, as well as further rebates or clean vehicles. The proposal earmarks $500 million toward infrastructure and $250 million would go toward manufacturing grants. Newsom did not specify what type of infrastructure programs would qualify; it&#8217;s likely those funds would go toward charging.</p>
<p><strong>Fisker</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/fisker-and-foxconn-sign-deal-to-build-electric-vehicles/">signed an agreement</a> with Foxconn, the Taiwanese company that assembles iPhones, to co-develop and manufacture a new electric vehicle. Production on the car, which will be sold under the Fisker brand name in North America, Europe, China and India, will begin in the U.S. by the end of 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Ford </strong>and<strong> BMW </strong>have each appointed members to the board of Solid Power, the solid state battery company that recently raised $130 million in a Series B round. Ford picked Ted Miller, manager of electrification subsystems and power supply research, and BMW chose Rainer Feurer, a senior vice president of corporate investments.</p>

<p><strong>Ford</strong> also confirmed this week that its all-electric pickup truck will be named the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/ford-reveals-three-new-details-about-its-officially-named-f-150-lightning-electric-pickup-truck/">F-150 Lightning</a>, resurrecting a name that once donned the SVT F-150 in the 1990s. The company hasn&#8217;t said much about the powertrain, range or other specs. However, Ford President and CEO Jim Farley provided new details about the electric pickup that is coming to market next year. Most notably, it seems that the battery on the Ford F-150 Lightning will have the ability to power a home during an outage. Ford has touted the capability of its Hybrid F-150 to power a job site or tools, but this is the first time the company has said one of its vehicles could act as a backup generator to a home.</p>
<p><strong>Harley-Davidson</strong> has spun out its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/harley-davidson-spins-out-livewire-into-a-standalone-electric-motorcycle-brand/">LiveWire electric motorcycle</a> as a standalone brand, complete with a new logo and brand identity. The company first unveiled the LiveWire electric motorcycle in 2018 with a listing price of $29,799, placing it on the higher end for motorcycles. It went into production the following year, with some bumps, including a brief halt to production due to a charging-related problem on one of the motorcycles. The &#8220;first LiveWire-branded motorcycle&#8221; will launch on July 8. Its public debut will come a day later at the International Motorcycle Show.</p>

<p><strong>Hyundai Motor Group</strong> said it will invest $7.4 billion in the U.S. by 2025 — money that will be used to produce future electric vehicles, improve production facilities and develop what the automaker describes as smart mobility solutions. The company is also going to invest in improving electrification and hydrogen energy.</p>
<p><strong>Subaru</strong> announced new details about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/subaru-solterra-ev-2022/">its first-ever EV</a>, which is set to hit the market in 2022. Subaru will call its first EV the Solterra, a fitting name for a brand synonymous with outdoor adventures and you know, the sun and the Earth. Subaru&#8217;s first full-fledged EV will be an SUV that ships with the manufacturer&#8217;s well-regarded all-wheel-drive capabilities. The Solterra is built on a new platform the company is developing in partnership with <strong>Toyota</strong>, which the latter company will use for its bZ4X crossover.</p>
<p><strong>Ultium Cells LLC</strong>, a joint venture between General Motors and LG Chem, has executed an agreement with Canadian company Li-Cycle to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/gm-and-lg-chems-ultium-cells-partners-with-li-cycle-to-process-manufacturing-waste/">recycle critical materials</a> from the scrap produced from Ultium&#8217;s manufacturing processes from its Lordstown plant, starting later in 2021. The materials from the Lordstown location will be sent to Li-Cycle&#8217;s recycling location in Rochester, New York, to be processed and returned to the battery supply chain.</p>
<h3>Hydrogen</h3>
<p><strong>Toyota</strong> tapped Japanese company <strong>ENEOS</strong> to help develop the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/toyota-partners-with-eneos-to-explore-a-hydrogen-powered-woven-city/">hydrogen fuel cell system</a> that will power its futuristic prototype city Woven City. The vision for the 175-acre city, where people will live and work amongst all of Toyota&#8217;s projects, including its autonomous e-Palette shuttles and robots, is to build a fully connected ecosystem powered by hydrogen fuel cells. ENEOS, a Japanese petroleum company that&#8217;s investing heavily into hydrogen, will help make Toyota&#8217;s &#8220;human-centered&#8221; city of the future. This new partnership not only signifies Toyota&#8217;s backing of hydrogen over electric, but it also could help Japan achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.</p>
<h3>Studies</h3>
<p>Global consulting firm <strong>AlixPartners </strong>forecasts that the ongoing semiconductor shortage will cost automakers globally $110 billion in lost revenues this year, up from the firm&#8217;s estimate in late January of $61 billion. In total, the firm is now forecasting that production of 3.9 million vehicles in total will be lost in 2021. The pandemic-induced shortage has been compounded by a fire in a key chip-making fabrication plant, severe weather in Texas and a drought in Taiwan, according to Mark Wakefield, global co-leader of the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners.</p>
<p>This problem isn&#8217;t going away either. There are up to 1,400 chips in a typical vehicle today. The rise in consumer electronics, which the majority of the chip supply goes toward, continues to put pressure on the automotive industry. There has always been a need for supply chain resiliency. But now, there is a broader push from the industry and governments to shore up the supply chain for the long term.</p>
<p><strong>Nexar</strong>, a company that makes an AI-based dashcam app to monitor road safety, put 36 vehicles on the streets of Milan in February. While driving around, the company collected images from dash cams and AI to map on-street parking spots and documented <a href="https://data.getnexar.com/solution/parking/">262,163 free street parking spots</a> in a month. This interesting nugget of information is part of a wider study conducted by Nexar to better understand how curbsides are used.</p>
<p>Nexar said the free parking spot identification along with the creation of a crowd-sourced map of such data was accomplished using vision (and specifically car camera vision). One of the goals, the company said, was to demonstrate that vision data can replicate the human understanding of what a parking spot is.</p>
<h2>Events and opportunities</h2>
<p>There are a number of events coming up — and not just TC Sessions: Mobility 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Ford Motor</strong> will hosts its Capital Markets Day on May 26. A webcast will open at 9:15 a.m. EDT and the event will start promptly at 9:30 a.m. EDT. After the presentation, CEO Jim Farley and CFO John Lawler along with other Ford executives will host a question-and-answer session with the analyst community.

<p>The <strong>Petersen Automotive Museum</strong> is launching a new three-month incubator program that is focused on women-led businesses in the automotive sector. Each year, the museum will choose one California-based startup with five or fewer employees and provide them with hands-on mentorship, access to the Petersen network of sponsors and partners and a $25,000 to $30,000 investment. Applications are reviewed by the program&#8217;s selection committee. Once accepted, the startup will work alongside the Petersen&#8217;s mentorship team to develop a custom program that addresses its business goals. Applications are being accepted now through July 31, 2021. <a href="https://www.petersen.org/business-incubator-program">Click here to</a> apply.</p>
<p><strong>Self Racing Cars</strong> is scheduled for October 16 to 17, 2021 at Thunderhill Raceway. If you&#8217;re not familiar, the event is organized each year by Joshua Schachter. The event is an autonomous racing series that has a hobbyist-maker vibe. It&#8217;s as much about tinkering and troubleshooting as it is about going around the track.</p>
<p>While there are different teams, it is a decidedly collaborative environment. I&#8217;ll never forget the first year that Schachter hosted the event. It was here that I first met and befriended Alex Roy, now one of my co-hosts on the Autonocast podcast. It&#8217;s where George Hotz of Comma.ai finally got his vehicle around the track (Alex and I in the backseat) and won the competition. And it was where I was introduced to a young and then unknown guy named Austin Russell who was working in stealth on what we would all eventually learn was a lidar company called Luminar.</p>
<p>Check the website <a href="http://selfracingcars.com/">for more information</a> and to sign up to participate. Right now, it looks like Nvidia is signed up and that list will likely grow in the coming months. And I hope to see you all there in the fall.</p>
<p><strong>TC Sessions: Mobility 2021! </strong>The June 9 event is right around the corner and I hope you&#8217;ll all be there. The agenda is packed for this one-day virtual event. You can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/announcing-the-agenda-for-tc-sessions-mobility-2021/">check out the agenda here</a>.</p>

<p>A few highlights:</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have a panel on self-driving deliveries with <strong>Starship Technologies</strong> co-founder and CEO and CTO <strong>Ahti Heinla</strong>, <strong>Amy Jones Satrom</strong>, who heads operations at <strong>Nuro </strong>and <strong>Gatik</strong> co-founder and CTO <strong>Apeksha Kumavat</strong>. We&#8217;ll have one-on-one interviews with <strong>Pam Fletcher, </strong>who is leading innovation efforts at <strong>GM</strong>, as well as <strong>Rimac Automobili</strong> founder and CEO <strong>Mate Rimac</strong>, <strong>Scale AI</strong> co-founder and CEO <strong>Alex Wang </strong>and <strong>Zoox</strong> co-founder and CTO <strong>Jesse Levinson</strong>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have investors, of course, including one panel with <strong>Clara Brenner</strong> of <strong>Urban Innovation Fund</strong>, <strong>Quin Garcia</strong> of <strong>Autotech Ventures</strong> and <strong>Rachel Holt</strong> of <strong>Construct Capital. </strong>Then there&#8217;s investor and LinkedIn founder <strong>Reid Hoffman</strong>, whose SPAC merged with Joby Aviation. Hoffman and Joby founder and CEO <strong>JoeBen Bevirt </strong>will come together to talk about what lies ahead. We also plan to bring together community organizer, transportation consultant and lawyer <strong>Tamika L. Butler</strong>, Remix co-founder and CEO <strong>Tiffany Chu</strong> and Revel co-founder and CEO <strong>Frank Reig </strong>to talk about equity, accessibility and shared mobility in cities.</p>
<p>One other panel we haven&#8217;t promoted yet will focus on China and robotaxis. The panel is bringing together <strong>Jennifer Li</strong>, vice president of finance at <strong>WeRide</strong>, <strong>Jewel Li</strong> who is COO of <strong>AutoX</strong> and<strong> Huan Sun</strong>, who heads up<strong> Momenta Europe. </strong>These executives, from three leading Chinese robotaxi companies (that also have operations in Europe or the U.S.), will join us to provide insight into the unique challenges of developing and deploying the technology in China and how it compares to other countries.</p>
<p>And there is more. Have a question for any of these folks? Email me; I want to hear from you! And remember, some of the panels will have a live question-and-answer period.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After seven years at Google, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacquelle?originalSubdomain=ch">Jacquelle Amankonah Horton</a> knew there was a white space in social between fans and creators. She built <a href="https://www.faveforfans.com/">Fave</a> to fill in that gap, and the company today announced the close of a $2.2 million seed round.</p>
<p>Female Founders Fund, HYBE, Sony Music, Warner Music, Concord Music, Quality Control, Right Hand Management, Techstars Music and Betaworks all participated in the round.</p>
<p>Fave is all about the relationship between fans and creators. As Horton describes it, creators and artists have a variety of ways they can reach out to their fans and share their lives, but for the super fans out there, there is no way to truly express their adoration beyond the flat experience of commenting on an Instagram post or liking a tweet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fave is broken down by fandoms (starting with Swifties/Taylor Swift), allowing fans to connect with one another, create content and buy and sell fan-themed merchandise and artwork to one another. Fave&#8217;s go-to-market is focused on the fans themselves, though the hope is to also bring creators on to the platform, which ultimately gives them another revenue stream.</p>
<p>Creators and Fave alike can generate revenue through advertising or through a transaction fee on goods sold through the marketplace. Fave takes a 10% cut on all transactions, whether sold by the creator or a fan.</p>
<p>Alongside the announcement of the funding, Fave is also launching into public beta.</p>
<p>Horton explained to TechCrunch that one tactic for the company is to engage with the top influencers for each respective fandom. Across fan communities, there are people who are relatively well-known as the top fans, sharing content and often getting recognized by the creator.</p>
<p>Fave is onboarding these influencers early on in the creation of a fandom to attract the rest of the fans over to the platform. The startup is also looking to capitalize on some of the competitiveness involved in being a super fan, giving creators the ability to set up contests and let their fans compete. Users that do well are rewarded with points that can be spent in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Horton said that she grew up as a super fan herself and can relate to the users.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was the girl in her bedroom who knew every lyric of every song, how many freckles they have, and fell asleep to the movie every single night just to hear the sound of his voice,&#8221; said Horton. &#8220;But I wasn&#8217;t able to go sit front row at a concert or spend $70 on a sweatshirt so the artists got nothing from me despite my deep passion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The hope is to give fans a place where they can truly let their fan flag fly, while giving artists a way to connect directly with fans. Though the startup only has one fandom open right now, they&#8217;re actively listening to users on the platform to determine which fandoms to build out next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On the heels of this morning&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/apple-to-add-lossless-audio-at-no-additional-cost/">announcement</a> of Apple&#8217;s <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-music-announces-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio/">next-generation music service</a> featuring lossless audio and spatial audio with support for Dolby Atmos, Amazon is making a move likely aimed at retaining its own streaming music subscribers. The company says that going forward, its high-quality streaming tier, Amazon Music HD, will be made available to all eligible Amazon Music Unlimited subscribers at no extra cost.</p>
<p>Amazon first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/amazon-launches-amazon-music-hd-with-lossless-audio-streaming/">announced</a> Amazon Music HD in fall 2019 with access to over 50 million songs that would stream in what Amazon is calling HD, with a bit depth of 16 bits and a sample rate of 44.1kHz (around CD-quality). It also promised &#8220;millions&#8221; more songs that would stream in Ultra HD, or 24-bit, with a sample rate of up to 192kHz (or better than CD quality).</p>
<p>Today, Amazon Music&#8217;s HD catalog has grown to more than 70 million songs and there are over 7 million Ultra HD tracks available. Amazon Music HD customers can also access a growing catalog of songs remixed in 3D Audio formats such as Dolby Atmos and Sony 360RA, which can be played back on Amazon&#8217;s own high-fidelity speaker, the Echo Studio.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Music in 360RA can also be streamed via Amazon Music HD on Sony’s RA5000 and RA3000 speakers by using Alexa Cast, the company notes.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hmAuBh1Fh2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/apple-to-add-lossless-audio-at-no-additional-cost/">Apple to add lossless audio to Apple Music at no additional cost</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Apple to add lossless audio to Apple Music at no additional cost&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/apple-to-add-lossless-audio-at-no-additional-cost/embed/#?secret=hmAuBh1Fh2" data-secret="hmAuBh1Fh2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The launch of HD streaming was seen as a way to counteract the threat from the music streaming service Tidal, which had been catering to audiophiles with higher quality streams, as well as a way to differentiate its service from larger streaming rivals, like Apple and Spotify &#8212; the latter which<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-a-new-high-end-subscription-spotify-hifi/"> recently announced a high-end subscription of its own</a>, Spotify HiFi, whose pricing and launch date is yet unknown.</p>
<p>Before today, Amazon Music HD was priced at $12.99 per month for Amazon Prime subscribers and $14.99 per month for anyone else. Now, Amazon says that new and existing subscribers to the Amazon Music Unlimited Individual Plan ($7.99/month for Prime members and $9.99/month otherwise) or the Family Plan ($14.99/month) can upgrade to Amazon Music HD at no additional cost &#8212; essentially a $5 per month savings.</p>
<p>The changes will kick in at the next billing cycle, and are supported in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Canada, France, Italy and Spain.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we first launched Amazon Music HD, our goal was to lead the industry by enabling music fans around the world to stream the best quality recording, the way artists intended their music to be heard,&#8221; said Steve Boom, VP of Amazon Music, in a statement about today&#8217;s news. &#8220;We’re thrilled now to make Amazon Music HD available to everyone at no extra cost. All music fans should have access to this quality of music, and now they do,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The move by Amazon to make its HD catalog a free upgrade follows this morning&#8217;s announcement from Apple that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/apple-to-add-lossless-audio-at-no-additional-cost/">it will add lossless audio to Apple Music at no additional cost,</a> starting next month. Apple touts over 75 million songs in lossless audio. The upgrade will also bring spatial audio with support for Dolby Atmos. Given the shift in the market, the pressure is on Spotify to make its HiFi music service competitively priced, as well.</p>
<p>Amazon Music Unlimited has been seen as the dark horse of music streaming, given its potential to grow to a larger size simply based on its ties with Amazon&#8217;s popular Prime subscription. The service had 55 million subscribers since early 2020, but Amazon declined to provide an updated figure today. For comparison, Apple Music <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/apple-music-surpasses-60-million-subscribers/">announced</a> 60 million subscribers in 2019 and was estimated to have grown to <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/apple-music-statistics/">72 million</a> by early 2020 and likely more than<a href="https://musically.com/2020/02/19/spotify-apple-how-many-users-big-music-streaming-services/"> 80 million</a> by now. Spotify, meanwhile, has <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-28/spotify-reports-first-quarter-2021-earnings/">158 million</a> paid subscribers.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a>.</p>
<p>There was lots to get through today, so, in order, here&#8217;s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early-stage founders can still apply for the impending Disrupt Battlefield event. You can sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/deadline-extended-apply-to-startup-battlefield-at-tc-disrupt-2021/">here</a> if that&#8217;s you. It&#8217;s going to be a lot of fun, tbh.</li>
<li>From the weekend: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/san-francisco-tech-companies-sitting-on-record-amounts-of-empty-space.html">San Francisco real estate is a mess</a>; Twitter Blue <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1393541248049303555">is coming</a> and I am hype about it; Elon Musk roiled crypto markets by being himself, which doesn&#8217;t speak too highly of the asset class.</li>
<li>AT&amp;T is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/att-confirms-deal-to-combine-its-warnermedia-subsidiary-with-discovery-inc-in-pure-play-43b-deal/">getting out of the TV game to some degree</a>, selling media assets to help pay down debt. Just like Verizon did <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/">by selling TechCrunch and family to Apollo</a>.</li>
<li>We also chatted about two Indian mega-rounds: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/merchant-commerce-platform-pine-labs-raises-285-million/">Pine Labs raising $285 million</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/16/indias-moglix-valued-at-1-billion-in-120-million-fundraise/">Moglix raising $120 million</a>.</li>
<li>From the early-stage front, two rounds this morning for your pleasure: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/sequoia-leads-5m-pre-seed-in-egypts-1-month-old-digital-bank-telda/">Telda&#8217;s super-cool pre-seed round</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/fresh-out-of-yc-houm-raises-8m-to-improve-the-home-rental-and-sales-market-in-latam/">recent Y Combinator-grad Houm&#8217;s latest investment</a>, which explains why the accelerator program is still so popular.</li>
<li>Extra Crunch Live this week is Shaun Maguire (Sequoia) + Samir Vasavada (Vise) on Wednesday, May 19th, at 3pm ET/12pm PT.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-music-announces-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio/">announced</a> that it is adding some new features to its music streaming service Apple Music. Starting next month, users will find some new options, such as spatial audio with support for Dolby Atmos as well as lossless audio files.</p>
<p>Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-a-new-high-end-subscription-spotify-hifi/">recently announced</a> a new high-end subscription tier with CD-quality, lossless audio files. But Spotify HiFi isn’t included in Spotify Premium by itself. You’ll have to pay a bit more money to stream lossless audio. Pricing hasn’t been disclosed yet.</p>
<p>Apple’s move is a bit different, as lossless audio is going to be included in the basic Apple Music subscription tier. For $9.99 per month, you’ll be able to choose between various audio quality settings. By default, Apple and other streaming services compress audio files so that it doesn’t require a lot of bandwidth.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You can also choose CD-quality, lossless streaming — 16 bit at 44.1 kHz. In that case, you’ll receive lossless audio files. Behind the scenes, Apple uses its own lossless audio format (ALAC, Apple Lossless Audio Codec). But that shouldn’t have an impact as FLAC, WAV or ALAC files sound exactly the same — it’s lossless audio.</p>
<p>If you have a <em>truly</em> unlimited mobile plan, you can even choose 24 bit at 48 kHz or 24 bit at 192 kHz. In that case, the average weight of a song should be around 250MB — yep, that’s a lot of bytes. Apple says you have to use an external, USB digital-to-analog converter to take advantage of the hi-resolution lossless tier. Plugging in a pair of headphones with your iPhone won’t cut it.</p>

<p>The entire Apple Music catalog of 75 million songs will support lossless audio. Music distributors already upload lossless audio files when they submit a song to streaming services. Adding lossless audio is all about surfacing those files to the end users.</p>
<p>As for spatial audio, it’ll be enabled by default on hardware that supports Dolby Atmos, such as AirPods and Beats headphones with an H1 or W1 chip. The most recent iPhone, iPad and Mac models also support Dolby Atmos. But it sounds like songs have to be remastered for Dolby Atmos specifically.</p>
<p>At first, only “thousands of songs” will support spatial audio. Artists include J Balvin, Gustavo Dudamel, Ariana Grande, Maroon 5, Kacey Musgraves and The Weeknd. You’ll be able to identify those tracks with a badge in the user interface.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As gaming platforms capitalize on pandemic-fueled traffic to their digital worlds, brands that drive culture in the physical world are fighting to ensure they don’t miss any new opportunities. A new partnership between Roblox and Gucci brings digital items from the fashion house into the platform’s metaverse alongside a new limited-run digital experience.</p>
<p>Gucci&#8217;s new experience teams a set of virtual spaces with a set of digital branded items in an effort to immerse Roblox users inside a world that feels unique to the Gucci brand and Roblox platform. The new space, called <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2021/05/gucci-garden-experience/">Gucci Garden</a>, debuts today for a two-week run on the Roblox platform.</p>
<p>The environment takes advantage of recent advances in the game engine powering Roblox, bringing users a high-dynamic set of environments that they can traverse as blank mannequins, which evolve visually as users move through different spaces. Different rooms in the experience draw influence from different Gucci campaigns of the past several years. The digital event&#8217;s rollout accompanies a real-world multimedia event in Florence, <a title="https://www.gucci.com/us/en/st/capsule/gucci-garden" href="https://www.gucci.com/us/en/st/capsule/gucci-garden" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.gucci.com/us/en/st/capsule/gucci-garden&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1621353006286000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFMnHN6yoUBSfFZSYoQNC_FNgcyQA">Gucci Garden Archetypes</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The rollout follows an early pilot with creator Rook Vanguard in releasing Gucci-branded digital items to the platform this past December.</p>

<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Gucci CMO Robert Triefus details how the luxury fashion brand has been redefining its approachability as it extends its reach to digital platforms like Roblox &#8212; which the company sees as an opportunity that&#8217;s growing too quickly to ignore.</p>
<p>“Hats off to Roblox, scale came quickly,” Triefus tells TechCrunch. “Gucci is scale, though it’s taken us 100 years, and it took Roblox about 100 days.”</p>
<p>For high-fashion brands, the digital sphere has presented plenty of challenges when it comes to preserving exclusivity on a medium that begs for mass adoption. Triefus says Gucci has aimed to lean into the access offered by digital platforms as a way of promoting a more inclusive brand.</p>

<p>“There&#8217;s so much talk today about the metaverse,” Triefus says. “In the last six years, [Creative Director Alessandro Michele] has created a Gucci Metaverse but it&#8217;s not necessarily a digital manifestation, it&#8217;s a narrative.”</p>
<p>Luxury and authenticity have been some of the central sells of blockchain-based NFTs, something Triefus still sees opportunities for down the road. &#8220;It’s astonishing to me how fast the conversation around NFTs has exploded,” Triefus says. &#8220;We’ve been studying blockchain for a long time as you might imagine, authenticity of product and of experience is extremely important.”</p>
<p>In addition to experiments with Roblox, late last year Gucci partnered with startup Genies to outfit user avatars.</p>
<p>Virtual items from real-world retailers have been relatively slow to pop up inside digital worlds, though as user perceptions of paying for digital goods have shifted, platforms are moving to capitalize.</p>
<p>“We don’t partner with very many brands,” Roblox exec Christina Wootton tells TechCrunch. “One thing that was very special when we started speaking with Gucci is that they took the time to understand our platform and what works well for designers and creators in our community.”</p>
