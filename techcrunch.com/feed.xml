										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Data is everywhere inside organizations, and employees are increasingly trying to find ways to put it to work to improve business outcomes. <a href="http://hex.tech/">Hex</a>, a startup that wants to simplify how data scientists and other employees gather and share data, announced a $16 million Series A today. The round comes just a little over 6 months after the startup announced its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/hex-lands-5-5m-seed-to-help-data-scientists-share-data-across-the-company/">$5.5 million seed round</a>.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s investment was led by Redpoint Ventures with help from previous investors Amplify Partners, as well as Data Community Fund, Geometry, Operator Collective, Tokyo Black, Vandelay Ventures, XYZ Venture Capital and various unnamed industry angels. Hex has now raised a total of $21.5 million, according to the company.</p>
<p>The startup has not been sitting still since that seed round when it was offering a beta of its fledgling product. Today it has a more complete product, says CEO and co-founder Barry McCardel. &#8220;We just released an all new version we&#8217;re calling Hex 2.0 and it fundamentally changes the way a lot of data science workflows work,&#8221; he said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220617" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As we described the tool at the time of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/hex-lands-5-5m-seed-to-help-data-scientists-share-data-across-the-company/">$5.5 million seed round</a> in March:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most data scientists work with their data in online notebooks like Jupyter, where they can build SQL queries and enter Python code to organize it, chart it and so forth. What Hex is doing is creating this super-charged notebook that lets you pull a data set from Snowflake or Amazon Redshift, work with and format the data in an easy way, then drag and drop components from the notebook page — maybe a chart or a data set — and very quickly build a kind of app that you can share with others.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hex is going after established data science notebook tools like Jupyter, which McCardel acknowledges is popular, but comes with a lot of baggage. &#8220;So, traditionally code notebooks like Jupyter have been really popular, but they have major issues with reproducibility, interpretability and performance. These are pretty well known.&#8221;  Hex 2.0 is designed to resolve those issues, he said.</p>
<p>Today they&#8217;ve got dozens of customers and are up from 5 employees at the time of the seed announcement to 18 today with plans to get to around 24 by the end of the year. With a diverse founding team that includes CTO Caitlin Colgrove and Chief Architect Glen Takahashi, the company wants to build a company that reflects the diversity of that group.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Building a diverse team is something we&#8217;ve put a lot of energy and intentionality into from day one. And for us it means making sure that every part of our recruiting process is set up to be as equitable as possible from sourcing to interviewing to the offer stage. And there&#8217;s a bunch of things we&#8217;ve done embracing distributed hiring and reaching out and partnering with diverse communities and trying to open up new opportunities,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company also announced a partnership with <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt Labs</a>, which is in the data transformation space, helping to take data in stored in data warehouses like Snowflake and preparing it to be analyzed in a tool like Hex. The two companies will share several integrations to make it easier to work in either application without having to jump between them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.element.fi">Element Finance</a> has raised a $32 million Series A round at a $320 million valuation. The company has been building a new DeFi (decentralized finance) protocol on top of the Ethereum blockchain. It lets you earn predictable returns on investments thanks to fixed rates over a predetermined period of time.</p>
<p>Polychain Capital is leading today’s funding round. Other new investors include Republic, Advanced Blockchain, P2P Validator, Rarestone, Ethereal Ventures and their limited partners. Some of the company’s existing investors are investing once again, such as Andreessen Horowitz, Placeholder, A_Capital, and Scalar Capital. Finally, there’s a <a href="https://medium.com/element-finance/element-finance-raises-32m-series-a-at-a-320m-valuation-6622fab5fb40">long list</a> of DeFi builders who participated in the round.</p>
<p>Element Finance is still relatively new as the company launched its protocol on the Ethereum mainnet on June 30. But it has been quite successful already as there are currently the equivalent of $180 million in total value-locked.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220842" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Users can currently participate in ten different <a href="https://app.element.fi/fixedrates/">fixed-rate pools</a>. They can contribute with stablecoins, such as DAI or USDC, with popular (wrapped) cryptocurrencies, such as wBTC, or with sophisticated deriative assets, such as steCRV — steCRV is a token that represents a stake in the <a href="https://curve.fi">Curve</a> ETH/stETH liquidity pool.</p>
<p>While this is already a cool product for individual investors, Element Finance also wants to convince fund managers to invest in an Element pool. The company has launched a <a href="https://medium.com/element-finance/introducing-elements-treasury-management-initiative-bbebbd99f89">treasury management initiative</a> to convince other DeFi protocol makers, funds and institutions that they should allocate a portion of their capital to Element Finance.</p>
<p>In order to guarantee fixed rates, some users can opt for higher returns. They contribute to liquidity pools with variable interests. But in that case you can’t predict your returns at the end of the year.</p>
<p>So far, 9,000 users have tried Element Finance. The company plans to introduce a <a href="https://medium.com/element-finance/an-introduction-to-elements-governance-model-efea13d1c7ee">governance system</a> with different voting vaults and different incentives. With today’s funding round, Element Finance will hire more people across all areas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[Modern Age provides digital tools to help users demystify and understand their aging options, including telemedicine and in-person treatments.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aging is inevitable, but <a href="https://modern-age.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Modern Age</a> wants to help you do it in a way that is healthier.</p>
<p>Melissa Earner, former vice president at Amazon and COO at Glossier, is behind the company, which is announcing $27 million in Series A funding led by Oak HC/FT.</p>
<p>Longevity has a personal component for her: As she watched her parents age, she saw the differences between her mother and her mother’s friends and got to thinking about how, in the second half of life, some people will thrive while others can decline rapidly.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220506" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“For example, what genetics and her environment is in her control,” said Earner, who went to business school with the intention of getting into long-term care, but ended up finding it difficult to find a long-term care company that wanted an MBA. Instead, it was Amazon that gave her the foundation for customer focus and using technology to solve problems.</p>
<p>As such, Modern Age wants to help people live longer, healthier lives, providing digital tools to help users understand their aging options, including telemedicine and in-person treatments. While researching the topic, Earner came across research that when you feel younger, you live longer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“That got me thinking about health and wellness to manage how you feel,” she added. “There are a lot of spot solutions out there, like going to the dermatologist for age spots, but not a lot of companies connecting the dots between all of the factors: nutrition, sleep, fitness, hair, skins, bones and metabolism. Humans are not great at these data points, but computers are, and using that, we have built something powerful.”</p>
<p>Users start by taking an assessment across variables to determine how old they feel and areas of health and wellness that are most important. The company plans to launch initially in the areas of skin, hair, bones and hormones.</p>
<p>For example, signs of aging in skin and hair are noticeable beginning in your 30s, which is also the time when people begin losing bone mass, something Earner said is not talked about much. In addition, hormones affect how much energy you have, and Earner says there is a lot of misinformation and a general lack of information, like women don’t realize that lower testosterone can lead to fatigue.</p>
<p>Also participating in the round are GV and founding partner Juxtapose, which gave the company a seed round in 2020, to bring the company’s total funding to $33 million.</p>
<p>&#8220;Much like some of our other successes in the health and wellness space, like Care/of or Tend Dental, we see Modern Age as another opportunity to utilize technology in a way that creates a hyper-personalized experience for customers and can lead to better resources and patient care,” Jed Cairo, co-founder and managing partner at Juxtapose, said via email.</p>

<p>A large portion of the new funding will be used to build out Modern Age’s flagship clinic in New York’s Flatiron district that is expected to open in early 2022. In addition, the company will invest in talent, technology development and customer engagement.</p>
<p>The company is now at 17 employees, and Earner expects to grow to 50, not including the staff in the clinic, by the end of 2022. The clinic will have its own clinicians and medical team. She also will be hiring a chief medical officer to work with her as well.</p>
<p>Annie Lamont, co-founder and managing partner at Oak HC/FT, said the science of longevity is still in the early stages and it is going to be a major area of investment. Indeed, companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/longevity-startup-longevica-plans-to-launch-supplements-based-on-long-term-research/">Longevica</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/07/longevity-startup-gero-ai-has-a-mobile-api-for-quantifying-health-changes/">Gero AI</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/rosita-longevity-wants-to-teach-seniors-how-to-live-long-healthy-lives/">Rosita Longevity</a> recently were in the news about their approaches and attracting funding.</p>
<p>Lamont says Earner “is incredibly experienced and grounded in sciences” and wants to build a company that is bringing clarity to consumers to become a trusted entity and credible voice to the topic of longevity.</p>
<p>“There are piecemeal attempts right now, and how people feel matters, as does the science,” she added. “Modern Age may not provide all of the services, but it will be a place to find out the truth of both the virtual and physical space and will have evolving services.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a>, the outsized fintech out of San Francisco that is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/stripe-closes-600m-round-at-a-95b-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at $95 billion</a>, is making another acquisition to expand the services it offers alongside its core payments product. The company is acquiring <a href="https://www.recko.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recko</a>, which has built a platform that lets businesses track and automate payments reconciliation, covering both outgoing and incoming payments and the full ecosystem of inbound and outbound payment sources and receivers. Like Stripe itself, Recko leans heavily on APIs to integrate and work with different data sources.</p>
<p>Recko is based out of Bangalore, India, and significantly this will be Stripe&#8217;s first acquisition in the country when the acquisition officially closes (based on customary closing conditions),</p>
<p>Terms of the deal are not being disclosed, Stripe tells us. For some background, though, Recko had raised about $7 million prior to this, with <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/268427-98/company/profile#investors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investors</a> including Vertex Ventures, Prime Venture Partners, and a number of individuals, including Taavet Hinirikus, the co-founder and former CEO of Wise (nee TransferWise). Founded in 2017 and based out of India, Recko had been seeing a lot of traction internationally, with Deliveroo, Meesho and PharmEasy among its wider list of customers. (That base and the crossover it has with Stripe&#8217;s customer base may well have been the trigger for getting on Stripe&#8217;s radar.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220818" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Stripe will begin integrating Recko into its wider payments stack, but also notes that existing Recko users will be able to continue using it as before. From the looks of it, the plan is not to limit any of the functionality of the product, which today is partly so effective because of how it precisely works across so much of the fragmentation you already have in the world of accounting and finance.</p>
<p>The acquisition is the latest move from Stripe to build out more services beyond basic payments, a way of capturing more revenue from existing customers, and more customers overall, in particular those seeing platforms that let them handle accounting and other work that goes hand-in-hand with taking or making payments.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Stripe acquired <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/stripe-acquires-bouncer-will-integrate-its-card-authentication-into-the-radar-fraud-detection-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bouncer</a> to integrate card authentication; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/stripe-acquires-taxjar-to-add-cloud-based-automated-sales-tax-tools-into-its-payments-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TaxJar</a> to bring in automatic sales tax tools. International acquisitions &#8212; others have included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paystack</a> in Nigeria and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/stripe-acquires-touchtech-updates-apis-to-prep-for-strong-customer-authentication-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Touchtech</a> in Ireland &#8212; have also been made strategically both to serve a wider network of territories and to tap into local expertise in those markets. Recko ticks both of those boxes.</p>
<p>Stripe&#8217;s moves come as part of a bigger consolidation we&#8217;ve been seeing in the world of fintech: a number of strong players have emerged covering very specific &#8220;point solutions&#8221; in the wider payments ecosystem, and so the stronger platform providers (and Stripe is among them) are now making moves to bring all of these together in the name of more convenience and efficiency for users, and better margins for Stripe itself.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Payments reconciliation shouldn’t be a mild headache that balloons into a migraine as a company grows—it should be an easy, highly automated process,” said Will Gaybrick, Stripe’s Chief Product Officer, in a <a href="https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/recko" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> announcing the deal. “Stripe helps millions of businesses around the world streamline their revenue management—from subscriptions and invoicing to revenue recognition and bookkeeping. With Recko, we’ll automate their payments reconciliation, a critical input into their overall financial health.”</p>
<p>Reconciliation is one of the trickier aspects of a business, regardless of whether it&#8217;s a sole trader, and SMB or a larger organization, as it involves balancing money going in and out simultaneously across multiple parties. The bigger an operation (regardless of organization size), the more complex it becomes. The smaller the organization, the more critical the work is since it&#8217;s closely linked to cashflow (and cashflow is often one of the bigger problems for smaller businesses: one reason why Stripe has also built a working capital product to advance money to customers that need it).</p>
<p>A diagram that Recko provides of where it sits in the payments and accounting environment really speaks to just how much integration of so many services is involved:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2220831" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-12.31.26-PM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="313" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-12.31.26-PM.png 2282w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-12.31.26-PM.png?resize=150,69 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-12.31.26-PM.png?resize=300,138 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-12.31.26-PM.png?resize=768,354 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-12.31.26-PM.png?resize=680,313 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-12.31.26-PM.png?resize=1536,708 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-12.31.26-PM.png?resize=2048,944 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-20-at-12.31.26-PM.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Of course, the other side of that argument is that a one-stop-shop leads to less competition, since Stripe offering an all-in-one solution becomes too compelling to pass up. (And while there remains a lot of competition in the world of payments, the competition argument becomes more serious when it gets applied in antitrust investigations when that bigger competitive landscape begins to disappear, for example when one platform, like Facebook&#8217;s or Microsoft&#8217;s, has been seen too much of the ecosystem in a particular area.)</p>
<p>Others like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/primer-raises-50m-at-a-425m-valuation-for-a-framework-designed-to-help-merchants-build-more-powerful-payment-flows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primer</a>, which announced a fundraise this week, present another approach, building a platform that makes it easy for businesses to keep using a wide variety of services together, with less pain in the process.</p>
<p>For the startup, it&#8217;s a window to scaling in a way that would have been more challenging on its own, aligned with one of the bigger and interesting privately-held companies (I guess we can&#8217;t call Stripe a startup anymore?) out there challenging the established players in financial services.</p>
<p>“Joining Stripe is a perfect next chapter for Recko, and we can’t wait to help grow the GDP of the internet by removing the burden of reconciliation complexity,” commented Saurya Prakash Sinha, CEO and co-founder of Recko, in a statement. “Internet businesses need tools that can scale with their growth and automate the tasks required to produce an accurate picture of their financial health.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A company from the creator of Ello and Kidrobot is announcing a new $20 million funding round to build out an imagined virtual world populated with deranged-yet-cute cartoon influencers.</p>
<p><a href="https://superplastic.co/">Superplastic</a>&#8216;s investors include Google Ventures, Index Ventures, Founders Fund, Craft Ventures, Galaxy Digital, Mantis VC/The Chainsmokers, Kakao, LINE Friends and individual investors like Cyan Bannister, Jared Leto, Justin Timberlake and Scooter Braun, among others. The $20 million Series A round brings the company’s total capital raised to $38 million.</p>
<p>Superplastic’s proposition is a strange one. The company owns an animated collab house of “synthetic superstars” — characters who live on social media and pop up everywhere else through partnerships with celebrities, iconic fashion brands and gaming platforms. The company has already racked up millions of followers across Instagram and TikTok, sold millions in NFTs and built up a bustling Discord community, all around a stable of violent, fashion-forward cartoon characters.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220536" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Everything is driven by the characters and the story&#8230; and in a way Superplastic [is] the management team,&#8221; Superplastic founder Paul Budnitz told TechCrunch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Kranky Series One <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f631.png" alt="😱" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> 14 iconic street artists. 3.5-inches of perfect vinyl. Are you ready? Tomorrow, 2PM ET <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/26a1.png" alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/FbqTR6WEf4">pic.twitter.com/FbqTR6WEf4</a></p>
<p>&mdash; SUPERPLASTIC (@superplastic) <a href="https://twitter.com/superplastic/status/1448347917337702404?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Budnitz is aiming high, aspiring to build his own “fucked up Disney.” Guggimon, one of Superplastic’s central characters, intermittently tortures his counterpart and models virtual Gucci gear — just one of Superplastic’s many lucrative partnerships. Guggimon also popped up in one of Fortnite’s recent seasons, not just as a skin but as a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22519431/fortnite-season-7-superman-flying-saucers-aliens">full-blown featured character</a>, appearing next to Superman. Meanwhile, Superplastic&#8217;s relationship with LINE and Kakao is already helping the characters gain a foothold in Asian markets that Kidrobot never quite pulled off.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Superplastic is also deep into the NFT phenomenon, which makes sense given Budnitz’s experience shaping the world of IRL collectibles with KidRobot. But he wasn’t always a believer. Budnitz told TechCrunch that he dismissed the phenomenon at first. “With the NFT thing, I was like nah, this shit is stupid. Suddenly I totally fucking got it all at once.&#8221; (Budnitz also initially felt the same way about Bitcoin before meeting a mysterious crypto evangelist with “really long fingernails” at an event who talked him into investing.)</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Superplastic <a href="https://www.christies.com/about-us/press-archive/details?PressReleaseID=10144&amp;lid=1">partnered with Christie’s</a> for an NFT drop through the storied auction house, complete with its own fittingly chaotic fictional narrative about two of the characters blowing up the building in the process.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220629" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220629" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2220629" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-19-at-1.48.52-PM.png?w=680" alt="Superplastic collectibles" width="680" height="309" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-19-at-1.48.52-PM.png 1557w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-19-at-1.48.52-PM.png?resize=150,68 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-19-at-1.48.52-PM.png?resize=300,136 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-19-at-1.48.52-PM.png?resize=768,349 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-19-at-1.48.52-PM.png?resize=680,309 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-19-at-1.48.52-PM.png?resize=1536,697 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-19-at-1.48.52-PM.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220629" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Superplastic</p></div></p>
<p>Superplastic dipped its toes into the wild world of digital collectibles starting in February, and now it’s running a full-blown Discord-based community known as the Jankyverse where members show off both the physical and digital figurines they’ve copped. Unlike most of the dime-a-dozen NFT projects churning out digital avatars, Superplastic developed its characters and fictional universe up front rather than tacking it on (or <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3dyem/investors-spent-millions-on-evolved-apes-nfts-then-they-got-scammed">promising to tack it on</a>) after cashing in on the speculative craze driving astronomical prices on OpenSea.</p>
<p>Superplastic is doing the NFT thing, but that’s just one channel in what’s ultimately a platform-agnostic vision. The company is all about expanding its universe of fictional chaos across mediums and it’s already cashing in on toy sales, apparel, NFTs and licensing, like collaborations with Epic Games, virtual persona pioneer <a href="https://superplastic.co/collections/gorillaz-vinyl-art-toys-collectibles">Gorillaz</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CI6BjLRFgaZ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading&amp;hl=en">Gucci</a>.</p>
<p>The characters might be also all over the place, but Budnitz is very clear that his company won’t sell bits of the IP off — even in exchange for a major partnership. The company said no to Quibi before that company’s untimely demise last year and also turned down two streaming studios that wanted to own a piece of Superplastic’s characters in perpetuity.</p>
<p>With the new investment, Superplastic will run with its plans for an animated feature film slated for 2022 starring its disturbed cast of alt-Disney characters. The company also plans to open retail shops in New York and Miami early next year to tie its digital collectibles to exclusive IRL experiences like secret areas just for NFT holders in-store.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m more interested in connecting the real world, not just doing stuff that&#8217;s all virtual,&#8221; Budnitz said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Digital traffic worldwide is increasingly done through mobile devices, and Embrace is bringing visibility to that data to companies.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many companies collect data from all of their users, but they don’t know what is good or bad data until it is collected and analyzed. Now in this increasingly mobile-first world, we use our phones for everything from apps to ordering to food to connecting with our cars.</p>
<p>Though these same companies have accelerated their digitalization to meet employees and customers where they are — up to 92% of all digital traffic worldwide is done through mobile devices — they lack visibility of this data and how it can be converted into retention and revenue.</p>
<p>That’s where <a href="https://embrace.io/">Embrace</a> comes in. Founded in 2016, the Culver City-based observability and data company launched its Data Intelligence product following the raise of $45 million in Series B funding led by New Enterprise Associates. Joining NEA in the Series B are existing investors Greycroft, AV8 and Eniac, and a group of founders from PagerDuty, SendBird, LogDNA, Scopely and Testflight. The infusion of capital gives the company $57 million, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/embrace-io/company_financials">according to Crunchbase data</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220395" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2220408" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220408" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2220408" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Embrace-App-Performance-Page.jpg" alt="Embrace's User Timeline page" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Embrace-App-Performance-Page.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Embrace-App-Performance-Page.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Embrace-App-Performance-Page.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Embrace-App-Performance-Page.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Embrace-App-Performance-Page.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Embrace-App-Performance-Page.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Embrace-App-Performance-Page.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Embrace-App-Performance-Page.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220408" class="wp-caption-text">Embrace&#8217;s User Timeline page. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Embrace</p></div></p>
<p>Its new Data Intelligence product enables organizations to make all of their mobile data accessible and actionable by their business intelligence and data science teams so that other departments, like engineering, product and marketing, can use that data to make better decisions about areas like new products and marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>It joins previous products Observability and Resolution that can be used to proactively discover, prioritize and resolve regressions.</p>
<p>“This can be used across industries and for mobile apps like games and social media, but also for the next generation of digital-first industries as more mobile and IoT devices are being used as point-of-sale systems,” Eric Futoran, CEO of Embrace, told TechCrunch. “Mobile data can be disconnected from its user and very voluminous, and our product lets people like engineers look up a year and see what happened.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Embrace has a SaaS pricing model with both free and pro/enterprise tiers. It now works with more than 100 organizations, including Hyatt, GOAT, Apprentice, Glo, TextNow, Dave and ChowNow. Not only has it grown its customer base, but it has also increased its employee count to 45, which is nearly 400% since its last funding round in 2019. Futoran intends to continue that streak, noting that it will be over 100 within the next 12 months as a result of the new funding.</p>
<p>To keep up with growth, of which annual recurring revenue increased three times over the past year, he also intends to deploy the new funds to round out the company’s leadership team, to grow on the go-to-market side for enterprise companies and continue product development.</p>
<p>Embrace aims to verticalize data for mobile devices, for which the stakes are high, as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2020/02/28/50-stats-all-marketers-must-know-about-gen-z/?sh=6dbc9a4176d0">75% of all media consumed by Gen Z is on a mobile device</a>, Futoran said.</p>
<p>“When you think about experiences with phones, our expectations have never been higher,” he added. “We are pushing the lines of AI, mobile and observability to make sense of the data. That process has to be in real time and automated so that you can figure out what it is and fix it quickly, which is hard to do on mobile. It is a natural evolution for us, and we are going to provide data for those doing the AI and ML for decision making.”</p>

Around 142 million households worldwide watched the Korean-language show about debt-ridden individuals playing a deadly game for a cash prize worth tens of millions of dollars. That makes it the most-viewed new show in Netflix history, the publication said.</p>
<p><em>Squid Game</em> captured the &#8220;cultural zeitgeist&#8221; and claimed the number 1 spot in the streaming giant&#8217;s rankings in 94 countries, including the US, Netflix has revealed. Since there&#8217;s a huge demand for all things <em>Squid Game</em>, Netflix has also announced that consumer products based on the show are now on their way to retail.</p>
<p>A few days ago, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://www.engadget.com/squid-game-documents-reveal-how-netflix-considers-a-show-successful-081058871.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">obtained</a> documents detailing the company&#8217;s scores for &#8220;impact value&#8221; and &#8220;efficiency.&#8221; Netflix has been pretty secretive on the metrics that make a title successful or not, and the documents showed how it measures series&#8217; and movies&#8217; success. <em>Squid Game</em> was a standout, generating $891.1 million in impact value, which is around 41.7 times — that&#8217;s its efficiency score — its budget of $21.4 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220816" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Thanks in part to <em>Squid Game&#8217;s</em> massive viewership, Netflix said it <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-19/netflix-tops-third-quarter-subscriber-views-sees-upbeat-fourth?sref=10lNAhZ9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">posted</a> its best subscriber growth of the year. &#8220;As the quarter continued, we saw an acceleration in our growth,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann said on the call. It welcomed 4.38 million subscribers in the third quarter, mostly from Asia and Europe, and it expects to get 8.5 million more customers in the final quarter of 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Building usable models to run AI algorithms requires not just adequate data to train systems, but also the right hardware subsequently to run them. But because the theoretical and practical are often not the same thing, there is often a gap between what data scientists may hope to do and what they practically do. Today, a startup called <a href="https://deci.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deci</a> that has built a deep learning platform to help bridge that gap &#8212; by building models that can work with the data and hardware that are available to use &#8212; is announcing some funding after finding strong traction for its products with Fortune 500 tech companies running mass-market, AI-based products based on video and other computer vision-based services.</p>
<p>The Tel Aviv-based startup has picked up a Series A of $21 million, money that it will be using to continue expanding its product and customer base. Insight Partners is leading the round, with previous backers Square Peg, Emerge and Jibe Ventures, alongside some new backers: Samsung Next, Vintage Investment Partners, and Fort Ross Ventures. Square Peg and Emerge led Deci&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/deci-raises-9-1m-to-use-ai-to-optimize-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seed round of $9.1 million a year ago</a>. It also works very closely with others who are not strategic or financial investors (but may well be down the line?). Intel collaborated with it on<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/deci-collaborates-with-intel-to-achieve-11-8x-accelerated-inference-speed-at-mlperf-301182412.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> MLPerf</a>, where Deci&#8217;s technology accelerates the inference speed of the ResNet-50 neural network when run on Intel CPUs.</p>
<p>Up to now, Deci has been focusing its attention on models for computer vision-based products, where its platform &#8212; built on its own proprietary AutoNAC (Automated Neural Architecture Construction) technology &#8212; is able to build, and continuously update, models quickly for services that might have otherwise taken longer, and a lot of trail and error, to devise.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220792" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>One key client, for example, is one of the world&#8217;s biggest and well-known videoconferencing platforms (unfortunately, name undisclosed) that is using Deci to build AI modeling so that users can blur their backgrounds in video calls. Here, all of the computing needed to execute that blurring is happening at &#8220;the edge&#8221;, on users&#8217; own CPU-based devices (that is, not typically optimized for AI workloads).</p>
<p>Yonatan Geifman, the CEO who co-founded Deci with Ran El-Yaniv and Jonathan Elial (a trio of AI specialists), said that the plan is now to start expanding from computer vision applications to another challenge, building better NLP (natural language) models, which you might need to run any kind of service with a voice interface, from personal assistants on phones or smart speakers through to audio-based search or any kind of customer service interface, for example.</p>
<p>Although Deci has picked up a lot of business by helping companies address the challenge of running AI services in a landscape of devices that are not necessarily optimized for AI, it has also found a lot of interest from organizations to use Deci to build better models for their own internal computing, even when they theoretically have the GPUs and compute power on hand to run anything. This taps into an interesting power balance that has long existed in enterprise IT and is very much getting played out in AI today, where enterprises will try to do more with the assets they have to hand, while at the same time they are regularly getting pushed to invest more in newer and more expensive and powerful equipment.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a race to larger models all the time,&#8221; Geifman said in an interview, citing the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/using-deepspeed-and-megatron-to-train-megatron-turing-nlg-530b-the-worlds-largest-and-most-powerful-generative-language-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new language model</a> announced earlier this month by Nvidia and Microsoft as one example of that evolution. &#8220;So the hardware is just not enough. In one sense, maybe that race and drive to invest in new hardware is being pushed by the hardware makers themselves, but the models <em>are</em> getting larger. There is a gap, between the algorithm and the supply of the hardware. So, we need to have some convergence based on what hardware we have. Deci is bridging or even closing that gap.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With adequate training data being another perennial problem in AI, Deci is also working to give a boost on the data side of the equation. Geifman said that Deci essentially builds synthetic data sets to supplement data when more is needed to build the models. In all cases, the product works within organizations&#8217; developer environments, data stays where it is and does not go to Deci or anywhere else in the process of building the models.</p>
<p>Alongside that Deci is also using AutoNAC to build more products. The most recent of these is DeciNets, which Deci describes as &#8220;a family of computer vision models&#8221; that essentially skip some of the work of building models from the ground up and therefore using less compute power to run.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deci is at the forefront of AI and deep learning acceleration, with highly differentiated technology that lets customers optimize blazingly fast deep learning models for inference tuned to any hardware platform,” said Lonne Jaffe, MD at Insight Partners, in a statement. “We are delighted to be part of Deci’s ScaleUp journey and look forward to supporting the company’s rapid growth.” Jaffe is joining the board with this round.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook &#8212; or whatever name the tech giant picks for a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/facebook-reportedly-plans-to-change-its-name-to-focus-on-the-metaverse/">reportedly looming rebrand of its data-mining empire</a> as it seeks to teleport its business into the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/zuckerberg-is-turning-trillion-dollar-facebook-into-a-metaverse-company-he-tells-investors/">metaverse</a> to escape the unending cavalcade of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety/">toxic publicity</a> its execs generate &#8212; has a new &#8216;bad behavior&#8217; badge to sport: It&#8217;s just been fined nearly $70 million (£50.5M) by a UK watchdog for deliberately withholding information related to ongoing antitrust oversight of its acquisition of Giphy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the first time the UK&#8217;s competition watchdog has found a company to have breached this type of order &#8212; by &#8220;consciously refusing to report all the required information&#8221;, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-fines-facebook-over-enforcement-order-breach">as it puts it</a>.</p>
<p>So that looks like an epic win for Facebook&#8217;s current PR strategy of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiA4MPr2NjzAhURCewKHRg_CpEQFnoECAUQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fm.facebook.com%2Fzuck%2Fposts%2F10113955029116581&amp;usg=AOvVaw0B23erwEIkDBpEVBjP3FsE">not giving two f***s</a> what anyone else thinks of it.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220760" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The tech giant has also of course recently acquired an expensive taste in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/21/meet-facebooks-latest-fake/">self-configured &#8216;accountability apparatus&#8217;</a> (aka the self-styled &#8216;Facebook Oversight Board&#8217;) &#8212; which may have caused it some confusion over its legal requirements to comply with actual oversight bodies that exist within democratic societies.</p>
<p>But that might be a too generous an interpretation of what Facebook is doing here.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="eNHOTq6hk7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/uks-antitrust-watchdog-takes-a-closer-look-at-facebook-giphy/">UK&#8217;s antitrust watchdog takes a closer look at Facebook-Giphy</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK&#8217;s antitrust watchdog takes a closer look at Facebook-Giphy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/uks-antitrust-watchdog-takes-a-closer-look-at-facebook-giphy/embed/#?secret=eNHOTq6hk7" data-secret="eNHOTq6hk7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The back story is that the UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has been scrutinizing Facebook&#8217;s acquisition of the animated GIF repository for well <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/12/uk-competition-watchdog-launches-investigation-into-facebooks-400m-acquisition-of-giphy/">over a year</a> now. But back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/uks-antitrust-watchdog-takes-a-closer-look-at-facebook-giphy/">April</a>, a new, in-depth phase of the probe was announced &#8212; after the regulator found concrete reasons to be concerned that Facebook owning Giphy would further reduce competition in the (already Facebook-dominated) digital advertising market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement at the time a faceless Facebook spokesperson claimed the tech giant would &#8220;continue to fully cooperate with the CMA’s investigation&#8221;. However it turns out even that Facebook claim was fake.</p>
<p>Per the CMA, Facebook has failed to follow the standard oversight process &#8212; failing to provide the regulator with required information related to an initial enforcement order (IEO) placed on it by the watchdog, despite repeated requests for it to do so.</p>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s actions are such that they have led the CMA to conclude that non-compliance was deliberate. Hence the meaty penalty for what the CMA describes as a &#8220;major&#8221; breach.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the first time a company has been found by the CMA to have breached an IEO by consciously refusing to report all the required information,&#8221; it writes. &#8220;Given the multiple warnings it gave Facebook, the CMA considers that Facebook’s failure to comply was deliberate. As a result, the CMA has issued a fine of £50 million for this major breach, which fundamentally undermined its ability to prevent, monitor and put right any issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tech giant was also criticised last year by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-welcomes-tribunal-judgment-in-facebook-and-giphy-case">Competition Appeal Tribunal</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-welcomes-court-judgment-in-facebook-and-giphy-case">Court of Appeal</a> over its lack of cooperation with the CMA &#8212; with judges calling it out over what they suggested “might be regarded as a high-risk strategy” in relation to not complying with the IEO and not keeping the CMA updated as the order required.</p>
<p>An IEO is intended to place a freeze on any further integration and ensure companies can continue to compete against each other in situations where an acquisition that&#8217;s under antitrust scrutiny has already been completed, as is the case with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/15/facebook-to-acquire-giphy-in-a-deal-reportedly-worth-400-million/">Facebook-Giphy buy</a>.</p>
<p>Facebook has been under a CMA IEO order since June 2020 in relation to its purchase of Giphy. But the watchdog said today that the tech giant &#8220;significantly limited&#8221; the scope of required updates related to its compliance with the order.</p>
<p>The concern driving what looks like an unprecedented penalty from the CMA appears to be both Facebook&#8217;s conscious flouting of standard compliance requirements, and the risk of it doing that to conceal what it&#8217;s doing with Giphy &#8212; in order to carry out activity that could, for example, make it harder for the watchdog to order a full unwinding of the acquisition &#8212; which is one of a number of <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6114d3e18fa8f53dc274c716/Facebook_GIPHY_Remedies_Notice_PV_120821.pdf">possible remedies it laid out this summer</a>. (And which Facebook <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-fights-british-watchdog-retain-gif-maker-giphy-2021-09-08/">quickly denounced</a> in a highly critical public response that also questioned the authority of the CMA to regulate the purchase at all.)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another tidbit here too: The CMA has also issued a separate fine &#8212; stinging Facebook a further £500,000 for changing its Chief Compliance Officer on two separate occasions without first seeking consent from the regulator.</p>
<p>Commenting on the action in a statement, Joel Bamford, senior director of mergers at the CMA, said: &#8220;We warned Facebook that its refusal to provide us with important information was a breach of the order but, even after losing its appeal in two separate courts, Facebook continued to disregard its legal obligations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This should serve as a warning to any company that thinks it is above the law,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Explaining the IEO requirement Bamford also said: &#8220;Initial enforcement orders are a key part of the UK’s voluntary merger control regime. Companies are not required to seek CMA approval before they complete an acquisition but, if they decide to go ahead with a merger, we can stop the companies from integrating further if we think consumers might be affected and an investigation is needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Facebook was contacted for a response to the CMA penalties &#8212; and in statement it criticized the action as &#8220;unfair&#8221;, claiming it had sought to take a &#8220;best effort compliance approach&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We strongly disagree with the CMA’s unfair decision to punish Facebook for a best effort compliance approach, which the CMA itself ultimately approved. We will review the CMA’s decision and consider our options,” said Facebook&#8217;s unnamed spokesperson.</p>
<p>The company also provided some &#8220;background&#8221; information that it said this was not for direct quoting or for attribution &#8212; so we won&#8217;t be publishing it.</p>
<p>Instead, here&#8217;s a GIF:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.hash.com.br/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a payment infrastructure fintech, announced today that it has raised $40 million in a Series C funding round co-led by QED Investors and Kaszek.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The raise comes just six months after the Brazilian startup raised $15 million in Series B financing led by Alexandria, Virginia-based QED, and brings its total raised to nearly $59 million since its 2017 inception. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endeavor Scale-Up Ventures also put money in the round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hash offers “end-to-end” payment infrastructure for non-financial B2B companies looking to offer banking services &#8212; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">from point-of-sale (POS) software and mobile applications to dashboards and payments. Its</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> white-label software builds customized payment services, focusing on B2B companies with large customer chains and partners.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220391" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engineer João Miranda, founder and CEO of Hash, said that since the company&#8217;s last raise, it has grown its number of transactions by “6x” while doubling its client base to 16. Over the past year, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hash has seen 10x growth in POS transactions, and Miranda anticipates it will top $275 million in total payment volume by year’s end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s self-proclaimed mission is to “decentralize” financial services, with an emphasis on SMEs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We provide financial infrastructure for B2B companies to embed payments solutions into their own custom ecosystems,” he said. “By doing this, those companies are offering better, and more competitive, solutions for SMBs inside their ecosystem.”</span></p>
<p>Hash&#8217;s 16 direct customers use its infrastructure to provide financial services to their own customers, which are SMEs. Currently, more than 16,000 SMEs are using its software.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hash, according to Miranda, aims to offer a “complete” payment services infrastructure with the goal of helping provide businesses with a new source of revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We understand that each sector, each ecosystem in the market, has its own specificities and necessities,” he told TechCrunch. “That’s why we use proprietary technology, capable of adapting to different market verticals.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup plans to use its new capital to grow “even further” in the markets it’s already in, either geographically or by segment. Today, Hash operates only in Brazil. Its goal is to expand throughout the &#8220;entire national territory, which is huge and has great growth potential,&#8221; Miranda said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Down the line, it wants to enable more financial services on top of its payments volume, such as credit, loans and card issuance infrastructure. Hash also plans, as most startups that have raised funding, to do more hiring. It’s already grown its headcount to nearly 170 compared to 74 a year ago. Its goal is to have 190 employees by year’s end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Santiago Fossatti, a partner at Kaszek, believes that Hash is “capable of solving several pains” in the industry while still “adding real value” to the business of its customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hash is on its way to play an important role in the payments industry and become a reference in Latin America,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Calling the market opportunity “massive,” QED Investors partner Mike Packer believes that the main difference between Hash and others in the space is its “ability to combine the best technology with a unique perspective of how to integrate payments into their partners’ business models.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.bulletproof.ai/">Resistant AI</a>, which uses artificial intelligence to help financial services companies combat fraud and financial crime &#8212; selling tools to protect credit risk scoring models, payment systems, customer onboarding and more &#8212; has closed $16.6 million in Series A funding.</p>
<p>GV (formerly Google Ventures) led the round, with participation from existing investors Index Ventures (led by partner Jan Hammer), Credo Ventures (led by Ondrej Bartos and Vladislav Jez) and Seedcamp, plus several unnamed angel investors specializing in financial technology and security.</p>
<p>The 2019-founded, Prague-based startup says the funding will be used to meet rising demand from global financial institutions, including by building out its product, engineering, and sales operations teams beyond its existing footprint &#8212; which also includes offices in London and New York.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219303" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup tells TechCrunch it has 30 customers signed up at this stage to use its dedicated anti-fraud security products &#8212; which include machine learning detection of fraudulent documents and AI for spotting problematic patterns of transactions.</p>
<p>Collectively its customers, which include banks, insurance companies and fintechs &#8212; it can&#8217;t name the biggest but names the likes of KBC, Payoneer, Habito and Twisto &#8212; are processing tens of millions of transactions per month, it also said, adding that in its home market of the Czech Republic it&#8217;s now working with banks that have a combined 50% marketshare.</p>
<p>To give a taster of the problem it&#8217;s tackling, the startup says that assessment of customer data it&#8217;s acquired and reviewed indicates: 17% of bank statement that are used for lending applications, &#8216;Know Your Customer&#8217; regulations and other purposes are tampered with; 11% of UK payslips submitted as part of digital loan applications are altered or forged; 15% of company registration certificates submitted worldwide when opening a bank account are fakes; and 9% of utility bills submitted as a proof of address worldwide are forged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our mission is to create an intelligent shield for autonomous financial systems, to protect them against these ever-evolving, ever-smarter attacks,&#8221; adds CEO Martin Rehak in a statement. &#8220;That’s the only way we can avoid epidemic fraud, mountains of manual reviews and four-factor authentication on every single online service.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In another supporting statement, Tom Hulme, general partner at GV, said: &#8220;Resistant AI&#8217;s founding team has unique expertise in applying AI and machine learning to detect complex and evasive behavior. Early customer traction demonstrates an ability to uncover unknown threats, and reliably categorize and reduce false alerts with transparent, explainable and verifiable detection models.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You’ve heard of Neo-banks. Meet the Neo-lender. One of the newest is London-based <a href="https://proportunity.co/">Proportunity</a>. It’s now raised a $150m mixed debt and equity funding round ($7 million equity financing and $143 million in debt), on top of its $10m debt round in 2020.</p>
<p>The round was led by VentureFriends, Kibo Ventures, and existing investors Anthemis, Entrepreneur First as well as new UK proptech investors Amro Partners.  The startup plans to use this funding to grow its team, as well as increase its maximum loan size from £90,000 up to £150,000 per home.</p>
<p>Some 85% of renters in the UK want to own their own home, but can’t because of high deposit requirements and rapidly rising house prices.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219740" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Proportunity says it provides home buyers with a home purchase equity loan, similar to the UK government’s &#8216;Help to Buy’ scheme, but available for any home not just new builds. It allows them to afford homes with only a 5% deposit, reducing the amount they need in savings. The Proportunity equity loan of up to £150,000 or 25% of the house price, sits on top of the maximum mortgage they get from a mainstream lender. The equity loan, in addition to the mortgage of up to 4.5x income, means they can effectively borrow up to six times their income.</p>
<p>The company says it can do this through its machine learning that helps identify fair valued homes in high potential growth areas, de-risking lending, and removing the need for a large deposit.</p>
<p>Vadim Toader, CEO and co-founder said: “In the UK there is a £100-200k gap between what buyers want and what they can afford, mainly caused by lenders restricting what they will lend to a maximum of 4.5x income and high deposit requirements. Combine this with growing house prices and the need for an extra bedroom in the new ‘work from home’ environment and it’s easy to see that buyers are facing a losing battle.”</p>
<p>VentureFriends partner, George Dimopoulos said: “In Proportunity we saw a product that can positively impact the lives of thousands of FHBs.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Proportunity has three main competitors: Generation Home &#8211; a new spin on guarantor mortgages, which largely helps structure financial help from family/friends. Wayhome (a.k.a Unmortgage) offers a private version of shared ownership which combines renting with a mortgage desposit.</p>

But, no, that’s precisely and exactly <em>not</em> what happened. So we dug in.</li>

Per our cybersecurity expert, all sorts of personal information can “be pulled from a person’s phone because of a security issue in widely used consumer-grade spyware.”</li>

<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>What is a startup? Recently there was fresh debate on this evergreen topic on Twitter. Perhaps we should just say that any company that has <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1450208056520892423">raised $50 million is no longer a startup</a>? It’s something else? Something between a startup and a unicorn?</p>
<p>I bring all that up because I have no idea what to call Instacart. Not really. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/instacart-acquires-caper-ai-a-smart-cart-and-instant-checkout-startup-for-350m-as-it-moves-deeper-into-physical-retail-tech/">just dropped $350 million to buy a different startup</a> — part of a deeper move into the technology powering physical retail — but perhaps both companies were not startups? Something to ponder. (Feel free to respond to this email with what you consider the “no longer a startup” line, if you want. I will see it.)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/gorillas-grabs-close-to-1bn-series-c-values-the-on-demand-grocery-delivery-biz-at-2-1bn/">OK, but surely companies that raise $1 billion rounds are not startups?</a> </strong>That would make Gorillas <em>not </em>a startup. Yes, the Berlin-based on-demand grocery delivery and dark store operator just raised nearly a flat-billion in a single round, valuing the company at just over $2 billion. Given the somewhat modest valuation figure next to the raise amount, we have questions, but the investment is still net-bullish for the current boom in grocery delivery startup activity that we’ve seen.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/bluepallet-raises-5m-to-take-its-chemical-industry-marketplace-global/"><strong>BluePallet proves that there are infinite spaces for tech startups to build:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Per our own <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann Azevedo</a>, BluePallet is an “online marketplace connecting manufacturers with the chemical industry,” and just raised $5 million. Think about all the other industries that could use better links to manufacturers. I mean, there’s at least another few dozen vertical SaaS plays there, right?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/electric-it-infrastructure-90-million-series-d-funding/"><strong>ITaaS:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If you are familiar with Justworks’ HR efforts, you will understand Electric. It’s Justworks for IT. Justworks, in case you are not familiar, does HR stuff for other companies. Electric does that for IT, and it just raised $90 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/figma-continues-expansion-beyond-design-with-updates-to-figjam-white-board-tool/"><strong>Figma cuts price of its whiteboard tool:</strong></a> Figma is best known for its design software, but the company has also built a whiteboard tool called FigJam. It competes with Mural, we reckon. Regardless, Figma wants more folks to use it, so it’s cutting the price. Given that we tend to see software prices move the <em>other</em> direction, this stood out to us. <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanrcrook">Jordan Crook</a>, who covered the news item, connected it to a larger product expansion narrative forming at Figma.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/mage-aims-to-be-the-stripe-for-ai-raises-6-3m-for-developer-tools-to-build-ai-into-apps/"><strong>AIaaS:</strong></a> A startup called Mage wants to offer AI tooling that product teams can use, without having to go beg for help from scarce data science resources. And the company just landed $6.3 million for its efforts. Mage fits into the software theme we’ve been tracking for some time of tech products working to help non-developers be able to do more on their own.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/wonolo-raises-140m-for-its-staffing-platform-used-by-1m-laborers-and-front-line-workers/"><strong>Wonolo proves that building for regulars can be big business:</strong></a><strong> </strong>While it’s in vogue to build software tooling for rarified fields, everyone needs a little help. Wonolo is proof that you can build for non-engineers, say, and still do well. The company, which focuses on helping hourly workers book jobs, just raised nine figures.</li>
<li>And because their team asked nicely, <a href="https://twitter.com/CarlyPage_">Carly Page</a> covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/19/soc-prime-lands-11m-series-a-to-become-spotify-for-cyber-threats/">the recent SOC Prime round for us</a>. The Boston-based startup working in the threat detection market just raised $11 million.</li>

<h2>How our startup boosted productivity with ‘get s*** done’ day</h2>
<p>One day every other week, Travelpayouts&#8217; “employees define clear-cut goals and receive specific, usually non-trivial, tasks with little to no communication involved,” writes Travelpayouts head Ivan Baidin.</p>
<p>Getting S*** Done Day allowed the team to address “sidelined” projects that may have seemed like small potatoes: rebuilding lifecycle emails, improving analytics and optimizing working hours.</p>
<p>Completing each of these “eternally postponed” tasks created incremental gains, says Baidin. “That is something we value a lot.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The former head of the Facebook app, who reported directly to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Fidji Simo, defended the social network at the start of an interview at the <a href="https://www.wsjtechlive.com/">WSJ Tech Live</a> event this afternoon. The exec was there to discuss her <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/instacart-hires-facebook-executive-as-new-ceo-ahead-of-expected-ipo/">new role as Instacart CEO</a> and her vision for the future of food delivery, but was asked to comment on the recent Facebook whistleblower&#8217;s testimony and the attention it has since raised.</p>
<p>Simo said she understood the scrutiny given Facebook&#8217;s impact on people&#8217;s lives. But she&#8217;s also worried that Facebook will never be able to do enough to appease its critics at this point, despite the complexity of the issues Facebook is grappling with as one of the world&#8217;s largest social networks.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are spending billions of dollars in keeping people safe. They are doing the most in-depth research of any company I know to understand their impact,&#8221; she argued, still very much on Facebook&#8217;s side, despite her recent departure. &#8220;And I think my worry is that people want &#8216;yes&#8217; or &#8216;no&#8217; answers to this question, but really these questions require a lot of nuance,&#8221; she added.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220593" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>While the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">whistleblower, Frances Haugen, suggested</a> that Facebook&#8217;s decision to prioritize user engagement through its algorithms was ultimately putting profits over people, Simo cautioned the choices weren&#8217;t quite as binary as have been described to date. She explained that making changes based on the research Facebook had invested in wasn&#8217;t just a matter of turning a dial and &#8220;all of a sudden, magically problems disappear &#8212; because Facebook is fundamentally a reflection of humanity,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2175265" style="width: 409px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2175265" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2175265" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fidji-Simo-For-Newswire.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="399" height="224" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fidji-Simo-For-Newswire.jpg 1953w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fidji-Simo-For-Newswire.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fidji-Simo-For-Newswire.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fidji-Simo-For-Newswire.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fidji-Simo-For-Newswire.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fidji-Simo-For-Newswire.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Fidji-Simo-For-Newswire.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2175265" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instacart</p></div></p>
<p>Instead, Simo said that the real issues at Facebook were around how every change Facebook makes can have significant societal applications at this point. It has to work to determine how it can improve upon the potentially problematic areas of its business without incidentally affecting other things along the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we discuss trade-offs, it&#8217;s usually trade-offs between two types of societal impacts,&#8221; she noted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As an example, Simo used what would seem like a fairly straightforward adjustment to make: determine which posts make Facebook users angry then show people less of those.</p>
<p>As Haugen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">had testified</a>, Facebook&#8217;s algorithms have been designed to reward engagement. That means posts with &#8220;likes&#8221; and other interactions spread more widely and are distributed higher up in people&#8217;s News Feeds. But she also said engagement doesn&#8217;t just come from likes and positive reactions. Engagement-based algorithms will ultimately prioritize clickbait and posts that make people angry. This, in turn, can help to boost the spread of posts eliciting stronger reactions, like misinformation or even toxic and violent content.</p>
<p>Simo, however, said it&#8217;s not as simple as it sounds to just dial down the anger across Facebook, as doing so would lead to another type of societal impact.</p>
<p>&#8220;You start digging in and you realize that the biggest societal movements were created out of anger,&#8221; she said. That led the company to question how it could make a change that could impact people&#8217;s activism.</p>
<p>(This isn&#8217;t quite how that situation unfolded, according <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-algorithm-change-zuckerberg-11631654215?mod=article_inline">to a report by the WSJ</a>. Instead, when the algorithm was tweaked to prioritize personal posts over professionally produced content, publishers and political parties adjusted their posts toward outrage and sensationalism. And Zuckerberg resisted some of the proposed fixes to this problem, the report said.)</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just a random example,&#8221; Simo said of the &#8220;anger&#8221; problem. &#8220;But literally, on every issue, there is always a trade-off that is another type of societal impact. And I can tell you for having been in these rooms for many, many years, it&#8217;s really never about like, &#8216;oh, are we doing the right thing for society, versus the right thing for Facebook and for profits&#8217;&#8230;the debate was really between some kinds of societal impact and another kind &#8212; which is a very hard debate to have as a private company.&#8221;</p>
<p>This, she added, was why Facebook wanted regulations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not surprising that Facebook has been calling for regulation in this space for a very long time because they never want to be in a position of being the ones deciding which implications, which ramifications, which trade-offs they need to make between one type of societal impact and another type of societal impact. The governments are better positioned to do that,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Given the increasing amount of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">evidence</a> coming out that Facebook itself understood, through its own internal research, that there were areas of its business that negatively impact society, Simo didn&#8217;t chalk up her departure from the social network to anything that was going on with Facebook itself.</p>
<p>Instead, she said she just wasn&#8217;t learning as much after 10 years with the company, and Instacart presented her with a great opportunity where she could learn &#8220;a different set of things,&#8221; she said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are many in the world of AI who worry about its implications. One of those people is Navrina Singh, a former product manager for Qualcomm, then Microsoft, who saw firsthand at Microsoft how a Twitter bot it developed in 2016 as an experiment in &#8220;conversational understanding,&#8221; was, to quote The Verge, &#8220;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist">taught to be a racist asshole in less than a day</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Microsoft&#8217;s mishap is but one of a long string of examples of AI gone wrong. In 2019, an algorithm sold by the health services company Optum to predict which patients will benefit from extra medical care was found by researchers to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/24/racial-bias-medical-algorithm-favors-white-patients-over-sicker-black-patients/">badly misjudge</a> the health needs of the sickest Black patients. Credit-scoring AI systems have repeatedly been found to be <a href="https://www.tfir.io/new-study-suggests-sexist-ai-contributes-to-the-17-billion-gender-credit-gap/">sexist</a>.</p>
<p>While many larger companies have assembled teams to tackle the ethical problems arising from the massive troves of data they collect, then used to train their machine learning models, progress on this front has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/15/technology/artificial-intelligence-google-bias.html">hardly been smooth</a>. In the meantime, smaller AI-powered companies that can&#8217;t afford teams of individuals are largely winging it.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220555" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Enter Singh&#8217;s company, <a href="https://www.credo.ai/">Credo AI</a>, a SaaS outfit that&#8217;s today taking the wraps off $5.5 million in funding that it raised from Decibel, Village Global and AI Fund.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s promise is pretty straightforward as she explains it, even as it&#8217;s managing the complex. Singh and her current team of 15 employees have developed a risk framework that gives companies a window into their own governance. It&#8217;s not so much that the startup&#8217;s tech is revolutionary (is our understanding) but rather that Credo AI addresses what is often a lack of accountability within organizations by giving them a control panel with the tools to manage all manner of data they are collecting, as well as suggest controls they might not be using, like IEEE standards they can integrate to provide stronger guardrails for their machine learning models.</p>
<p>&#8220;What many companies haven&#8217;t really figured out is that there is a lack of common language and alignment on what &#8216;good&#8217; looks like in AI governance, so organizations are really looking for help with that standardization,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>Credo AI&#8217;s software is not a one-size-fits all offering, Singh notes. Different organizations see different impacts from their models, and even within so-called industry verticals, individual companies often have different objectives. &#8220;Fairness is not defined within different sectors,&#8221; says Singh, who points as an example to financial services, where much is getting redefined on an ongoing basis by federal banking agencies. &#8220;What is fairness for fraud mean? What is fairness for credit underwriting?&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Rather than wait for answers, says Singh, Credo AI works with companies to align on what their own values are, then it offers them the tools to manage accordingly, including to add additional metrics when they choose, and different stakeholders. &#8220;We want to enable your data science team to collaborate with your compliance team, your executive to collaborate with your machine-earning person, your product manager to collaborate with your risk manager,&#8221; says Singh.</p>
<p>Credo AI want to help companies avoid those face-palm moments &#8212; or worse.</p>
<p>Certainly, it&#8217;s a big market opportunity. According to data published earlier this year by the International Data Corporation (IDC), worldwide revenue for the AI market, including software, hardware and services, was expected to grow 16.4% year over year in 2021, to $327.5 billion. By 2024, said IDC, the market is expected to break the $500 billion mark.</p>
<p>As companies spend more on AI, they&#8217;ll presumably need more help to make sure it&#8217;s performing the way they expect and not causing harm. Indeed, if Singh has her way, working with Credo AI will one day serve as a kind of stamp that companies use to advertise their focus on ethical AI.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we do our jobs right,&#8221; says Singh, &#8220;I want anyone who&#8217;s building good AI to be associated with Credo AI. That is certainly our aspiration.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Without a good technical foundation, you may end up accumulating a lot of technical debt.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Having a great idea isn’t enough when you’re starting a startup. You have to execute well on that idea by making the right decisions at the right time. In particular, you have to pick the right tech stack for your product. Without a good technical foundation, you can end up accumulating a lot of technical debt.</p>
<p>So to help founders understand what a good tech stack should look like, we invited two experts on this topic, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/preeti-somal">Preeti Somal</a>, the EVP of Engineering at <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com">HashiCorp</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jill-wetzler">Jill Wetzler</a>, the VP of Engineering at <a href="https://pilot.com">Pilot</a>, to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> to discuss everything from evaluating vendors to making sure you can rely on an open source product.</p>
<h2>Making sure your team can ship quickly</h2>
<p>Some development environments are more familiar than others. For instance, if you choose to work with a popular framework, it’ll be easier to find engineers to join your team, and the learning curve will be easier for your existing developers.</p>
<p>Your tech stack isn’t limited to the language your team is using. Choosing a good CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous delivery) framework can help you release updates more frequently. Using test suites is also a key element of a good development pipeline.</p>
<p>&#8220;I looked at how we were thinking about developer productivity and our environment. What are the things that can help our team move really fast and ship really fast? Because I think that is the name of the game when you&#8217;re talking about a startup. It just comes down to how you can get your code out the door as quickly as possible,&#8221; Wetzler said.</p>
<p>Wetzler knows what she&#8217;s talking about on this front as she experienced the <i>opposite</i> of that in a previous job when she was working for Twitter. &#8220;Twitter was making some decisions that I think were based on some people&#8217;s personal preferences at the time. We started to fork our own versions of git and our build system as well. It just became a mess that had to be untangled over a number of years. And so you really do pay for those decisions down the line,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The ability to reuse your code across different platforms can also help you manage multiple projects more easily. That can be important if you’re in charge of the roadmap and you want to have some visibility when you’re planning the next quarter.</p>
<p>“We had done a really good job of making some investments in our back-end productivity. But when it came to front end, we were really missing a lot of the key infrastructure pieces that helped us build a front end really quickly,” Wetzler said. She worked on fixing that when she joined Pilot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NASA and Boeing provided an update on the beleaguered Starliner capsule Tuesday, confirming that the earliest the spacecraft will fly will be sometime during the first half of next year. Starliner was grounded in August, after an issue with the oxidizer valves was discovered roughly four and a half hours before launch.</p>
<p>The launch was part of an uncrewed test flight, dubbed Orbital Flight Test-2 (OFT-2), the second for Starliner. Since the issue was discovered, Boeing has still been unable to identify the root cause of why 13 of the 24 valves in the propulsion system remained stuck in the closed position during routine pre-mission activities.</p>
<p>Two valves have been removed from the spacecraft and sent to NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, where they will be disassembled and examined for further investigation, Michelle Parker, Boeing’s chief engineer of space and launch, said during a media briefing Tuesday.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220599" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Launchpad hiccups indefinitely delay Boeing&#8217;s troubled Starliner orbital test&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/launchpad-hiccups-indefinitely-delay-boeings-troubled-starliner-orbital-test/embed/#?secret=M6F0cERslV" data-secret="M6F0cERslV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In 2014, NASA awarded Boeing and SpaceX each contracts for six round-trip crewed missions to the International Space Station under its Commercial Crew Program (CCP). The agency is going through both contracts to potentially add even more flights to each company’s roster, particularly in light of the likely extension of the operational life of the ISS past 2024, Steve Stich, NASA’s manager of CCP, said in the media briefing. The eventual schedule could see each company ferrying astronauts to and from the station once a year.</p>
<p>NASA maintains “every confidence that Boeing will be flying crew soon,” Stich said. “We’ll get this problem solved and then we’ll have two space transportation systems like we want, with Boeing and SpaceX both flying [ … ] I have no reason to believe Boeing won’t be successful.”</p>
<p>Even once Boeing gets Starliner back to the launch pad, Boeing’s CCP program manager John Vollmer estimated it would be around six months between a successful OFT-2 and a crewed mission. He added that the cost of the valve investigation and launch delay will be borne by Boeing, not NASA.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is the second launch attempt for Starliner, after OFT-1 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/boeings-starliner-crew-capsule-fails-to-enter-planned-target-orbit-for-space-station-docking/">failed to enter the target orbit</a> in a 2019 launch due to a software issue. SpaceX, the other contractor selected under NASA’s CCP, has flown three crewed missions with its Crew Dragon capsule and will conduct a fourth on Halloween.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Alongside today&#8217;s release of the new Pixel 6 smartphones, Google has again upgraded one of the device&#8217;s most basic &#8212; but often overlooked &#8212; functions: the ability to make phone calls. In previous years, Google Assistant learned to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/09/googles-pixels-get-a-feature-drop-with-call-screen-and-camera-enhancements/">screen your calls</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/09/google-duplex-is-coming-to-pixel-phones-next-month/">make your reservations by phone</a> via a technology called Duplex. Last year, it learned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/a-new-google-assistant-feature-hold-for-me-waits-on-hold-so-you-dont-have-to/">how to wait on hold for you</a>, too. Today, Google is <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/phone-app-updates/">expanding</a> some of these existing features and adding new ones &#8212; including a tool that shows you the best time to call a business and a new Duplex-powered feature for navigating businesses&#8217; phone trees.</p>
<p>With the Phone app on Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, a new feature called &#8220;Wait Times&#8221; will display the projected time it will take to get through to a person when dialing a toll-free number. You&#8217;ll be able to see this information before you place the call not only for the present time, but also for the rest of the week. This information may allow you to make a better decision about when to place the call.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220563" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220563" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2220563" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dialer_P6-Marketing_Wait-Times.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220563" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220540" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Of course, in order to show this information, Google is leveraging its ability to collect data from its users. Similar to how Google Maps will show you when a business is the most crowded using anonymized data from Maps users, &#8220;Wait Times&#8221; are inferred from call length data when calls are placed through its phone app. This data is not linked to individual users, Google says.</p>
<p>Another new addition is the &#8220;Direct My Call&#8221; feature, which will help you get through complicated phone trees when you dial a business. Instead of listening and trying to remember the many options presented (e.g., &#8220;Press 1 for hours and locations&#8221;), Google Assistant will translate the automated messages for you. This allows you to read back through the options to see which number you&#8217;ll want to tap to get the information you need &#8212; or to reach a live agent, as is often the case.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220562" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220562" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2220562 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dialer_P6-Marketing_Direct-My-Call.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220562" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>In the past, users frustrated with difficult customer service calls may have turned to third-party apps and websites like <a href="https://gethuman.com/">GetHuman</a>, to figure out how to reach a real person more quickly. But these websites aren&#8217;t always up to date. &#8220;Direct My Call&#8221; offers an alternative. You could multitask or even set your phone down while the various options are read aloud &#8212; something that&#8217;s tedious to have to listen to in real time. When you return to the phone, you&#8217;ll be able to read the options available and choose the one you need. (The feature could also help those who are hard of hearing, but who don&#8217;t yet require a <a href="http://www.abouttty.com/">TTY</a>.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Like the the earlier reservation-setting feature, &#8220;Direct My Call&#8221; is also powered by Google Duplex technology.</p>
<p>Duplex is sometimes confused with the reservation scheduling feature itself, which was one of the first big use cases for the technology when it debuted. But <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html">Duplex itself</a> doesn&#8217;t just enable natural-sounding conversations for making your appointments. It can be used for understanding, too. In the case of &#8220;Direct My Call,&#8221; for example, Duplex uses advanced speech recognition and language understanding models to help determine when the business wants you to do something &#8212; like press a number, say a word (like &#8220;representative&#8221;) or enter your account number, among other things.</p>
<p>In addition to &#8220;Direct My Call&#8221; and &#8220;Wait Times,&#8221; which are launching with the Pixel devices, for the time being, Google is also expanding access to &#8220;Hold for Me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since launching last year in the U.S., the feature has saved users over 1.5 million minutes per month. In the coming months, it will begin to roll out to Pixel users in Australia, Canada and Japan, as well, says Google.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2220561" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220561" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2220561" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dialer_P6-Marketing_Caller-ID-Tag.max-1000x1000-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dialer_P6-Marketing_Caller-ID-Tag.max-1000x1000-1.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dialer_P6-Marketing_Caller-ID-Tag.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dialer_P6-Marketing_Caller-ID-Tag.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dialer_P6-Marketing_Caller-ID-Tag.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dialer_P6-Marketing_Caller-ID-Tag.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dialer_P6-Marketing_Caller-ID-Tag.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dialer_P6-Marketing_Caller-ID-Tag.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dialer_P6-Marketing_Caller-ID-Tag.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dialer_P6-Marketing_Caller-ID-Tag.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dialer_P6-Marketing_Caller-ID-Tag.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220561" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Google&#8217;s existing call screening functions are also getting an upgrade.</p>
<p>Before, Google&#8217;s own caller ID coverage would help <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/09/googles-pixels-get-a-feature-drop-with-call-screen-and-camera-enhancements/">users to identify spam and other calls</a> from unknown numbers. Now, it will allow users to contribute data about their incoming business calls, too. That means you&#8217;ll be able to share what type of business had called you (e.g., bill collectors, finance, utilities, etc.) so that others who receive the same call in the future will know what to expect. This data is shared without any personal identifiers, notes Google. The company believes this will help double the number of businesses with caller ID information going forward.</p>
<p>In addition, call screening will expand to more markets. In the U.S., Canada and Japan, it&#8217;s now screening 37 million calls per month. Starting today, it will roll out to Pixel users in the U.K., France, Germany, Australia, Ireland, Italy and Spain, too.</p>
<p>Typically, Google releases new features to its latest Pixel phones first, before rolling them out over time to more Pixel devices or Android more broadly. That means &#8220;Wait Times&#8221; and &#8220;Direct My Call&#8221; will likely be exclusive to Pixel 6 phones for some time, initially.</p>
