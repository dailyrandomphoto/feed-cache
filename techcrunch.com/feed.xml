										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://alviere.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alviere</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an embedded finance startup that aims to help any brand deliver financial products and services to its customers and employees, announced today it has closed $70 million of new funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April, New York-based Alviere closed a $20 million Series A led by Viola Ventures and Viola Fintech, with the participation of CommerzVentures, Mitsubishi Capital Corporation, Wix.com Capital, Draper Triangle Ventures, Cross River Bank Capital, CERCA Partners and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, just six months later, the startup is announcing an additional $50 million in Series B investment. Unnamed institutional fintech investors led the latest financing, which included participation from existing backers Viola Ventures, Viola Fintech and CommerzVentures, as well as Cleveland-based North Coast Ventures. Opera Tech Ventures, the VC arm of BNP Paribas, also put money in the round. Alviere has now raised a total of $71 million since its 2017 inception.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216333" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embedded finance is a hot topic these days and it feels like we’re seeing a growing number of rounds in the space. Just last week, TechCrunch reported that Productfy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a banking-as-a-service (BaaS) company that aims to build “DeFi for traditional finance,” </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/08/productfy-raises-16m-to-build-the-shopify-of-embedded-finance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $16 million in a Series A round of funding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led by CM Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yuval Brisker, CEO and co-founder of Alviere, started the company with Pedro Silva a few years after having </span><a href="https://news.yahoo.com/oracle-buys-toa-technologies-pull-170015173.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sold his previous company, TOA Technologies, to Oracle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a deal rumored to have valued it at over $500 million. (TOA was a Cleveland, Ohio, cloud-based enterprise software company.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is loathe, though, to slap the BaaS label on his newest startup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re doing embedded finance, which is as big or bigger than BaaS,” Brisker told TechCrunch.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever you want to call it, the market for embedded finance is massive and expected to grow worldwide to become a $7.2 trillion market by 2030, according to a forecast from</span><a href="https://www.simon-torrance.com/blog/EmbeddedFinance1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Simon Torrance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Last year, the banking-as-a-service market alone was valued at $356 billion, according to</span><a href="https://www.verifiedmarketresearch.com/product/banking-as-a-service-baas-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Verified Market Research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The foundations of Alviere were born out of an attempt to build a payment app to exchange money without exchanging personal information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We quickly learned that was not an easy undertaking,” he recalls. “But we built for ourselves, we realized we could white label and sell to others.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But instead of building a consumer app, the team decided to package the solution &#8212; dubbed The HIVE &#8212; to businesses or brands to be able to launch any financial service on their own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how is this different from BaaS?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I look at BaaS offerings, it is usually selling technology to tech mavens who can use it to actually either accelerate the ability to build financial products or embed those products in their software or technology,” Brisker said. “That’s not what we’re doing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, he added, Alviere is going more mainstream and after brands that don’t currently offer any financial technology and don’t know how to do it but might have an existing loyal customer base. By using Alviere, those customers would be able to go to customers, he said, and say, “Hey, we now offer a bank account.” And rather than a partnering bank owning the customers, the actual brand would own the customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brisker doesn’t see Alviere’s offering as a threat to banks. His argument is that by removing the “pain” of having to deal with customers, banks can actually improve profitability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When you take away a lot of the customer service components you&#8217;re going to have a much more efficient operation, and they&#8217;ll still be able to have the deposits and the lender loans,” he told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alviere plans to use its new capital in part to expand beyond North America (it is licensed in &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">almost&#8221; all 50 U.S. states) to Europe and Latin America. The goal is to provide financial services to a new cohort of users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortune 500 companies are Alviere’s target, and so far, it has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">closed deals with two unnamed brands that each have more than 10 million household subscribers or customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The startup’s business model relies on its customers&#8217; success, according to Brisker. Basically, it shares the revenue it makes with its customers, which will make money each time on interchange fees each time a branded credit card is swiped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re deeply embedded in their business on multiple levels,” Brisker said. “Embedded finance technology is taking the decentralization of financial services to the next level. Now any brand with an existing customer base &#8212; be it a telco, a retailer, a shoe company, an automobile company, a marketplace &#8212; will be able to deliver financial products and services to its customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims that by using its software, brands can start lucrative lines of businesses that can allow them to deliver “everything personal finance” to their customers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial services that Alviere’s HIVE enables brands to embed in their business include direct deposit FDIC Insured checking and savings accounts; credit, debit, prepaid and gift cards; payment services; domestic and international money transfers; loyalty programs and cash pick up and deposits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omry Ben David, general partner at Viola Ventures, said his firm had been proactively looking to make a play in the embedded finance space for “quite some time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As legacy fintech investors for the past 20 years, we believe consumer financial services are undergoing a tectonic shift and that the next consumer banking revolution will be for established brands to offer bespoke, well-crafted financial services to their existing, and new, loyal audiences,” he wrote via e-mail. “Be it a checking/savings account, branded credit card, loyalty or gift cards, BNPL loans, digital payments services, remittance, etc. – all ‘programmed’ and inter-connected to suit a specific consumer segment, geography and/or need. No more &#8216;one size fits all.&#8217; ”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Carving out 45 minutes or an hour for a workout can be difficult between work, home and daily life. Digital fitness and wellness company <a href="https://fitonapp.com/">FitOn</a> was created to provide 15- or 20-minute workouts aimed at getting people moving in whatever time they can make.</p>
<p>The company closed on an $18 million Series B round of funding, led by Delta-v Capital, with participation from existing investors Accel, Telstra Ventures, Crosscut Ventures, Maverick Ventures and Second Avenue Partners.</p>
<p>The funding comes as the Los Angeles-based company hits 10 million members for its app that offers personalized fitness and wellness programs and a unique social experience from trainers likes Orangetheory Fitness, KINRGY and Zumba, and even some celebrity ambassadors like Gabrielle Union, Julianne Hough, Halle Berry, Jonathan Van Ness and The Chainsmokers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216126" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Founded by the husband-and-wife team of former Fitbit executive Lindsay Cook and AllTrails founder Russell Cook, the app launched two years ago with a mission of what CEO Lindsay Cook called a “democratization of digital fitness.”</p>
<p>“I was super immersed in the category and working at a fitness company, but found that I did not have a lot of time for fitness myself,” she said. “I was underwhelmed by some of the apps, which were not premium products and had so many barriers to entry, like expensive bikes or hardware equipment. I saw a change to democratize fitness when I saw that no one was going after the mass market.”</p>
<p>She teamed up with her husband, who had spent 20 years in digital products, to put together a health and fitness app that would do what AllTrails did for outdoors and what Calm did for meditation, Cook added.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216132" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216132" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2216132" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FitOn_Fullscreen_2021-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FitOn_Fullscreen_2021-1.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FitOn_Fullscreen_2021-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FitOn_Fullscreen_2021-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FitOn_Fullscreen_2021-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FitOn_Fullscreen_2021-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FitOn_Fullscreen_2021-1.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FitOn_Fullscreen_2021-1.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216132" class="wp-caption-text">FitOn app</p></div></p>
<p>FitOn is a freemium product, and members have access to hundreds of workouts in cardio, strength, yoga, stretch and meditation. It also has a pro subscription model that includes music tracks on top of the workouts, connection to health monitoring devices, offline downloads, meal plans and recipes. It also has a social platform built in with a chat feature, and members can invite friends to participate in programs and challenges.</p>
<p>The latest round of funding gives FitOn a total of $30 million raised to date, which includes a seed round in 2018 and Series A in 2020.</p>
<p>“FitOn is delivering millions of workouts a month to its members by prioritizing product innovation, community and premium content to build one of the largest health and fitness communities,” said David Schaller, managing partner at Delta-v Capital. &#8220;We are thrilled for FitOn to join our portfolio of innovators in digital fitness and wellness, which includes other category-leaders such as Tonal.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since the Series A, the company’s growth has accelerated and is up 500% year over year on revenue from the subscription model. Now that it has passed 10 million members, Cook expects to reach 25 million by the end of next year. In addition, FitOn members passed over 1 billion workout minutes, and most work out three or four times a week.</p>
<p>The app is seeing over 285% more downloads than Peloton, 588% more than Beachbody and is consistently in the top 20 of the health and fitness category and has garnered more than 300,000 five-star reviews, according to Cook.</p>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to grow its team, build out key positions and continue on its fast pace of releasing new products. In the past two years, the company released more than 78 products. FitOn has focused mostly on the United States, but it is planning to grow internationally as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a business still two years in the making, we are satisfied with revenue and have lots of opportunity to build large-scale business,&#8221; Lindsay Cook said. “In this anti-diet culture, it is not about the ‘perfect body,’ but promoting self-care. We are building a lifestyle brand encouraging people to do a 10-minute workout here and there.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.getresq.com/">ResQ</a>, which does end-to-end equipment repairs for over 4,000 restaurant groups &#8212; from Taco Bell to Tim Hortons &#8212; has raised a $39 million Series A co-led by Tiger Global and Canvas Ventures. The capital, which includes investments from Homebrew, Inovia Capital and Golden Ventures, comes just months after the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/resq-seed-75/">announced its $7.5 million seed round. </a></p>
<p>Driving down customer costs is a big business anywhere, but especially within the world of restaurants &#8212; which already have razor-thin margins and built-in volatility. With this in mind, ResQ’s growth and subsequent capital makes sense. The startup, built by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kuljeev-singh-1299a657?originalSubdomain=ca">Kuljeev Singh</a>, offers “revenue recovery” services to its customers by optimizing its back-of-house operations.</p>
<p>ResQ&#8217;s core service connects contractors to restaurants, and then provides them with one spot to organize communication, pay bills and establish accountability. Toast’s lucrative IPO has brought a renewed spotlight to the opportunity for cloud-based software services within the restaurant industry. The Boston-based company was valued at $4.9 billion in early 2020, and currently hovers at a valuation of $25.81 billion, according to several finance websites.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216419" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Singh views Toast as a potential partner, not a competitor, because the public company works on front-of-house operations and point-of-sales processes.</p>
<p>“This is not just a piece of technology you build and you sell to restaurants,” Singh said. “We have to build a marketplace in the background, build products and services for local and national contractors…there’s so much depth.” ResQ is having conversations with restaurant tech companies that need back-of-house solutions, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/02/the-full-stack-approach-but-this-time-sans-status-quo/">everyone tries to become an end to end solution.</a></p>
<p>Abid Lallani, president of The Lallani Group and a customer, said that ResQ has helped them “no longer need to look for vendors, shop around for multiple quotes and spend time going back and forth with vendors.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>By saving worker time and offering clearer visualization into how repairs will work, restaurants on the ResQ platform have seen up to a 20% decrease in annual operation costs, according to the company. New customers include Fogo de Chão, Marugame Udon and Akamai Brands.</p>
<p>Like any two-sided marketplace, ResQ exposes itself to challenges of supply and demand. In its world, it needs to curate the delicate balance between a growing, diverse group of skilled workers and a subset of locations where it can reasonably offer its on-demand servicing. The startup grew its contractor base by 400% in the last four months, and expanded its operations from seven to 36 states in the same time period.</p>
<p>Labor shortages are a challenge that ResQ will have to constantly navigate &#8212; and one that its <a href="https://www.eater.com/22675736/restaurant-labor-shortage-2021-materials-food-sourcing-delivery">customers are currently facing every single day.</a> As the startup has scaled, a lot of its focus has been about understanding how to bring value to the evolving nature of the restaurant industry, from full-service businesses to a small independent company. Helping employees on staff better spend their time seems to be the common thread.</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re essentially giving that time back to those team members, when you already have labor shortages, to focus on growth projects, to focus on opening up new restaurants, or to focus on guest experience,” Singh said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following Tile&#8217;s recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/tile-secures-another-40-million-to-take-on-apple-airtag-with-new-products/">close on $40 million</a> in debt financing, the company today is introducing its latest lineup of lost-item trackers, including the long-promised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/tile-to-launch-to-launch-a-new-tracker-powered-by-ultra-wideband-technology/">ultra wideband powered tracker</a> aimed to compete with Apple AirTag, Tile Ultra. This product, though being officially announced, is not yet available for purchase. Instead, the company&#8217;s first updates include the premium Tile device, the Tile Pro, which features a new design meant to better address its core use cases of being attached to bags, keys, backpacks, and luggage. All of Tile&#8217;s other existing trackers &#8212; the Mate, Sticker and Slim &#8212; have also been upgraded with new features like louder rings, longer finding ranges, and increased water resistance, among other things.</p>
<p>Tile has been working on the Tile Ultra for some time, as the company&#8217;s plans for its new technology <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/tile-to-launch-to-launch-a-new-tracker-powered-by-ultra-wideband-technology/">were detailed</a> in January. The device will have the same form factor as Tile Pro, but a more premium design treatment and will ship with a stainless steel ring. More importantly, the device will be powered by ultra-wideband technology, which is the same thing Apple AirTag uses for more precise finding capabilities.</p>
<p>When available, Tile Ultra will combine both Bluetooth and ultra-wideband finding capabilities with the ability to seek out objects as far away as 400 feet, then display their location in an updated mobile app interface. Here, you&#8217;ll look at a camera view of your room or other location, with large, AR arrows pointing you to the location of your missing Tile.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216632" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Tile, a staunch Apple critic in recent months, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tile-bashes-apples-new-airtag-as-unfair-competition/">has been vocal about</a> how Apple has entered its market and immediately put it at a disadvantage from a competitive standpoint. Though <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/235016/will-2021-be-the-year-apples-u1-chip-goes-wide.html">newer model iPhones</a> shipped with ultra-wideband capabilities powered by the U1 chip, the ability to tap into that functionality has not been available to third-party developers until the launch of iOS 15. That gave Apple a head start with AirTag. For comparison, Tile says it has been working closely with its partner Google to ensure that its new ultra-wideband device will work well with Android 12, which brings ultra-wideband to Android for the first time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple held off making ultra wideband available to pilot until they launched their first product and had that product in the market for a while,&#8221; noted Tile CEO CJ Prober, of the delay to launch Tile Ultra. For this reason, the upcoming Tile Ultra won&#8217;t ship until early 2022.</p>
<p>In the near term, the rest of Tile&#8217;s lineup is getting a significant refresh.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The popular Tile Pro looks very different with its new, more slender form factor, which Tile landed on after around 16 different design choices it tested internally.</p>
<p>&#8220;This form factor really resonated with folks because of the way it hangs on your keys &#8212; it&#8217;s like a key fob, and it just fits really well,&#8221; notes Prober.</p>
<p>The device only has slight enhancements on the performance side, as the aesthetics change was the big update here. It will continue to feature a 400 ft finding range and a one-year replaceable battery.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216643" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216643" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2216643" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Black-Pro-Sticker-Combo.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Black-Pro-Sticker-Combo.jpg 7952w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Black-Pro-Sticker-Combo.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Black-Pro-Sticker-Combo.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Black-Pro-Sticker-Combo.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Black-Pro-Sticker-Combo.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Black-Pro-Sticker-Combo.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Black-Pro-Sticker-Combo.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Black-Pro-Sticker-Combo.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216643" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tile</p></div></p>
<p>The rest of Tile&#8217;s lineup was updated, too. The Tile Mate has an updated, sleeker design that also fits well on purses and keys, and will now come in both black and white. It features a 250 ft range (an increase of 25% over prior versions) improved water resistance (to IP67, or 30 mins. at one meter deep), a louder ring, and a 3-year non-replaceable battery.</p>
<p>Tile Sticker, which works well on things like your TV remote or other items where you can&#8217;t easily attach a tracker, is getting a 67% improvement in range to up to 250 ft. It will also get the same update in terms of a louder ring, improved water resistance, and a 3-year non-replaceable battery.</p>
<p>And finally, the Tile Slim, designed for tucking inside wallets, has received the same updated set of performance improvements, too in terms of range, battery, and ring.</p>
<p>Pro and Slim will retail for $34.99. Mate is $24.99 and Sticker is $29.99.</p>

<p>Along with the product updates, Tile is updating its mobile app with a new way to find lost items, called Lost and Found. This service allows anyone who finds a lost Tile item to scan a QR code on the device to see the owner&#8217;s contact information, so they can coordinate its return.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216662" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216662" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2216662" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tile-Lost-and-Found-User-Experience.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tile-Lost-and-Found-User-Experience.jpg 7500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tile-Lost-and-Found-User-Experience.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tile-Lost-and-Found-User-Experience.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tile-Lost-and-Found-User-Experience.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tile-Lost-and-Found-User-Experience.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tile-Lost-and-Found-User-Experience.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tile-Lost-and-Found-User-Experience.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Tile-Lost-and-Found-User-Experience.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216662" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tile</p></div></p>
<p>Inspired by AirTag&#8217;s security features, which periodically warns if an unknown AirTag is following you around, Tile will also identify if an unknown device is nearby. This feature, however, works differently from Apple&#8217;s AirTag. Instead, users will be able to download the Tile app, then push a button to enable a manual scan of unwanted Tiles nearby. They will not need a Tile account to do so. This functionality is not yet live, but was designed based on recommendations from the National Network to End Domestic Violence, Tile says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost 70% of stalking victims know their offender,&#8221; says Prober. &#8220;And their guidance was that you really need to put this kind of safety feature in the hands of the user, as opposed to having people waiting for some type of notification that might go away.&#8221;</p>
<p>This feature, called Scan and Secure, will go live on iOS and Android early next year.</p>
<p>Though Tile has moved into services and has been expanding through partnerships with companies who want to include lost item finding into their own products, the majority of Tile&#8217;s revenue still comes from the direct sale of its devices. To date, Tile has sold 40 million trackers and has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/tile-secures-another-40-million-to-take-on-apple-airtag-with-new-products/">over</a> 425,000 paying subscribers &#8212; a smaller portion of the many more users who don&#8217;t subscribe to a premium service. During the first half the year, Tile&#8217;s revenues increased by over 50%, but the company declines to share its hard numbers.</p>
<p>The new Tile lineup, except for Tile Ultra, is available today on Tile.com and retailers like Amazon, Costco, Best Buy, Target, and others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A number of startups have emerged aimed at cleaning up low Earth orbit, which is currently crowded with millions of pieces of space junk – including anything from broken satellites, to rocket fragments, to debris from vehicle stages or space missions. While the task of cleaning up LEO is an important one, there’s one problem, according to Alex Fielding, co-founder of a new space venture alongside Steve Wozniak: we don’t know where most of the space junk is actually located.</p>
<p>“Orbital cleanup companies, they don&#8217;t have resolution, or we don&#8217;t agree on where almost any object in low Earth orbit is with greater accuracy than maybe three or 400 kilometers on any given moment,” Fielding said in a recent interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Fielding and Wozniak are aiming to close that knowledge gap with their new company, Privateer. The company, which has been in stealth, got some attention in September after Wozniak tweeted a link to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a7A1w1C2TE&amp;feature=emb_title&amp;ab_channel=Privateer">one-minute promo vodeo on Youtube</a>, and rumors intensified that Privateer would be focused on cleaning up space objects.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216646" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="78ZnTVmuqZ"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/removing-space-debris-requires-action-and-caution/">Removing space debris requires action and caution</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Removing space debris requires action and caution&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/removing-space-debris-requires-action-and-caution/embed/#?secret=78ZnTVmuqZ" data-secret="78ZnTVmuqZ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Turns out, that’s not quite accurate. “Privateer actually got started, not with the goal of cleaning up space on day one,” Fielding explained. “We really got started with the goal of building […] the Google Maps of space.”</p>
<p>This is not the first collaboration for Fielding and Apple co-founder Wozniak. The two created Wheels of Zeus in the early 2000s, a hardware company that developed tech to track the location of physical objects.</p>
<p>“When we started that, half of the stuff in space twenty years ago was trash,” Fielding said. The situation has only gotten more dire since. “You&#8217;re in a world with many, many, many more things [in orbit], of which those many more things are far more dangerous, they&#8217;re almost all in low orbits, they&#8217;re moving very, very fast, and they&#8217;re not well tracked or understood for the most part.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The dangers of space junk remain all too present. In May, astronauts aboard the International Space Station discovered a five-millimeter-wide hole in a robotic arm attached to one of the modules. While that arm remains functioning, the ISS did not perform a maneuver to avoid being hit, which suggests that the object was one of the millions in orbit that are too small to be tracked by the U.S. Space Force’s Space Surveillance Network.</p>
<p>In the same way that launch companies like Rocket Lab and SpaceX are now providing services that used to be the exclusive purview of public agencies like NASA, Privateer could fill in these massive data gaps.</p>
<p>Privateer is hitting the ground running. The company will be sending up its first satellite, dubbed “Pono 1,” on February 11, 2022. The spacecraft, which will be roughly 3U in size (just about half-a-foot), will be equipped with 42 sensors, 30 of which are non-optical and twelve of which are optical cameras. The non-optical sensors will be capable of a precision of as much as 4 microns. The actual body of the satellite will be made of carbon fiber and 3D printed, using an approach that means it’s a single, solid piece with the same rigidity of titanium, Fielding said. Instead of propellant, it will be directionally oriented using magnetic torquers, a small device that generates electric current for attitude control.</p>
<p>Pono 1 will only stay up for four months, when it will be deorbited and vaporized back in the Earth’s atmosphere. The second satellite, Pono 2, is going up at the end of April. Privateer has already chosen a launch provider and received the requisite approvals for both launches.</p>
<p>In addition to the launches, Fielding said Privateer is already working with Astroscale, an orbital logistics and servicing startup that’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/astroscale-successfully-demos-in-space-capture-and-release-system-to-clear-orbital-debris/">currently demo-ing</a> a space junk removal satellite. Privateer also signed a partnership with the Space Force.</p>
<p>To not pursue a complete Google Maps of space might not just be negligent – it could be fatal, according to Fielding. “I&#8217;m an optimist and I still am very, very, very afraid that we&#8217;re too late, that we&#8217;re probably within 24 months of the first on-orbit human space casualty. And the reason for that is just the proliferation in low Earth orbit.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The humble USB-C port has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/europe-proposes-usb-c-as-a-common-charger-for-electronic-devices-131605815.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">been in the news</a> because Europe wants to make it a standard for all mobile devices to reduce e-waste — and Apple is the only manufacturer still not using the standard for its smartphones. Now, a robotics engineering student has proved that its possible to replace the iPhone&#8217;s Lightning connector with a USB-C port, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/10/11/iphone-gets-usb-c-thanks-to-creative-robotics-engineer" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><em>Apple Insider</em></a> has reported.</p>
<p>On his YouTube channel, EFPL master&#8217;s student Ken Pillonel teased an iPhone X with a USB-C port, promising a full video later on how it was done. In an earlier <a href="https://kenp.io/iphone_usbc_mod_part_1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">blog post and video</a>, he explained how he reverse-engineered the Lightning connector, then built a <a href="https://kenp.io/iphone_usbc_mod_part_1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">prototype</a> PCB connector to prove the concept.</p>
<p>Pillonel discovered that Apple sells a Lightning connector to certified partners that build USB-C to Lightning cables. He managed to get one out of a third-party cable, then remove the metallic part and expose the PCB. With that done, he pulled the female Lightning port from an iPhone and soldered wires from the bare C94 board to a PCB with USB-C connectors. &#8220;Once that was done I had my first working prototype,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Lightning is gone and only USB-C is left.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216649" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The next step was to &#8220;fully reverse engineer the C94&#8221; board so that everything can be shrunk down to fit into a phone, he said. That part has apparently been done, judging by the video above, and will be fully explained in a second video.</p>
<p>An iPhone with a USB-C port is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-10-iphone-11-pro-usb-c-fastcharge.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">dream</a> for many users, as it would allow for faster PD charging and the use of standard, non-proprietary cables. It&#8217;s also clearly feasible for Apple, given that the iPad Pro has a USB-C port. Europe has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/europe-proposes-usb-c-as-a-common-charger-for-electronic-devices-131605815.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">proposed a rule</a> that would require USB-C charging for all phones and electronic devices, with the aim of reducing e-waste and consumer inconvenience.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear if this has been done before, but most folks shouldn&#8217;t try a project like this at home. Pillonel has an electronics background and is <a href="https://kenp.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">working on</a> a Master&#8217;s degree in Robotics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL). That&#8217;s without mentioning that it would obviously void your iPhone&#8217;s warranty.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When the Trump administration <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/trump-ban-tiktok/">announced</a> it would ban TikTok in the U.S., a number of alternative short-form video apps began to flourish, as users hedged their bets on a potential TikTok exit. Among these was Byte, an app co-created by Vine co-founder Dom Hofmann, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/03/byte-tops-a-million-downloads-amid-spam-issues-and-content-concerns/">topped 1.3 million downloads</a> in its first week alone. But when Trump&#8217;s ban on TikTok failed, Byte <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/26/style/clash-byte-app-acquisition.html">sold to</a> rival <a href="https://www.clashapp.co/">Clash</a> &#8212; an admission of sorts that TikTok&#8217;s momentum couldn&#8217;t be beaten. Now, new owner Clash is kicking off round two. It&#8217;s relaunching its app with the &#8220;best of Byte&#8221; under the hood alongside a suite of creator tools for monetizing a fan base.</p>
<p>This time, the focus isn’t on beating TikTok, but working in parallel alongside it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.clashapp.co/">Clash</a> was founded by Brendon McNerney, a former Vine star who at one point grew his own social following on the now-shuttered app to over 700,000 followers. As someone who worked directly in the creator space, McNerney believes he could offer a unique perspective on creator monetization &#8212; something even leading apps can still struggle with today.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216198" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The newly rebuilt Clash’s premise is that it can help creators identify, engage and monetize their strongest and most loyal fans.</p>
<p>To do so, Clash is introducing a set of tools for creators and their fans, including a virtual tipping mechanism called Drops (not to be confused with product drops, popular in e-commerce) and a custom messaging system called Fanmail, for starters.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216326" style="width: 325px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216326" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2216326" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_4_.jpg?w=315" alt="" width="315" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_4_.jpg 920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_4_.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_4_.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_4_.jpg?resize=768,1660 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_4_.jpg?resize=315,680 315w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_4_.jpg?resize=711,1536 711w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_4_.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216326" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clash</p></div></p>
<p>The idea is that creators could grow their overall fanbase by using larger platforms like Instagram, TikTok or YouTube, where they can monetize the crowd through various methods, like advertising revenue share, brand sponsorships and other more direct methods, when available, like tips and subscriptions. Meanwhile, Clash could serve as the backchannel for the fans who are more invested in the creator&#8217;s journey &#8212; like those who are willing to help fund a creator&#8217;s work, similar to Patreon, or those who want a closer relationship with their favorite creators than they would otherwise be able to achieve elsewhere.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>McNerney says large platforms, like TikTok, can limit creators&#8217; monetization potential.</p>
<p>&#8220;TikTok is a virality machine. It just creates new creators every day &#8212; an issue because there&#8217;s only so many ad dollars&#8230;there&#8217;s only so many dollars in the Creator Fund,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>The founder took inspiration from what was working well in other industries, like Twitch with live content, OnlyFans for adult content and Patreon for more project-based work, like podcasts.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216320" style="width: 325px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216320" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2216320" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_1_.jpg?w=315" alt="" width="315" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_1_.jpg 920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_1_.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_1_.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_1_.jpg?resize=768,1660 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_1_.jpg?resize=315,680 315w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_1_.jpg?resize=711,1536 711w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_1_.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216320" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clash</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;The thing that really stuck out was, in 2019, I started seeing creators post their Venmo links in their bio. It was kind of a head-scratch moment,&#8221; McNerney says. He began to think about how those link-in-bio systems could be turned into more of a product. &#8220;And so we really started from the question&#8230;if Patreon was built now, what would it look like? And then: how can we do what we know well &#8212; which is short-form video?&#8221; he continues. &#8220;We really wanted to build a short-form video platform, where the video was just the medium, but the whole point of the platform was to support your favorite creators and connect with your fans.&#8221;</p>
<p>The initial beta version of Clash launched last summer on the App Store. Soon, the team found creators wanted to use it as a more authentic place to engage with fans outside of larger platforms. Creators wanted to create content specifically designed for the top 10-15% of their fan base &#8212; people who were already supporting them in other ways, like buying their merchandise, for example.</p>
<p>This led to the launch of Clash&#8217;s first product, Fanmail, where fans could pay to unlock the ability to send personalized messages to top creators, who acknowledge them and respond directly.</p>
<p>It also introduced Drops, a digital good purchased from the App Store that fans can use as a token of appreciation or for access to send Fanmail.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216322" style="width: 325px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216322" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2216322" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_2_.jpg?w=315" alt="" width="315" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_2_.jpg 920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_2_.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_2_.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_2_.jpg?resize=768,1660 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_2_.jpg?resize=315,680 315w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_2_.jpg?resize=711,1536 711w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_2_.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216322" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clash</p></div></p>
<p>Creators can redeem Drops at 2,500 (or $25), <a href="https://clashappco.medium.com/?p=f4a1f62b6e2c">Clash says</a>. This is a lower threshold than some creator platforms, like Twitch, where you need to <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/affiliate-payout-faq?language=en_US">have earned $100</a> to cash out. Clash says it will also seed its network by gifting hundreds of Drops to new users, free of charge. And, for the time being, Clash will not take a cut of these sales &#8212; meaning creators keep 100% of the revenue from the Drops they receive. (The company hasn&#8217;t yet decided what percentage it will take when the promotional period ends sometime next year.)</p>
<p>McNerney envisions how Clash can be used in the early stages of content creation and planning, which makes it more symbiotic with larger platforms, like TikTok, instead of a direct competitor. For example, one of Clash&#8217;s launch creators, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ladyyasmina1?">Yasmine Sahid</a>, who makes comedic videos on TikTok, is using Clash to fund her other passion: making music. She&#8217;s been building her first music video with the support of fans on Clash, who are funding it through their Drops. And as the video is produced, these fans get access to the behind-the-scenes content and other sneak peeks.</p>
<p>Plus, he argues, innovations in creator monetization may need to take place outside of larger platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest issue, I think, is while [these large platforms] are experimenting with these tools, they&#8217;re not leaning into them. At the end of the day, their revenue is 98, 99% from advertising revenue,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The model that they see themselves leaning into is just strictly focusing on keeping eyeballs glued to the screen. Whereas, they&#8217;re improving their algorithms &#8212; they want people viewing &#8212; we actually want people engaging,&#8221; McNerney adds.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216324" style="width: 325px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216324" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2216324" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_3_.jpg?w=315" alt="" width="315" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_3_.jpg 920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_3_.jpg?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_3_.jpg?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_3_.jpg?resize=768,1660 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_3_.jpg?resize=315,680 315w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_3_.jpg?resize=711,1536 711w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMAGE_Clash_Launch-Announcement_3_.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216324" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Clash</p></div></p>
<p>At launch, Clash&#8217;s app has been rebuilt to handle future scale and to support monetization tools. Meanwhile, Clash is including what the team loved about Byte, including the way Byte&#8217;s Camera worked, the in-app feed and the app&#8217;s Discovery page. There are other similarities between Byte&#8217;s design and the new app, as well.</p>
<p>And while Clash will gain access to Byte&#8217;s existing registered user base of 5 million when it relaunches in Byte&#8217;s place on the app stores, it plans to support a variety of creators &#8212; not just the young Gen Z&#8217;ers who <a href="https://community.byte.co/t/wow-the-hate-towards-millenials-is-real/55146?page=3">used to try to</a> &#8220;<a href="https://community.byte.co/t/stop-bullying-millennials/56166">bully the millennials</a>&#8221; off the original Byte app.</p>
<p>In the near-term, Clash plans to add something called a &#8220;fan score&#8221; based on their engagement in the app, including entering chats and commenting on videos. It plans to release this feature soon after the public debut.</p>
<p>Of course, even as a platform for the most loyal fans, Clash will have its competition from startups and big tech alike. Twitter has built Super Follow to cater to creators while Instagram has been spotted working on its own fan subscription product in recent days.</p>
<p>Co-founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pj-leimgruber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/pj-leimgruber/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633623542719000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGBxqFq37wCK2ezV-ySdrr15btWiQ">P.J. Leimgruber</a>, who previously founded influencer agency NeoReach, LA-based Clash is now a team of 17 full-time. Many early employees have backgrounds in social and creator platforms, including Facebook, TikTok, Vine, Snap, Twitter, Google, Pinterest and Cameo. Vine&#8217;s/Twitter&#8217;s head of Creator Development, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/karynisaunicorn/">Karyn Spencer</a>, is also Clash&#8217;s creator advisor. Byte and Vine co-founder Dom Hoffman remains an advisor.</p>
<p>Ahead of its relaunch, Clash raised $9.1 million in funding over three rounds. The latest was <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210126005283/en/Clash-Acquires-Byte-App-Secures-Investment-from-Alexis-Ohanian%E2%80%99s-Seven-Seven-Six">a seed round</a> led by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian’s new fund Seven Seven Six. Other investors in Clash include M13 Ventures, Plug and Play, ACME Capital, and angels Jesse Leimgruber (NeoReach co-founder) and NBA Players, Austin Rivers and Seth Curry.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.clashapp.co/">Clash</a> is relaunching today under Byte&#8217;s listing on the App Store and on Google Play.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.plume.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plume</a> &#8212; a communications startup that partners with carriers to provide smart mesh WiFi to improve broadband connectivity in homes, and then offers other smart home services on top of that network &#8212; has been in the middle of a massive boom in its business fueled by the rapid uptake, use, and complete reliance on broadband in the home working as best as it can.</p>
<p>Now it has closed a huge funding round to ride the wave. The Palo Alto-based startup has raised another $300 million led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2 at a valuation of $2.6 billion. Plume&#8217;s CEO and founder Fahri Diner said the startup will be using the money to continue building out its software platform, inking and servicing more deals with carriers, and generally expanding its horizons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two years ago, the killer app was WiFi, managing the pods,&#8221; he said, referring to the system of mesh routers that are used to improve the speed and quality of a WiFi network in homes. &#8220;That is no longer it, although it&#8217;s still a big piece of it. Access control and device security are growing fast, and people are also engaging with our motion sensors since indoor cameras are going away because of privacy reasons. IOT, health, energy management, and home security are all areas we have been testing for two years and they work, so we will be leaning into a lot of stuff.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216594" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Other investors in this latest round were not disclosed but previous backers include a strong mix of strategic and financial investors: Charter Communications, Comcast Cable, Foxconn, Insight Partners, Jackson Square Ventures, Liberty Global Ventures, Presidio Ventures, Qualcomm, Samsung, Service Electric Cablevision, Shaw Ventures, Silicon Valley Bank, and UpBeat Venture Partners among them. Insight was the sole backer in its last round, investing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/plume-picks-up-270m-at-a-1-35b-valuation-to-power-smart-home-wifi-for-broadband-providers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$270 million at a $1.35 billion valuation</a> in the startup. The fact that this latest SoftBank-led round is coming just eight months later is a mark of how rapidly Plume&#8217;s business has been growing.</p>
<p>Indeed, Covid-19 and the impact it had on how we use our broadband at home has probably been the biggest driver of Plume&#8217;s business in the last year.</p>
<p>As more people have been compelled to stay home to work, study, and pass the time, the more strain we&#8217;ve been putting on those home networks. In some cases, like mine, that strain also quickly led to major cracks: I am myself a Plume user; after trying a number of other things it was the only solution that could get the broadband to work well and reliably in our London Victorian house.</p>
<p>I guess we weren&#8217;t the only ones. Plume said that business ballooned in the last two quarters, adding 13 million new households to total 35 million (&#8220;more than our biggest customer, Comcast,&#8221; Diner pointed out to me); and it added 350 million more devices to its platform bringing the total to 1.2 billion devices; plus 60 more broadband carrier customers to now total 240 million globally (these include cable companies, telcos, and wireless carriers that also offer broadband).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s also now partnering with those carriers to branch out beyond their own broadband. In an OTT-style play, in the UK, Plume and Virgin Media are selling HomePass, which includes the Plume pod and software to manage it and run other services, across all of the UK (25 million households), regardless of whether Virgin is providing the broadband underpinning the service or not.</p>
<p>All of this is banked around services for consumers and the connected home. These are two areas where the startup will definitely continue to expand its reach, as outlined by the range of managed services Diner said the company has been working on for some time, along with others tapping into the connected home and specifically electronic objects that already have some degree of interfacing with the internet (think here: Plume letting you know when your connected Nespresso machines is about to need cleaning). These are due to start to get rolled out later this year when Plume releases an update of its app.</p>
<p>But further along, the company&#8217;s next steps will likely be outside the home, Diner said. One big area where you could see it doing more, for example, is in the area of industrial environments, where there are vast networks of often remote devices that are costly to connect to networks in a reliable way, which also need monitoring &#8212; two areas where Plume could figure in the future.</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We might segment the market into residential, business, and industrial IoT,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have a phenomenal foothold in residential, which we are now moving into small business. Industrial is also in our scope. We have ambitious plans and this financing gives us more capability.&#8221; What is not in scope, he added, is enterprise campuses, where often there is already extensive internet wiring and bespoke WiFi solutions that fit into a company&#8217;s particular networking and security configurations. </span></p>
<p>“The pandemic has dramatically accelerated the adoption of digital services, increasing our dependence on smart devices,” said Nagraj Kashyap, Managing Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, who joined the <span class="il">Plume</span> Board of Directors, in a statement. “Through its innovative cloud data platform, we believe <span class="il">Plume</span>’s consumer-first approach provides customers with reliable connectivity in their homes and beyond. We are pleased to partner with Fahri and the team to support their ambition of reinventing services for smart spaces globally.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cytrio, a Boston-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/data-privacy/">data privacy</a> and compliance startup, has launched its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/saas/">software-as-a-service</a> privacy rights management platform after landing $3.5 million in seed funding.</p>
<p>The funding was secured from angel investors and institutional seed investors, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/dreamit-ventures/">Dreamit Ventures</a>, Food Retail Ventures, and Rockwood Group, and values the company at &#8220;north of $10 million&#8221;, Cytrio co-founder and CEO Vijay Basani told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The raise also included Cytrio’s founding team. This includes Basani, who previously founded WebManage Technologies (acquired by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/netapp/">NetApp</a>), AppIQ (acquired by HP), and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/03/cygilant-ransomware/">Cygilant</a>, as well as chief privacy officer Pankaj Parekh, who previously worked at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/zscaler/">Zscaler</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/Microsoft/">Microsoft</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216059" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Cytrio’s founding team claims more than 50 years of data, privacy, and security experience. The startup said it&#8217;s looking to serve mid-market companies, which Cytrio claims often struggle to adopt data privacy regulations due to the fact that current privacy rights management solutions are expensive, complex to deploy, and difficult to use. The company says it&#8217;s filling this gap with its privacy rights management platform — built on AI-led data discovery and automated response workflows — which will help small and medium-sized companies comply with a range of emerging privacy legislation, including in California, Virginia, and Colorado.</p>
<p>“Current first generation privacy rights management solutions on the market do not play well in the mid-market due to deployment complexity, long time to value and the requirement of dedicated privacy teams,” Basani told TechCrunch. “Cytrio is challenging this paradigm with a next-gen privacy rights management solution where we believe we can deliver value on day one.”</p>
<p>Basani adds that “data privacy compliance is about to get even more critical”, with “a slew of new Acts, heftier fines, and potential impacts on revenues going to hit companies found unprepared.”</p>
<p>“While enterprises can absorb some of these challenges and have the resources to manage data privacy mid-market companies simply do not. We are going to fix that,” he says.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cytrio tells TechCrunch it will use its $3.5 million seed raise to expand its team (from a headcount of 23 and expanding to more than 40 employees in the next 12 months) to validate its product, and to achieve annual recurring revenue of more than $250,000.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a>, the $40 billion software startup looking to make design accessible to everyone, has today announced a video editing suite.</p>
<p>Launched in 2013, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/canva/">Canva</a> emerged during the design rennaissance, around the same time that Sketch, Figma and InVision were crashing the Adobe party. Unlike the others, Canva focused on democratization of design, creating a UI that allowed anyone to make just about anything, from slide decks to t-shirts to social media assets.</p>
<p>Today, Canva continues on that trajectory in the world of video.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216591" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Canva video software offers a scene-focused interface, meaning that users can break down their video into easy-to-manage pieces. From there, they can trim scenes (coming soon), manage multiple audio tracks and use in-editor video previews to check their work.</p>
<p>Canva is also offering video templates to simplify the process for users based on their end goals. For example, folks making a TikTok video are designing and editing in a different format than folks making Twitch banners.</p>
<p>Considering the growth in educational video &mdash; Canva says that 20 percent of knowledge workers either create or consume video for their job every single day &mdash; the company is also introducing screen and in-editor recording, so folks can record themselves or their screen to create a video for the rest of the team or organization.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216599" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216599" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Canva_PlayWithVideo_Screen-Sharing.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="398" class="size-large wp-image-2216599" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Canva_PlayWithVideo_Screen-Sharing.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Canva_PlayWithVideo_Screen-Sharing.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Canva_PlayWithVideo_Screen-Sharing.png?resize=300,176 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Canva_PlayWithVideo_Screen-Sharing.png?resize=768,450 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Canva_PlayWithVideo_Screen-Sharing.png?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Canva_PlayWithVideo_Screen-Sharing.png?resize=1536,900 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Canva_PlayWithVideo_Screen-Sharing.png?resize=2048,1200 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Canva_PlayWithVideo_Screen-Sharing.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216599" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Canva</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For users who are looking to polish up their video, Canva is also offering animations and automatic transitions in its classic easy-to-use interface.</p>
<p>Moreover, Canva Video is multiplayer, allowing users to edit in the same scene-based editor without having to download, reupload, etc.</p>
<p>In an email interview, Canva&#8217;s Head of Product Rob Kawalsky explained that the greatest challenge in building video creation software has been balancing the need for a powerful, robust tool with the simplicity of use that Canva has built its foundation on, adding that most video creation software relies on a multi-layer editing timeline.</p>
<p>&#8220;We landed on our unique scene-based timeline, which splits videos into scenes that have a similar look and feel to presentation slides,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This feels instantly familiar, and also means Canva’s editor offers an almost identical editing experience whether you’re creating a static or moving design. Powerful editing features, like the ability to add animations, scene transitions and crop clips are available, but rather than having hundreds of confusing buttons at once, everything is context-specific — meaning the options present themselves as you need them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Canva Video is included as part of the company&#8217;s free tier.</p>
<p>Video represents a massive new frontier for Canva, which recently raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/canva-raises-200-million-at-a-40-billion-valuation/">$200 million at a $40 billion valuation</a> and announced plans to double its workforce yet again over the next year.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="fJ4nkuwSSL"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/canva-raises-200-million-at-a-40-billion-valuation/">Canva raises $200 million at a $40 billion valuation</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Canva raises $200 million at a $40 billion valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/canva-raises-200-million-at-a-40-billion-valuation/embed/#?secret=fJ4nkuwSSL" data-secret="fJ4nkuwSSL" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company is on track to do $1 billion in annualized revenue for 2021 with over 500,000 teams using the paid product.</p>
<p>Video only fuels the growth of the company, which has mastered the process of going B2B from B2C.</p>
<p>&#8220;People come to Canva to design a specific format, but quickly realize they can do much more,&#8221; added Kawalsky.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today announced a new feature for its AppSheet automation service that will allow developers on its no-code platform to create custom apps and automation that can interact directly with Gmail. By leveraging <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/take-action-and-stay-up-to-date-with-dynamic-email-in-gmail/">dynamic email</a>, developers can now build applications that users can trigger and execute right from inside their Gmail inbox &#8212; and while that has been the promise of dynamic email since Google announced it in 2019, we haven&#8217;t seen all that many developers really make use of these capabilities yet.</p>
<p>With this, an AppSheet developer could now build an approval workflow or asset management system that users can update right from within an email, for example.</p>
<p>Praveen Seshadri, the CEO and founder of AppSheet who sold the service to Google in 2020, noted that this is a small but important step in the service&#8217;s overall mission to enable more users to convert their idea into working software &#8212; and to help those developers (or &#8220;creators,&#8221; as he likes to call them) reach their users where they are.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216465" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re in the process of doing is saying, &#8216;how do we let people who are what we call <em>creators</em> &#8212; people with ideas of how to make things run better or automate things, and so on &#8212; build those things?&#8217; Traditionally, there were apps, but of late, we&#8217;re trying to say, &#8216;how do we integrate that deeper into the experience of those end users?&#8217; That&#8217;s what developers have been doing for a while with the workspace platform and now we&#8217;re broadening that to the non-developers,&#8221; Seshadri said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216467" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-2.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216467" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2216467" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-2.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="607" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2216467" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Typically, it&#8217;s the business users who are the closest to the business problems, so as Seshadri noted, they are also usually the ones who know what they want from an automation solution like this. And while they may not be able to code themselves, Seshadri argues that AppSheet&#8217;s focus on a declarative approach lets users focus on outcomes and not the &#8220;insanely tedious steps to achieve those outcomes.&#8221; But he also noted that in most businesses, no-code users and traditional engineers work together. Somebody has to build and maintain the database that the no-code application sits on top of, after all.</p>
<p>On top of broadening the capabilities of the AppSheet platform, though, the current focus for the team is on how those efforts are consumed by end users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Traditionally, if you&#8217;re building applications, you got to go to the application and do something there,&#8221; Seshadri said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to do an expense report. I&#8217;ve got an expense report application, a web web page or something And I do that. And then I have to do something with recruiting, I go to that application. We tend to transform your context in all these places. What we&#8217;re doing now is taking AppSheet applications built by creators and bringing them into your Gmail, so that the users can stay in the context they are in and the work comes to them, the application comes to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted that Gmail is an obvious starting point inside of Google Workspace, though the overall goal is to meet the users where they are so they can stay within their current work context as much as possible.</p>

<p>In this context, it&#8217;s also worth noting that Google is also launching a new integration with Atlassian today that brings a Jira integration to Google Chat and Spaces (formerly called &#8220;Rooms&#8221;). With this, users will be able to create new Jira tickets right from Chat and Spaces, see previews of their tickets and track active issues. That is pretty much a capability that users of Slack and Microsoft Teams already have access to, so in many ways, Google is simply filling a gap in its tool chest here.</p>
<p>&#8220;Modern work requires people to switch contexts and tools faster than ever before,&#8221; said Joff Redfern, chief product officer, Atlassian. &#8220;We believe an open ecosystem and tight integrations among the tools that users rely on every day is vital to their success. Since 2017, our Trello integration with Gmail has been installed by more than 7 million people. Today, we are excited to build on the partnership between Atlassian and Google to propel work collaboration further with the integration of Jira with Google Chat and Spaces.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2019, Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/google-closes-2-6b-looker-acquisition/">acquired</a> the business intelligence service <a href="https://looker.com/">Looker</a> for $2.6 billion and Salesforce <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/salesforce-closes-15-7b-tableau-deal/">picked up</a> <a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a> for $15.7 billion. But today, the two competitors are growing closer together thanks to a new integration between the two. Specifically, Tableau users will soon be able to access Looker&#8217;s semantic layer, while Google&#8217;s Looker users will soon be able to use Tableau&#8217;s visualization layer on top of the Looker platform.</p>
<p>This may seem like an unlikely partnership at first, but in a way, this allows both services to play to their strengths. Tableau&#8217;s advanced visualization capabilities have always been a draw for its users, but unlike Looker, it was born on the desktop and despite all of the company&#8217;s efforts, that desktop/cloud split is still somewhat apparent in its products. Looker, on the other hand, was born in the cloud, but it&#8217;s also very much a product for the more technical user who can write SQL while Tableau&#8217;s focus is more on enabling any business user to analyze data. That, in many ways, is also why both were a good match for their respective acquirers at the time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that everyone who is solving for simplicity and working with data is a partner of Google,&#8221; said Gerrit Kazmaier, Google&#8217;s VP &amp; GM for Databases, Analytics &amp; Looker, &#8220;We also work With Databricks. Ultimately, everyone is benefiting if we&#8217;re solving the right problems overall. And if companies like Tableau &#8212; a great partner of Google&#8217;s &#8212; are also interested in making working with data more simple, it&#8217;s a really good basis for collaboration.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216112" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>He noted that Looker&#8217;s semantic model brings a lot of flexibility to the table, while Tableau offers its users a lot of tools to democratize data and around data visualization and storytelling. It&#8217;s maybe no surprise then that the two companies already share a large number of customers. &#8220;We thought, how much would it help our customers if they just could use Tableau against LookerML? Meaning they would not be required to copy and again, get into all of this complexity. And on the other side, we thought on the Looker side, how much you know, would it actually help Looker customers, if they could just connect Tableau to it? And we thought, actually, it would help a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kazmaier argues that in the end, what counts is the customer experience and how a service can create value for a customer. &#8220;I think every company who starts making it about themselves is, is going to face hard times,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At its Cloud Next event, Google today announced the launch of <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Spark</a> on Google Cloud as a fully managed service. With this, the popular open-source data processing engine will become a premium offering on Google Cloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this innovation, Spark finally arrives in the cloud-native world,&#8221; said Gerrit Kazmaier, Google&#8217;s VP &amp; GM for Database, Data Analytics &amp; Looker. &#8220;It allows data engineers and data scientists to work with Spark without worrying about cluster end configurations. We also integrated it into all of our data services. So you can launch it directly from BigQuery, from Vertex AI, from Dataplex. It makes using Spark so easy that it allows our customers to use the frameworks and the toolkits that they&#8217;re familiar with &#8212; they love the data science experience, and they can now consume it in a cloud-native way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google argues that this is the &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 300;">world’s first autoscaling and serverless Spark service for the Google Cloud data platform.&#8221; But it&#8217;s worth noting that, given its popularity, there are plenty of other companies that will run and manage Spark for their customers. Spark is also at the center of Databricks&#8217; platform, which is maybe no surprise, given that the well-funded startup was founded by the creators of Spark.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216086" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>You may also wonder: doesn&#8217;t Google Cloud already offer a managed Spark service as part of Dataproc (that is, of course, if you&#8217;re one of the five people who is capable of remembering every service that Google, Amazon and Microsoft now offer in their clouds&#8230;)?</p>
<p>These are different services, targeting different customers, though, Kazmaier told me. If you already have Spark, Hadoop or maybe MapReduce, Presto and other systems up and running, then the idea here is that Dataproc will give you all of these, but as a managed service. But for Kazmaier, the focus of what he&#8217;s building out around Google Cloud&#8217;s data services is all about simplicity and especially about making life easier for companies that are just getting started in their data journey.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re building a data team &#8212; and you hire one data engineer and one data scientist? Do what you really want to get started by saying: &#8216;I&#8217;ll now build a storage system. I&#8217;ll build up a metadata system from the ground up.&#8217; Of course not, but this is literally what you are forced to do today,&#8221; he said. &#8221; Now with Spark serverless, you just say &#8216;go.'&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://bondvet.com/">Bond Vet</a>, the NY-based veterinary care clinic, has announced the close of a $170 million investment from Warburg Pincus.</p>
<p>The veterinary startup raised $17 million toward the end of 2020, explaining that they&#8217;re modeled after the human-focused CityMD. Bond Vet company currently offers services in New York City and Long Island, New York.</p>
<p>The idea is that the startup can fill the gap between vet ERs and the veterinary equivalent of a primary care physician. There is no membership required to bring your pet to Bond Vet, with walk-ins or appointments available via the website or mobile app. Bond Vet also offers urgent care and primary care for pets, which includes vaccinations, check-ups, preventative medicine, etc.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216610" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I am a puppy mom as of May 2021 and have been going to Bond Vet exclusively since my little dude came on the scene. I&#8217;m paying the bills, too. Bond Vet isn&#8217;t giving me or my pup special treatment. Here&#8217;s my review:</p>
<h3>The pros</h3>
<p>Bond Vet offers telehealth appointments. These aren&#8217;t <em>always</em> useful as our pets can&#8217;t explain their own symptoms, so unless the issue is incredibly obvious, it&#8217;s probably best to bring your furry friend into a clinic. When it is an obvious problem, being able to diagnose and treat an issue from the safety and comfort of your home, without having to cart your pet around, is wonderful.</p>
<p>Bond Vet tracks everything in a mobile app. You can look at the notes from your pet&#8217;s last appointment on the app, or download and print their entire medical history, proof of vaccinations, etc.</p>
<p>Bond Vet is pretty damn affordable, and the model makes pricing pretty straightforward, which isn&#8217;t necessarily common in the vet or human healthcare worlds. Vaccinations, for example, are $55 for cats and dogs. A telehealth appointment is $50.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has an on-site pharmacy, and they&#8217;re pretty good about turning around medication quickly. They&#8217;ll even ship you medication if you&#8217;re not in town and have been given a prescription via telehealth.</p>
<p>Bond Vet is designed specifically to be a vet&#8217;s office. There is a treat station, and separated chairs in the waiting area to make sure sick pets aren&#8217;t over stimulated by the other animals in the room.</p>
<h3>A few small cons</h3>
<p>Bond Vet&#8217;s model is very akin to CityMD, which means that your pet is unlikely to see the same vet or nurse exclusively. In other words, it can be hard to build a relationship with your pet&#8217;s primary doctor, as they don&#8217;t really have one.</p>
<p>And Bond was <em>very</em> slow to allow pet parents back into the clinic alongside their fur-babies during the pandemic. While stores all around their Cobble Hill location were back open for business, with both masked and unmasked patrons wandering around, pet parents had to stay outside while their pets were treated. It was very recent that Bond started allowing pet parents back into the clinic, and even then, not into the exam rooms with their pets.</p>
<p>I fully understand and appreciate the need to provide safe spaces for workers during the pandemic. But as a new mom to a little puppy, this policy of being outside until the end of July was somewhat bothersome considering that my pet has no agency or representation if I&#8217;m not around. I&#8217;m sure the nice folks at Bond would never do anything untoward with my little guy, but I still feel uncomfortable sending him somewhere to get pricked or prodded without me. And it was especially terrible sending him to get his vaccinations without even being in the building.</p>
<p>At times Bond can feel a bit like a volume play. When I first got my puppy, I had a million questions about what was best for him, from his bath time routine to his diet to the best treats and bones for teething. We&#8217;ve been to Bond at least half a dozen times, if not more, and it&#8217;s about 50/50 when it comes to whether a nurse, vet tech or doctor has the time to really sit down and answer all your questions.</p>
<p>Overall, I&#8217;ve been happy with my choice to use Bond Vet. And it would seem I&#8217;m not alone. The startup has treated more than 40,000 pets in the NYC area.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what cofounder and CEO Mo Punjani had to say in a prepared statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>The increase in pet ownership, accelerated by the rise of adoptions and need for care during the pandemic has demonstrated an enormous opportunity to improve veterinary services, especially in urgent and emergent cases for pets. Bond Vet meets the demand for a high-quality, convenient experience for pet care, supported by our best-in-class technology and standards for medical excellence. The new partnership with Warburg Pincus and the continuing support of our initial capital provider Talisman Capital, will help accelerate our growth and enable us to provide the best experience for our pets, pet parents and our veterinarians in New York and beyond.</p></blockquote>
<p>The new funding will be used to expand the Bond Vet footprint, invest in equipment, training, culture and technology.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Today at Google Cloud Next, the company&#8217;s annual customer conference, Google announced a broad portfolio of hybrid cloud services designed to deliver computing at the edge of Google&#8217;s network of data centers, in a partner facility or in a customer&#8217;s private data center &#8212; all managed by Anthos, the company&#8217;s cloud native management console. There&#8217;s [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today at <a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next">Google Cloud Next</a>, the company&#8217;s annual customer conference, Google announced a broad portfolio of hybrid cloud services designed to deliver computing at the edge of Google&#8217;s network of data centers, in a partner facility or in a customer&#8217;s private data center &#8212; all managed by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/22/google-clouds-fully-managed-anthos-is-now-generally-available-for-aws/">Anthos</a>, the company&#8217;s cloud native management console.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to unpack here, but Sachin Gupta, Google&#8217;s GM and VP of Product for IaaS, says the strategy behind the announcement was to bring customers along who might have specialized workloads that aren&#8217;t necessarily well suited to the public cloud &#8212; a need that he says they were continually hearing about from potential customers.</p>
<p>That means providing them with some reasonable alternatives. &#8220;What we find is that there are various factors that prevent customers from moving to the public cloud right away,&#8221; Gupta said. For instance, they might have low latency requirements or large amounts of data that they need to process and moving this data to the public cloud and back again may not be efficient. They also may have security, privacy, data residency or other compliance requirements.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2215647" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>All of this led Google to design a set of solutions that work in a variety of situations that might not involve the pure public cloud. A solution could be installed on the edge in one of Google&#8217;s worldwide data centers, in a partner data center like a telco or a colo facility like Equinix, or as part of a managed server inside a company&#8217;s own data center.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YgAPnnGDPv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/">With a $50B run rate in reach, can anyone stop AWS?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;With a $50B run rate in reach, can anyone stop AWS?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/embed/#?secret=YgAPnnGDPv" data-secret="YgAPnnGDPv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>With that latter component, it&#8217;s important to note that these are servers from partner companies like Dell and HPE, as opposed to a server manufactured and managed by Google as Amazon does <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/04/aws-outposts-begins-to-take-shape-to-bring-the-cloud-into-the-data-center/">with its Outposts product</a>. It&#8217;s also interesting to note that these machines won&#8217;t be connected directly to the Google cloud in any way, but Google will manage all of the software and provide a way for IT to manage cloud and on-prem resources in a single way. More on that in a moment.</p>
<p>The goal with a hosted solution is a consistent and modern approach to computing using either containers and Kubernetes or virtual machines. Google provides updates via a secure download site and customers can check these themselves or let a third party vendor handle all of that for them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The glue here that really holds this approach together is Anthos, the control software the company introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/09/googles-anthos-hybrid-cloud-platform-is-coming-to-aws-and-azure/">a couple of years ago</a>. With Anthos, customers can control and manage software wherever it lives, whether that&#8217;s on premise, in a data center or on public clouds, even from competitors like Microsoft and Amazon.</p>

<p>The whole approach signals that Google is attempting to carve out its own share of the cloud by taking advantage of a hybrid market opening. While this is an area that both Microsoft and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/ibm-ceo-arvind-krishna-wants-to-completely-transform-his-organization/">IBM</a> are also trying to exploit, taking this comprehensive platform approach while using Anthos to stitch everything together could give Google some traction, especially in companies that have specific requirements that prevent them from moving certain workloads to the cloud.</p>
<p>Google reached 10% market share in the cloud infrastructure market for the first time in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/cloud-infrastructure-market-kept-growing-in-q2-reaching-42b/">the most recent quarterly report</a> from August with a brisk growth rate of 54%, showing that they are starting to gain a bit of momentum, even though they remain far behind Amazon with 33% and Microsoft with 20% market share.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google first revealed BigQuery Omni, its Anthos-based multi-cloud data analytics solution, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/google-clouds-new-bigquery-omni-will-let-developers-query-data-in-gcp-aws-and-azure/">last summer</a>. Today, at its annual Cloud Next event, the company announced that BigQuery Omni is generally available. What makes Omni different from similar services is that it allows its users to use the standard BigQuery interface they know to query data that sits on other clouds, including Microsoft&#8217;s Azure and AWS &#8212; all without having to move copies of their data between these clouds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone knows a data silo is bad, but the reality is that right now, we are building data silos, just in different clouds,&#8221; Gerrit Kazmaier, Google&#8217;s VP &amp; GM for Databases, Analytics &amp; Looker, told me. &#8220;There is a new generation of data silos and we recognize that most of the companies in the world live in a multi-cloud reality, and with BigQuery Omni, we basically give them the possibility to do analytics across them &#8212; cross-cloud analytics, which I think is the ultimate in simplicity, because you don&#8217;t need to think anymore about where do I move my data and all of the repetition and redundancy in governing it. The single pane of glass and that single processing framework &#8212; it&#8217;s a feat of engineering that the team basically took BigQuery and brought many parts of it to other clouds.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216390" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bq_omni_2.1009031213430625.max-1200x1200-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216390" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2216390" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bq_omni_2.1009031213430625.max-1200x1200-1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="476" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bq_omni_2.1009031213430625.max-1200x1200-1.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bq_omni_2.1009031213430625.max-1200x1200-1.png?resize=150,70 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bq_omni_2.1009031213430625.max-1200x1200-1.png?resize=300,140 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bq_omni_2.1009031213430625.max-1200x1200-1.png?resize=768,357 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bq_omni_2.1009031213430625.max-1200x1200-1.png?resize=680,316 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bq_omni_2.1009031213430625.max-1200x1200-1.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2216390" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216364" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A number of Google Cloud customers are already making good use of these capabilities. Kazmaier noted that Johnson &amp; Johnson, for example, uses it to combine its data in Google Cloud with S3 data on AWS, while Electronic Arts uses it to combine advertising data with in-game purchases.</p>
<p>Talking about data silos, Google also today noted that Dataplex, a tool that allows enterprises to manage, monitor and govern their data across data lakes and warehouses, will also be generally available later this year. It is currently in preview.</p>
<p>Like so many of Google Cloud&#8217;s other announcements today, both of these services recognize that virtually every enterprise now operates in a multi-cloud environment &#8212; and almost by default, that means that a lot of valuable data is spread across systems. Using multiple systems to manage this data is cumbersome and error-prone, but most importantly, it&#8217;s hard (and often expensive) to combine all of this data in a single system. Google&#8217;s approach here is to just bring all of its own services to these various clouds and then manage them from GCP. That&#8217;s the approach it took with Anthos to manage Kubernetes clusters and, unsurprisingly, that now also allow it to run some core GCP services outside of its own cloud, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google Cloud today announced a new (and free) feature that will provide its users with custom <a href="https://cloud.google.com/carbon-footprint">carbon footprint reports</a> that detail the carbon emissions their cloud usage generates.</p>
<p>Google Cloud itself has long said that it wants to run 100% on carbon-free energy by 2030. It&#8217;s already matching its energy usage with renewable energy purchases. But it&#8217;s not just Google Cloud, virtually every enterprise today is looking to see how it can reach its emission targets, too. Quantifying the role of cloud computing in this is notoriously difficult, though, so the idea here is to make it easier for businesses to report the environmental impact of their cloud usage, both internally and externally.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216442" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-3.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216442" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2216442" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-3.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2216442" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216432" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Customers can leverage this data for reporting as well as internal audits and carbon reduction efforts. Build in collaboration with customers like HSBC, L&#8217;Oreal and Atos, our carbon footprint reporting introduces a new level of transparency to support customers in meeting their climate goals,&#8221; said Jenn Bennett, who leads Google Cloud&#8217;s data and technology strategy for sustainability in the <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-cloud/octo-google-clouds-two-way-innovation-street/">Office of the CTO</a>. &#8220;Customers can monitor their cloud emissions over time by project, by product and by region, empowering IT teams and developers with metrics that help them reduce their carbon footprint. Digital infrastructure emissions are really just one part of their environmental footprint, but accounting for carbon emissions is necessary to measure progress against the carbon reduction targets that they all have.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216453" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216453" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2216453" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Untitled-1.gif" alt="" width="600" height="375" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2216453" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>As Bennett noted, once a company has accurate reporting in place, providing recommendations for how to reduce their climate impact is a natural next step. Specifically, this means adding carbon estimates to Google Cloud&#8217;s Unattended Project Recommender, which helps customers reduce their number of idling resources, and adding a sustainability impact category to its Active Assist Recommender.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">KixCare, a Canadian pediatric <a href="https://www.kixcare.com/">virtual healthcare platform</a>, announced that it has raised $2 million in seed funding. Esplanade Ventures, Canada’s leading digital health venture capital firm, led the funding round, with participation from Horizon Capital and angel investors.</p>
<p>The platform connects families and their children with pediatric telehealth services and aims to enable equitable access to quality care for all Canadian children. KixCare’s team of pediatric care experts includes pediatricians, psychologists, behavioral therapists, dietitians, concussion specialists and more. The company currently offers services in the province of Ontario and is looking to expand across Canada.</p>
<p>“The funding has enabled us to grow our presence here in Ontario and we’ll be launching next in Quebec by the end of the year,” said KixCare CEO Daniel Warner in an interview with TechCrunch. “The funding will be used to grow our team, improve the digital experience and grow our network of healthcare providers, including pediatricians.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216105" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Warner noted that KixCare believes that the current model of children’s healthcare often fails to meet the needs of both families and providers. The team believes that existing traditional and digital healthcare options often fail to provide accessible, online pediatric care from experts.</p>
<p>Through KixCare, families and their children are able to access primary and comprehensive care for things like mental health and concessions, along with sleep, diet and lactation concerns. KixCare’s pediatric experts are available outside traditional clinic hours by appointment or within the hour for urgent situations.</p>
<p>“KixCare provides a simple accessible solution for many of the challenges that are present in children’s healthcare today. We’re so excited to be the first ones to launch the pediatric-specific virtual care service. Our social mission is to help all 10 million Canadian families equitably and to be there for them and their little ones through their healthcare journey,” Warner stated.</p>
<p>“The time is right to introduce a new pillar into the pediatric care space. We want to have children and their families turn to KixCare for problems big or small, many of which can be resolved virtually. Especially with the pandemic, where have parents turned to for quality healthcare for their children? If it’s a primary care concern or mental health concern, where do you turn? The answer is now KixCare.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When asked about how KixCare differs from numerous other virtual healthcare platforms, Warner said that KixCare is the only platform that is focused exclusively on pediatric health. He also noted that some other platforms have an out-of-pocket charge or require users to go through insurance, but that KixCare allows families to access the service for free through their provincial health cards.</p>
<p>In terms of the future, Warner said KixCare is looking to add more services and diagnostic tools, as the company aims to ensure that it can build an immersive and quality experience that meets the needs of children.</p>
<p>Additionally, Dr. Janaki Vallipuram, one of KixCare’s healthcare providers, told TechCrunch in an email that “the platform is needed now more than ever &#8211; when timely access to primary care is difficult due to the pandemic and emergency departments are seeing higher numbers of pediatric visits that do not necessarily need to be there.</p>
<p>“However, I believe that Kixcare has a role beyond just this pandemic and can continue to be a great addition to our existing healthcare model. I am thrilled to be part of a platform that is so impactful, and to be working with a team that has a great vision.”</p>
<p>KixCare was founded by a team of healthcare veterans, including Dr. Sheldon Elman, a family physician with over 45 years of experience in healthcare and who is also the founder and chairman of Persistence Capital Partners and Esplanade Ventures. Dr. Elman is joined by Dr. Harley Eisman, the chief medical officer of KixCare and the medical director of pediatric emergency services at Montreal Children’s Hospital with over 25 years of experience as a physician.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">MX Player, the popular on-demand video streaming service, has passed 1 billion downloads, joining a very small but high-profile list of apps globally to achieve this milestone. The firm, owned by Indian conglomerate Times Internet, is the first from the world&#8217;s second largest market to make it to the group.</p>
<p>The app, which began its journey as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/times-internet-buys-mx-player-for-140m/">a local video playback player</a>, has grown immensely in the past two years as the startup populated the platform with thousands of local and international movies and shows and several original titles, it said, and also as people found themselves locked in their homes with newfound time because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>MX Players &#8212; which offers an ad-supported free app or those without ads for just $2.6 a year &#8212; has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/26/indias-mx-player-expands-to-us-uk-and-other-markets-in-international-push/">expanded to several international markets</a> including Bangladesh, Middle East, Southeast Asia, U.S. and the UK. (India is its most popular market.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216588" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.mxplayer.in">MX Player</a>&#8216;s page on the Google Play Store now <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mxtech.videoplayer.ad">reflects the 1 billion installs figure</a>, though the startup &#8212; whose vast majority of users are on Android &#8212; added that it also sees very considerable large volumes of downloads on several third-party stores. (It did not share figures for other stores.)</p>
<p>“We focused on two simple things: get the right content for the audience we have and get the product right for our users,” said Karan Bedi, chief executive of MX Player, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Bedi said the startup has made fast inroads in the market in part because very few players are producing content for the masses. Bedi, who previously ran Eros Now’s India business, pointed to the disconnect between the players and the audiences they are going after even as everyone appears to claim that they are attempting to win the entire country.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2216612" style="width: 920px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2216612" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2216612 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karan-Bedi-CEO-MX-Player.jpeg" alt="" width="910" height="1280" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karan-Bedi-CEO-MX-Player.jpeg 910w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karan-Bedi-CEO-MX-Player.jpeg?resize=107,150 107w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karan-Bedi-CEO-MX-Player.jpeg?resize=213,300 213w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karan-Bedi-CEO-MX-Player.jpeg?resize=768,1080 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karan-Bedi-CEO-MX-Player.jpeg?resize=483,680 483w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Karan-Bedi-CEO-MX-Player.jpeg?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 910px) 100vw, 910px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2216612" class="wp-caption-text">Karan Bedi (Image credits: Times Internet)</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“When you look at the landscape, we have the broadcast players who are putting their broadcast content on OTT with some small investment in producing original shows. Then we have the international firms &#8212; Netflix and Amazon &#8212; that are focusing on the top 5% of the masses,” he said.</p>
<p>“If you look at the content we are going after, it’s very relatable to the broader audience,” he said.</p>
<p>Some of the original web shows MX Player has produced or exclusively licensed include Hello Mini, a thriller and romance story, Aashram, which is also in thriller and crime genres, and Flames, a teenage romance story. Citing an internal survey MX Player conducted with its users, Bedi said shows such as the &#8220;Indian Matchmaking,&#8221; which made a lot of buzz among Netflix users in India, didn&#8217;t find resonance with MX Player audience.</p>
<p>MX Player, which also operates the popular short-video app MX TakaTak, has also emerged as one of the most aggressive firms to innovate and adapt on product innovation. Its app also has in-app integration with music service Gaana, also owned by Times Internet, as well as offers several mini-games.</p>
<p>The app was the first among any popular video services to deploy support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versatile_Video_Coding">H.266 video codec</a>. The move has allowed the firm to reduce the amount of data users consume while streaming videos by more than half &#8212; while also improving the overall video quality.</p>
<p>Improvements like this are even more significant for firms such as MX Player, Bedi said, because of the audience it is serving. &#8220;For example, we have had clear measurement on the link between latency and engagement. The lower the latency, and we&#8217;re talking about seconds here, we have seen seven to eight percent bump in engagement.&#8221;</p>
<p>India is one of the world&#8217;s fastest growing entertainment markets. Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney&#8217;s Hotstar, and dozens of other international services are competing to win users in the country, which has over 700 million of them online.</p>
<p>According to research firm Sensor Tower, there are fewer than 20 apps (not including those from Google that ship pre-installed on Android devices) that have been downloaded or installed a billion times. The firm confirmed to TechCrunch in August that no other Indian app was even close to hitting the milestone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amid a <a href="https://aibusiness.com/author.asp?section_id=789&amp;doc_id=769626" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global semiconductor shortage</a>, an upstart in the world of AI chips is announcing a big round of funding to meet a boom in demand for its technology. <a href="https://hailo.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hailo</a>, which makes edge-device chips customized to work with AI workloads &#8212; typical implementations include smart cities, retail environments, industrial settings and next-generation automotive systems &#8212; has raised $136 million in a Series C round of funding, one of the biggest to date in the AI chip market. We&#8217;ve confirmed with sources close to Hailo that the investment values it at around $1 billion.</p>
<p class="p1">Poalim Equity and Gil Agmon co-led the round, with participation also from previous backers Hailo Chairman Zohar Zisapel, ABB Technology Ventures (ATV), Latitude Ventures, OurCrowd; and new investors Carasso Motors, Comasco, Shlomo Group, Talcar Corporation Ltd., and Automotive Equipment (AEV). The company has now raised some $224 million to date.</p>
<p>This latest round comes about 18 months after Hailo&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/hailo-raises-60m-series-b-for-its-ai-chips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Series B of $60 million</a>, and about a year after the release of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/hailo-challenges-intel-and-google-with-its-new-ai-modules-for-edge-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company&#8217;s most recent AI modules</a> based on its Hailo 8 chip, intended to compete against the likes of Intel and Nvidia.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2216569" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Orr Danon, the co-founder and CEO, said in an interview that in the interim the company has been seeing a huge surge of interest in the market &#8212; in the last quarter alone, he said Hailo doubled the number of projects it&#8217;s working on to 100 &#8212; so this latest round is about scaling to meet that demand, but also to continue customizing how and where its processors can be used.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are now in the market with the Hailo 8, and people are very excited because of its efficiency,&#8221; he said. One unique aspect of Hailo&#8217;s edge chips is that they are designed to adapt to existing resources to work with custom neural networks, so not only are they fast but need less energy to run than the equivalent amount of processing power that you might otherwise need in a data center computer to run a similar task. &#8220;However, we want to expand our offering. It&#8217;s not a one size fits all, so we are also investing in software.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">The funding is coming on the heels of a complicated year in the world of chips, where the pandemic has alternative driven strong demand in some areas (for example in consumer environments, where users have been kickstarting the renewal cycle for better devices at a time when other activity has been limited); big drops in activity among others (eg, ambitious projects in areas like autonomous vehicles); and a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/were-in-a-hurry-a-new-ceo-scrambles-to-cope-with-a-global-chip-crisis-11633701630?mod=djemalertNEWS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major slowdown</a> in production overall. For a company working in edge devices as Hailo is, that presents an opportunity to make the case for more efficient and cost effective systems, helped by the fact that it is able to integrate with users&#8217; own neural networks and preferred development frameworks such TensorFlow or ONNX.</p>
<p>Danon said that while Hailo has seen a softening in demand in some segments &#8212; for example, automotive &#8212; the diversity of its business has meant that demand overall has continued to rise. Even automotive is coming back after a particularly frothy period and some fallout as a result. So, for example, while the number of projects focused on fully-autonomous vehicles may have gone down, there are still a number of efforts working on semi-autonomous systems, which he said still translate into business for Hailo.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Companies are now starting to look for realistic deployments, and facing real challenges,&#8221; he said. &#8221; Okay, maybe we do not need our self-driving cars to drive on the Autobahn, but we still need to learn new tasks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alongside this, he said the company is seeing a lot of strong interest from industrial customers, those in the retail industry (where edge devices are used for computer vision applications, such as those you might have in a security system, or in an automated check-out service, or for analytics), and in smart cities, where transportation will also continue to be a major driver of business. It&#8217;s for the opportunity ahead as much as for the current business that investors are backing the company.</p>
<p>“In the coming years, AI will become the defining feature for creating new business value and reshaping user experience as we know it. The ability to bring AI-based features to market will increasingly be the deciding factor over whether companies succeed or fail,” said Mooly Eden, who recently left Intel, where he worked for nearly 40 years and was most recently president of its operations in Israel, and is now on the board of Hailo. “Hailo’s innovative and hyper-efficient processor architecture addresses the growing demand for a new kind of chip to handle these new types of workloads, challenging traditional computing solutions.”</p>
