										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the pandemic forced everyone to stay at home last year, many gym-goers looked to at-home fitness makers to fill the void for their cardiovascular and strength-training workouts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help meet that demand, <a href="https://tempo.fit/">Tempo</a>, the five-year-old fitness startup founded by Moawia Eldeeb and Josh Augustin, closed a $220 million Series C round led by SoftBank. The company plans to use the raise to shore up its supply chain, keep up with increased consumer demand and fuel efforts such as R&amp;D and content. Other participants in the Series C round included Bling Capital, DCM, General Catalyst and Norwest Venture Partners. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tempo’s freestanding cabinet, which the company launched in February 2020, includes a 42-inch touchscreen with a 3D motion-tracking camera that consistently scans, tracks and coaches users as they work out. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It currently sells three hardware bundles, starting at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$2,495, that include accessories like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">barbells, dumbbells, a folding bench, a kettlebell system, a squat rack, a workout mat, a recovery foam roller and a heart rate monitor, depending on which bundle customers spring for. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users also pay a $39 monthly subscription to access on-demand and live classes. </span></p>
<p>[gallery ids="2137299,2137301,2137366,2137300,2137302,2137365"]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept for Tempo came about in 2015 when Eldeeb and Augustin developed SmartSpot, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a computer vision-augmented smart screen they sold to gyms that helped trainers analyze and improve their clients’ form during workouts. With the trove of data generated and collected by SmartSpot, Eldeeb and Augustin developed a program that identified fitness users’ most common movement errors and utilized machine learning to offer unique recommendations for each individual user — a program that became part of the foundation for Tempo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Being a personal trainer once, I remember charging $150 an hour,” explains Eldeeb. “I want to create a better experience and offer it to many more people for a lot less. That means we&#8217;re going to continue to invest in the core technology that makes that possible.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tempo’s launch came during a particularly opportune time. With the pandemic unfolding, demand for at-home fitness solutions soared. The startup has seen sales surge 1,000% since it began taking pre-orders in early 2020, with delivery delays currently ranging between five to seven weeks — a common issue faced by other at-home fitness companies such as Peloton, Tonal and Echelon. Tempo users have collectively performed 5 million workouts, or clocked 40,000 hours on their devices to date, according to the company. </span></p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0NicenYFUg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1/">The Tonal EC-1</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The Tonal EC-1&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/tonal-ec1/embed/#?secret=0NicenYFUg" data-secret="0NicenYFUg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That [supply chain] was definitely an issue,” acknowledges Eldeeb, pointing to production challenges posed by factories temporarily shutting down or reducing operations in 2020. “We were doing this for the first time at scale, and we’d made small quantities of the product before [launch]. But for our first year in the market, we had to solve all those problems and still ship the product, which was a huge undertaking. We basically had to reduce sales because I wanted the factory workers to be safe.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Tempo, the opportunity to scale is enormous, as the global market is estimated to reach </span><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/smart-fitness-devices-market"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$29.4 billion </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">by 2025. With new funding in tow, Eldeeb wants to capitalize on surging demand, with plans of doubling down on logistics and its supply chain, growing employee headcount and expanding its content to offer yoga and boxing classes later this year.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With vaccinations across the U.S. steadily increasing and gyms reopening, the big question is whether people will stick with their at-home fitness workouts, throw themselves back into their old gym routines or adopt a hybrid model that marries the two. Eldeeb is betting that now that more people have acclimated to working out in their homes, they’ll stay the course out of sheer convenience, pointing to </span><a href="https://newconsumer.com/trends/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a Consumer Trends report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from The New Consumer published earlier this year indicating that 81% of people under the age of 40 prefer to exercise at home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If true, then companies like Tempo will continue to reap the benefits of this shift of fitness into the home. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[How do you predict earnings when you are still figuring it out? You need to work on making your revenue predictable, repeatable and scalable; and use tools that will help you create projections.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For a long time, &#8220;revenue&#8221; seemed to be a taboo word in the startup world. Fortunately, things have changed with the rise of SaaS and alternative funding sources such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/19/who-are-the-major-revenue-based-investing-vcs/">revenue-based investing VCs</a>. Still, revenue modeling remains a challenge for founders. How do you predict earnings when you are still figuring it out?</p>
<p>The answer is twofold: You need to make your revenue predictable, repeatable and scalable in the first place, plus make use of tools that will help you create projections based on your data. Here, we&#8217;ll suggest some ways you can get more visibility into your revenue, find the data that really matter and figure out how to put a process in place to make forecasts about it.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			You need to make your revenue predictable, repeatable and scalable in the first place, plus make use of tools that will help you create projections based on your data.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Base projections on repeatable, scalable results</h2>
<p>Aaron Ross is a co-author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Predictable-Revenue-Business-Practices-Salesforce-com/dp/0984380213">&#8220;Predictable Revenue,&#8221;</a> a book based on his experience of creating a process and team that helped grow Salesforce&#8217;s revenue by more than $100 million. &#8220;Predictable&#8221; is the key word here: &#8220;You want growth that doesn&#8217;t require guessing, hope and frantic last-minute deal-hustling every quarter- and year-end,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>This makes recurring revenue particularly desirable, though it is by no means the be-all-end-all of predictable revenue. On one hand, there is always the risk that recurring revenue won&#8217;t last, as customers may churn and organic growth runs out of gas. On the other, there is a broader picture for predictable revenue that goes beyond subscription-based models.</p>
<p>Ross and his co-author, <a href="https://maryloutyler.com/about/">Marylou Tyler,</a> outline three steps to predictable revenue: predictable lead generation, a dedicated sales development team and consistent sales systems. They wrote an entire book about it, so it would be hard to sum it up here. So what&#8217;s the takeaway? You shouldn&#8217;t base your projections on processes and results that aren&#8217;t repeatable and scalable.</p>
<h2>Cross the hot coals</h2>
<p>In their early days, startups usually grow via word of mouth, luck and sheer hustle. The problem is that it likely won&#8217;t lead to sustainable growth; as the saying goes, what got you <em>here</em> won&#8217;t get you <em>there</em>. In between, there is typically a phase of uncertainty and missed results that Ross refers to as &#8220;the hot coals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before the hot coals, predicting revenue is vain at best, and oftentimes impossible. I, for one, remember being at a loss when an old-school investor asked me for five-year profit-and-loss projections when my now-defunct startup was nowhere near a stable money-making path. <a href="https://twitter.com/lpolovets/status/1029959027260764160?s=12">Not all seed investors expect this</a>, so there was obviously a mismatch here, but the challenge is still the same for most founders: How do you bridge the gap between traditional projections and the reality of a startup?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">The $9 trillion financial management firm Blackrock is collaborating with the $313 billion Singapore investment firm Temasek to back companies developing technologies and services to help create a zero emission economy by 2050.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">The two mega-investment firms will invest an initial $600 million to launch Decarbonization Partners, and look to raise money from investors committing to achieving a net zero world and long-term sustainable finacnial returns. The two partners have set themselves a goal to raise $1 billion for their first fund, including capital from Temasek and BlackRock.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The partnership, coming during Earth month, is one of several big multi-billion dollar initiatives that are underway to prevent global climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Indeed, BlackRock is somewhat tardy to the party. Temasek, for its part, has already made a number of high-profile bets in the alternative meat market &#8212; namely in companies like Impossible Foods &#8212; and in alternative energy technology developers including Eavor, a geothermal company, and a $500 million bet on a renewable power developer in India.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a coalition of billionaires led by Bill Gates are already on their second billion dollar investment vehicle through Breakthrough Energy, a multi-stage, multi-strategy initiative that includes a venture capital arm as well as other types of financing on the way.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The world cannot meet its net zero ambitions without transformational innovation,” said Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, in a statement. “For decarbonization solutions and technologies to transform our economy, they need to be scaled. To do that, they need patient, well-managed capital to support their vital goals. This partnership will help define climate solutions as a standalone asset class that is both essential to our collective mission and a historic investment opportunity created by the net zero transition.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To get a sense of what Decarbonization Partners might back, companies should probably look to the Breakthrough Energy portfolio &#8212; the firms share similar interests in new sources of energy, technologies to distribute that energy, building and manufacturing technologies, and material science and process innovations.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a big swing that the firms are taking, but the flood of capital coming into the sustainability sector is commensurate with both the size of the problem, and the potential opportunity in returns generated by solving it.</p>
<p>A report from Morgan Stanley estimated that solving climate change <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2019/10/24/stopping-global-warming-will-cost-50-trillion-morgan-stanley-report/?sh=4b3f1d7751e2">would be a $50 trillion problem</a>, according to a 2019 report from Forbes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Bold, aggressive actions are needed to make the global net zero ambition a reality. Decarbonization Partners represents one of several steps we are taking to follow through on our commitment to halve the emissions from our portfolio by 2030, and ultimately move to net zero emissions by 2050,” said Dilhan Pillay, Chief Executive Officer of Temasek International. “Through collective efforts with like-minded partners, we will be able to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders over the long term, and investors will have the opportunity to help deliver innovative solutions at scale to address climate challenges.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">How much is Epic Games worth? Well, we’ve long ago surpasses the realm of dollar figures regular humans can contextualize. With its latest round, the gamer hits an equity valuation of $28.7 billion. Yes, &#8220;b&#8221; for &#8220;billion.&#8221; That’s a lot of micro-transactions.</p>
<p>Time to start talking metaverse!</p>
<p>Best known for the wildly successful battle royale title, Fortnite, Epic just announced another $1 billion funding round, featuring a $200 million Sony Group Corporation investment. The rest of the list is, predictably, a long one, including [deep breath], Appaloosa, Baillie Gifford, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company LLC, GIC, T. Rowe Price Associates-managed accounts, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, BlackRock managed accounts, Park West, KKR, AllianceBernstein, Altimeter, Franklin Templeton and Luxor Capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We are grateful to our new and existing investors who support our vision for Epic and the Metaverse,” CEO and founder Tim Sweeney said in a statement tied to the news. “Their investment will help accelerate our work around building connected social experiences in Fortnite, Rocket League and Fall Guys, while empowering game developers and creators with Unreal Engine, Epic Online Services and the Epic Games Store.”</p>
<p>Sweeney has plenty of reason to be grateful, as the controlling shareholder.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a busy several months for the game-maker. The company has been waging an on-going war with the both Apple and Google over in-game payment revenues. A trial expected to feature some of the biggest names in tech is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/20/tim-cook-and-tim-sweeney-among-potential-witnesses-for-apple-epic-trial/">expected to kick off early next month</a>.</p>
<p>Epic has also been using its already extremely deep coffers to purchase game developers and publishing studios, including its March acquisition of Fall Guys-maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/epic-is-buying-fall-guys-developer-mediatonic/">Mediatonic</a>. It&#8217;s clear the company is amassing a large portfolio of titles through acquisitions, a trend that is almost certain to continue with this latest massive round.</p>
<p>The funding also looks likely to strengthen the company&#8217;s ties to Sony, as well. Here&#8217;s Sony Group Corporation CEO, Kenichiro Yoshida, also quoted in the press release,</p>
<blockquote><p>Epic continues to deliver revolutionary experiences through their array of cutting edge technologies that support creators in gaming and across the digital entertainment industry. We are excited to strengthen our collaboration to bring new entertainment experiences to people around the world. I strongly believe that this aligns with our purpose to fill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology.</p></blockquote>
<p>Prior to this round, the company had <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/epic-games-2">raised $3.4 billion</a>, including a a $1.78 billion round last August.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Justin Mast has a simple reason for starting his plant retail startup <a href="https://bloomscape.com/">Bloomscape</a> in Detroit.</p>
<p>“This is home,” he told me. “This is where I have a really strong network and I knew I’d be able to find a lot of support.”</p>
<p>Mast didn’t grow up in Detroit proper, but he’s from Grand Rapids, Michigan&#8217;s second largest city. He recalled a weekend in Detroit after finishing graduate school at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, when he was “totally blown away” by the city’s energy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And when it came time to launch Bloomscape in 2018, Mast said it made sense to do so from Detroit because of Michigan’s “strong heritage in the horticulture industry” — in floriculture, for example, it <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/Todays_Reports/reports/floran20.pdf">ranks as one of the biggest producers in the United States</a>.</p>
<p>That heritage isn’t abstract to him. Mast said his family has been involved in the industry for five generations on his father’s side (including three generations in the Netherlands) and three generations on his mother’s. He worked in the family greenhouse as a child and even starting a roadside plant stand.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124397" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124397" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2124397 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/210218_bloomkits-lifestyle_4_1234.jpg" alt="Bloomscape" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/210218_bloomkits-lifestyle_4_1234.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/210218_bloomkits-lifestyle_4_1234.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/210218_bloomkits-lifestyle_4_1234.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/210218_bloomkits-lifestyle_4_1234.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/210218_bloomkits-lifestyle_4_1234.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/210218_bloomkits-lifestyle_4_1234.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2124397" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bloomscape</p></div></p>
<p>“This was my version of a lemonade stand,” he said — albeit a lemonade stand that became popular enough that Mast needed to recruit his siblings for help, and that eventually provided him with enough money to buy a used car.</p>
<p>Bloomscape launched in 2018, and Mast said that from the beginning, the startup’s advantage was “to really know the ins and outs of the business.” That allowed Bloomscape to ship larger plants (like birds of paradise and Chinese fan palms), and more recently to expand with outdoor plants and garden <a href="https://bloomscape.com/shop/plants/outdoor-porch-patio-plants/">&#8220;bloom kits.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>“By focusing on one of the least glamorized parts of this industry, the supply chain, we are able to design this process for shipping larger plants, at scale, throughout the country,” he said. “We’re shipping out tropical plants in the dead of winter, thousands of times a week, with a real high level of consistency. We know the plants really well, we how they perform, how they move through a supply chain, we know the nuances of FedEx and UPS, we know what growers are growing quality product.”</p>
<p>Bloomscape has raised a total of $24 million, most recently in a Series B last fall led by General Catalyst, with participation from Annox Capital’s Bob Mylod, Home Depot board member Jeff Boyd, former Seventh Generation and Burt’s Bees CEO John Replogle and existing investors Revolution Ventures and Ludlow Ventures.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124400" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124400" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2124400" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Bloomscape.gif?w=600" alt="Bloomscape" width="600" height="600" /><p id="caption-attachment-2124400" class="wp-caption-text">Bloomscape bloom kits</p></div></p>
<p>When I asked whether investors had ever pressured him to move the startup to Silicon Valley, Mast said, “We’ve had successful funding rounds, but even in most successful rounds, not everyone’s going to be the right fit.” So it sounds like the issue came up, but Mast made sure that everyone who actually invested saw the startup’s location as an advantage, or at least “if they saw it as a disadvantage, they were willing to overlook it.”</p>

<p>Nor has the location proven to be an issue when it comes to hiring. Mast said the company successfully lured Aaron Averbuch (formerly based in Seattle and a vice president of engineering at Placed and Snap) to Detroit to become CTO. He also noted that Detroit is close to the University of Michigan, and that “all the schools in Chicago and Pittsburgh are within a few hours’ drive.”</p>
<p>Mast added that the last six months have been “a particularly exciting time” to run a startup in Detroit, with the success of companies like StockX, Floyd and Autobooks.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;re thrilled to be here,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.homex.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">HomeX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a home services platform for homeowners and service providers</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">has raised $90 million in a funding round led by New Mountain Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Mountain Capital, a New York-based investment firm with more than $30 billion in assets under management, was the only institutional investor to put money in this round alongside company executives. The company was bootstrapped until a 2019 $50 million-plus debt financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2017, Chicago-based HomeX aims to “radically improve” home services by pairing service workers with homeowners, both virtually and in person. It also has built software, and offers services for, contractors that are aimed at helping them drive and manage demand “more efficiently.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, one of the company’s co-founders, CTO </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonjweaver/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simon Weaver</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and several team members were on the development team of Evi, a startup that had built an AI program that can be communicated with using natural language via an app, that was </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/17/sources-say-amazon-acquired-siri-like-evi-app-for-26m-is-a-smartphone-coming/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired by Amazon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2012. That technology was essentially the brain behind Amazon’s virtual assistant Alexa. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HomeX uses artificial intelligence to diagnose home issues virtually before a contractor even goes out to a home, with the goal of helping them resolve a problem faster (by having the necessary equipment ahead of time for example), which in turn makes customers happier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re using machine-generated content to create solutions that are specific to a homeowner’s issues,” said  co-founder and president Vincent Payen. “Using machines to understand symptoms, the questions to ask and to actually get to a diagnosis and a recommendation or resolution is where AI absolutely shines and allows us to do things that were not possible even three or five years ago.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founder and CEO Michael Werner worked in the </span><a href="https://www.homeadvisor.com/research/home-services-is-a-500-billion-dollar-industry/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$500 billion services industry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for years (his family founded <a href="https://www.wernerco.com/us">Werner Ladders</a>) and recognized just how fragmented it was. He also acknowledges that, especially in certain markets, “there&#8217;s a terrible imbalance between very high demand and not enough contractors to do the work, or rather, a terrible labor shortage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HomeX Remote Assist</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in particular virtually connects homeowners (via phone, video or chat) with HomeX’s licensed technicians to diagnose and repair common home issues. That business unit has experienced more than 400% growth in less than a year, according to Werner. Last year, the company grew by “about 5x” the number of contractors on its platform. It declined to reveal revenue figures.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For homeowners, we&#8217;re making home maintenance less complicated,” Werner said. “At the same time, we want to help the contractor succeed. Similar to how telemedicine has changed how medicine is delivered, HomeX Remote Assist is going to change the service experience for taking care of your home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another area of HomeX’s business that is growing rapidly is its B2B offering. Home warranty and insurance companies see remote services “as very additive to make their business more efficient,” notes Payen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are using some of our capital toward a pilot program and a number of business development opportunities there,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, while the company is not profitable overall, it is profitable in the services side of its business, according to Werner. In the last 12 months alone, it has served &#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of clients via its platform, defined by unique virtual and physical appointments.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Mountain Capital Managing Director Harris Kealey said his firm viewed HomeX as a business that is primed to reshape the home and commercial services industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The market is massive and the need for change and innovation is substantial,” he said in a written statement.</span></p>
<p>Another company in the space, <a href="https://www.thumbtack.com">Thumbtack</a>, recently expanded into video home checkups. Thumbtack, a marketplace where you can hire local professionals for home improvement and other services such as repairs, in December <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/thumbtack-acquires-setter/">acquired</a> <a href="https://setter.com">Setter, </a>a startup which provided its customers with video home checkups conducted by experts, and then offered personalized plans for how to address any issues.</p>
<p>Thumbtack had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/30/thumbtack-layoffs/">laid off 250 employees</a> at the end of March 2020, after the company saw big declines in its major markets. Since then, however, CEO Marco Zappacosta told TechCrunch there’s been “a renewed focus on the home and an acceleration of digital adoption.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Artificial intelligence technology holds a huge amount of promise for enterprises &#8212; as a tool to process and understand their data more efficiently; as a way to leapfrog into new kinds of services and products; and as a critical stepping stone into whatever the future might hold for their businesses. But the problem for many enterprises is that they are not tech businesses at their cores and so bringing on and using AI will typically involve a lot of heavy lifting. Today, one of the startups building AI services is announcing a big round of funding to help bridge that gap.</p>
<p><a href="https://sambanova.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SambaNova</a> &#8212; a startup building AI hardware and integrated systems that run on it that only officially came out of three years in stealth last December &#8212; is announcing a huge round of funding today to take its business out into the world. The company has closed in on $676 million in financing, a Series D that co-founder and CEO Rodrigo Liang has confirmed values the company at $5.1 billion.</p>
<p>The round is being led by SoftBank, which is making the investment via Vision Fund 2. Temasek and the Government of Singapore Investment Corp. (GIC), both new investors, are also participating, along with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/15/the-red-hot-ai-chip-space-gets-even-hotter-with-56m-for-a-startup-called-sambanova/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous backers</a> BlackRock, Intel Capital, GV (formerly Google Ventures), Walden International and WRVI, among other unnamed investors. (Sidenote: BlackRock and Temasek separately <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210412005969/en/Temasek-and-BlackRock-Launch-Decarbonization-Investment-Partnership" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kicked off an investment partnership yesterday</a>, although it&#8217;s not clear if this falls into that remit.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Co-founded by two Stanford professors, Kunle Olukotun and Chris Ré, and Liang, who had been an engineering executive at Oracle, SambaNova has been around since 2017 and has raised more than $1 billion to date &#8212; both to build out its AI-focused hardware, which it calls <a href="https://sambanova.ai/products/datascale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DataScale</a> and to build out the system that runs on it. (The &#8220;Samba&#8221; in the name is a reference to Liang&#8217;s Brazilian heritage, he said, but also the Latino music and dance that speaks of constant movement and shifting, not unlike the journey AI data regularly needs to take that makes it too complicated and too intensive to run on more traditional systems.)</p>
<p>SambaNova on one level competes for enterprise business against companies like Nvidia, Cerebras Systems and Graphcore &#8212; another startup in the space which earlier this year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/28/ai-chipmaker-graphcore-raises-222m-at-a-2-77b-valuation-and-puts-an-ipo-in-its-sights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised a significant round</a>. However, SambaNova has also taken a slightly different approach to the AI challenge.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201209005200/en/SambaNova-Systems-Ushers-in-New-Era-of-Computing-with-Availability-of-SambaNova-DataScale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December</a>, the startup launched <a href="https://sambanova.ai/services/dataflow-as-a-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dataflow-as-a-service</a> as an on-demand, subscription-based way for enterprises to tap into SambaNova&#8217;s AI system, with the focus just on the applications that run on it, without needing to focus on maintaining those systems themselves. It&#8217;s the latter that SambaNova will be focusing on selling and delivering with this latest tranche of funding, Liang said.</p>
<p>SambaNova&#8217;s opportunity, Liang believes, lies in selling software-based AI systems to enterprises that are keen to adopt more AI into their business, but might lack the talent and other resources to do so if it requires running and maintaining large systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;The market right now has a lot of interest in AI. They are finding they have to transition to this way of competing, and it&#8217;s no longer acceptable not to be considering it,&#8221; said Liang in an interview.</p>
<p>The problem, he said, is that most AI companies &#8220;want to talk chips,&#8221; yet many would-be customers will lack the teams and appetite to essentially become technology companies to run those services. &#8220;Rather than you coming in and thinking about how to hire scientists and hire and then deploy an AI service, you can now subscribe, and bring in that technology overnight. We’re very proud that our technology is pushing the envelope on cases in the industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be clear, a company will <em>still</em> need data scientists, just not the same number, and specifically not the same number dedicating their time to maintaining systems, updating code and other more incremental work that comes managing an end-to-end process.</p>
<p>SambaNova has not disclosed many customers so far in the work that it has done &#8212; the two reference names it provided to me are both research labs, the <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://sambanova.ai/videos/argonne-national-laboratory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sambanova.ai/videos/argonne-national-laboratory/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618405040273000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGkKuXMEiUeVRaxOsAQsDQ8dddoMA">Argonne National Laboratory</a> and the <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://sambanova.ai/videos/lawrence-livermore-national-laboratory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sambanova.ai/videos/lawrence-livermore-national-laboratory/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618405040273000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHBSo0lMOUlA0ytBQaWCC6OxPxHMw">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> &#8212; but Liang noted some typical use cases.</p>
<p>One was in imaging, such as in the healthcare industry, where the company&#8217;s technology is being used to help train systems based on high-resolution imagery, along with other healthcare-related work. The coincidentally-named Corona supercomputer at the Livermore Lab (it was named after the 2014 lunar eclipse, not the dark cloud of a pandemic that we&#8217;re currently living through) is using SambaNova&#8217;s technology to help run calculations related to some Covid-19 therapeutic and antiviral compound research, Marshall Choy, the company&#8217;s VP of product, told me.</p>
<p>Another set of applications involves building systems around custom language models, for example in specific industries like finance, to process data quicker. And a third is in recommendation algorithms, something that appears in most digital services and frankly could always do to work a little better than it does today. I&#8217;m guessing that in the coming months it will release more information about where and who is using its technology.</p>
<p>Liang also would not comment on whether Google and Intel were specifically tapping SambaNova as a partner in their own AI services, but he didn&#8217;t rule out the prospect of partnering to go to market. Indeed, both have strong enterprise businesses that span well beyond technology companies, and so working with a third party that is helping to make even their own AI cores more accessible could be an interesting prospect, and SambaNova&#8217;s DataScale (and the Dataflow-as-a-service system) both work using input from frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, so there is a level of integration already there.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re quite comfortable in collaborating with others in this space,&#8221; Liang said. &#8220;We think the market will be large and will start segmenting. The opportunity for us is in being able to take hold of some of the hardest problems in a much simpler way on their behalf. That is a very valuable proposition.&#8221;</p>
<p>The promise of creating a more accessible AI for businesses is one that has eluded quite a few companies to date, so the prospect of finally cracking that nut is one that appeals to investors.</p>
<p>“SambaNova has created a leading systems architecture that is flexible, efficient and scalable. This provides a holistic software and hardware solution for customers and alleviates the additional complexity driven by single technology component solutions,” said Deep Nishar, Senior Managing Partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. “We are excited to partner with Rodrigo and the SambaNova team to support their mission of bringing advanced AI solutions to organizations globally.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Building, scaling and launching new tools and products is the lifeblood of the technology sector. When we consider these concepts today, many think of Big Tech and flashy startups, known for their industry dominance or new technologies that impact our everyday lives. But long before garages and dorm rooms became decentralized hubs for these innovations, local and state governments, along with many agencies within the federal government, pioneered tech products with the goal of improving the lives of millions.</p>

			Long before garages and dorm rooms became decentralized hubs for innovation, local and state governments, along with many agencies within the federal government, pioneered tech products with the goal of improving the lives of millions.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As an industry, we’ve developed a notion that working in government, the place where the groundwork was laid for<a href="https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/timeline/personalized-assistant-that-learns"> the digital assistants we use every day</a>, is now far less appealing than working in the private sector. The immense salary differential is often cited as the overwhelming reason workers prefer to work in the private sphere.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But the hard truth is the private sector brings far more value than just higher compensation to employees. Look no further than the boom in the tech sector during the pandemic to understand why it’s so attractive. A company like Zoom, already established and successful in its own right for years, found itself in a situation where it had to<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/2/21277006/zoom-q1-2021-earnings-coronavirus-pandemic-work-from-home"> serve an exponentially growing and diverse user base</a> in a short period of time. It quickly confronted a slew of infrastructure and user experience pivots on its way to becoming a staple of work-from-home culture &#8212; and succeeded.</p>
<p>That innate ability to work fast to deliver for consumers and innovate at what feels like a moment’s notice is what really draws talent. Compare that to the government’s tech environment, where decreased funding and partisan oversight slow the pace of work, or, worse, can get in the way of exploring or implementing new ideas entirely.</p>
<p>One look (literally, see our graph below) at the trends around R&amp;D spending in the private and government sectors also paints a clear picture of where future innovations will come from if we don’t change the equation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2133385" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2133385" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2133385 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Josh-Mendelsohn-column.png?w=680" alt="Chart of Facebook R&amp;D spending vs. DARPA annual budget" width="680" height="420" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Josh-Mendelsohn-column.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Josh-Mendelsohn-column.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Josh-Mendelsohn-column.png?resize=300,186 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Josh-Mendelsohn-column.png?resize=768,475 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Josh-Mendelsohn-column.png?resize=680,420 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Josh-Mendelsohn-column.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2133385" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Josh Mendelsohn/Hangar</p></div></p>
<p>Look no further than the U.S. government’s own (now defunct) Office of Technology Assessment. The agency aimed to provide a thorough analysis of burgeoning issues in science and technology, exposing many public services to a new age of innovation and implementation. Amid a period of downsizing by a newly Republican-led Congress, the OTA was defunded in 1995 with a peak annual budget of just $35.1 million (adjusted for 2019 dollars). The authoritative body on the importance of technology to the government was deemed duplicative and unnecessary. Despite<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2019/12/18/congress-should-revive-the-office-of-technology-assessment-heres-how-to-do-it/"> numerous calls for its reinstatement</a>, it has since remained shuttered.</p>
<p>Despite dwindling public sector investment and lackluster political action, the problems that technology is poised to help solve haven’t gone away or even eased up.</p>
<p>From the COVID pandemic to worsening natural disasters and growing societal inequities, public leaders have a responsibility to solve the pressing issues we face today. That responsibility should breed a desire to continuously iterate for the sake of constituents and quality of life, much in the same way private tech caters to the product, user and bottom line.</p>
<p>My own experiences in government have shaped my career and approach to building new technologies more than my time in Silicon Valley. There are plenty of tangible parallels to the private sector that can attract driven and passionate tech workers, but the responsibility of giving government work realistic consideration doesn’t just fall at the feet of talent. The governments that we depend on must invest more capital and pay closer attention to the tech community.</p>
<p>Tech workers want an environment where they can thrive and get to see their work in action, whoever the end user may be. They don’t want to feel hamstrung by the<a href="https://time.com/longform/america-innovation/"> threat of decreased funding</a> or the red tape that comes as a result of government partisanship. Replicating the unimpeded focus of Silicon Valley’s brightest examples is a must if we’re serious about drawing talented individuals into government or public-sector-focused work.</p>
<p>A great example of these ideas in action is one of the most beloved government agencies, NASA. Its continued funding has produced technologies developed for space exploration that are now<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/07/08/space-race-inventions-we-use-every-day-were-created-for-space-exploration/39580591/"> commonplace</a> in our lives, such as scratch-resistant lenses, memory foam and water filters. These use cases came much later on, only after millions of dollars were invested without knowing what would result.</p>
<p>NASA has continued to bolster its ability to stay nimble and evolve at a rapid pace by<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/30/how-nasa-is-evolving-through-partnerships-with-private-space-companies.html"> partnering with private companies</a>. For talent in the tech sphere, the ability to leverage outside resources in this way, without compromising the product or work, is a boon for ideation and iteration.</p>
<p>One can also point to the agency when considering the importance of keeping technology research and innovation as apolitical as possible. It’s one of the few widely known public entities to prosper on the back of<a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2020/12/bipartisan-nasa-authorization-bill-clears-senate"> bipartisan support</a>. Unfortunately, politicians typically do all of us a disservice, particularly tech workers in government, when they too closely connect themselves or their parties to a particular program or platform. It hinders innovation &#8212; and the ensuing mudslinging can detract from talented individuals jumping into government service.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of extremely capable tech workers who want to help solve the biggest issues facing society. Will we give them the legitimate space and opportunity to conquer those problems? There’s been some indication that we can. These ambitious and forward-looking efforts matter today more than ever and show all of us in the tech ecosystem that there’s a place in government for tech talent to grow and flourish.</p>

As well as fiat, several funds invested with Ethereum-based stablecoins, DAI and USDC, as consideration.</p>
<p>Sources told TechCrunch that this is an unpriced round because of the valuation risk, and the funding instrument is “full”, so the round is being closed now.</p>
<p>The fundraise looks like a highly strategic one, based around the idea that traditional institutions will need visibility into the increasingly influential world of ‘decentralized finance’ (DeFi) and the Web3 applications being developed on the Ethereum blockchain.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement on the fundraise, ConsenSys said it has been through a “period of strategic evolution and growth”, but most outside observers would agree that this is that’s something of an understatement.</p>
<p>After a period of quite a lot of ‘creative disruption’ to put it mildly (at one point a couple of years ago, ConsenSys seemed to have everything from a VC fund, to an accelerator, to multiple startups under its wing), the company has restructured to form two main arms: ConsenSys, the core software business; and ConsenSys Mesh, the investment arm, incubator, and portfolio. It also acquired the Quorum product from J.P. Morgan which has given it a deeper bench into the enterprise blockchain ecosystem. This means it now has a very key product suite for the Etherum platform, including products such as Codefi, Diligence, Infura, MetaMask, Truffle, and Quorum.</p>
<p>This suite allows it to serve both public and private permissioned blockchain networks. It can also support Layer 2 Ethereum networks, as well as facilitate access to adjacent protocols like IPFS, Filecoin, and others. ConsenSys is also a major contributor to the Ethereum 2.0 project, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>Commenting on the fundraise, Joseph Lubin, founder of ConsenSys and co-founder, Ethreum said in a statement: “When we set out to raise a round, it was important to us to patiently construct a diverse cap table, consistent with our belief that similar to how the web developed, the whole economy would join the revolutionaries on a next-generation protocol. ConsenSys’ software stack represents access to a new automated objective trust foundation enabled by decentralized protocols like Ethereum. We are proud to partner with preeminent financial firms alongside leading crypto companies to further converge the centralized and decentralized financial domains at this particularly exciting time of growth for ConsenSys and the entire industry.”</p>
<p>With financial institutions able to see, ‘in public’ DeFi happening on Ethereuem, because of the public chain, they can see how much of the financial system is gradually starting to merge with the blockchain world. So it&#8217;s becoming clearer what attracts these major institutions.</p>
<p>Mike Dargan, Head of Group Technology at UBS said: “Our investment in ConsenSys adds proven expertise in distributed ledger technology to our UBS Next portfolio.&#8221;</p>
<p>For MasterCard this appears to be not just a pure investment &#8211; Consensys has been working with it on a private permissioned network.</p>
<p>Raj Dhamodharan, executive vice president of digital asset and blockchain products and partnerships at Mastercard said: “Enterprise Ethereum is a key infrastructure on which we and our partners are building payment and non-payment applications to power the future of commerce… Our investment and partnership with ConsenSys helps us bring secure and performant Enterprise Ethereum capabilities to our customers.”</p>
<p>Colleen Sullivan, Co-Founder and CEO of CMT Digital said: “ConsenSys is the pioneer in bridging the gaps across traditional finance, centralized crypto, and DeFi, and more broadly, between Web 2.0 and Web 3.0. We are proud to participate in this funding round as the ConsenSys team continues to pave the way for global users  — retail and institutional — to easily access the crypto ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch understands that the fundraise was started around the time of the Quorum acquisition, last June. The $65 million round is in majority fiat currency as opposed to cryptocurrency and is an adjunct to the round done with JP Morgan last summer.</p>
<p>The presence of significant crypto players such as Maker Protocol Labs shows the significance of the fund-raise, beyond the simple transaction.  The announcement also comes just ahead of the Coinbase IPO, which makes for interesting timing.</p>
<p>ConsenSys’ products have become highly significant in the world where developers, enterprises, and consumers meet blockchain and crypto. In its statement, the company claims MetaMask now has over three million monthly active users across mobile and desktop, a 3x increase in the last five or six months, it says. This is roughly the same amount of monthly active customers as Coinbase.</p>
<p>The ConsenSys announcement comes just ahead of the Coinbase IPO. While Coinbase is acting as an exchange to turn fiat into crypto and vice versa, it has also been getting into DeFi of late. Where there are also resemblances with ConsenSys, is that Coinbase, with 3 million users, is used as a wallet, and MetMask, which also has 3 million users, can also be used as a wallet. The comparison ends there, but it’s certainly interesting, given Coinbase’s $100 billion valuation.</p>
<p>As Jeremy Millar, Chief Development Officer, told me: “Coinbase has pioneered an exchange, in one of the world&#8217;s most regulated financial markets, the US. And it has helped drive significant interest in the space.  We enjoy a very positive relationship with Coinbase, trying to further enable the ecosystem and adoption of the technology.”</p>
<p>The background to this raise is that a lot of early-stage blockchain and crypto companies have been raising a lot of money recently, but much of this has been through crypto investment firms. Only a handful of Silicon Valley VCs are backing blockchain, such as Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<p>What’s interesting about this announcement is that these incumbent financial giants are not only taking an interest, but working alongside ConsenSys to both invest and build products on Ethereum.</p>
<p>It’s ConsenSys’ view that every payment service provider, banks will need this financial infrastructure in the  future, especially for DeFI.</p>
<p>Given there is roughly $43 billion collateralized in DeFi, it&#8217;s increasingly the case that major investors are involved, and there are increasingly higher returns than traditional yield and bond or bond yields.</p>
<p>The moves by Central Banks into digital currencies is also forcing companies and governments to realize digital currency, and the ‘blockchain rails’ on which it runs, is here to stay. This is what is suggested by the Greater Bay Area Homeland Development Fund’s (a Shenzhen / Hong Kong joint partnership) decision to get involved.</p>
<p>Another aspect of this story is that ConsenSys is sitting on some extremely powerful products. Consensys has six products that serve three different types of people.</p>
<p>Service developers who are building on Ethereum are using Truffle to develop smart contracts. Users joining the NFT hype are using MetaMask underneath it all.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="oWAC94df6j"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/consenysys-launches-a-more-energy-efficient-nft-ecosystem-with-a-project-from-artist-damien-hirst-as-its-first-drop/">ConsenSys launches a more energy-efficient NFT ecosystem with a project from artist Damien Hirst as its first drop</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;ConsenSys launches a more energy-efficient NFT ecosystem with a project from artist Damien Hirst as its first drop&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/consenysys-launches-a-more-energy-efficient-nft-ecosystem-with-a-project-from-artist-damien-hirst-as-its-first-drop/embed/#?secret=oWAC94df6j" data-secret="oWAC94df6j" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The MetaMask wallet allows users to swap one token for another. This has proved quite lucrative for ConsenSys, which says it has resulted in  $1.8 billion in volume in decentralized exchange use. ConsenSys takes a 0.875 percent cut on every swap that it serves.</p>
<p>And institutions are using Consensys’ products. The company says more than 150,000 developers use Infura’s APIs, and 4.5 million developers create and deploy smart contracts using Truffle, while its Protocols group — developer of Hyperledger Besu and ConsenSys Quorum — are building Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) for six central banks, says Consensys.</p>
<p>Consensys is also making hay with the NFT boom. Developers are using Consensys products for the nodes and infrastructure on Ethereum which stores the NFT files.</p>
<p>Consensys is also riding two waves. One is the developer eave and the other is the financial system wave.</p>
<p>As a spokesperson said: “Where the interest in money and invention started happening was on public networks like Ethereum. So we really believe that these are converging and they will continue to, and every one of our products offers public main net compatibility because we think this is the future.”</p>
<p>Millar added: “If we want to help the world adopt the technology we need to meet it at its adoption point, which for many large enterprises means inside the firewall first. But similarly, we think, just like the public Internet, the real value &#8211;  the disruptive value &#8211; changes the ability to do this on a broader permissionless basis, especially when you have sufficient privacy and authentication available.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify this morning officially announced the limited U.S. release of its first hardware device, the oddly named <a href="http://carthing.spotify.com/">Car Thing</a>, aimed at Spotify Premium subscribers. The new device &#8212; which Spotify is surprisingly offering for free plus shipping &#8212; has evolved substantially from the version <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/17/spotify-is-test-driving-a-car-hardware-thing-called-car-thing/">that first began testing in 2019</a>. This upgraded model has a touchscreen, a big, grippable knob for navigation, voice control features, and four preset buttons at the top for favorite music, podcasts or playlists, similar to Spotify on mobile devices.</p>
<p>The company explained its interest in Car Thing is about solving a need for customers who want a &#8220;more seamless&#8221; and personalized in-car listening experience. Although many cars today support Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, Spotify points out that the average age of a car in the U.S. is actually 11 years old and the average lifetime of cars is 18 years. That means there are still a large number of cars on the road that don&#8217;t support modern, in-car infotainment systems.</p>
<p>Car Thing is being introduced to serve this market &#8212; and likely, to give Spotify the opportunity to explore future business models where it has a more direct relationship with customers inside the vehicle, though the company isn&#8217;t speaking to its longer-term ambitions at this time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2137349" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137349" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2137349" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-2.png" alt="" width="1024" height="480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-2.png 3708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-2.png?resize=150,70 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-2.png?resize=300,141 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-2.png?resize=768,360 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-2.png?resize=680,319 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-2.png?resize=1536,720 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-2.png?resize=2048,959 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Image-2.png?resize=50,23 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137349" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>The new Car Thing itself is a lightweight (3.4 oz.), thin (4.6&#8243; x 2.5&#8243; x 0.7&#8243;) music and podcast player that offers a combination of voice control, knobs, buttons, and a touchscreen display for navigating its menus and selecting the media you want to hear. You can choose to use set up the device to work via Bluetooth or an AUX or USB cable, depending on how you usually connect your phone to your car stereo to play music.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re also able to mount Car Thing to your dash in a variety of ways as the device ships with three different types of dash and vent mounts to choose from, along with a car charger and USB-C cable.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137352" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137352" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2137352" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Angle-Image.png" alt="" width="1024" height="722" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Angle-Image.png 3708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Angle-Image.png?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Angle-Image.png?resize=300,212 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Angle-Image.png?resize=768,542 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Angle-Image.png?resize=680,480 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Angle-Image.png?resize=1536,1084 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Angle-Image.png?resize=2048,1445 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Angle-Image.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137352" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>At launch, Car Thing will walk you through a quick tour where it explains how to get started. The user interface recalls the Spotify mobile app, so it isn&#8217;t difficult to get used to for first-time users. Here, you can tap, swipe and use your voice to interact with the screen. The knob lets you quickly move through your choices &#8212; an experience that may be more comfortable to those used to interacting with knobs on their car&#8217;s built-in stereo.</p>
<p>Across the top of the device are four preset buttons that let you save your favorite content for easy access. By default, these are configured with your Liked Songs and Spotify&#8217;s Daily Drive and Morning Commute playlists, with the last preset empty. Many users may just keep these selections, but you can change them at any time, Spotify says.</p>

<p>Ahead of the device&#8217;s launch, Spotify quietly began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/spotify-stays-quiet-about-launch-of-its-voice-command-hey-spotify-on-mobile/">rolling out support for its &#8220;Hey Spotify&#8221; voice command</a>, which Car Thing leverages, too. This lets you speak your requests directly to Spotify, by asking for a song, album, artist, playlist, station or podcast, which Car Thing &#8220;hears&#8221; by way of its four microphones at the top. (Four, because Spotify wants Car Thing to respond even if you&#8217;re blasting your music or have the windows down, which creates additional noise.)</p>
<p>On mobile devices, using &#8220;Hey Spotify&#8221; is an opt-in option that you can shut off from the app&#8217;s settings. But Car Thing represents a smarter, not to mention more safety-focused, use case for voice control. Instead of fiddling with the screen or knobs, you can speak your commands &#8212; or allow your kids to shout out their options from the backseat, perhaps.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137357" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137357" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2137357" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/For-the-Record-PR-Header.png" alt="" width="1024" height="391" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/For-the-Record-PR-Header.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/For-the-Record-PR-Header.png?resize=150,57 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/For-the-Record-PR-Header.png?resize=300,115 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/For-the-Record-PR-Header.png?resize=768,293 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/For-the-Record-PR-Header.png?resize=680,260 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/For-the-Record-PR-Header.png?resize=1536,586 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/For-the-Record-PR-Header.png?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137357" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Spotify&#8217;s<a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/legal/voice-controls/plain/"> policy regarding its use of voice data</a> explains the company will collect recordings and transcripts of what you say along with information about the content it returned to you, and may use the data to improve the feature over time. The company told us that beyond the voice data, the device isn&#8217;t collecting any more information that it does already in the mobile app. Still, Car Thing does give Spotify a more direct window into what people listen to during commutes and longer road trips, which could inform its future products, programmed playlists and other features.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a typical year, Americans spend over 70 billion hours in their cars and there are 250 million cars on America&#8217;s roads today,&#8221; noted Spotify&#8217;s Head of Global Culture and Trends, Shanon Cook. &#8220;That&#8217;s a lot of time spent on the road. So what you do and what you listen to, to help you get through those hours in the car really matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Initially, Car Thing is being made available during this limited release period for free, as selected users will just pay the cost of shipping &#8212; a choice Spotify made because Car Thing is still somewhat experimental.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Spotify&#8217;s first hardware, and we obviously want to get things right,&#8221; said Spotify&#8217;s Head of Hardware Products, Andreas Cedborg. &#8220;And we want to learn quite a lot here in the beginning, so it&#8217;s a natural way for us to start,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137506" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137506" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2137506" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="442" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg 11944w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg?resize=300,195 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg?resize=768,499 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg?resize=680,442 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg?resize=1536,998 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg?resize=2048,1331 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Car-Thing-Unboxing-Image.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137506" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Spotify says the current retail price for the device is $80. It doesn&#8217;t know if or when it will begin to retail the device, however. But it can roll out updates to its software so at least the device won&#8217;t be immediately obsolete, if Spotify decides to go in a different direction one day.</p>
<p>Despite Spotify&#8217;s exploration into hardware, the company stressed it doesn&#8217;t aim to be a hardware company. If anything, it&#8217;s seems more likely that Spotify is toying with the idea of becoming the next SiriusXM by way of a specialized in-car experience &#8212; although one that&#8217;s even more of an add-on than SiriusXM is as you physically have to attach the thing &#8212; the Car Thing &#8212; to your dash. Longer-term, it&#8217;s not clear it makes much sense to develop a Car Thing product line as cars get smarter every year and infotainment systems become more standard.</p>
<p>Car Thing will only be offered on an invite-only basis via <a href="http://carthing.spotify.com/">carthing.spotify.com</a> to U.S. Spotify Premium subscribers with a smartphone. The company declined to say how many units would be shipped, so you&#8217;ll probably want to jump on the waitlist sooner rather than later if such a device interests you.</p>

A New York-based startup called <a href="https://www.willo.com">Willo</a> has been working for several years on a device that should transform the tooth-brushing experience for children.</p>
<p>Willo isn’t a new toothbrush — electric or not. It’s an oral care device that doesn’t look like a toothbrush at all. The startup has worked with dental professionals to start from scratch with oral care in mind.</p>
<p>The device can be quite intimidating when you don’t see it in action as it takes quite a bit of shelf space and you don’t know what you’re supposed to do. But when you see it in action, it looks easier than expected. Willo specifically targets children because they tend to struggle to reach every tooth and brush properly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/NQGJAOzQVJo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Kids are supposed to grab the handle and put the mouthpiece in their mouth. They can start brushing by pressing the button and that’s it. They don’t have to do anything else. The silicone-based mouthpiece also features soft bristles. It starts vibrating in your kid’s mouth when they press the button.</p>
<p>The handle is connected to a bigger home station that contains a water tank with a special rinse liquid. Kids don’t have to use toothpaste and don’t have to rinse their mouth. Everything is handled by the device.</p>
<p>Finally, Willo is a connected device, which means that parents can track oral care in a mobile app. You can also set up multiple users — your kids will have to swap the mouthpiece before using the device.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking about buying a device for your children, Willo costs $199. You then have to pay $13 per month to receive rinse pods as well as new mouthpieces that always fit.</p>
<p>While the product is going live today, the startup has already tested it with real families. These children rated the device 4.73/5 and parents gave an NPS of 70+. They’ve all kept using Willo after the testing phase.</p>
<p>Behind this product, there’s a team of 33 people in France and the U.S. They have filed over 50 patents over the past 7 years — 30 of them have been granted so far. The company has raised $17 million in total funding from Kleiner Perkins, Bpifrance and Matt Rogers’ fund Incite.</p>
<p>It’s true that the concept of a toothbrush hasn’t changed at all. Making a device that changes the way you brush your teeth is an ambitious bet. But it’s clear that the startup has made a lot of efforts to tackle this challenge. Now let’s see if they manage to convince parents.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://meroxa.com/">Meroxa</a>, a startup that makes it easier for businesses to build the data pipelines to power both their analytics and operational workflows, today announced that it has raised a $15 million Series A funding round led by Drive Capital. Existing investors Root, Amplify and Hustle Fund also participated in this round, which together with the company&#8217;s previously undisclosed $4.2 million seed round now brings total funding in the company to $19.2 million.</p>
<p>The promise of Meroxa is that can use a single platform for their various data needs and won&#8217;t need a team of experts to build their infrastructure and then manage it. At its core, Meroxa provides a single Software-as-a-Service solution that connects relational databases to data warehouses and then helps businesses operationalize that data.</p>

<p>&#8220;The interesting thing is that we are focusing squarely on relational and NoSQL databases into data warehouse,&#8221; Meroxa co-founder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/devarispbrown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://links91.mixmaxusercontent.com/uZQSMtfp48vTf5ZbA/l/SgV2zDZ5qqX8hm6Wn?messageId%3DR0PKO0lHL11Oy9F7k%26rn%3D%26re%3DgIt92Yug2YuVncjh2YlRHQjlmclRWZyZmI%26sc%3Dfalse&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618356851469000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGuYNMbxt1-Fd_7f_mLmHhLVtHJEA">DeVaris Brown</a> told me. &#8220;Honestly, people come to us as a real-time FiveTran or real-time data warehouse sink. Because, you know, the industry has moved to this [extract, load, transform] format. But the beautiful part about us is, because we do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture">change data capture</a>, we get that granular data as it happens.&#8221; And businesses want this very granular data to be reflected inside of their data warehouses, Brown noted, but he also stressed that Meroxa can expose this stream of data as an API endpoint or point it to a Webhook.</p>
<p>The company is able to do this because its core architecture is somewhat different from other data pipeline and integration services that, at first glance, seem to offer a similar solution. Because of this, users can use the service to connect different tools to their data warehouse but also build real-time tools on top of these data streams.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137472" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meroxa-Dashboard_Pipeline.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137472" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2137472" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meroxa-Dashboard_Pipeline.png" alt="" width="1024" height="718" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meroxa-Dashboard_Pipeline.png 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meroxa-Dashboard_Pipeline.png?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meroxa-Dashboard_Pipeline.png?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meroxa-Dashboard_Pipeline.png?resize=768,538 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meroxa-Dashboard_Pipeline.png?resize=680,476 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meroxa-Dashboard_Pipeline.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2137472" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Meroxa</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We aren&#8217;t a point-to-point solution,&#8221; Meroxa co-founder and CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahamidi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://links95.mixmaxusercontent.com/uZQSMtfp48vTf5ZbA/l/BVqT3wBs8wVQG6E7N?messageId%3DR0PKO0lHL11Oy9F7k%26rn%3D%26re%3DgIt92Yug2YuVncjh2YlRHQjlmclRWZyZmI%26sc%3Dfalse&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618356851469000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGxO0-uAY3XP0yMRk9eoYQiRAN-SA">Ali Hamidi </a>explained. &#8220;When you set up the connection, you aren&#8217;t taking data from Postgres and <em>only</em> putting it into Snowflake. What&#8217;s really happening is that it&#8217;s going into our intermediate stream. Once it&#8217;s in that stream, you can then start hanging off connectors and say, &#8216;Okay, well, I also want to peek into the stream, I want to transfer my data, I want to filter out some things, I want to put it into S3.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because of this, users can use the service to connect different tools to their data warehouse but also build real-time tools to utilize the real-time data stream. With this flexibility, Hamidi noted, a lot of the company&#8217;s customers start with a pretty standard use case and then quickly expand into other areas as well.</p>
<p>Brown and Hamidi met during their time at Heroku, where Brown was a director of product management and Hamidi a lead software engineer. But while Heroku made it very easy for developers to publish their web apps, there wasn&#8217;t anything comparable in the highly fragmented database space. The team acknowledges that there are a lot of tools that aim to solve these data problems, but few of them focus on the user experience.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137512" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meroxa-CLI_from-postgres-to-snowflake.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137512" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2137512" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meroxa-CLI_from-postgres-to-snowflake.png" alt="" width="1024" height="573" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meroxa-CLI_from-postgres-to-snowflake.png 1351w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meroxa-CLI_from-postgres-to-snowflake.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meroxa-CLI_from-postgres-to-snowflake.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meroxa-CLI_from-postgres-to-snowflake.png?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meroxa-CLI_from-postgres-to-snowflake.png?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meroxa-CLI_from-postgres-to-snowflake.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2137512" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Meroxa</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;When we talk to customers now, it&#8217;s still very much an unsolved problem,&#8221; Hamidi said. &#8220;It seems kind of insane to me that this is such a common thing and there is no &#8216;oh, of course you use this tool because it addresses all my problems.&#8217; And so the angle that we&#8217;re taking is that we see user experience not as a nice-to-have, it&#8217;s really an enabler, it is something that enables a software engineer or someone who isn&#8217;t a data engineer with 10 years of experience in wrangling Kafka and Postgres and all these things. [&#8230;] That&#8217;s a transformative kind of change.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Meroxa uses a lot of open-source tools but the company has also committed to open-sourcing everything in its data plane as well. &#8220;This has multiple wins for us, but one of the biggest incentives is in terms of the customer, we&#8217;re really committed to having our agenda aligned. Because if we don&#8217;t do well, we don&#8217;t serve the customer. If we do a crappy job, they can just keep all of those components and run it themselves,&#8221; Hamidi explained.</p>
<p>Today, Meroxa, which the team founded in early 2020, has over 24 employees (and is 100% remote). &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">I really think we’re building one of the most talented and most inclusive teams possible,&#8221; Brown told me. &#8220;Inclusion and diversity are very, very high on our radar. Our team is 50% black and brown. Over 40% are women. Our management team is 90% underrepresented. So not only are we building a great product, we&#8217;re building a great company, we&#8217;re building a great business.&#8221;  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft is understandably positioning the latest additions to its Surface line as productivity devices. Laptop sales, in particular, have jumped amid the pandemic, as many have scrambled to shift to a work from home setting. With that in mind, the latest version of the Surface Laptop is far and away the headline item amid a new batch of devices.</p>
<p>The Surface Laptop 4 doesn’t seem to mark a massive upgrade to the line, arriving about a year and half after the previous model. Of course, the product has been one of the better received among the company’s proprietary hardware offerings, swapping the more creator-focused convertible models for a more straightforward approach. Sometimes the classics are classics for a reason.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137443" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137443" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2137443" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Laptop-4-7.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Laptop-4-7.png 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Laptop-4-7.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Laptop-4-7.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Laptop-4-7.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Laptop-4-7.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Laptop-4-7.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Laptop-4-7.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Laptop-4-7.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137443" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Available with either a 13.5- or 15-inch touchscreen, the new Laptop sports either an 11th Gen Intel Core or AMD Ryzen processor. The system’s lowest configuration will run $999, but Microsoft has yet to break down the pricing from there. The company is promising improved performance and increased battery life, over the 11.5 posted hours on the Laptop 3. The below video puts the new time at &#8220;up to 19 hours,&#8221; which big if true &#8212; and nice for when we all start traveling again.</p>

<p>The system builds on its predecessor’s HD webcam with the addition of improved low-light capabilities. That’s paired with a studio mic array. Again, nothing groundbreaking, but it’s nice to see companies paying attention to this stuff in the age of COVID-19, when a concerning percentage of our interpersonal communication occurs via webcam.</p>

<p>The design language is similar to earlier versions, though the company has swapped in a new Ice Blue color option. Microsoft is keeping that proprietary charging port around (fast charging will get you up to 80% in an hour). That&#8217;s coupled with USB A and C. There are a pair of Dolby Atmos speakers on board and the touchscreen works with the Surface Pen.</p>
<p>The Laptop is available for preorder today in the U.S., Canada and Japan, and starts shipping on April 15. The 13.5-inch AMD Ryzen with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage runs $999. On the high end, the 15-inch Intel Core i7 with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage is $2,399 (plus another $100 if you want to upgrade Windows 10 Home to Pro). The company is tossing in Surface Earbuds for early preorders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The new Surface Laptop was the marquee arrival in today’s Microsoft announcement, but boy howdy, the company also dropped a whole bunch of new accessories. It’s a pretty broad range of new devices, including some small updates to existing products and entirely new entries. But there’s one clear through line across them all: Teams.</p>
<p>Microsoft is, after all, a software company at heart. That’s always fueled the company’s hardware products. So it’s really not a major surprise that its productivity software is the driving force here. After all, this is the company that was pushing Office integration on its earbuds.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137432" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137432" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2137432" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Headphones-2-6.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Headphones-2-6.png 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Headphones-2-6.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Headphones-2-6.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Headphones-2-6.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Headphones-2-6.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Headphones-2-6.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Headphones-2-6.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Surface-Headphones-2-6.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137432" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Matter of fact, the company’s actually debuting a slight upgrade to its Surface Headphone line. The Headphones 2+ for Business. The big distinction here is the addition on-ear Teams control. The other additions to the well-received over-ear headphones are fairly minor (hence the telling “2+” name), including improved remote calling. They also run a bit of a premium at $299 to the Headphone 2’s $250. They’re shipping later this month.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137437" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137437" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2137437" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Microsoft-Modern-Webcam-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1122" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Microsoft-Modern-Webcam-1.jpg 8000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Microsoft-Modern-Webcam-1.jpg?resize=137,150 137w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Microsoft-Modern-Webcam-1.jpg?resize=274,300 274w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Microsoft-Modern-Webcam-1.jpg?resize=768,842 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Microsoft-Modern-Webcam-1.jpg?resize=620,680 620w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Microsoft-Modern-Webcam-1.jpg?resize=1401,1536 1401w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Microsoft-Modern-Webcam-1.jpg?resize=1869,2048 1869w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Microsoft-Modern-Webcam-1.jpg?resize=46,50 46w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137437" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>The remainder of the new products fall under the “Modern” line, which currently also includes the Modern Mouse. Joining the Headphones are the Microsoft Modern USB and Wireless Headsets. Here the products get a dedicated Teams button for joining calls on MS’ platform. They’ll ship in June for $50 and $100, respectively.</p>

<p>Microsoft is also adding a 1080p webcam to the mix. The Modern Webcam has a 78-degree field of view and can shoot in HDR. There’s a privacy shutter on board, as well as software settings for things like auto white balance and facial retouching, if you’re so inclined. And yes, Teams certification. Can’t help but think this would have been a big hit this time last year, but for many working from home will be the new normal, going forward. That will ship in June for a reasonable $70.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137436" style="width: 705px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137436" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2137436" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Microsoft-Modern-USB-C-Speaker-2.jpg" alt="" width="695" height="391" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Microsoft-Modern-USB-C-Speaker-2.jpg 695w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Microsoft-Modern-USB-C-Speaker-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Microsoft-Modern-USB-C-Speaker-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Microsoft-Modern-USB-C-Speaker-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Microsoft-Modern-USB-C-Speaker-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 695px) 100vw, 695px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137436" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Microsoft</p></div></p>
<p>The oddest addition is probably the Microsoft Modern USB-C Speaker. With Cortana seemingly dead in the water, Teams is once again the driving force here. It’s a desktop speaker with dual microphones designed for Teams calls and some light music listening. That one is also arriving in June, priced at $100.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roku today is unveiling new hardware and software, including the latest version of its Roku OS media software, Roku OS 10, which expands support for AirPlay 2 and Apple&#8217;s HomeKit, and adds a variety of new features and optimizations focused on helping users get to content and stream faster. It&#8217;s also introducing its latest 4K player, the Roku Express 4K+; an updated version of its combo media player and soundbar; and an upgraded voice remote with a rechargeable battery and hands-free voice support via the &#8220;Hey Roku&#8221; command.</p>
<p>Of the three new devices, the Roku Voice Remote Pro ($29.99) may actually be the more interesting addition as it pushes Roku further into the &#8220;smart speaker&#8221; space, so to speak &#8212; except in this case, the &#8220;speaker&#8221; is a TV remote equipped with a mid-field microphone that&#8217;s always listening for the &#8220;Hey Roku&#8221; command. From a practical standpoint, that means you can leave the remote laying on your coffee table and instead speak <a href="https://support.roku.com/article/360009552694">commands</a> like &#8220;Hey Roku, launch Netflix&#8221; or &#8220;search for free movies,&#8221; or &#8220;show me comedies,&#8221; or whatever else it is you want to watch &#8212; without having to first pick up the device and press the push-to-talk voice search button.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137114" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137114" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2137114" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro.png 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137114" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roku</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This feature, of course, also comes with concerns. Consumers may be wary of bringing more voice assistants into their home, after it was discovered that tech giants <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/google-ordered-to-halt-human-review-of-voice-ai-recordings-over-privacy-risks/">Google</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/amazon-adds-alexa-delete-what-i-said-today-command/">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/26/siri-recordings-regularly-sent-to-apple-contractors-for-analysis-claims-whistleblower/">Apple</a> had initially dropped the ball on respecting consumer privacy when it came to how users&#8217; voice data was being stored and utilized. Though they&#8217;ve all made changes since, the experience may have left its mark on consumers&#8217; minds.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, Roku says it will retain some of the audio recordings it receives for technical support and to improve the quality of its service, much like the others in the market. And users can opt out of that data collection (via Roku.com/account/voice). The company notes that voice recordings are disassociated from the consumer&#8217;s account within 30 days, and it only allows access to Roku employees, not contractor workforces.</p>
<p>If this doesn&#8217;t appeal to you, the remote offers a mute button for the microphone if you want to upgrade for its other features, and not use the hands-free listening.</p>
<p>The other features still make for a worthwhile upgrade, however, as this is Roku&#8217;s first remote with a rechargeable battery, for example. The device charges via a micro-USB cable, which is more environmentally friendly. It also offers preset buttons with access to Netflix, Hulu, Disney+ and, for the first time, Apple TV+. And it offers a lost remote finder feature (which works via voice, too); private listening via the built-in headphone jack; a push-to-talk voice button if you don&#8217;t want hands-free; and two personal shortcuts for favorite voice commands.</p>
<p>The voice remote is on sale today via Roku&#8217;s website and will be available in retail stores in May.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137113" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137113" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2137113" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro-with-Packaging.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro-with-Packaging.png 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro-with-Packaging.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro-with-Packaging.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro-with-Packaging.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro-with-Packaging.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro-with-Packaging.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro-with-Packaging.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro-with-Packaging.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro-with-Packaging.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Voice-Remote-Pro-with-Packaging.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137113" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roku</p></div></p>
<p>Another new device announced today is the Roku Express 4K+ ($39.99) which will replace the older Roku Premiere.</p>
<p>This digital media player is targeted towards first-time streamers and secondary TVs &#8212; which are now more often becoming 4K TVs, but where consumers don&#8217;t need the full specs of Roku&#8217;s top-of-the-line players. The Express 4K+ has a faster processor than the Premiere and more storage, as well as support for dual-band Wi-Fi. It works with third-party micro-USB and Ethernet adapters, which is a plus as hardwiring your device was previously a feature only available on the pricier Roku Ultra.</p>
<p>The device also brings HDR 10+ to the Roku platform for the first time, though this support will soon make its way to the Roku Ultra through the upcoming Roku OS 10 software update. It additionally supports HD, 4K, HDR, and HDR 10 and ships with a standard voice remote.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137104" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137104" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2137104" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Express-4K.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="391" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Express-4K.png 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Express-4K.png?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Express-4K.png?resize=300,172 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Express-4K.png?resize=768,441 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Express-4K.png?resize=680,391 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Roku-Express-4K.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137104" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roku</p></div></p>
<p>The device goes on sale in the U.S. in mid-May online and in retail stores. Walmart, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/07/roku-to-launch-low-cost-versions-of-its-soundbar-and-subwoofer-under-walmarts-onn-brand/">a Roku partner</a>, will have an exclusive version of the Roku Express 4K+ called Roku Express 4K ($35) which offers a better value by dropping the voice remote for the basic one.</p>
<p>Along with the launch of the media player and remote, Roku is updating its Roku Smart Soundbar in May. The device is being rebranded to the Roku Streambar Pro ($179.99), and will feature both 4K streaming and cinematic sound, but now ships with the same voice remote that comes with the Ultra, which means it supports private listening on headphones. And it adds support for a new Roku OS 10 feature called Virtual Surround, which aims to simulate a surround sound setup for Roku Smart Soundbar and Roku Streambar Pro owners, who don&#8217;t have another set of speakers to offer true surround sound.</p>

<p>In addition to Virtual Surround and HDR 10+ support, Roku latest OS will roll out Apple AirPlay 2 and HomeKit support to more HD devices, including the Roku Express and some HD Roku TVs.</p>
<p>It will also add a customizable Live TV Channel Guide with favorites; automatic Wi-Fi network detection during setup (and it tells you which of your multiple channels is better to use); and an &#8220;instant resume&#8221; feature which takes you back to where you left off when you relaunch a supported channel.</p>
<p>At launch, there are over 15 channels that support &#8220;instant resume,&#8221; including AT&amp;T TV, FilmRise, FOX Business Network, FOX News Channel, Fubo Sports Network, HappyKids TV, Plex.tv, STARZ, and The Roku Channel.</p>

<p>For gamers, a new automatic game console configuration feature, which automatically configures preferred settings, could be useful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Depending on the capabilities of the console and the TV, it can also mean turning on things like HDR gaming, variable refresh rates, high frame rate gaming like 120Hz, or maybe THX Certified Game Mode. So, without having to go through complex menus, a user just plugs in their console, and we know exactly how to give them the best experience on the game side,&#8221; noted Roku VP of Retail Product Strategy, Mark Ely. The feature works with both Xbox and PlayStation consoles and will also update the input on the Home Screen.</p>

<p>Roku OS 10 is rolling out to select Roku players now and is expected to roll out to all supported streaming players, including the all-new Roku Express 4K+ and Roku Streambar Pro, and all Roku TV models in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>The new devices and software arrive after a year of increased at-home streaming due to the coronavirus pandemic, which forced users indoors and under lockdowns. Roku in Q4 2020 reported 51.2 million active accounts, <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/roku-tops-50-million-active-accounts-2020-1234879467/">up 39% for the year</a>, and 58.7 billion streaming hours, while its free streaming hub, The Roku Channel, saw roughly 200% growth between just June and August 2020 when it added live linear viewing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our business and streaming, in general, continues to grow and accelerate just because there&#8217;s such a shift from people that are getting rid of cable and moving over to streaming. And we saw, of course, with theater shutdowns, more people streaming first-run movies at home,&#8221; Ely noted. &#8220;So, streaming hours increased, and the volume of our products and the popularity of streaming devices increased, as well,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Roku&#8217;s continued momentum, however, cannot rely on pandemic impacts alone. Amazon remains a top competitor, and just rolled out its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-redesigned-fire-tv-interface-rollout-more-devices-110003449.html">updated Fire TV interface months ago</a>. There are also now rumors that Apple is planning an updated player of its own, with <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/12/bloomberg-apple-developing-connected-tv-box-with-integrated-speaker-and-facetime-camera/">an Apple TV-HomePod combo of sorts</a>, similar to the existing Roku Streambar. That will leave Roku with plenty of competition to keep it on its toes for months to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix is giving its Kids’ profiles a revamp, the company announced today. While adults’ profiles are personalized with horizontal rows of recommendations that appear as they scroll down, the Kids profiles’ redesign is more visual in nature. When kids now log in to their account on a TV, they’ll be greeted with their favorite titles and characters right at the top of the screen, Netflix says.</p>
<p>Previously, the layout for the Kids profile was similar to an adult’s, with rows that showed Trending shows and other suggestions from Netflix’s library (See below). Now, the top row will feature the kid’s most-watched content &#8212; and for early readers, the characters will help direct kids to the show they want to watch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137524" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137524" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2137524" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Old-Kids-Homepage-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Old-Kids-Homepage-1.jpg 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Old-Kids-Homepage-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Old-Kids-Homepage-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Old-Kids-Homepage-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Old-Kids-Homepage-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Old-Kids-Homepage-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Old-Kids-Homepage-1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Old-Kids-Homepage-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137524" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Netflix old Kids profile</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2137523" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137523" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2137523" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/New-Kids-Homepage-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/New-Kids-Homepage-1.jpg 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/New-Kids-Homepage-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/New-Kids-Homepage-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/New-Kids-Homepage-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/New-Kids-Homepage-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/New-Kids-Homepage-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/New-Kids-Homepage-1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/New-Kids-Homepage-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137523" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Netflix new Kids profile</p></div></p>
<p>To customize this row for each user, Netflix uses information about what was watched to improve its <a href="http://www.netflix.com/recommendations">recommendations.</a> It notes that the favorite shows featured at the top of the screen will come from the full Netflix catalog, not just its original programming. For the title to appear in their row, a child must watch a show at least once, Netflix says. When selected, the background updates to reflect the chosen show, as well.</p>
<p>Younger kids often navigate Netflix visually. Even toddlers can be found using iPads or TV remotes, moving through Netflix like a pro, at times. And during the COVID era where parents were stuck at home trying to both entertain their little kids while homeschooling older ones and somehow also finding time to work, it makes sense to update one of the most popular “TV babysitter” apps to make it something that younger children could use on their own without parental assistance. The need to serve the overwhelmed parent was part of the thinking behind the upgrade, pitching how the update would give parents who &#8220;need 30 minutes of uninterrupted time to knock out some work&#8221; time to do so. (Uninterrupted time during the pandemic? What&#8217;s that?)</p>
<p>Netflix says the new profiles are rolling out now to TV devices globally, but will be tested on tablets and mobile devices in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Workflow automation has been one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/no-code-workflow-and-rpa-line-up-for-their-automation-moment/">the key trends this year</a> so far, and <a href="http://zoho.com">Zoho</a>, a company known for its suite of affordable business tools has joined the parade with a new low code workflow product called <a href="https://www.qntrl.com/">Qntrl</a> (pronounced control).</p>
<p>Zoho&#8217;s Rodrigo Vaca, who is in charge of Qntrl&#8217;s marketing says that most of the solutions we&#8217;ve been seeing are built for larger enterprise customers. Zoho is aiming for the mid-market with a product that requires less technical expertise than traditional business process management tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;We enable customers to design their workflows visually without the need for any particular kind of prior knowledge of business process management notation or any kind of that esoteric modeling or discipline,&#8221; Vaca told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While Vaca says, Qntrl could require some technical help to connect a workflow to more complex backend systems like CRM or ERP, it allows a less technical end user to drag and drop the components and then get help to finish the rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;We certainly expect that when you need to connect to NetSuite or SAP you&#8217;re going to need a developer. If nothing else, the IT guys are going to ask questions, and they will need to provide access,&#8221; Vaca said.</p>
<p>He believes this product is putting this kind of tooling in reach of companies that may have been left out of workflow automation for the most part, or which have been using spreadsheets or other tools to create crude workflows. With Qntrl, you drag and drop components, and then select each component and configure what happens before, during and after each step.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, Qntrl provides a central place for processing and understanding what&#8217;s happening within each workflow at any given time, and who is responsible for completing it.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen bigger companies like Microsoft, SAP, ServiceNow and others offering this type of functionality over the last year as low code workflow automation has taken center stage in business.</p>

<p>This has become a more pronounced need during the pandemic when so many workers could not be in the office. It made moving work in a more automated workflow more imperative, and we have seen companies moving to add more of this kind of functionality as a result.</p>
<p>Brent Leary, principal analyst at CRM Essentials, says that Zoho is attempting to remove some the complexity from this kind of tool.</p>
<p>&#8220;It handles the security pieces to make sure the right people have access to the data and processes used in the workflows in the background, so regular users can drag and drop to build their flows and processes without having to worry about that stuff,&#8221; Leary told me.</p>
<p>Zoho Qntrl is available starting today starting at just $7 per user month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since ride-hailing companies like Uber and Bolt disrupted the transportation industry, one of the thorns on their sides has been traffic congestion and pollution</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/ride-hailing-climate-risks">has shown</a> that trips from ride-hailing cars have more emissions than those from personal cars</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reduce their carbon footprint and solve the latter problem, both companies have floated the idea of ridesharing and other transportation models, like bike and scooter-sharing services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They also have toyed with integrating public transportation scheduling and providing drivers with incentives to switch to electric cars</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, these models have found little or no success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in 2018, Lyft decided to go a step further by promising to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">attain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> carbon neutrality. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/all-lyft-rides-are-carbon-neutral/558443/">The Atlantic</a>, the company planned to execute this by purchasing carbon credits from</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">3Degrees</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a sustainability company based in San Francisco</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, <a href="https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/a-year-of-carbon-neutral-lyft-rides">Lyft said</a> it had eliminated the amount of carbon that would take 2.4 million acres of trees to remove in a single year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It achieved this by purchasing 2,062,500 metric tons of carbon offsets, but the company reverted to its old ways in 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But while the program made Lyft rides carbon neutral, it was an expensive process. The company claimed that net emissions from its rides would still increase in the long run. So Lyft promised to offer rides only in electric vehicles by 2030. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the same with most car companies worldwide, each promising to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">attain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> carbon neutrality via electric cars in the future</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Planet, a car company based in South Africa wants to achieve carbon neutrality now, not later</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But Planet42 isn&#8217;t a ride-hailing company. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It offers a car subscription product that buys second-hand cars from dealerships and rents to customers via a subscription model</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by Marten Orgna and Eerik Oja, Planet42 targets individuals in emerging markets but has a presence only in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has bought </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 3,000 cars in South Africa and plans to increase this number to 100,000 in the next few years &#8212; and 1 million cars globally by 2025</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So despite not being a ride-hailing company and having a huge positive social impact because it gives cars to people who otherwise would not have them, there is a limited negative environmental impact Planet42 has due to the emissions produced by its cars</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most car companies seem lethargic toward becoming carbon neutral, Planet42, studying how it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">indirectly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contributes to emissions, decided to act last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Few people would argue that becoming carbon neutral is not a worthwhile goal, but it seemed to us that the world is not moving towards carbon neutrality fast enough,&#8221; Oja told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So instead of introducing a vacuous grand plan of becoming carbon neutral by 2040 or something like that, we decided to become carbon neutral now</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because there are hardly any electric vehicles in Africa for mass consumption and planting trees can be costly, how has the company gone about it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before helping Lyft embark on its tree-planting project, 3Degrees engaged in a couple of wind farms and captured greenhouse gases from landfill projects</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Planet42 chose to neutralize its carbon emission through the former; however, it works with local companies in South Africa to reach this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its first project is a wind farm in Northern Cape, South Africa; with the money from carbon offset credits, Planet42 has been able to finance the farm for months</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The power produced from wind turbines offsets other, more harmful energy production methods like burning coal and supporting a low carbon global economy</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are offsetting this negative impact by investing into carbon offset projects in the markets we operate in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To put it another way, the investments we make into carbon neutrality represent a self-imposed tax</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We are leading by example and hope that companies in Africa and beyond will follow us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the company, which has raised $20 million in debt and equity, first launched, attaining carbon neutrality wasn&#8217;t even an afterthought</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But now, not only is it certified as a carbon-neutral company by Natural Capital Partners, its investors feel enthused about the project</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oja says what&#8217;s next for the company will be to achieve carbon neutrality via electric cars ultimately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that might be a reach. The adoption</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of electric vehicles in Africa faces </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> problems different from what the U.S., Europe and even other emerging markets face</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top of mind is the dire power situation where unreliable power supply </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is provided</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at high electricity prices</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then there is a general lack of tax incentives, subsidies and policies, and the sole fact that they are too expensive for the average African car owner</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, there are <a href="https://www.eei.org/resourcesandmedia/newsroom/Pages/Press%20Releases/EEI%20Celebrates%201%20Million%20Electric%20Vehicles%20on%20U-S-%20Roads.aspx">more than a million electric vehicles</a> on U.S. roads and <a href="http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7480/CBP-7480.pdf">over 317,000 on U.K. roads</a>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In South Africa &#8212; Planet42&#8217;s main market and Africa&#8217;s top electric car market, this number <a href="https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2020-11-17-electric-cars-will-take-off-in-sa-when-the-state-incentivises-them-says-report/">is just about 1,000</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, until electric cars become mainstream, wind farms will remain vital to the company&#8217;s carbon-neutral efforts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what we could be doing is for our cars to be electric, and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re planning for the future. When we do that, there wouldn&#8217;t be any need for offsets on a day to day side but we&#8217;re not there right now. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone understands that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ultimately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> electric cars will be ideal; however, that future is not now and we need to act right now,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; the CEO said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re not feeling well and your doctor asks you to get labs drawn, you know that can increase the time between a diagnosis and care. But <a href="https://getlabs.com/">Getlabs</a>, a company that brings the lab to you with its at-home, blood-drawing service, is aiming to eliminate that friction, and today announced </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $3 million seed round led by PivotNorth Capital. The funding will be used to launch in Phoenix, Philadelphia, and Dallas, all of which have been soft launches so far.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Seventy percent of all medical decisions are based on lab results, yet 30% of patients are non-compliant and skip their lab orders,” Getlabs said in a statement. For many, getting their labs drawn is just one more tedious step in getting the care they need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Getlabs, once a phlebotomist draws your blood, it can get processed in any lab of your choice, though the company has partnerships with Labcorp and Quest Diagnostics.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company charges for drawing the labs, but insurance pays for the blood work to be processed, as it normally would. To get your blood drawn at home, Getlabs charges the patient between </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$29-$49, and it’s based on when you want them to come to you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[Brick and mortar] labs usually charge a $25 blood drawing fee, which isn’t covered by insurance, so the $29 fee charged by Getlabs is only a couple more dollars,” Kyle Michelson, Getlabs founder and CEO, told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2137491" style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2137491" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-medium wp-image-2137491" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3.jpg?w=200" alt="" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3.jpg 5080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3.jpg?resize=454,680 454w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3.jpg?resize=1024,1536 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3.jpg?resize=1366,2048 1366w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-3.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2137491" class="wp-caption-text">Kyle Michelson, founder and CEO, Getlabs. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Getlabs</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getlabs is the result of a challenge Michelson himself faced. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I needed my labs done all the time while I was in Y Combinator [for another idea],&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was there for three months, and you’re scrambling to build a business, and I had no time, and the little time I had I spent driving to the lab and waiting for an hour. So it was just a miserable experience,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I started looking into why people didn’t get their labs done, and the top reason was inconvenience,” he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting healthcare today often includes four trips: going to the doctor, the lab, back to the doctor and then the pharmacy. But with the massive growth of virtual care and with companies like Capsule, Amazon Pharmacy and PillPack (owned by Amazon) offering prescription delivery to your door, Michelson saw a gap in the market for a more convenient lab service, too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getlabs, which is fully remote and has 37 employees, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">plans to use the funding to expand to Phoenix, Philadelphia and Dallas and also to expand to other verticals of home health. Other investors in the round include Tusk Venture Partners, Rosecliff Ventures, Liquid 2 Ventures, CityLight Capital, Karlin Asset Management and angel investor Matthew Dellavedova.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I believe Getlabs is the final step in delivering at-home healthcare that will be so crucial as more organizations and individuals see the benefits of telemedicine,&#8221; said Tim Connors, founder and managing partner at PivotNorth Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While not all ailments can be treated virtually, when possible, “The end goal for Getlabs is to fully partner with telemedicine services so patients never have to leave the home,” the company said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Edvard Engesaeth, co-founder of Nurx, “Getlabs could play an important part for healthcare companies like Nurx to treat more complex conditions where in-person blood draws are required by providing remote care in the home.&#8221;</span></p>
