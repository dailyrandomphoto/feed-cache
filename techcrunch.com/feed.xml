										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Podcasts are all the rage, but podcast discovery is a challenge. Today, Spotify announced its acquisition of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/podz-launch/">Podz</a>, a startup that&#8217;s trying to solve the problem of podcast discovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Spotify, we are investing to build and scale the world’s best (and most personalized) podcast discovery experience,&#8221; the <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-06-17/spotify-accelerates-podcast-discovery-with-acquisition-of-podz/">company said</a>. &#8220;We believe that Podz’ technology will complement and accelerate Spotify’s focused efforts to drive discovery, deliver listeners the right content at the right time, and accelerate growth of the category worldwide.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since podcasts are usually upwards of 30 minutes long, it&#8217;s hard for listeners to browse new shows – listening to an episode of a podcast isn&#8217;t as easy as trying out a song by a new artist. So, Podz developed what it called &#8220;the first audio newsfeed,&#8221; presenting users with 60-second clips from various shows. Podcasters often use apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/13/sparemin-headliner/">Headliner</a> to create clips to promote on their social media accounts, and Podz follows the same idea. But instead of podcasters manually choosing how to promote their show, Podz chooses a clip using its machine learning model, which was trained on more than 100,000 hours of audio in consultation with journalists and audio editors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2111232" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2111232" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2111232" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Podz_Gif.gif?w=680" alt="Podz demo" width="680" height="453" /><p id="caption-attachment-2111232" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Podz</p></div></p>
<p>Before its acquisition by Spotify, Podz raised $2.5 million in pre-seed funding from M13, Canaan Partners, Charge Ventures, and Humbition. Celebrities like Katie Couric and Paris Hilton also invested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Already, the average podcast listener subscribes to seven podcasts but follows almost 30 on Podz,&#8221; M13 General Partner Latif Peracha <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/podz-launch/">told TechCrunch</a> via email in February. &#8220;Early signals make us optimistic the team can build a transformative product in the category.”</p>
<p>This acquisition marks yet another sign of Spotify&#8217;s ambition to corner the podcasting market, and audio entertainment in general – just yesterday, Spotify debuted <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/16/spotify-launches-its-live-audio-app-and-clubhouse-rival-spotify-greenroom/">Greenroom</a>, its live audio Clubhouse rival. And when it comes to driving revenue from podcast subscriptions, Spotify and Apple are neck and neck. In April, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/">Apple announced</a> its expansion into podcast subscriptions, and the following week, Spotify began rolling out its subscription platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-test-paid-podcast-subscriptions-this-spring-via-new-anchor-feature/">after teasing it</a> in February. Apple said it will take 30% of podcast revenue in the first year, which will drop to 15% in the second. On the other hand, Spotify&#8217;s program won&#8217;t take any cut from creators until 2023, when it will take 5%.</p>
<p>Though podcast creators can quickly determine that it might prove more beneficial to surrender 5% of their subscription earnings than 30%, listeners will likely just flock to whatever app provides the best user experience – and if Spotify&#8217;s investment in discovery pays off, it could pose trouble for Apple&#8217;s longstanding dominance in the podcasting medium.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://keeptruckin.com/">KeepTruckin</a>, a hardware and software developer that helps trucking fleets manage vehicle, cargo and driver safety, has just raised $190 million in a Series E funding round, which puts the company&#8217;s valuation at $2 billion, according to CEO Shoaib Makani. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/g2vp-vc-raises-500-million-to-fund-tech-that-make-industries-more-sustainable/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">G2 Venture Partners</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which just raised a $500 million fund to help modernize existing industries, participated in the round, alongside existing backers like Greenoaks Capital, Index Ventures, IVP and Scale Venture Partners, which is managed by BlackRock. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">KeepTruckin intends to invest its new capital back into its AI-powered products like its GPS tracking, ELD compliance and dispatch and workflow, but it’s specifically interested in improving its smart dashcam, which instantly detects unsafe driving behaviors like cell phone distraction and close following and alerts the drivers in real time, according to Makani. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says Usher Transport, one of its clients, says it has seen a 32% annual reduction in accidents after implementing the Smart Dashcam, DRIVE risk score and Safety Hub, products that the company offers to increase safety.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;G2 Venture Partners raises $500 million to fund sustainable tech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/g2vp-vc-raises-500-million-to-fund-tech-that-make-industries-more-sustainable/embed/#?secret=2TSQA2ujCk" data-secret="2TSQA2ujCk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“KeepTruckin’s special sauce is that we can build complex models (that other edge cameras can’t yet run) and make it run on the edge with low-power, low-memory and low-bandwidth constraints,” Makani told TechCrunch. “We have developed in-house IPs to solve this problem at different environmental conditions such as low-light, extreme weather, occluded subject and distortions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This kind of accuracy requires billions of ground truth data points that are trained and tested on KeepTruckin’s in-house machine learning platform, a process that is very resource-intensive. The platform includes smart annotation capabilities to automatically label the different data points so the neural network can play with millions of potential situations, achieving similar performance to the edge device that’s in the field with real-world environmental conditions, according to Makani.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/us-freight-after-covid-19-whats-next"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2020 McKinsey study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> predicted the freight industry is not likely to see the kind of YOY growth it saw last year, which was 30% up from 2019, but noted that some industries would increase at higher rates than others. For example, commodities related to e-commerce and agricultural and food products will be the first to return to growth, whereas electronics and automotive might increase at a slower rate due to declining consumer demand for nonessentials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the pandemic, the company said it experienced 70% annualized growth, in large part due to expansion into new markets like construction, oil and gas, food and beverage, field services, moving and storage and agriculture. KeepTruckin expects this demand to increase and intends to use the fresh funds to scale rapidly and recruit more talent that will help progress its AI systems, doubling</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its R&amp;D team to 700 people globally with a focus on engineering, machine vision, data science and other AI areas, says Makani. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think packaging these products into operator-friendly user interfaces for people who are not deeply technical is critical, so front-end and full-stack engineers with experience building incredibly intuitive mobile and web applications are also high priority,” said Makani.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p>Much of KeepTruckin&#8217;s tech will eventually power autonomous vehicles to make roads safer, says Makani, something that&#8217;s also becoming increasingly relevant as <span style="font-weight: 400;">the </span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/29/economy/truck-driver-shortage-pay-hikes/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demand for trucking continues to outpace supply of drivers.</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Level 4 and eventually level 5 autonomy will come to the trucking industry, but we are still many years away from broad deployment,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our AI-powered dashcam is making drivers safer and helping prevent accidents today. While the promise of autonomy is real, we are working hard to help companies realize the value of this technology now.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric vehicle startup Canoo detailed some of the features that may be on its app on Thursday, foremost of which is a one-stop shop functionality that customers could use for their Canoo vehicles – and all their other cars, as well.</p>
<p>This unusual approach to its branded vehicle app could potentially pay off big-time for Canoo in terms of user data and revenue via sales on services like tire replacements and insurance. If the average Canoo driver owns two other vehicles, that could mean that 50,000 sold Canoos could yield data on up to 150,000 vehicles total, Canoo&#8217;s senior VP of global customer journey and aftersales Christian Treiber said.</p>
<p>“Let&#8217;s think about the opportunity overall,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The Canoo ecosystem, but for the entire customer garage.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For all vehicles – Canoo or not – that are hooked into the app, the driver will be able to see details on range and battery life for their EVs, as well as the odometer, miles per gallon, and total range for their internal combustion engine vehicles. Treiber said this could be accomplished simply using an ODB connector.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know how to translate data in cars, we know how to take that metadata and put in service maintenance, repair and asset information, because that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve done, we&#8217;ve built a multi billion dollar business doing this,&#8221; Canoo CEO Tony Aquila told TechCrunch. &#8220;So we can take that data and do that for you. It&#8217;s nothing for us on our platform. It&#8217;s just an OBD dongle. OEMs spend money on stupid stuff, we&#8217;d rather give you a dongle for your second car. If you want to connect it, you can run it all off the same app.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aquila took the helm at Canoo in April, after co-founders Stefan Krause and Ulrich Kranz departed in June 2020 and April, respectively. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/apple-confirms-hiring-of-ulrich-kranz-former-ceo-of-ev-company-canoo/">Kranz was hired by Apple</a> to help with the development of its first car.) Aquila founded Solera Holdings in 2005, a risk management and asset protection software company.</p>
<p>Canoo’s hoping to use its app to drive revenue in other ways as well. For Canoo cars, drivers can access the Maintenance and Upgrades section to instantly upgrade the horsepower of their vehicle, schedule a service appointment or check for software updates. Up to 94% of the electronic control units will have wireless updating capability. The app will also make predictive wear and tear reminders for when you’ll likely need new tires – and it will push special offers for these services in advance.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167584" style="width: 182px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167584" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2167584 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-17-at-13.28.06.png?w=172" alt="" width="172" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-17-at-13.28.06.png 508w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-17-at-13.28.06.png?resize=86,150 86w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-17-at-13.28.06.png?resize=172,300 172w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-17-at-13.28.06.png?resize=389,680 389w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-17-at-13.28.06.png?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 172px) 100vw, 172px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167584" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://www.canoo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canoo </a><span class="screen-reader-text"><a href="http://www.canoo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(opens in a new window)</a></span></p></div></p>
<p>Drivers will also be able to order other vehicle upgrades for the Canoo, like a roof rack or floor or seat protection.</p>
<p>Much of these features – especially the services for non-Canoo vehicles – will likely come together through partnerships with service providers, insurance companies and vehicle detailers. Trieber hinted at other potential partnerships as well, such as using the Canoo app as a digital wallet to pay for a meal at a restaurant, for example</p>
<p>“The single greatest opportunity for the automotive industry is monetizing data, and we want to be part of it, and we will be part of it,” he said.</p>
<p>The news was announced during the company&#8217;s investor day presentation Thursday, where Aquila also revealed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/17/canoo-to-build-its-first-electric-vehicle-factory-in-oklahoma/">Oklahoma as the site</a> for its first factory. That location is expected to open in 2023. Canoo&#8217;s debut lifestyle vehicle, which is expected to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/canoos-electric-microbus-will-start-under-35000-when-it-comes-to-market-next-year/"> be delivered</a> in the fourth quarter of 2022, will being manufactured by Netherlands-based contract manufacturer VDL Nedcar while the factory is being built.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">This past year, three sheep in Canada</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">have been wearing their kidneys on their sleeves. Or more aptly, in jackets on their fluffy backs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These three sheep are part of an ongoing animal study run by the Buffalo, New York-based startup Qidni Labs, a company pursuing waterless and mobile blood purification systems. Qidni Labs was founded in 2014, has raised $1.5 million and is currently in the due diligence process leading up to another round of funding. Qidni Labs was also an </span><a href="https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/clinical-it/learning-health-systems-research/news/21078579/15-winners-named-in-phase-1-of-kidneyx-redesign-dialysis-competition"><span style="font-weight: 400;">award winner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the 2019 KidneyX Summit for developing an air removal system for a wearable renal therapy device. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The jackets are a prototype of Qidni’s mobile hemodialysis machine called Qidni/D. The idea behind Qidni/D is that it will be significantly smaller than a traditional hemodialysis setup and use fewer fluids, allowing patients to be more mobile. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We see this device, and this technology, to be a bridge to a blood purification technology that allows the patients to be mobile, although we do not anticipate that to be the first product,” says Morteza Ahmadi, the founder and CEO of Qidni Labs. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/kidneydisease/publications-resources/ckd-national-facts.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per the CDC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, about one in seven people in the US have some type of chronic kidney disease. Over time, that could progress kidney failure, at which point it&#8217;s recommended that patients start dialysis or receive a transplant. That threshold is typically</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK492982/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> symptom based</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; people might experience weight loss, shortness of breath or an irregular pulse to name a few symptoms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two major types of dialysis: hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis passes blood through a filter and a liquid called dialysate, whereas peritoneal dialysis inserts fluid into the body, which absorbs toxins, then drains it out. Qidni/D is a hemodialysis machine that can fit into a sheep sized jacket, and uses its own cartridges and gel-based system to cut down on the amount of liquid needed to perform dialysis. (TechCrunch reviewed images of the device). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an early animal trial – the results of which have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal – the device was able to reduce levels of urea in sheep’s blood at the threshold of an </span><a href="https://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/aa136315#:~:text=This%20difference%20is%20called%20the,an%20average%20URR%20of%2065%25."><span style="font-weight: 400;">adequate dose of traditional dialysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. TechCrunch reviewed data from the study over Zoom. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="et0xyFqHjg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/ai-is-ready-to-take-on-a-massive-healthcare-challenge/">AI is ready to take on a massive healthcare challenge</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;AI is ready to take on a massive healthcare challenge&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/ai-is-ready-to-take-on-a-massive-healthcare-challenge/embed/#?secret=et0xyFqHjg" data-secret="et0xyFqHjg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These sheep had no functioning kidneys, and were hooked up to the machine for between four and eight and a half hours. Morteza adds that the data so far suggests that four hours of treatment should be sufficient to cleanse the sheep’s blood. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is just one small animal study, so it’s hard to draw massive conclusions from it. It didn’t include an active control arm, for instance, and instead compared the amount of urea and electrolytes removed from the sheep’s blood to published standards from other studies on dialysis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The study alone is far from enough to suggest that the technology is ready for market, but those within the company are taking it as a good sign that the design of Qidni’s mobile dialysis machine bears further testing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can say that in this study, we could replace daily dialysis based on the data,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team will continue to tweak the technology in more sheep-based studies this year, and is aiming to begin human trials in 2022. The overall goal is to file for FDA approval, provided that clinical studies can demonstrate safety and efficacy, by the second half of 2023. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kidney treatment landscape is dominated by dialysis, which is an onerous treatment – despite the fact that a kidney transplant, in many cases, could relieve that burden.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the moment, far more people with end stage renal disease are on dialysis than receive kidney transplants. </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/kidneydisease/pdf/Chronic-Kidney-Disease-in-the-US-2021-h.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The CDC estimates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that 786,000 people in the US live with end stage renal failure, of which 71 percent are on dialysis and 29 percent have received transplants. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dialysis industry, and in particular Fresenius and DaVita, the two giants that control about </span><a href="https://features.propublica.org/covid-dialysis/for-years-jamarcus-crews-tried-to-get-a-new-kidney-but-corporate-healthcare-stood-in-the-way/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">70 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the industry, also has a </span><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/in-dialysis-life-saving-care-at-great-risk-and-cost"><span style="font-weight: 400;">controversial and complicated history</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of poor performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kidney treatment landscape is also notable because it’s covered by Medicare, however, it remains expensive. Dialysis and transplants make up about </span><a href="https://pharm.ucsf.edu/kidney/need/statistics#:~:text=Hemodialysis%20care%20costs%20the%20Medicare,patient%20care%20is%20%243.4%20billion."><span style="font-weight: 400;">seven percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Medicare’s budget. Because of this complex landscape, startups have been pursuing alternatives like </span><a href="https://pharm.ucsf.edu/kidney"><span style="font-weight: 400;">implantable kidneys</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Qidni’s current product is not an artificial kidney in that it could live forever in the body of a participant and replace a non-functional organ. Rather, it’s a more mobile take on dialysis. Qidni/D, the blood purification device, is the company’s main focus for the time being. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="2HN38NL6N0"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/deep-science-introspective-detail-oriented-and-disaster-chasing-ais/">Deep Science: Introspective, detail-oriented and disaster-chasing AIs</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Deep Science: Introspective, detail-oriented and disaster-chasing AIs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/deep-science-introspective-detail-oriented-and-disaster-chasing-ais/embed/#?secret=2HN38NL6N0" data-secret="2HN38NL6N0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Qidni/D  does have some unique elements that may make it as “disruptive” as Morteza hopes it will be. Namely, its small size, and low water requirements. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During an average week of dialysis treatment, the average person is exposed to about </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dialysis/guidelines/water-use.html#:~:text=During%20an%20average%20week%20of,patient%20exposure%20to%20waterborne%20pathogens."><span style="font-weight: 400;">300 to 600 liters of water</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, per the CDC. Some of that water is used in the dialysate solution that helps to leach toxins out of the blood. Per Morteza, Qidni/D uses just one</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">cup of water per treatment session, most of which is contained with the dialysate solution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In our understanding, this is probably one of the first times in the world that waterless technology is useful for blood purification over a long period of time in a large animal model,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Removing the liquid components of dialysis may streamline an already onerous process. Morteza, for one, hopes that this would make at-home dialysis more attainable (fewer stringent water safety requirements) and limit risks of infection (</span><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/infection-control-and-hospital-epidemiology/article/abs/investigation-of-healthcare-infection-risks-from-waterrelated-organisms-summary-of-cdc-consultations-20142017/0771439B1D60E697C52B37FC24944CC0#fndtn-information"><span style="font-weight: 400;">water-related infections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sometimes occur during dialysis).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also a small step towards creating an implantable kidney, which would, ideally, not require massive amounts of external fluid – though mobile dialysis remains Qidni’s current focus. The company’s upcoming round will be focused on testing their cartridge technology in small human trials. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In this round of funding we would be raising $2.5 million, and that should take us to a point that we can test this technology in a small group of patients, connected to an existing dialysis machine using our own cartridges instead of existing dialysate,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s ultimately a step towards a machine that functions more like the organ it’s supposed to mimic, though the holy grail for patients is a solution that ends the need for dialysis in the first place. </span></p>

<p>Coda is simple in that its focus is on the document, one of the oldest content formats/tools on the internet, and indeed in the history of software. Its ambition lies in the fact that there are massive incumbents in this space, like Google and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO Shishir Mehrotra told TechCrunch that that level of competition wasn&#8217;t a hindrance, mainly because the company was very good at communicating its value and building highly effective flywheels for growth.</p>
<p>Mehrotra was generous enough to let us take a look through his pitch doc (not deck!) on a recent episode of Extra Crunch Live, diving not only into the factors that have made Coda successful, but how he communicated those factors to investors.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167195" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167195" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2167195" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-4.43.21-PM.png" alt="Coda Pitch Doc" width="1024" height="563" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-4.43.21-PM.png 1822w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-4.43.21-PM.png?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-4.43.21-PM.png?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-4.43.21-PM.png?resize=768,422 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-4.43.21-PM.png?resize=680,374 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-4.43.21-PM.png?resize=1536,845 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-16-at-4.43.21-PM.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167195" class="wp-caption-text">A screenshot from Coda&#8217;s pitch doc.</p></div></p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live also features the ECL Pitch-off, where founders in the audience come &#8220;onstage&#8221; to pitch their products to our guests. Mehrotra and his investor, Madrona partner S. Somasegar, gave their live feedback on pitches from the audience, which you can check out in the video (full conversation and pitch-off) below.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Extra Crunch Live takes place every Wednesday at 3 p.m. EDT/noon PDT. Anyone can hang out during the episode (which includes networking with other attendees), but access to past episodes is reserved exclusively for Extra Crunch members. Join <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe">here</a>.</p>
<h2>The soft circle</h2>
<p>Like many investors and founders, Mehrotra and Somasegar met well before Mehrotra was working on his own project. They met when both of them worked at Microsoft and maintained a relationship while Mehrotra was at Google.</p>
<p>In their earliest time together, the conversations centered around advice on the Seattle tech ecosystem or on working with a particular team at Microsoft.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many people will tell you building relationships with investors … you want to do it outside of a fundraise as much as possible,&#8221; said Mehrotra.</p>
<p>Eventually, Mehrotra got to work on Coda and kept in touch with Somasegar. He even pitched him for Series B fundraising &#8212; and ultimately got a no. But the relationship persisted.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">According to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinehaskins1/new-law-restrict-stingray-surveillance-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1"><em>BuzzFeed News</em></a>, Democratic Senator Ron Wyden and Representative Ted Lieu will introduce legislation later today that seeks to restrict police use of international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) catchers. More commonly known as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-12-edmonton-police-stingray.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">Stingrays</a>, police frequently use IMSI catchers and cell-site simulators to collect information on suspects and intercept calls, SMS messages and other forms of communication. Law enforcement agencies in the US currently do not require a warrant to use the technology. The Cell-Site Simulator Act of 2021 seeks to change that.</p>
<p>IMSI catchers mimic cell towers to trick mobile phones into connecting with them. Once connected, they can collect data a device sends out, including its location and subscriber identity key. Cell-site simulators pose a two-fold problem.</p>
<p>The first is that they&#8217;re surveillance blunt instruments. When used in a populated area, IMSI catchers can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-21-court-stingray-without-warrant-violates-fourth-amendment.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">collect data from bystanders</a>. The second is that they can also pose a safety risk to the public. The reason for this is that while IMSI catchers act like a cell tower, they don&#8217;t function as one, and they can&#8217;t transfer calls to a public wireless network. They can therefore prevent a phone from connecting to 9-1-1. Despite the dangers they pose, their use is widespread. In 2018, the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/stingray-tracking-devices-whos-got-them" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">American Civil Liberties Union found</a> at least 75 agencies in 27 states and the District of Columbia owned IMSI catchers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In trying to address those concerns, the proposed legislation would make it so that law enforcement agencies would need to make a case before a judge on why they should be allowed to use the technology. They would also need to explain why other surveillance methods wouldn&#8217;t be as effective. Moreover, it seeks to ensure those agencies delete any data they collect from those not listed on a warrant.</p>
<p>Although the bill reportedly doesn&#8217;t lay out a time limit on IMSI catcher use, it does push agencies to use the devices for the least amount of time possible. It also details exceptions where police could use the technology without a warrant. For instance, it would leave the door open for law enforcement to use the devices in contexts like bomb threats where an IMSI catcher can prevent a remote detonation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our bipartisan bill ends the secrecy and uncertainty around Stingrays and other cell-site simulators and replaces it with clear, transparent rules for when the government can use these invasive surveillance devices,&#8221; Senator Ron Wyden told <em>BuzzFeed News</em>.</p>
<p>The bill has support from some Republicans. Senator Steve Daines of Montana and Representative Tom McClintock of California are co-sponsoring the proposed legislation. Organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Electronic Privacy Information Center have also endorsed the bill.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Lately, Snapchat&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/everyone-you-know-is-a-disney-princess-which-means-ar-is-queen/?tpcc=ECTW2020">3D Cartoon lens</a> has been all the buzz, making all of our friends look like Pixar characters. But since 2013, a staple filter on the ephemeral photo-sharing app has been the speed filter, which shows how fast a phone is moving when it takes a photo or video. Today, Snapchat confirmed that it will pull the filter from the app.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/17/1007385955/snapchat-ends-speed-filter-that-critics-say-encouraged-reckless-driving">NPR first reported this today</a>, calling it a &#8220;dramatic reversal&#8221; of Snap&#8217;s earlier defense of the feature. Over the years, there have been <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/accidents/snapchat-video-appears-to-show-driver-going-115-mph-on-night-of-crash-that/2300400/#">multiple car accidents</a>, <a href="https://abc11.com/action-news-investigation-snapchat-fatal-car-crash-philadelphia/1198049/">injuries</a> and <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article229028219.html">deaths</a> that were related to the use of the filter. In 2016, for instance, an 18-year-old took a Snapchat selfie while driving, then struck another driver&#8217;s car at 107 miles per hour. The other driver, Maynard Wentworth, suffered traumatic brain injuries and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/28/snapchats-speed-filter-cited-in-lawsuit-following-atlanta-highway-crash/">sued Snap</a>. His lawyer said that the 18-year-old &#8220;was just trying to get the car to 100 miles per hour to post it on Snapchat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Snapchat&#8217;s filter-related offenses don&#8217;t begin and end here. Last year on Juneteenth, a day that commemorates the end of slavery, Snapchat released a filter that prompted users to &#8220;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/19/21296713/snapchat-juneteenth-filter-smile-chains-controversial">smile to break the chains</a>.&#8221; On 4/20 in 2016, Snapchat partnered with Bob Marley&#8217;s estate to release a feature that gave users dreadlocks and darker skin, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/20/snapchats-new-bob-marley-filter-prompts-blackface-backlash/">committing blackface</a>. And even after Snapchat&#8217;s speed filter was linked to fatal car accidents, it remained available in the app with a simple &#8220;don&#8217;t snap and drive&#8221; warning.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Today the sticker is barely used by Snapchatters, and in light of that, we are removing it altogether,&#8221; a spokesperson from Snap said, adding that the feature had previously been disabled at driving speeds. The company has begun removing the filter, but it might take several weeks to take full effect.</p>
<p>This new stance from Snap comes after the Ninth Circuit Appeals Court found in May that the company can be sued for its role in a fatal car accident.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Generally, </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/section-230-bills-algorithms-congress-hearing/">Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> protects websites, or &#8220;interactive computer services,&#8221; from lawsuits like this, providing immunity for these platforms from third-party content posted on them. But in 2019, the parents of two children killed in crashes &#8212; Landen Brown and Hunter Morby &#8212; filed another lawsuit. They argued that the app&#8217;s &#8220;negligent design&#8221; (including a speed filter to begin with) contributed to the crash. A California judge dismissed the case, citing Section 230, but in May of this year, three judges on the federal Ninth Circuit Appeals Court ruled that Section 230 actually </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2021/05/04/20-55295.pdf">doesn&#8217;t apply here</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. The conflict isn&#8217;t with Snapchat&#8217;s role as a social media platform, but rather, the app&#8217;s design, which includes a demonstrably dangerous speed filter.</span></p>
<p>So, the sudden removal of the speed filter isn&#8217;t as random as it may seem. Now that their Section 230 defense is no longer, it makes sense that keeping the filter isn&#8217;t worth the legal risk. You&#8217;d think that the filter-related accidents would have been enough for Snapchat to take down the filter years ago, but better late than never.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Early-stage founders, a shipload of opportunity is about to set sail and you don’t want to miss the boat. We have only a few spots left to exhibit in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalley&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=61721marketingpost&amp;display=">Startup Alley</a> at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> (September 21-23). Buy a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalley&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=61721marketingpost&amp;display=TRUE">Startup Alley Pass</a> and take advantage of all the exposure, perks and potential to help your startup cruise to the next level.</p>
<p>Every exhibiting startup gets a virtual booth where you can post a company video and links to your website and social media accounts. But don’t stop there. Hopin, the virtual platform, lets you get creative — and interactive. Schedule and host live-stream product demos, tutorials or Q&amp;A sessions. Or cook up some other amazing way to showcase your expertise.</p>
<p>And every exhibiting startup also gets two minutes to pitch live during a breakout session. Your audience? TechCrunch staff and thousands of Disrupt attendees from across the globe. Exposure, practice and invaluable feedback from the pitch-savvy TC crew — jump on board that opportunity.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Team TechCrunch will choose two exhibiting startups to be a Startup Battlefield Wild Card. Those founders will compete in Startup Battlefield for a chance at $100,000. You can’t beat that kind of global attention.</p>
<p>Exhibit in Startup Alley and you might be selected to join the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/?utm_medium=marketingpost&amp;utm_campaign=disrupt2021&amp;utm_content=startupalley&amp;utm_source=tcwebsite&amp;promo=61721marketingpost&amp;display=">Startup Alley+</a> cohort. TC staff will choose 50 startups to participate in a VIP experience designed to provide more exposure, education and opportunity — long before Disrupt even starts. The Startup Alley+ experience begins July 9 with free attendance to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/">TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing &amp; Fundraising</a>. Read more about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/heres-all-the-biz-dev-support-startup-alley-founders-get-at-tc-disrupt-2021/">the business development support you’ll receive</a> as part of Startup Alley+.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Robotic process automation (RPA) is rapidly moving beyond the early adoption phase across verticals. Automating just basic workflow processes has resulted in such tremendous efficiency improvements and cost savings that businesses are adapting automation at scale and across the enterprise.</p>
<p>While there is a technical component to robotic automation, RPA is not a traditional IT-driven solution. It is, however, still important to align the business and IT processes around RPA. Adapting business automation for the enterprise should be approached as a business solution that happens to require some technical support.</p>
<p>A strong working relationship between the CFO and CIO will go a long way in getting IT behind, and in support of, the initiative rather than in front of it.</p>

			A strong working relationship between the CFO and CIO will go a long way in getting IT behind, and in support of, the initiative rather than in front of it.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>More important to the success of a large-scale RPA initiative is support from senior business executives across all lines of business and at every step of the project, with clear communications and an advocacy plan all the way down to LOB managers and employees.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve seen in real-world examples, successful campaigns for deploying automation at scale require a systematic approach to developing a vision, gathering stakeholder and employee buy-in, identifying use cases, building a center of excellence (CoE) and establishing a governance model.</p>
<h2>Create an overarching vision</h2>
<p>Your strategy should include defining measurable, strategic objectives. Identify strategic areas that benefit most from automation, such as the supply chain, call centers, AP or revenue cycle, and start with obvious areas where business sees delays due to manual workflow processes. Remember, the goal is not to replace employees; you&#8217;re aiming to speed up processes, reduce errors, increase efficiencies and let your employees focus on higher value tasks.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The biggest tech companies have put a lot of time and money into building tools and platforms for their data science teams and those who work with them to glean insights and metrics out of the masses of data that their companies produce: how a company is performing, how a new feature is working, when something is broken, or when something might be selling well (and why) are all things you can figure out if you know how to read the data.</p>
<p>Now, three alums that worked with data in the world of big tech have founded a startup that aims to build a &#8220;metrics store&#8221; so that the rest of the enterprise world &#8212; much of which lacks the resources to build tools like this from scratch &#8212; can easily use metrics to figure things out like this, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://transform.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transform</a>, as the startup is called, is coming out of stealth today, and it&#8217;s doing so with an impressive amount of early backing &#8212; a sign not just of investor confidence in these particular founders, but also the recognition that there is a gap in the market for, as the company describes it, a &#8220;single source of truth for business data&#8221; that could be usefully filled.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is announcing that it has closed, while in stealth, a Series A of $20 million, and an earlier seed round of $4.5 million &#8212; both led by Index Ventures and Redpoint Ventures. The seed, the company said, also had dozens of angel investors, with the list including Elad Gil of Color Genomics, Lenny Rachitsky of Airbnb and Cristina Cordova of Notion.</p>
<p>The big breakthrough that Transform has made is that it&#8217;s built a metrics engine that a company can apply to its structured data &#8212; a tool similar to what big tech companies have built for their own use, but that hasn&#8217;t really been created (at least until now) for others who are not those big tech companies to use, too.</p>
<p>Transform can work with vast troves of data from the warehouse, or data that is being tracked in real time, to generate insights and analytics about different actions around a company&#8217;s products. Transform can be used and queried by non-technical people who still have to deal with data, Handel said.</p>
<p>The impetus for building the product came to Nick Handel, James Mayfield and Paul Yang &#8212; respectively Transform&#8217;s CEO, COO and software engineer &#8212; when they all worked together at Airbnb (previously Mayfield and Yang were also at Facebook together) in a mix of roles that included product management and engineering.</p>
<p>There, they could see first-hand both the promise that data held for helping make decisions around a product, or for measuring how something is used, or to plan future features, but also the demands of harnessing it to work, and getting everyone on the same page to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a growing trend among tech companies to test every single feature, every single iteration of whatever. And so as a part of that, we built this tool [at Airbnb] that basically allowed you to define the various metrics that you wanted to track to understand your experiment,&#8221; Handel recalled in an interview. &#8220;But you also want to understand so many other things like, how many people are searching for listings in certain areas? How many people are instantly booking those listings? Are they contacting customer service, are they having trust and safety issues?&#8221; The tool Airbnb built was <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/how-airbnb-achieved-metric-consistency-at-scale-f23cc53dea70" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minerva</a>, optimised specifically for the kinds of questions Airbnb might typically have for its own data.</p>
<p>&#8220;By locking down all of the definitions for the metrics, you could basically have a data engineering team, a centralized data infrastructure team, do all the calculation for these metrics, and then serve those to the data scientists to then go in and do kind of deeper, more interesting work, because they weren&#8217;t bogged down in calculating those metrics over and over,&#8221; he continued. This platform evolved within Airbnb. &#8220;We were we were really inspired by some of the early work that we saw happen on this tool.&#8221;</p>
<p>The issue is that not every company is built to, well, build tools like these tailored to whatever their own business interests might be.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a handful of companies who do similar things in the metrics space,&#8221; Mayfield said, &#8220;really top flight companies like LinkedIn, Airbnb and Uber. They have really started to invest in metrics. But it&#8217;s only those companies that can devote teams of eight or 10, engineers, designers who can build those things in house. And I think that was probably, you know, a big part of the impetus for wanting to start this company was to say, not every organization is going to be able to devote eight or 10 engineers to building this metrics tool.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the other issue is that metrics have become an increasingly important &#8212; maybe the most important &#8212; lever for decision making in the world of product design and wider business strategy for a tech (and maybe by default, any) company.</p>
<p>We have moved away from &#8220;move fast and break things.&#8221; Instead, we now embrace &#8212; as Mayfield put it &#8212; &#8220;If you can&#8217;t measure it, you can&#8217;t move it.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2167627" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2167627" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2167627" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/introducing-flow.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="212" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/introducing-flow.png 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/introducing-flow.png?resize=150,47 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/introducing-flow.png?resize=300,93 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/introducing-flow.png?resize=768,239 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/introducing-flow.png?resize=680,212 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/introducing-flow.png?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2167627" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://transform.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transform <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Transform is built around three basic priorities, Handel said.</p>
<p>The first of these has to do with collective ownership of metrics: by building a single framework for measuring these and identifying them, their theory is that it&#8217;s easier for a company to all get on the same page with using them. The second of these is to use Transform to simply make the work of the data team more efficient and easier, by turning the most repetitive parts of extracting insights into automated scripts that can be used and reused, giving the data team the ability to spend more time analyzing the data rather than just building datasets. And third of all, to provide customers with APIs that they can use to embed the metric-extracting tools into other applications, whether in business intelligence or elsewhere.</p>
<p>The three products it&#8217;s introducing today, called Metrics Framework, Metrics Catalog and Metrics API follow from these principles.</p>
<p>Transform is only really launching publicly today, but Handel said that it&#8217;s already working with a small handful of customers (unnamed) in a small beta, enough to be confident that what it&#8217;s built works as it was intended. The funding will be used to continue building out the product as well as bring on more talent and hopefully onboard more businesses to using it.</p>
<p>Hopefully might be less a tenuous word than its investors would use, convinced that it&#8217;s filling a strong need in the market.</p>
<p class="p3">“Transform is filling a critical gap within the industry. Just as we invested in Looker early on for its innovative approach to business intelligence, Transform takes it one step further by providing a powerful yet streamlined single source of truth for metrics,” said Tomasz Tunguz, MD, Redpoint Ventures, in a statement.</p>
<p class="p3">“We’ve seen companies across the globe struggle to make sense of endless data sources or turn them into actionable, trusted metrics. We invested in Transform because they’ve developed an elegant solution to this problem that will change how companies think about their data,” added Shardul Shah, a partner at Index Ventures.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The AI-powered defense company founded by tech iconoclast Palmer Luckey has landed a $450 million round of investment that values the startup at $4.6 billion just four years in.</p>
<p>In April, reports suggested that the company was <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/anduril-raising-new-round-that-will-double-valuation-to-over-4-billion">on the hunt for fresh investment</a> and headed for a valuation between four and five billion, up from $1.9 billion in July 2020.</p>
<p>The new Series D round was led by angel investor and serial entrepreneur Elad Gil, a former Twitter VP and Googler with a track record of investments in companies with exponential growth. Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund, 8VC, General Catalyst, Lux Capital, Valor Equity Partners and D1 Capital Partners also participated in the round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Just as old incumbent institutions with little to no organizational renewal impacted our ability to respond to COVID, the defense industry has undergone significant consolidation over the last 30 years,&#8221; Gil wrote in a <a href="http://blog.eladgil.com/2021/06/anduril-defense-tech.html?m=1">blog post on the investment</a>. &#8220;There has not been a new defense technology company of any scale to directly challenge these incumbents in many decades&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Anduril <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/anduril-palmer-luckeys-secretive-defense-company-is-booming-under-trump">launched quietly in 2017 but grew quickly</a>, picking up contracts with Customs and Border Protection and the Marine Corps during the Trump administration. Luckey, the young high-flying founder who sold Oculus to Facebook before being booted from the company, emerged as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/16/palmer-luckey-to-host-trump-fundraiser-in-southern-california.html">one of President Trump&#8217;s most prominent boosters</a> in the generally Trump-averse tech industry.</p>
<p>The company makes defense hardware, including long-flying drones and surveillance towers that connect to a shared software platform it calls Lattice. The technology can be used to secure military bases, monitor borders and even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20898931/anduril-anvil-drone-footage-palmer-luckey-quadcopter">knock enemy drones out of the sky</a>, in the case of Anduril&#8217;s counter-UAS tech known as &#8220;Anvil.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anduril co-founder and CEO Brian Schimpf describes the company&#8217;s mission as one of &#8220;transformation,&#8221; pairing relatively affordable hardware with sensor fusion and machine learning technologies through a contract partner more nimble than established giants in the defense sector.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new round of funding reflects our confidence that the Department of Defense sees the same problems we do, and is serious about deploying emerging technologies at scale across land, sea, air and space domains,&#8221; Schimpf said.</p>

<p>The company set its sights on work with the Department of Defense from its earliest days and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/anduril-air-force-abms-jadc2/">last year was one of 50 vendors tapped by the DoD</a> to test tech for the Air Force&#8217;s own piece of the Joint All-Domain Command &amp; Control (JADC2) project, which seeks to build a smart warfare platform to connect all service members, devices and vehicles that power the U.S. military.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/anduril-palmer-luckeys-defense-company-tests-its-tech-at-the-us-canada-border"> work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection</a> also matured from a pilot into a program of record last year. Anduril supplies the agency with connected surveillance towers capable of autonomously monitoring stretches of the U.S. border.</p>
<p>In April, <a href="https://medium.com/anduril-blog/anduril-industries-acquires-area-i-adds-altius-capabilities-to-hardware-portfolio-36633ebcc73b">Anduril acquired Area-I</a>, a company known for small drones that can be launched from a larger aircraft. Area-I counted the U.S. Army, Air Force, Navy and NASA among its customers, relationships that likely sweetened the deal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Krafton, which filed for an IPO earlier this week, has built a gigantic gaming empire. If the firm is able to raise the target $5 billion from the IPO it will be the largest public offering in its home country, South Korea. The firm has something to celebrate elsewhere in the world, too.</p>
<p>On Thursday, it pulled off another feat that no other firm has been able to achieve: Its sleeper hit title, PUBG Mobile, has made a return to India, which banned the title more than nine months ago.</p>
<p>The world&#8217;s second-largest internet market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/india-bans-pubg-and-over-100-additional-chinese-apps/">banned over 200 apps last year</a> citing national security concerns. All the apps New Delhi blocked in the nation had links to China. The move was seen by many as retaliation as tension between the two nuclear-armed neighboring nations escalated last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Every other app that has been banned by India &#8212; and pulled by Google and Apple from their respective app stores in the country in compliance with local government orders &#8212; remains in that state. ByteDance, whose TikTok app identified India as its largest market, has significantly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/bytedance-to-cut-jobs-in-india-amid-tiktok-ban/">downsized its team in the country</a>. (ByteDance runs several businesses in India and many remain operational. Employees have been instructed to stay off the radar.)</p>
<p>Which is what makes PUBG Mobile’s return to India all the more interesting. The game, which has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/krafton-announces-pubg-mobile-india-return-under-battlegrounds-mobile-title/">rebranded to Battlegrounds Mobile India</a> in the South Asia market, is available to download from the Play Store for any user in the country &#8212; provided they sign up for an early access before the imminent launch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="YuEX3INeFn"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/krafton-announces-pubg-mobile-india-return-under-battlegrounds-mobile-title/">PUBG Mobile to relaunch as Battlegrounds Mobile in India</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;PUBG Mobile to relaunch as Battlegrounds Mobile in India&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/krafton-announces-pubg-mobile-india-return-under-battlegrounds-mobile-title/embed/#?secret=YuEX3INeFn" data-secret="YuEX3INeFn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Even as PUBG Mobile is now using a different moniker, the game follows the same plot, and the identical home screen greets users with the familiar ecstatic background score.</p>
<p>Moreover, users are offered a quick and straightforward option to migrate their PUBG Mobile accounts to the new app.</p>
<p>Rishi Alwani, the quintessential gaming reporter in India who edits <a href="https://in.ign.com">IGN India</a>, told TechCrunch that the new game is “essentially PUBG Mobile with data compliance, green blood, and a constant reminder that you’re in a ‘virtual world’ with such messaging present as you start a game and when you’re in menus.”</p>
<p>The changes are likely Krafton’s attempt to assuage <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/pubg-video-game-arrests-india-ban">previous concerns</a> from the local authorities, some of whom had expressed concerns about the game’s affect on youngsters.</p>

<p>But these on-the-surface changes raise a set of bigger questions that have been a topic of discussion among several startup founders and policy executives in India in recent months:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did the government of India approve the new game?</li>
<li>If not, why has Google permitted the app on the Play Store?</li>
<li>Assuming the Indian government has approved the new game, what steps did Krafton take that adequately addressed the Indian government’s concerns?</li>
<li>Why has no other app been able to make a return to India so far?</li>
</ul>
<p>Neither the Indian government nor Krafton have publicly said anything on this subject. Krafton, on its part, has taken steps to assuage India’s concerns. For instance, last year the South Korean firm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/pubg-cuts-publishing-ties-with-tencent-games-in-india-a-week-after-ban/">cut ties with its publishing partner Tencent</a>, the only visible Chinese affiliation &#8212; if the Indian government was indeed banning just Chinese apps. Krafton also publicly announced that it will be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/pubg-mobile-announces-return-to-india-new-game-100-million-investment/">investing $100 million in India’s gaming ecosystem</a>.</p>
<p>The Indian government’s order and the communication and compliance mechanism for concerned entities have been so opaque on this subject that it is unclear on what grounds Krafton has been able to bring the game back.</p>
<p>One explanation &#8212; albeit admittedly full of speculation &#8212; is that it’s a new app in the sense that it has a new app ID. In this instance, it happens to have a new developer account, too. Remember, India banned apps, and not the firms themselves. Several Tencent and Alibaba apps, for instance, remain available in India.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;6 investors on 2021&#8217;s mobile gaming trends and opportunities&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/6-investors-on-2021s-mobile-gaming-trends-and-opportunities/embed/#?secret=9PF1jBTCPq" data-secret="9PF1jBTCPq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>This would also explain how BIGO has been able to launch a new app &#8212; Tiki Video &#8212; under a new developer account and plenty of effort to conceal its connection. That app, which was launched in late February, has amassed over 16 million monthly active users, according to mobile insight firm App Annie. The app’s existence and affiliation with BIGO have not been previously reported.</p>
<p>But the question remains, are these simple workarounds enough to escape the ban? To be sure, some apps, including Battlegrounds Mobile India, are also hosting their data in the country now, and have agreed for periodic audits. So is that enough? And if it is, why aren&#8217;t most &#8212; if not all &#8212; apps making a return to India?</p>
<p>Regardless, the return of PUBG Mobile India is a welcome move for tens of millions of users in the country, many of whom &#8212; about 38 million last month, according to App Annie &#8212; were using workarounds themselves to continue to play the game.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[At TC Sessions: Mobility 2021, Revel CEO and co-founder Frank Reig, Remix CEO and co-founder Tiffany Chu, and lawyer Tamika L. Butler discussed how mobility companies should think about equity.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mobility should be a right, but too often it&#8217;s a privilege. Can startups provide the technology and the systems necessary to help correct this injustice? Shared micromobility, in particular, offers an opportunity for more equitable and accessible mobility within cities, but only if done intentionally. Building equity and accessibility into the business model is not always top of mind for startups looking to pay back investors and make money, and it&#8217;s a time-consuming task. Is it still possible to achieve those goals while remaining profitable?</p>
<p>At our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-mobility-2021?promo=leftrail&amp;display=true">TC Sessions: Mobility 2021</a> event, I sat down with Revel CEO and co-founder Frank Reig, Remix CEO and co-founder Tiffany Chu, and community organizer, transportation consultant and lawyer Tamika L. Butler to discuss how mobility companies should think about equity, why incorporating it from the get-go will save money in the long run, and how they can partner with cities to expand accessible and sustainable mobility.</p>
<h2>What does equity mean?</h2>
<p>Shared mobility services have often directly appealed to the young, able-bodied and affluent, especially when they first dropped into cities around the world. Older populations and communities of color have been less likely to either have access to or to use shared mobility services, but that&#8217;s beginning to change. As mobility startups consider how to weigh providing equitable service while maintaining a profit, Butler outlined the importance of thinking about those who are most vulnerable.</p>
<blockquote><p>Who isn&#8217;t this helping? And it doesn&#8217;t matter if that&#8217;s a small amount of people, right? So you might say something like, people with disabilities might be proportionally a smaller number of people, Black people might be proportionally a smaller number of people. But if you make things better for folks with a disability, say, by adding curb cuts into sidewalks, that actually makes things better for a ton of people. And so you may be thinking of it … only helping a small group of people. And I think we really have to shift the way we think about equity. It&#8217;s not just numbers, who is this going to help the most, it&#8217;s … who is often intentionally neglected or pushed aside because their numbers aren&#8217;t big enough? <em><strong>(</strong></em><em><strong>Timestamp: 19:10)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<h2>Build equity into the business model from the start</h2>
<p>Many startups are just trying to keep their idea alive and start a business at the beginning. They want to solve an essential problem, like lack of socially distanced mobility options, and prove their unit economics so they don&#8217;t come back to their investors empty handed. Some companies might even be of the mindset that building equity and accessibility into their business model isn&#8217;t their concern. But delivering on those core values will just be the price of doing business in the future, so it certainly should be their concern, Butler said.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think for companies, I would say that people like to say it takes too much time or costs too much money to do things equitably. But whether or not you&#8217;re retrofitting a house or whether or not you&#8217;re retrofitting your company, whenever you retrofit something, it costs more money. And so if you think about equity as something you just build in from the beginning, it will actually save you money and take less time than if you try to do it later because someone tells you to do it or you&#8217;ve had some controversy or you all of a sudden feel bad. <em><strong>(</strong></em><em><strong>Timestamp: 4:50)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<p>Reig chimed in to talk about Revel&#8217;s access program, which gives 50% off to riders who are on any form of public assistance.</p>
<blockquote><p>So the access program, for instance, was something from day one. That wasn&#8217;t something we added in a year or two later after venture funding … that was still when we were bootstraped, you know, a company in North Brooklyn with 70 mopeds. From day one, I&#8217;ve never used the gig economy, customer service agent mechanic battery swapper, from day one, every single person on the team is a regular employee. And I think that&#8217;s just a cultural ethos I&#8217;ve always wanted in the company. <em><strong>(</strong></em><em><strong>Timestamp: 6:04)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://vitosha.vc">Vitosha Venture Partners</a> is a brand new venture fund launching out of Bulgaria, and backed by the Bulgarian government. The €26 million ($30 million) fund aims to invest in approximately 100 companies, starting from low ticket sizes all the way up to a million, in early-stage and growth-stage companies that are based in or related to Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Vitosha will be co-financed by the European Structural and Investment Funds under the Operational Programme for Innovation and Competitiveness 2014-2020, managed by the Fund of Funds in Bulgaria. Beyond standard VC conventions, it will also back companies that matter for the growth, sustainability and development of the local economy in Bulgaria and the Central European region.</p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call, co-founder Max Gurvits said: “Bulgaria and this whole region of Southeastern Europe is a very early ecosystem. The cool thing that&#8217;s happening here and that&#8217;s something we&#8217;re excited about and proud of is that because Bulgaria started a little earlier in tech than the neighboring countries, it&#8217;s still very early, but there are thousands of people now in startups.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He added: &#8220;I do think that in Bulgaria, something like the emergence of a unicorn-like UiPath might happen in the next two or three years. So we&#8217;re slowly but surely catching up.”</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of food tech / agtech here, there there&#8217;s a lot of connected hardware manufacturing like electric bicycles. While those companies might not be groundbreaking or world-changing they are actually quite solid fast-growing businesses that have a pretty high probability of exiting for 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x or more.”</p>
<p>Vitosha will also run an <a href="https://www.vitosha.vc/accelerate">acceleration program</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Canoo, the electric vehicle startup that recently became a publicly traded company through a merger with a SPAC, plans to build a factory in Oklahoma that will employ up to 2,000 workers, newly appointed CEO Tony Aquila said Thursday during the company&#8217;s investor day presentation.</p>
<p>The factory will be located on a 400-acre site in the MidAmerica Industrial Park in Pryor, Oklahoma about 45 minutes from Tulsa. The facility, which the company describes as a &#8220;mega microfactory&#8221; will include a paint, body shop and general assembly plant and is expected to open in 2023. The site is near a number of manufacturing and logistics businesses, Aquila noted.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a hub that we think is going to grow like crazy,&#8221; Aquila said at the event. &#8220;In addition to that, it puts you dead center for logistics and movement across North America, so you can get anywhere, same day and back is pretty important.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Canoo, which has said it will <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/canoos-electric-microbus-will-start-under-35000-when-it-comes-to-market-next-year/">deliver its first EV</a> in the fourth quarter of 2022, also announced it is partnering with Netherlands-based contract manufacturer VDL Nedcar to handle initial production while the factory is being built.</p>
<p>Canoo&#8217;s announcement comes nearly a year after Oklahoma lost its bid to convince Tesla to build its next factory in the state. Tesla ultimately <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/tesla-picks-austin-for-its-next-u-s-factory-to-build-cybertruck-semi-truck-model-y/">picked a site near Austin</a> for the factory, which it has said will produce the Cybertruck, the Tesla Semi and the Model Y and Model 3 for sales to customers on the East Coast.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re super pumped — we think we are the flavor of the month and we are the right place for manufacturing,&#8221; Gov. Kevin Stitt said, noting that the state has the lowest electricity costs in the entire country. Those lower rates have helped attract companies like Google, which operates a data center in Pryor.</p>
<p>Canoo&#8217;s investor day featured a variety of engineers, designers and executives all of whom focused on certain aspects of the company&#8217;s vision. Canoo is focused on products for consumers and commercial customers. All of Canoo&#8217;s EVs will share the same skateboard and use different cabins or &#8220;top hats&#8221; that can be paired to create unique vehicles. The company has unveiled several vehicles, including an electric microbus, a pickup and one designed for business-to-business applications. The company has scaled up its workforce to about 435 people as of the end of the first quarter of 2021 and plans to expand to 690 people by the end of the year, according to CTO Pete Savagian.</p>
<p>It was also the first major public event with Aquila steering the company that has had a bumpy ride in the past year.</p>
<p>Canoo started as Evelozcity in 2017, founded by former Faraday Future executives Stefan Krause and Ulrich Kranz. The company rebranded as Canoo in spring 2019 and debuted its first vehicle several months later. The unique-looking vehicle and Canoo&#8217;s initial plan to offer it only as a subscription helped the company gain the attention of investors and the media. Canoo even landed a <a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2982">partnership with Hyundai</a> to co-develop EVs, but that deal fell apart earlier this year after the company changed its business model and decided to not offer engineering services to other automakers, according to comments made in March by Aquila.</p>
<p>Canoo also lost its cofounders, first Krause, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/10/apple-confirms-hiring-of-ulrich-kranz-former-ceo-of-ev-company-canoo/">more recently Kranz</a>. And in May, the company disclosed that is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The investigation is broad and covers the special purpose acquisition company Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp.&#8217;s initial public offering and merger with Canoo, the company&#8217;s operations, business model, revenues, revenue strategy, customer agreements, earnings and other related topics, along with the recent departures of certain of the company&#8217;s officers, according to a quarterly earnings report posted May 17.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Apple’s location devices — called AirTags — have been out for more than a month now. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/first-findings-with-apples-new-airtag-location-devices/">initial impressions</a> were good, but as we concluded back in April: “It will be interesting to see these play out once AirTags are out getting lost in the wild.”</p>
<p>That’s exactly what our resident UX analyst, <a href="http://builtformars.com">Peter Ramsey</a>, has been doing for the last month — intentionally losing AirTags to test their user experience at the limits.</p>
<p>This Extra Crunch exclusive is a simplified conversation around <a href="https://builtformars.com/case-studies/apple-airtags">this Built for Mars article</a>, which helps bridge the gap between Apple’s mistakes and how you can make meaningful changes to your product’s UX.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			For an industry that’s often soured by privacy concerns, Apple has an unusually strong stance on keeping your data private.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>AirTag not reachable</h2>
<p>There are two primary purposes of an error message:</p>
<ol>
<li>To notify the user what has gone wrong (and how it affects them).</li>
<li>To help the user resolve the issue.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most businesses do a decent job at the first one, but it’s rare that a product will proactively obsess over the second.</p>
<p>Typically, Apple is one of the few examples that <em>do </em>— it’s indisputably one of the leaders in intuitive design. Which is why I was surprised to see Apple’s error message when an AirTag is not reachable:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2166507" style="width: 892px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2166507" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2166507" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AirTag-image-1.jpg" alt="" width="882" height="740" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AirTag-image-1.jpg 882w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AirTag-image-1.jpg?resize=150,126 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AirTag-image-1.jpg?resize=300,252 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AirTag-image-1.jpg?resize=768,644 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AirTag-image-1.jpg?resize=680,571 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/AirTag-image-1.jpg?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 882px) 100vw, 882px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2166507" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Built for Mars screenshot</p></div></p>
<p>There’s a huge amount of ambiguity in the statement “move around to connect,” and it fails to mention that this error <em>could be</em> because the AirTag’s batteries have been removed.</p>
<p>Instead, Apple should make this message clickable, which opens a modal to learn more about this issue.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://wise.com">Wise</a>, the fintech company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/wise/">formerly known</a> as TransferWise, has announced that it wants to become a public company on the London Stock Exchange. Instead of following the traditional IPO route, Wise plans to go public via a direct listing. This is going to be the biggest direct listing on the London Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Wise, the company specializes in cross-border money transfers. If you want to send money to someone living in another country, traditional retail banks charge a lot in foreign exchange fees, foreign transaction fees, etc.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some well-known alternative options, such as Western Union and MoneyGram. While those companies provide some convenient on-ramp and off-ramp methods, they’re still more expensive than Wise.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Wise, users first upload money to their Wise account using a bank transfer or a debit card. They can then send money in another currency to a recipient’s bank account. The company tries to be as transparent and upfront as possible when it comes to fixed and variable fees.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="dOSwqUCrR9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/wise/">TransferWise rebrands as Wise ahead of an expected IPO</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TransferWise rebrands as Wise ahead of an expected IPO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/wise/embed/#?secret=dOSwqUCrR9" data-secret="dOSwqUCrR9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Originally founded in 2011, Wise has grown quite a lot as its revenue grew from $422 million to $586 million in its most recent financial year (from £303 million to £421 million, respectively). It represents $57 million (£41 million) in profit before tax — the company says it has been profitable since 2017.</p>
<p>Overall, Wise has 10 million customers who process around $7 billion (£5 billion) in cross-border transactions every month. More recently, the company diversified its revenue by adding new products.</p>
<p>For instance, customers can hold money in 56 currencies in their Wise accounts. They get account numbers in 10 different currencies as well as a debit card. This feature is particularly useful for freelancers who want to accept payments in another country or people moving abroad for a year or two.</p>
<p>The company has also expanded beyond B2C with Wise Business. Those accounts work a bit like regular Wise accounts, but with multiple users and additional features. Wise also powers cross-border transactions in third-party services, such as Monzo and N26.</p>
<p>Opting for a direct listing is an interesting move. A few companies have chosen direct listings in the U.S., such as Spotify, Coinbase and Slack. It means that you’re confident there’ll be enough interest from investors, as banks aren’t helping you with your introduction.</p>
<p>It also means that Wise doesn’t need more money, as a direct listing doesn’t let you raise additional capital.</p>
<p>Like many tech companies, Wise plans to introduce a dual-class share structure, which means that all of Wise’s existing shareholders will get more votes per share for a while. This is going to be an important listing for the European fintech scene and also for the British tech ecosystem. Now, let’s see how investors feel about Wise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Free money from the government sounds like winning the lottery, but the reality is that most tech startups and even local retail businesses and restaurants can potentially qualify for tax credits related to research and development in the United States. Those credits, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/04/amazon-had-to-pay-federal-income-taxes-for-the-first-time-since-2016.html">which is what helps tech giants keep their tax rates to near zero</a>, are hard for smaller companies to receive because of extensive documentation requirements and potential audit costs.</p>
<p>So a number of startups have been launched to solve that gap, and now, larger companies are entering the fray as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://gusto.com">Gusto</a>, which started off with payroll for SMBs and has since expanded into employee on-boarding, insurance, benefits and other HR offerings, today announced that it is acquiring <a href="https://ardius.com">Ardius</a>, a startup designed to automate tax compliance particularly around R&amp;D tax credits.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Los Angeles-based company was founded by Joshua Lee <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ardius">in 2018</a>, who previously had worked for more than a decade at accounting firm EY. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, and Ardius will run as an independent business with the entire team transitioning to Gusto.</p>
<p>The strategy here is simple: Most R&amp;D credits require payroll documentation, data that is already stored in Gusto’s system of record. Ardius in its current incarnation was designed to tap into a number of payroll data providers and extract that data and turn it into verifiable tax documents. With this tie-up, the companies can simply do that automatically for Gusto’s extensive number of customers.</p>
<p>Joshua Reeves, co-founder and CEO of Gusto, said that the acquisition falls in line with the company’s long-term focus on customers and simplicity. “We want to bring together technology, great service, [and] make government simpler,” he said. “In some ways, a lot of stuff we&#8217;re doing — make payroll simpler, make healthcare simpler, make PPP [loans] and tax credits simpler — just make these things work the way they&#8217;re intended to work.” The company presumably could have built out such functionality, but he noted that “time to market” was a crucial point in making Ardius the company’s first acquisition.</p>
<p>Tomer London, co-founder and chief product officer, said that “we&#8217;ve been looking at this space for a long time because it kind of connects to one of our original product principles of building a product that is opinionated,” he said. In a space as complicated as HR, “we want to be out there and be an advisor, not just a tool. And this is just such a great example of where you can take the payroll data that we already have and in just a few clicks and in a matter of a few days, get access to really important cash flow for a business.” He noted that tax credits is “something that&#8217;s been on our roadmap for a long time.”</p>
<p>Gusto works with more than 100 third-party services that integrate on top of its platform. Reeves emphasized that while Ardius is part of Gusto, all companies — even those that might compete directly with the product — will continue to have equal access to the platform’s data. In its release, the company pointed out that Boast.ai, Clarus, Neo.Tax and TaxTaker are just some of the other tax products that integrate with Gusto today.</p>
<p>Of course, Ardius is just one of a number of competitors that have popped up in the R&amp;D and economic development tax credit space. MainStreet, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/free-money-for-startups-its-possible-with-mainstreets-platform-for-economic-development-incentives/">which I last profiled in 2020 for its seed round</a>, just raised $60 million in funding in March led by SignalFire. Meanwhile, Neo.tax, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/rd-tax-credits-are-due-july-15th-neo-tax-wants-to-help-startups-apply-and-raised-3m-to-do-it/">which I also profiled last year</a>, has raised a total of $5.5 million.</p>

<p>Reeves was sanguine about the attention the space is garnering and the potential competition for Ardius. When it comes to R&amp;D tax credits, “whatever creates more accessibility, we’re a fan of,” he said. “It&#8217;s great that there&#8217;s more awareness because it&#8217;s still under-utilized frankly.” He emphasized that Gusto would be able to offer a more vertically-integrated solution given its data and software than other competitors in the space.</p>
<p>While the pandemic particularly hit SMBs, who often lacked the financial wherewithal of larger companies to survive the crisis, Gusto actually expanded its business as new companies sprouted up. Reeves said the company grew its customer base 50% in its last fiscal year, which ended in April. It “turns out in a health pandemic and in an economic crisis, things like payroll and accessing health care are quite important,” he said. Gusto <a href="https://gusto.com/covid-19/paycheck-protection-program">launched a program to help SMBs collect the government’s stimulus PPP loans</a>.</p>
<p>The company’s main bases of operation are in San Francisco, Denver and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/24/smb-payroll-startup-gusto-raises-200m-series-d-plans-rd-expansion-to-nyc/">New York City</a>, and the company has a growing contingent of remote workers, including the Ardius crew, who will remain based in LA. While Reeves demurred on future acquisitions, Gusto’s focus on expanding to a comprehensive financial wellness platform for both employees and businesses would likely suggest that additional acquisitions may well be in the offing in the future.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">If I told you a decade ago that a spin bike would be a social community, you’d have had a good laugh. But that’s precisely what Peloton is: A spin bike with a social community where the instructors are the influencers.</p>
<p>Peloton is just one example of how social is being integrated into every aspect of the customer experience in an increasingly digital world. Whether it’s considering a new restaurant to check out, a movie to see or a product to buy, most people look at reviews before making a final decision. They want social proof as an indicator of quality and relevance.</p>

<p>Influencers are a natural byproduct of this desire for social validation, and as social permeates the customer journey, creators have become an essential source of validation and trust. Indeed, social validation is what social platforms are built on, so it’s a significant component of how we derive relevance online — and the deeper integration of social is changing the dynamic between brands and digital creators.</p>
<h2>The shifting economy of creator monetization</h2>
<p>Brand sponsorships are the holy grail for creators hoping to monetize their online influence. According to an <a href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/influencer-monetization-2021">eMarketer report</a>, brand partnerships are still the No. 1 source of revenue for most digital creators.</p>
<p>However, digital creators have a lot more monetization options to choose from, thanks to Patreon, affiliate platforms, paid content platforms and platform revenue sharing, making it easier to earn a living without relying so heavily on brand sponsorships.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;">Have you worked with a talented individual or agency who helped you find and keep more users?<br />

<hr />
<p>As a result, creators are diversifying their revenue streams, which, for some creators, allows them to be more selective about the brands they work with. What’s more, creators aren’t reliant on just one channel or one form of revenue.</p>
<p>YouTube creators probably have the most diversified revenue, often combining brand sponsorships, subscription models, affiliate deals, tipping/donations, their line of branded products and revenue share. However, it’s important to note that not all monetization options apply to every creator. But with so many options to choose from, making a living as a digital creator is more accessible than ever.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the ways online creators can monetize their content:</p>
<p><strong>Ad revenue sharing: </strong>Advertising is the most traditional form of revenue for online creators. With this model, ads are injected into and around the creator’s content, and they make a certain percentage of revenue based on impressions. However, the revenue split can vary based on the platform, and some platforms have a specific threshold creators must hit before they can participate in ad revenue sharing.</p>
<p><strong>Affiliate marketing: </strong>Similar to advertising or a brand sponsorship, affiliate marketing is an agreement for a share of revenue based on products sold. This kind of arrangement generally works best when the creator has a blog, website or YouTube account. Affiliate links allow the influencer to proactively choose the products they want to talk about and earn from, rather than having to wait for a brand deal to come their way.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>
