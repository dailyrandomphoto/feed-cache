										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/figma/">Figma</a> spent years in stealth before launching its web-based collaborative design tool. Since coming into the light, the company has been iterating quickly. Today, Figma launches its biggest product update to date.</p>
<p>Meet FigJam, Figma&#8217;s new whiteboarding tool.</p>
<p>The entire concept of Figma stemmed from the fact that designers were taking up much more space at the figurative table and needed a place to collaborate efficiently. That is only more true today, especially during the last year of working from home, which is why Figma is extending itself throughout the workflow of designers with whiteboarding.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Not only does FigJam give designers a place to come up with ideas together, but it also gives nondesigners a place to participate in the brainstorm.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ETCxV3zGIz"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/figma-raises-50-million-series-d-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/">Figma raises $50 million Series D led by Andreessen Horowitz</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Figma raises $50 million Series D led by Andreessen Horowitz&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/30/figma-raises-50-million-series-d-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/embed/#?secret=ETCxV3zGIz" data-secret="ETCxV3zGIz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>FigJam functionality includes sticky notes, emojis and drawing tools, as well as shapes, pre-built lines and connectors, stamps and cursor chats. As expected, FigJam works with Figma so components or other design objects breathed into life on FigJam can easily be moved into Figma.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our point of view here was focusing on how to make FigJam work as the first step in the design process, before you go into actually doing design work,&#8221; said Figma founder and CEO Dylan Field. &#8220;We see people looking for a better, more fluid experience, but we also wanted to make it simple enough to bring other people into the tool.&#8221;</p>
<p>To take that a step further, Figma is also introducing voice chat into all of its products. That means users who are designing alongside one another in Figma or brainstorming in FigJam don&#8217;t need to hop into a separate Zoom call or Google Meet, but can just toggle on chat in Figma to use audio.</p>
<p>Figma didn&#8217;t build its voice chat from scratch, but rather worked with a partner to bring this to market. Figma did not specify which partner/tech it&#8217;s working with on voice chat.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Alongside the release of FigJam and voice chat, Figma is also releasing a more full-featured mobile app, which will be in beta through TestFlight at launch.</p>

<p>One final update that Figma is announcing today is branching and merging in Figma. This allows designers who are updating the design system, for example, to branch out and do their work and then merge that work with the existing design system, rather than updating a shared component or resource and affecting everyone else&#8217;s workflow.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Recent laws allowing healthcare providers to refuse care because of conscientious beliefs and denying care to transgender individuals might not seem like an issue for the tech industry at first blush, but these types of legislation directly contradict the core values of health tech.</p>
<p>Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson last month signed into law <a href="https://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/Bills/Detail?ddBienniumSession=2021%2F2021R&amp;measureno=SB289">S.B. 289</a>, known as the “Medical Ethics and Diversity Act,” which allows anyone who provides healthcare services &#8212; not just doctors &#8212; to refuse to give non-emergency care if they believe the care goes against their conscience.</p>
<p>Arkansas is <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/374077-health-care-conscience-laws-infringe-on-the-rights-of-others">one of several states in the U.S. that have been pushing laws like this </a>over the past several years. These &#8220;conscience laws&#8221; are harmful to all patients &#8212; particularly LGBTQ individuals, women and rural citizens &#8212; especially because over <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/10/25/20929539/catholic-hospitals-religious-refusal-rural-health-care-evan-minton">40% of available hospital beds are controlled by Catholic institutions</a> in some states.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			While disguised as a safeguard that prevents doctors from having to participate in medical services that are at odds with their religious beliefs, these laws go far beyond that and should be repealed.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>While disguised as a safeguard that prevents doctors from having to participate in medical services that are at odds with their religious beliefs, these laws go far beyond that and should be repealed.</p>
<h2>&#8220;Non-emergency&#8221; service is open to interpretation</h2>
<p>The Arkansas legislation is one giant slippery slope. Even beyond the direct effects that the law would have on reproductive rights and the LGBTQ community, it leaves open questions about the many different services that medical professionals could decline simply by saying it goes against their conscience.</p>
<p>Broadly letting healthcare providers decide which services they will perform based on religion, ethics or conscience essentially eliminates protections patients have under federal anti-discrimination regulations.</p>
<p>What constitutes an &#8220;emergency&#8221; to one doctor or EMT may be deemed a &#8220;non-emergency&#8221; by another. By allowing medical professionals to avoid performing some services, the bill can be interpreted as allowing anyone involved in the provision of healthcare services to avoid performing any kind of service, as long as they say they believed it wasn&#8217;t an emergency at the time.</p>
<p>The law also allows individuals to refuse to refer patients to someone who would provide the desired service for them. This places an undue burden on patients with physical or mental health issues and causes delays in treatment as the patient searches for an alternate provider. In cases of health and life-threatening issues, for example, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/catholic-hospitals-refuse-to-treat_n_5b06c82fe4b05f0fc8458db3">women have been refused treatment at Catholic medical institutions and forced to ride to the closest emergency care center</a>.</p>
<h2>The health tech community is working to improve the health of all</h2>
<p>The Arkansas law runs counter to the values of the businesses that are working hard to develop and improve medical technologies. Health tech startups at their core are fighting to provide more and better services to more patients &#8212; whether it’s by building platforms to make healthcare accessible to all, developing specific medical devices to improve the quality of service or researching new treatments and vaccines.</p>
<p>Imagine developing a vaccine for a global pandemic and then allowing doctors the right to refuse to administer it because it’s open to interpretation whether the virus represents an emergency to specific people. Or imagine <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edwi/pr/hospital-pharmacist-plead-guilty-attempting-spoil-hundreds-covid-vaccine-doses">a hospital pharmacist who deliberately tries to spoil hundreds of vaccine doses</a> because of the conspiracy theories he believes. Laws like the one in Arkansas open up the healthcare system to abuse by conspiracy theorists, and it is already the case that many <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/04/wellness-qanon-coronavirus/">wellness providers are basing their advice and services on QAnon falsehoods</a>.</p>
<p>The health tech community is not just developing medications and devices for patients whose beliefs are similar to their own. Equally, medical professionals should not be making it harder for people to get needed medical care based on personal feelings. On the contrary, the ultimate goal of health tech businesses and healthcare providers alike should be a singular focus on improving the quality of care for all.</p>
<h2>&#8220;Medical ethics&#8221; and anti-LGBTQ laws are unethical</h2>
<p>As the health tech community continues to work tirelessly to bring new solutions to the marketplace to improve the health of everyone, it must also stand against laws like this, which threaten to eradicate the important gains that have been made in enhancing the lives and health of patients.</p>
<p>The Arkansas law &#8212; and others like it &#8212; place the burden of finding appropriate care on the patient instead of on the medical community, where it belongs. These laws must be repealed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was “the eighth wonder of the world,” Donald Trump said, driving a golden shovel into the ground. The then-president touted Foxconn’s planned Wisconsin factory as a major win for his economic goals.</p>
<p>A year and a half later, the future of the manufacturing deal is far less certain. Earlier this week, the state announced a dramatic scaling back of a plan it had hoped would return blue-collar jobs back to the hard hit state. The Taiwanese manufacturing giant is scaling back its investment from $10 billion to $672 million.</p>
<p>The new plans also call for a massive cut to potential headcount &#8212; to 1,454, down from 13,000. Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers framed the reduction as a tax-saving deal in <a href="https://wedc.org/blog/gov-evers-announces-renegotiated-foxconn-contract-to-save-taxpayers-2-77-billion/">a press release issued this week</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Foxconn pulls back on its $10 billion factory commitment&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/foxconn-pulls-back-on-its-10-billion-dollar-factory-commitment/embed/#?secret=td47X4tkyG" data-secret="td47X4tkyG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“When I ran to be governor, I made a promise to work with Foxconn to cut a better deal for our state—the last deal didn’t work for Wisconsin, and that doesn’t work for me,” Evers said. “Today I’m delivering on that promise with an agreement that treats Foxconn like any other business and will save taxpayers $2.77 billion, protect the hundreds of millions of dollars in infrastructure investments the state and local communities have already made, and ensure there’s accountability for creating the jobs promised.”</p>
<p>Evers stepped into the role of Governor in 2019, following Scott Walker, who played a key role in negotiating the deal under Trump. The package included in the neighborhood of $4 billion in incentives for Foxconn, a record-breaking deal for the firm.</p>
<p>Plans for the TV factory shifted considerably since it was announced nearly four years ago, and in early 2019, it appeared that Foxconn had abandoned it altogether, before a phone call from Trump apparently put plans back on track.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/foxconn-sharply-scales-back-wisconsin-investment-2021-04-20/">Reuters notes</a>, the state has already spent in excess of $200 million on infrastructure, training and other aspects ahead of the planned factory opening.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re anything like me, you&#8217;re increasingly tired of video meetings (to the point where I often just keep the camera off). But the reality is that this style of meetings will be with us for the foreseeable future, whether we like them or not.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141684" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meet_Low_light_mode_1920x1080_white_BGPiP2_Minimize_Drag.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141684" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2141684 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meet_Low_light_mode_1920x1080_white_BGPiP2_Minimize_Drag.gif" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141684" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Google notes that today&#8217;s release is meant to make meetings &#8220;more immersive, inclusive, and productive.&#8221; The new UI doesn&#8217;t look to be a radical change, but it puts more of the controls and features right at your fingertips instead of hiding them in a menu. It also consolidates them in the bottom row instead of the current system that spreads out features between the main menu bar and an additional small menu at the top.</p>
<p>For presenters who don&#8217;t want to see themselves on the screen, Meet now also lets you minimize or completely hide your own video feed &#8212; and if you really want to glance into your own eyes, you can also pin your feed to the rest of the grid. Google says it also plans to soon let you turn off your self-feed across all Meet calls.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141713" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meet_Low_light_mode_1920x1080_white_BG_Pin_preso_5fps.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141713" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2141713" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meet_Low_light_mode_1920x1080_white_BG_Pin_preso_5fps.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141713" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Talking about pinning, one feature that seems especially useful is the ability to highlight multiple feeds. This new multi-pinning capability will make it easier to focus on the participants in a chat that are most active, for example. This feature will roll out in the coming months.</p>
<p>And coming in a few months, some of those highlighted feeds may look a bit more interesting (or annoying, depending on your point of view) because one new feature Google has planned &#8212; but isn&#8217;t ready to roll out yet &#8212; is video background replacement. For now, Google will only offer three scenes: a classroom, a party and a forest. The company says more will follow, but it doesn&#8217;t look like you&#8217;ll be able to bring your own videos to this feature anytime soon.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141710" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meet_Low_light_mode_1920x1080_white_BG__just_placed-1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141710" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2141710" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Meet_Low_light_mode_1920x1080_white_BG__just_placed-1.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141710" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Other new features in this release include Meet&#8217;s capability to automatically spruce up your video feed a bit to make sure you&#8217;re more visible in a dark environment and enhance your video when you are sitting in front of a bright background. This will roll out in the coming weeks. There&#8217;s also autozoom, which uses AI to automatically zoom in on you and put you in the middle of your frame. That&#8217;s coming to paid Google Workspace subscribers in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the words of co-founder and CEO Jonathan Shambroom, <a href="https://www.creatorplus.com">Creator+</a> is a new startup that will &#8220;finance, produce and distribute feature-length films from today&#8217;s top creators and emerging storytellers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is coming out of stealth today and also announcing that it has raised $12 million in funding led by Petra Group and Freestyle Capital, with participation from Jake Roper, Peter Hollens, Wendy Ayche (a.k.a. Wengie), Selina Tobaccowala, Jazwares CEO Judd Zebersky and others.</p>
<p>Shambroom (who&#8217;s been an executive at numerous startups and also served as general manager at Crackle) told me that one of the key aspects of the Creator+ strategy is that it controls &#8220;both sides of the equation&#8221; — it&#8217;s both producing films and building its own streaming platform, where the movies will be available for individual purchase, with no subscriptions and no ads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He said that allows the startup to control costs and distribution, but it also &#8220;enables us to do something brand new with creators,&#8221; giving them a 50-50 split on revenue, as well as sharing audience data and ownership of the intellectual property.</p>
<p>&#8220;Creator&#8221; is a term that gets used pretty broadly, and Creator+ isn&#8217;t announcing any specific deals today. But co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer Benjamin Grubbs (who previously led creator partnerships at YouTube) told me the company is initially focused on &#8220;storytellers and artists.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4flKgWJgdP"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/16/next-10-ventures/">Former YouTube exec unveils Next 10 Ventures, a $50M fund to back online creators</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Former YouTube exec unveils Next 10 Ventures, a $50M fund to back online creators&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/16/next-10-ventures/embed/#?secret=4flKgWJgdP" data-secret="4flKgWJgdP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We recognize that there are a lot of gifted storytellers on some of these large, open, ad-supported platforms where they already reach large audiences and fan bases,&#8221; Grubbs said. &#8220;But there are constraints, whether that’s time-based or economic, on the types of stories that you can actually tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Creator+ will allow those creators to break free of some of those constraints, making feature films with budgets in the low seven figures. Shambroom said the startup wants to deliver &#8220;what people expect in a film, 90 minutes give-or-take &#8230; in many of the genres that exist today&#8221; while also allowing creators to experiment with new formats and new production technologies. In some cases, these movies could be a creator&#8217;s &#8220;passion project,&#8221; while in other cases Creator+ could match them up with the right script.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see a multitude of roles and opportunities for creators, both in front of or behind the camera,&#8221; Grubbs added.</p>
<p>Creator+ plans to put between five and 10 films into production this year, with the first titles released in 2022. Shambroom said it&#8217;s committed to supporting underrepresented storytellers and has already hired <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benokeefe/">Ben O&#8217;Keefe</a> as its head of diversity and impact. The team also has global ambitions, which is why they brought on international investors, including Malaysia-based Petra Group.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The tidal wave of growth is upon us — an unprecedented economic boom that will manifest later this year, bringing significant investments, acquisitions and customer growth. But most tech companies and startups are not adequately prepared to capitalize on the opportunity that lies ahead.</p>
<p>Here’s how marketing in tech will shift — and what you need to know to reach more customers and accelerate growth in 2021.</p>
<p>First and foremost, differentiation is going to be imperative. It’s already hard enough to stand out and get noticed, and it’s about to get much more difficult as new companies emerge and investments and budgets balloon in the latter half of the year. Virtually all major companies are increasing budgets to pre-pandemic levels, but will delay those investments until the second half of the year. This will result in an increased intensity of competition that will drown out any undifferentiated players.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The second half of 2021 will bring incredible growth, the likes of which we haven’t seen in a long time.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Additionally, tech companies need to be mindful not to ignore the most important part of the ecosystem: people. Technology will only take you so far, and it’s not going to be enough to survive the competition. Marketing is about people, including your customers, team, partners, investors and the broader community.</p>
<p>Understanding who your people are and how you can use their help to build a strong foundation and drive exponential growth is essential.</p>
<p>Tactically, the most successful tech companies will embrace video and experimentation in their marketing — two components that will catapult them ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>Ignoring these predictions, backed by empirical evidence, will be detrimental and devastating. Fasten your seatbelts: 2021 is going to be a turbocharged year of growth opportunities for marketing in tech.</p>
<h2>Differentiation is crucial</h2>
<p>The explosion of tech companies and startups seeking to be the next big thing isn&#8217;t over yet. However, many of them are indistinguishable from each other and lack a compelling value proposition. Just one look at the websites of new and existing tech companies will reveal a proliferation of buzzwords and conceptual illustrations, leaving them all looking and sounding alike.</p>
<p>The tech companies that succeed are those that embrace one of the fundamentals of effective marketing — positioning.</p>
<p>In the ’80s, Al Ries and Jack Trout published &#8220;Positioning: The Battle For Your Mind&#8221; and coined the term<em>,</em> which documented the best-known approach to standing out in a noisy marketplace. As the market heats up, companies will realize the need to sharpen their positioning and dial in their focus to break through the noise.</p>
<p>To get attention and build traction, companies need to establish a position they can own. The mashup method — &#8220;Netflix but for coding lessons&#8221; — is not real positioning; it’s simply a lazy gimmick.</p>
<p>It is imperative to identify who your ideal customer is and not just who <em>could</em> use your product. Focusing on a segment of the market rather than the whole is, perhaps counterintuitively, the most effective approach to capturing the larger market.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The B2B payments space has seen an explosion in demand, and investor interest, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic as businesses try to figure out how to pay each other digitally. The challenges become even more complex when dealing with cross-border payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startups that were formed before the pandemic stand to benefit from the shift. One such startup, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.tribal.credit">Tribal Credit</a>,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched its beta in late 2019 to provide payment products for startups and small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) in emerging markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Tribal Credit announced it has raised $34.3 million in a combined Series A and debt round led by QED Investors and Partners for Growth (PFG). Existing backers BECO Capital, Global Ventures, OTG Ventures and Endure Capital also participated in the round, along with new investor Endeavor Catalyst. The raise follows “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">10x” year-over-year growth, according to CEO and co-founder Amr Shady.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the investment, Tribal received $3 million from the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Stellar Development</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Foundation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a nonprofit organization that supports the development and growth of the open-source Stellar blockchain network. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tribal uses a proprietary AI-driven underwriting approval process to evaluate businesses and approve them for credit lines. Those businesses can then use those credit lines to spend on Tribal’s products, Tribal Card and Tribal Pay. Tribal Card is a business Visa card that allows users to create physical and virtual multi-currency cards. Tribal Pay allows them to make payments to merchants and suppliers that don’t accept credit cards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says its value proposition lies not only in its ability to provide SMEs with virtual and physical corporate cards, but also a digital platform that allows founders and CFOs “to give access to and manage the spend of their distributed teams.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ve seen more demand for making B2B online payments amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, with many SMEs migrating to digital and spending more on online products and services,” Shady told TechCrunch. “Companies in this new economy are digital and global first. The need for a corporate card was accelerated. As card spend grew during the pandemic, this meant greater liability on founders’ using their personal cards, or other competing cards linked to their personal credit.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tribal, he said, underwrites the company without impacting the founders’ credit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another accelerator for its products was how the pandemic forced teams to work remotely. Founders and CFOs needed a way to provide access to corporate payments while maintaining control, Shady pointed out. Tribal’s platform aims to streamline financial operations for a distributed team. </span></p>

<p>Of course, Tribal is not the only company offering credit cards for startups. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/brex-applies-for-bank-charter-taps-former-silicon-valley-bank-exec-as-ceo-of-brex-bank/">Brex</a>, which has amassed $465 million in venture capital funding to date, also markets a credit card tailored for startups. While the companies are similar, there is a distinct difference, according to Shady: &#8220;Emerging market SMEs have different pains, particularly when it comes to cross-border payments.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tribal&#8217;s initial efforts are focused on Latin America, in particular Mexico, which is the startup&#8217;s biggest market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its new capital will go toward accelerating its growth in the region, according to Shady. In particular, the equity will go toward growing Tribal’s leadership team in Mexico, while the debt will fuel the company’s customers’ growing credit lines, Shady said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have invested heavily in our product over the past year,” Shady said. “We’re the first mover in our segment in LatAm with a diverse suite of SME products that includes corporate cards, wire payments and treasury services. We’re incredibly excited by the future ahead of us in Mexico and beyond.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Compared with everything else we’ve seen in this</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">market, Tribal has a differentiated and superior product that meets customers’</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">needs in a way that no competitor can match,” she said in a written statement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morton went on to note that Tribal has had strong traction in Mexico, with adoption from “fast-growing startups”</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">across the country, including many companies within QED’s own portfolio. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PFG is providing the debt facility for Tribal.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tribal Credit previously raised $7.8 million in a series of seed rounds. The latest round brings its total raised to $42.1 million.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Earlier this year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/08/roku-acquires-quibis-content/">Roku acquired the program catalog from Quibi</a>, the short-form video app backed by Jeffrey Katzenberg that had failed to gain traction amid the pandemic, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/quibi-is-dead/">despite nearly $2 billion in financing</a>. Quibi had been designed for on-the-go viewing, but launched when users were staying at home &#8212; watching TV on bigger screens and for longer periods of time. But now Quibil&#8217;s shows will return. Roku <a href="https://blog.roku.com/roku-originals">announced</a> today that Quibi&#8217;s catalog will be rebranded as &#8220;Roku Originals,&#8221; and will arrive on The Roku Channel in the near future.</p>
<p>Roku says it will offer more details about its launch plans in May.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s Roku Originals will become available to stream for free within The Roku Channel, the media platform&#8217;s ad-supported streaming hub for TV, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/06/roku-launches-its-own-channel-featuring-free-ad-supported-movies/">movies</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/24/rokus-adds-news-to-its-free-channel-including-the-new-streaming-network-abc-news-live/">news</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/the-roku-channel-expands-to-include-over-100-live-channels-adds-a-live-tv-guide/">live TV,</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/08/roku-expands-its-free-streaming-channel-with-entertainment-and-live-sports/">sports</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/19/roku-launches-a-kids-family-section-on-the-roku-channel-plus-parental-controls/">more</a>. The originals arriving will include a range of content, including scripted and unscripted series, as well as documentaries. At launch, these will be available to users in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. only.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Quibi&#8217;s service had made headlines for its shows that featured several big names from Hollywood, including Anna Kendrick, Chrissy Teigen, Lena Waithe, Idris Elba, Kevin Hart, and Liam Hemsworth, among others. But none of the Quibi content had been compelling enough to push consumers to subscribe to Quibi&#8217;s service &#8212; that is, Quibi didn&#8217;t have a flagship show like &#8220;Game of Thrones&#8221; or a new &#8220;Star Trek&#8221; series to draw people in. It didn&#8217;t have any classics, either, like &#8220;The Office&#8221; or &#8220;Friends.&#8221; Instead, Quibi was relying on the combination of star power and its &#8220;quick bites&#8221; mobile viewing format to attract users. But the latter no longer made sense when life on-the-go had been shut down. And for escapist, short-form entertainment, users already had TikTok.</p>
<p>Today, Roku notes that while the Quibi shows will serve as the initial backbone for its Roku Originals catalog, it plans to launch more original programming in the future under this brand.</p>
<p>In 2021, the company will roll out over 75 Roku Originals, which will include Quibi&#8217;s catalog and other unreleased series that never got the chance to air on Quibi before its shutdown. This will complement The Roku Channel&#8217;s existing lineup of over 40,000 free movies and programs, and its over 165 free live, linear TV channels.</p>
<p>Roku&#8217;s streaming business got a big boost during the pandemic, which brought in <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/roku-q4-2020-beats-estimates-record-revenue-1234910714/">a record $649.9 million in revenue in the fourth quarter and pushed Roku to a $65.2 million profit</a> when Wall St. was expecting a loss. Active users were also up 39% year-over-year to 51.2 million, and The Roku Channel&#8217;s free hub grew faster, doubling to 63 million people. With originals, Roku has a chance to further retain that audience, even as the pandemic bump starts to fade and users go back to their regular lives as vaccination rates increase and workplaces re-open.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/roku-acquires-rights-to-quibi-s-content-11610116056#">Wall St. Journal had earlier reported</a> Roku paid less than $100 million for Quibi&#8217;s catalog.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robotic process automation (RPA) unicorn <a href="https://www.uipath.com/">UiPath</a> last night priced its IPO <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210420006244/en/UiPath-Announces-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering">at $56 per share</a>, above its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/uipath-raises-ipo-range-still-targets-lower-valuation-than-final-private-round/">raised price target range of $52 to $54</a>. The company sold 9,416,384 shares at that price, alongside 14,474,393 from existing shareholders. Its underwriters can purchase 3,583,616 shares at its IPO price if they so choose.</p>
<p>UiPath raised $527.3 million on a gross basis for the primary shares that it sold in the transaction, a deal that values the company at around $29.1 billion on a nondiluted basis. On a fully diluted basis, The Exchange calculates that UiPath is worth up to $31 billion.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>UiPath&#8217;s pricing run has been fascinating to watch. The company first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/uipaths-first-ipo-pricing-could-be-a-warning-to-late-stage-investors/">proposed a $43 to $50 per-share IPO price range</a>; at that price, UiPath was worth $22.2 billion to $25.8 billion on a nondiluted basis. A coup? For a company that valued at just over $10 billion a year ago, you&#8217;d think so. The company&#8217;s final IPO price is nearly a tripling of its 2020 worth.</p>
<p>But for UiPath, things are complicated by a 2021 private round that valued the company at $35 billion, a figure that weighs somewhat heavily around the company&#8217;s neck.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995214 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-red.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Not that we should hold the final down-round IPO price differential against UiPath. It got away with raising $750 million at an inflated price before turning around and raising another half-billion at a more reasonable (more on that in a moment) valuation while providing all but its very final investors with excellent returns.</p>
<p>Its employees should do well, too, I reckon. (And Alphabet. Perhaps the company can now <a href="https://www.protocol.com/google-contractors-forced-unemployment">afford to bring more of its contractors on full-time</a> thanks to, say, the nearly 21x return that its late-stage group CapitalG made on the 13 million UiPath shares it purchased during its Series B.)</p>
<p>Regardless, after watching the UiPath IPO pricing dance from its first S-1 filing through settling at $56 per share, I think the only parties that should feel a bit silly are the investors who decided that pushing up the value of the former startup by 3.5x in a less than a year was durable logic. Let&#8217;s talk about why.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the world’s organizations shifted to remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But even as more people are vaccinated and offices are planning re-openings, it’s clear that for some organizations, remote work is here to stay. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deel, a startup which provides payroll, compliance tools and other services to help businesses hire remotely, has seen increased demand in the wake of this shift.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today, the San Francisco company has announced that it has raised $156 million in Series C funding led by the YC Continuity Fund and existing backers Andreessen Horowitz and Spark Capital. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, former Stripe payments guru Lachy Groom, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Jeff Wilke, and Anthony Schiller also participated in the round, among others. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The raise is notable for a few reasons. For one, it comes just over seven months after Deel raised </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/deel-nabs-30m-more-for-payroll-compliance-and-other-tools-to-run-global-workforces/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a $30 million Series B </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">financing. So it is essentially more than 5x the size of that round. It’s also a big deal because it propels Deel, a 3 year-old company, to unicorn status with a $1.25 billion valuation. The raise also comes after a massive year of growth for Deel, which says it saw a “20x” increase in revenue in 2020 with over 1,800 business clients. That’s up from 500 at the time of its September raise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-founded by MIT alumni Alex Bouaziz and Shuo Wan, Deel aims to allow businesses “to hire anyone, anywhere, in a compliant manner.” It claims that by using its services, businesses can hire and onboard international employees or contractors in under 5 minutes, with no local entity required and that “paying them in 120+ currencies takes just a click.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deel plans to use its new capital to continue an international expansion and set up 80 new Deel-owned entities across the world in 2021. Deel also plans to do some hiring itself, and grow its product offerings. The company’s own team is entirely remote, and has grown from 7 employees to over 120 across 26 countries since January 2020. CB Insights projects the industry for virtual HR software will grow to</span><a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/remote-hiring-startups-gaining-traction/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">$43 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 2026 as technology platforms like Deel help businesses make the transition to remote-first work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">YC Continuity’s Ali Rowghani, who has joined Deel’s board as part of the funding, believes Deel was already at the forefront of remote work pre-pandemic and that “it will be long after.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The way people work is fundamentally changing&#8230; the [Deel] team is uniquely equipped to remove the obstacles of remote work so companies hire the best talent in the world, instead of only those nearest to them,” he said in a written statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As TechCrunch previously reported, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deel today already provides various tools to employees and the organizations that they work for, such as payroll services, tax compliance information, assistance on building contracts, invoicing services and a range of insurance options covering health and other areas related to working life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now the plan is to continue building out that stack with more services aimed at both the workers and their employers. That includes loans based on salary for workers, more insurance and benefits options and other offerings.</span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For this week’s deep dive <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and<a href="https://twitter.com/alex"> Alex</a> and Danny wanted to chat crypto. No, not cryptography, but cryptocurrency. The topic has been hot in recent months thanks to Coinbase, recent weeks thanks to the rapid price appreciation in the value of many coins, and in recent days because dogecoin went crazy.</p>
<p><em>Vote for <a href="https://vote.webbyawards.com/PublicVoting#/2021/podcasts/general-series/technology">Equity to win a Webby</a> so that our parents are proud!</em></p>
<p>So with our minds tuned to the future of money, and commerce, and content, here&#8217;s the show&#8217;s rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recent crypto news has been more than busy, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/venmo-adds-support-for-buying-holding-and-selling-cryptocurrencies/">Venmo adding crypto support</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptocurrency-giant-binance-hires-former-top-bank-regulator-11618912800">Brian Brooks joining Binance</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/">the Coinbase direct listing</a>.</li>
<li>But that&#8217;s not all, there have been a host of NFT marketplaces that have raised millions in the past week. We talk about <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/93707/nft-marketplace-rarible-raises-1-75-million-in-seed-funding-round">Rarible</a>, <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/99869/nft-marketplace-superrare-funding-round">SuperRare</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/nft-marketplace-opensea-raises-23-million-from-a16z/">OpenSea</a>, and <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nft-startup-dapper-labs-raising-money-at-over-7-5-billion-valuation">Dapper Labs. </a>We talk about differentiation, UX, and if more than one marketplace can win.</li>
<li>Dogecoin&#8217;s <em>to the moon </em>moment had reached a new price high and come down some before our show recorded, but the cryptocurrency&#8217;s joke apparently is still funny after all these years. Here&#8217;s a<a href="https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1384459900147933184/photo/2"> tweet</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/dogecoin-traders-whip-up-doge-day-frenzy-in-push-toward-1-11618842535?mod=hp_lead_pos11">an article</a> about it.</li>
<li>And the idea that Coinbase&#8217;s successful direct listing will matter for investors betting on crypto-focused startups is true, at least according to investors. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/coinbases-direct-listing-alters-the-landscape-for-fintech-and-crypto-startups/">More on that here, </a>and hit us up if you want a sweet discount code to get past that paywall.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://welcome.tech/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome Tech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has built a digital platform aimed at immigrants and their families, has raised $35 million in a Series B funding round co-led by TTV Capital, Owl Ventures and SoftBank Group Corp.’s SB <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/03/softbank-launches-100m-opportunity-growth-fund-to-invest-in-founders-of-color/">Opportunity Fund</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crosscut Ventures, Mubadala Capital, Next Play Capital and Owl Capital also participated in the financing, which brings the Los Angeles-based company&#8217;s total raised to $50 million since its 2010 inception. Welcome Tech, which has an office in San Antonio, Texas, raised an $8 million Series A in March of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Built by immigrants for immigrants, Welcome Tech aims to do just what its name indicates &#8212; help immigrants feel more welcome, have an easier transition and achieve greater success when moving to the United States.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s approach was different in that rather than launch a banking product and then set out to earn the trust of the community it aims to serve, it first worked hard to earn that trust and understand the community’s needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in its first years of existence, Welcome Tech has focused on building out a platform that provides educational resources, information and services that “they need to thrive in a  new country.” Its efforts are initially primarily focused on the Hispanic community in the U.S.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of its platform, dubbed </span><a href="https://saberespoder.com/en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SABEResPODER</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (meaning Knowledge is Power in Spanish),</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to serve as “a widely recognized and trusted resource” to members of the Hispanic community in the U.S., the company says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armed with knowledge and data that it has gathered over the years, Welcome Tech six months ago launched a banking service, including a debit card and bilingual mobile app. And in January, it launched a monthly subscription offering that gives users access to discounted resources such as medical and dental professionals.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Big banks rush to back Greenwood, Killer Mike&#8217;s Atlanta-based digital bank for underrepresented customers&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/big-banks-rush-to-back-greenwood-killer-mikes-atlanta-based-digital-bank-for-underrepresented-customers/embed/#?secret=ADxt6Yd525" data-secret="ADxt6Yd525" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gardiner Garrard, co-founder and partner, TTV Capital, points out that the Hispanic market represents the </span><a href="https://multicultural.com/articles/the-2020-hispanic-market-report-now-available-from-claritas/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">largest minority cohort in the U.S</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">., with a population of 62.8 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That said, less than half of Hispanic households are ‘fully banked’, meaning they cannot open an account, which then negatively impacts their ability to secure other products or services,” Garrard said. “To not serve this community is a major failure. Welcome Tech is addressing this issue head on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Welcome’s platform is approaching 3 million active users, according to co-founder and CEO Amir Hemmat. Its ultimate goal, he said, is to serve as “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital Ellis Island.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The way we leave immigrants’ success to chance is pretty crazy,” he told TechCrunch. “If you think of countries the way you think of companies and the way they want to attract and retain&#8230;here, we almost do the opposite.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, Hemmat and co-founder Raul Lomeli-Azoubel recognized that access to financial services was crucial to immigrants’ success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Although we ultimately see ourselves building towards a better future for immigration and a broader platform, the foundation and beachhead for that is definitely in financial services,” Hemmat said.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome offers a free banking account that is fully bilingual for English and Spanish speaking communities with “key features that are very tailor made for this community.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A number of new digital banks targeting Latino and immigrant communities in general have emerged in recent years, including </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/tomocredit-raises-7m-to-help-people-with-cash-but-little-to-no-credit-history/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TomoCredit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/big-banks-rush-to-back-greenwood-killer-mikes-atlanta-based-digital-bank-for-underrepresented-customers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenwood</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Welcome aims to differentiate itself from competitors in being a more broad-based platform. Its subscription offering &#8212; at $10 a month &#8212; does things like offer discounts to healthcare professionals and free televisits, for example.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we dug in, we realized that immigrants are not being provided data-driven recommendations,” Hemmat said. “It’s very much a word of mouth and trial of error, and in some cases highly predatory, experience. We’re working to aggregate a historically fragmented audience and that gives us massive leverage to source better offerings, pricing and experiences for consumers across multiple categories.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital to build more partnerships so that it can do the above, as well as spread awareness about its services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gosia Karas, investment director and head of growth stage investments at SoftBank’s Opportunity Fund, told TechCrunch that the fact that the immigrant population in the U.S. is “growing really fast and underserved creates an opportunity for someone to come in and serve them well with a financial services offering.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, SoftBank was attracted to Welcome Tech’s approach to truly understand, and gather data around, its target market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before even jumping head first into building a fintech company, they did a lot of work prior,” Karas said. “They spent years building an understanding of this audience of the immigrant population, including building trust within that demographic. And at the same time, they have been building targeted content. This serves as a really great backbone to build a company that is very well-suited to serve that audience and to roll out things like the debit card and other financial services offerings.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.misfitsmarket.com">Misfits Market</a>, a startup known for selling &#8220;ugly&#8221; fruits and vegetables at discount prices, announced this morning that it has raised $200 million in Series C funding.</p>
<p>The company says this brings its total funding to $301.5 million and moves its valuation into unicorn territory (i.e., above $1 billion). It isn&#8217;t getting any more specific about that valuation, though <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-21/misfits-market-funding-round-brings-valuation-to-1-1-billion">Bloomberg reports</a> that it&#8217;s $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO Abhi Ramesh told me that the Delanco, New Jersey-based startup has expanded beyond produce into a variety of grocery categories. At the same time, he said all of its products remain united by a focus on &#8220;a single word, which is value.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Misfits Market products are discounted by up to 40 percent compared to what you&#8217;d find in other grocery stores (in-person or online), which Ramesh said the company achieves by purchasing products that regular stores won&#8217;t buy or sell, often for &#8220;crazy, random&#8221; reasons. For example, he said the company had recently purchased 50,000 bottles of perfectly good olive oil &#8220;where the labeling was just angled the wrong way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company says its active customer base and order volume grew 5x last year, when it shipped 77 million pounds of food to more than 400,000 customers. Ramesh said it was a big challenge to meet increased consumer demand (and it did have to create a long wait list for a while), but Misfits had advantages that many other grocery companies did not.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fortunately, because we operate our own fulfillment centers and we have our own internal tech built around this, we were not constrained by the same constraints that physical grocery stores have, where we have to close at 9pm every day, where we have to make room for regular foot traffic and Instacart shoppers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For us, we just have to scale our fulfillment centers, which is easier said than done.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new round was led by Accel and D1 Capital, with participation from Valor Equity Partners, Greenoaks Capital, Sound Ventures, Third Kind Ventures and others. Accel&#8217;s Ryan Sweeney is joining Misfits&#8217; board of directors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Direct-to-consumer models aren&#8217;t anything new in the food industry, but the approach Misfits Market has taken is,” Sweeney said in a statement. “Instead of focusing only on their end customer, they’ve managed to create a dynamic solution that also supports food suppliers at every level.”</p>
<p>With the new funding, Misfits Market plans to continue expanding into new grocery categories and new geographies. For example, it&#8217;s taking its first orders from Oregon and Washington today, and Ramesh said his goal is to be shipping to &#8220;100 percent of zip codes in the 48 lower states&#8221; in the next 12 months.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Amazon is bringing its new biometric device, the Amazon One scanner, to Whole Foods store. The retail giant this past fall first introduced the Amazon One scanner, which allows shoppers to enter a store by having their palm scanned. The customer&#8217;s palm signature can be associated with their payment mechanism in a retail environment &#8212; [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon is <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-one-continues-expansion-now-available-as-a-contactless-payment-option-at-initial-whole-foods-market-store-in-seattle">bringing</a> its new biometric device, the Amazon One scanner, to Whole Foods store. The retail giant this past fall first <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/introducing-amazon-one-a-new-innovation-to-make-everyday-activities-effortless">introduced</a> the Amazon One scanner, which allows shoppers to enter a store by having their palm scanned. The customer&#8217;s palm signature can be associated with their payment mechanism in a retail environment &#8212; like Amazon&#8217;s cashier-less Amazon Go stores, where customers shop then walk out without having to go through a traditional checkout process. Now at Whole Foods, the Amazon One scanner will be added as a payment option at checkout.</p>
<p>That means customers could choose to scan their palm over the reader to pay for their purchases, instead of paying with cash or a credit or debit card, for example. It will not replace other payment options, Amazon stressed.</p>
<p>Amazon says it&#8217;s initially adding the Amazon One palm scanner to the Whole Foods Market store at Madison Broadway in Seattle, but plans to roll it out to seven more Whole Foods Market stores in the greater Seattle area in the months to come. Seattle will likely serve as a test market for the new technology before Amazon chooses to roll it out more broadly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/29/amazon-introduces-the-amazon-one-a-way-to-pay-with-your-palm-when-entering-stores/">its launch in September</a>, Amazon One scanners have already been installed in several Amazon stores in the Seattle area, including Amazon Go, Amazon Go Grocery, Amazon Books, Amazon 4-star, and Amazon Pop Up. The retailer says &#8220;thousands&#8221; of customers have now enrolled their palm signatures.</p>
<p>With the Whole Foods launch, customers will be able to sign up for Amazon One at a kiosk or device in the participating Whole Foods stores, where they can choose to enroll one or both palms. The scanner uses computer vision technology to create the unique palm signature, which is associated with the payment card the customer inserts into the device.</p>
<p>Existing customers who had previously enrolled in Amazon One at a different location will have to re-insert their credit card one time in the Whole Foods store to continue to use the service in those stores, Amazon said.</p>
<p>In addition, customers will be able to link their Amazon One ID with their Amazon account in order to get their Prime membership discount to apply to their Whole Foods Market purchases via the Amazon One device in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;At Whole Foods Market, we’re always looking for new and innovative ways to improve the shopping experience for our customers,&#8221; said Arun Rajan, senior vice president of technology and chief technology officer at Whole Foods Market, in a statement about the expansion. &#8220;Working closely with Amazon, we’ve brought benefits like Prime member discounts, online grocery delivery and pickup, and free returns to our customers, and we’re excited to add Amazon One as a payment option beginning today. We’re starting with an initial store at Madison Broadway in Seattle and look forward to hearing what customers think as we expand this option to additional stores over time,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The device, of course, comes with concerns given Amazon&#8217;s track record with biometric technology. The company has <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202006/u-s-congress-member-welcomes-awss-facial-recognition-moratorium-demands-further-explanations">sold biometric facial recognition services</a> to law enforcement in the U.S.; its facial recognition technology <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202006/u-s-congress-member-welcomes-awss-facial-recognition-moratorium-demands-further-explanations">was the subject of a data privacy lawsuit</a>; and its Ring camera <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-ring-2000-police-fire-departments-213301374.html">company continues</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/08/over-30-civil-rights-groups-demand-an-end-to-amazon-rings-police-partnerships/">work in partnership with police.</a> It was also found to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/03/amazon-responds-to-a-u-s-senators-inquiry-confirms-alexa-voice-records-are-kept-indefinitely/">keeping Alexa voice records indefinitely</a>, with no option for customers to delete them. (Amazon later <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/amazon-adds-alexa-delete-what-i-said-today-command/">changed</a> that &#8212; and, to be fair, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/google-ordered-to-halt-human-review-of-voice-ai-recordings-over-privacy-risks/">Google</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/26/siri-recordings-regularly-sent-to-apple-contractors-for-analysis-claims-whistleblower/">Apple</a> were mishandling customer voice data, too.)</p>
<p>Just yesterday, Amazon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/amazon-is-opening-a-london-hair-salon-to-test-ar-and-other-retail-technologies/">announced tests</a> of other retail and AR technology in a London area hair salon, which would involve cameras capturing customer images. The company said it wasn&#8217;t retaining &#8220;customer data,&#8221; but declined to answer a question about the non-personal data being collected at the salon.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s announcement, Amazon notes that the Amazon One device is &#8220;protected by multiple security controls, and palm images are never stored on the Amazon One device.&#8221; It says the images are encrypted and sent to a secure area built for Amazon One in the cloud where Amazon creates the customers&#8217; palm signatures. It also offers a way for customers to unenroll from Amazon One from either a device itself or from one.amazon.com, which also deletes their biometric data when all their transactions have completed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Companies like <a href="https://ro.co/">Ro</a> and <a href="https://www.forhims.com/">Hims</a> have capitalized on the need for more seamless and discreet access to health and wellness products that are part of everyday life. For men.</p>
<p><a href="https://getstix.co/">Stix</a> is looking to do the same for women, and has today announced the raise of a $3.5 million seed round. The financing was co-led by Resolute Ventures and SWAT equity partners, with participation from Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator, Bullish, and a variety of strategic angels. This brings the total amount raised by the company to $5 million.</p>
<p>Stix launched in 2019 with a D2C pregnancy test that was easy to buy and use, and that eliminated some of their associated stigma. For example, some pregnancy tests show a smiley face when a woman tests positive, despite the fact that not all women taking a pregnancy test want to be pregnant.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company then expanded to ovulation tests and prenatal supplements. Most recently, Stix has moved into UTI diagnostics tests, pain relief products, and preventative supplements. This last product category is particularly important. First of all, women are 30 times more likely to get a UTI than men, according to <a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/urinary-tract-infections">womenshealth.gov</a>, and more than half of all women will have at least one UTI in their lifetime. It&#8217;s a huge market.</p>
<p>Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, there are few if any diagnostic products out on the market that women can buy over the counter. In other words, it&#8217;s taxing for a woman to diagnose a UTI (usually having to go see a doctor) despite the fact that UTIs are incredibly common.</p>
<p>The FDA-cleared UTI test makes it much easier for women to take action and get some answers from the comfort of their own home. Stix offers these products as a subscription and gives customers the option to choose how frequently they&#8217;d like them delivered.</p>
<p>Stix was cofounded by <a href="https://twitter.com/cynplotch?lang=en">Cynthia Plotch</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jamienorwood_">Jamie Norwood</a>. The startup is looking to build a full suite of not only products, but educational resources and content to help guide women through these hyper common, but difficult, experiences.</p>
<p>Stix has eight people on the team, including the cofounders, three of whom are people of color. All are women.</p>
<p>The startup is not alone in the market. <a href="https://modernfertility.com/">Modern Fertility</a>, for example, is selling ovulation and pregnancy tests direct to consumer and has distribution through big box retailers like Wal-Mart.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Our venture capital-focused podcast <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a> made it to the finals of its category in the Webbys, a digital awards show for digital things.

<p>The company&#8217;s tech integrates satellite imagery with mobile and desktop applications for farming analytics. These offerings include both remote crop monitoring, variable-rate seed and fertilizer applications that can reduce the time spent on field scouting and improve efficiency as it relates to inputs.</p>
<p>OneSoil already has more than 200,000 farmers and consultants using its service across over 180 countries just two and a half years after its launch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims that roughly 5% of the world&#8217;s total arable land (197 mln acres) is covered by OneSoil users, which include major ag companies like BASF and Krone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing from Almaz and PortfoLion will be used to expand on its market position in the Americas and Europe, the company said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We aim to help farmers make informed decisions for their agricultural operations, reduce input waste, and increase their profits. To do that, we provide digital tools that combine real-time, global-scale satellite imagery processing for the best analytics and insights for our users,&#8221; says Slava Mazai, CEO at OneSoil, in a statement. &#8220;We aim to build the biggest digital platform for informed solutions and precision agriculture. To move faster down this path, we will hire tech and marketing professionals in Europe and the CIS, and we&#8217;re looking for consultants and business partners in the field of agronomy in North and South America&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For Almaz investor, Pavel Bogdanov, it was the company&#8217;s impressive adoption rates among farmers that convinced the firm to invest in the OneSoil round. &#8220;[F</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">armers&#8217;] adoption of new tools has been slow due to the complexity of the products, cost, and a degree of risk aversion among farmers. At least, we thought adoption was slow before we met OneSoil. OneSoil is very popular with farmers; the growth in global usage was so impressive that we decided to invest in OneSoil to help them add even more valuable solutions for farmers&#8221;, said Bogdanov, in a statement.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Enterprises are adopting an ever-wider range of SaaS applications to work and interface with customers, and that is proving to be a major security concern: it&#8217;s not just the prospect of phishing, credential stuffing and other malicious tricks to get into systems that are a worry, but the fact that more applications mean more attack surfaces, and more integrations between apps mean more inadvertent holes that get exposed in the process.</p>
<p>And that is leading to surge of interest in security applications that can help. Today, a startup called <a href="https://appomni.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AppOmni</a> &#8212; which has built a platform to help monitor SaaS apps and their activity, provide guidance to warn or block when things might go wrong, and fix problems when they do occur &#8212; is announcing some funding to fuel its growth.</p>
<p>The startup has raised $40 million in a Series B round led by Scale Venture Partners, with Salesforce Ventures and ServiceNow Ventures, as well as previous backers ClearSky, Costanoa Ventures, Inner Loop Capital and Silicon Valley Data Capital also participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is coming on the back of a huge year for AppOmni. The company grew 900%, co-founder and CEO Brendan O&#8217;Connor told TechCrunch, and it has managed to stay at 100% customer retention &#8212; that is, AppOmni has yet to lose a single customer since it was founded.</p>
<p>The company today integrates with over 100 connectors, platforms used by developers and IT teams at companies to manage the apps that their businesses use, tools Splunk and Sumo Logic. Through this, AppOmni is able to aggregate and normalize event data around those apps, in addition to deeper monitoring in cases where it can integrate with apps themselves (those integrations to date include some of the most popular apps that enterprises use today, including Salesforce and Slack, Zoom, Microsoft 365, Box and Github).</p>
<p>As O&#8217;Connor describes it, the sheer number of apps that enterprise teams use and adopt has made managing security around them very complex. Partly because of how SaaS is set up for usage by as many people in and outside the organization as possible (to make the apps more useful), AppOmni estimates that some 95% of enterprises &#8220;overprovision&#8221; permissions for external users.</p>
<p>On top of that, some of the biggest problems occur indirectly, specifically when applications are linked up together, creating a flow of sensitive data. AppOmni says that some 55% of companies have sensitive data living in SaaS systems that has been inadvertently exposed to the anonymous internet, sitting there completely unguarded, in this way. (See <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/geico-driver-license-numbers-scraped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zack&#8217;s story here</a> for a recent example of how this can play out.)</p>
<p>This is an issue, he said, that is unique to SaaS, which he describes different architecturally to any software that companies might have used in the past. &#8220;There is no operating system, no network that is exposed to customers,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The idea is that AppOmni provides a dashboard to make that monitoring much less murky. &#8220;One of our customers described using AppOmni as being akin to turning a light on in a dark room,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor said.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Connor and his co-founder, Brian Soby (the CTO), have first-hand knowledge of the challenges of securing SaaS applications: both spent years at Salesforce &#8212; with O&#8217;Connor the company&#8217;s SVP and &#8220;chief trust officer&#8221;, a role he left to join ServiceNow as its security CTO, before leaving there to co-found AppOmni with Soby.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s partly that track record, along with AppOmni&#8217;s own track record, that has given the startup the attention that it has from investors. Interestingly, Scale came to know AppOmni not over a coffee or a pitch deck, but as one of those satisfied customers, which eventually led the VC to offer to invest.</p>
<p>“Scale Venture Partners became an AppOmni customer in 2020. We know firsthand how powerful and differentiated the AppOmni product when it comes to protecting our sensitive SaaS data, and we’re excited to now be both a customer and an investor,” said Ariel Tseitlin, a partner at Scale Venture Partners, in a statement. “AppOmni’s 9x growth last year, driven by the acquisition of customers across a wide range of industries, proves that AppOmni is the market leader in the increasingly important SaaS Security Management market. We expect the momentum to continue in 2021 and beyond as companies accelerate their shift to cloud applications to support their larger remote workforces.”</p>
<p>The company has raised $53 million to date, and it is not disclosing valuation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://authzed.com/">Authzed</a>, an early stage startup that wants to make it easier for developers to build permissions in their applications, announced a $3.9 million seed round today. The investment was led by Work-Bench with participation from Y Combinator and Amplify Partners.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Jake Moshenko says the service is an API that is designed to help developers quickly add permissions to an application. &#8220;Authzed is a platform to store, compute and validate application permissions. So based on our experience at Google and Red Hat and Amazon, we think that this is the proper way that companies should be doing application permissions,&#8221; Moshenko told me.</p>
<p>The way the service works is by helping to define groups of users, and based on the membership of a given group, defining what data they can see and what functions they have permissions to access. While it may rely on Active Directory or LDAP as the basis of permissions groups, he says that it simplifies the actual permissions implementation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;So, by itself Active Directory doesn&#8217;t actually fully solve the problem. You still have to bind to that group membership to a set of permissions that it implies. With our system, you can actually unify the way that you talk about both the permissions and group members,&#8221; Moshenko said.</p>

<p>The company has built out the framework for the service, But Moshenko says the links to Active Directory and other directory services are on the road map. For now, they have been working with design partners to get the basics of the product down, and today the company is opening the service for any developer who wants to use it.</p>
<p>For starters, it will be free, but over time he expects they will have pricing tiers. He likens his service to other API companies like Twilio for communications or Stripe for payments and expects the cost will be low when an application is just starting out and then go up over time as it gets more popular and needs to check the permissions more regularly.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s early days for the company and other than the three co-founders, they have just one employee. The plan is to hire additional engineers using the money from this round, while trying to build traction in the developer community for the product. He says that the number of new employees they add this year will really depend on how well the product is doing in the market.</p>
<p>The founders previously founded Quay, a private registry for Docker containers, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/08/13/coreos-acquires-quay-io-to-launch-its-private-docker-repository/">they sold to CoreOS in 2014</a>.

IBM then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/01/with-the-acquisition-closed-ibm-goes-all-in-on-red-hat/">bought Red Hat for $34 billion</a> later in the year.</p>
