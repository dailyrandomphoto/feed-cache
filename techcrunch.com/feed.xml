										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’ve piloted Spot a number of ways in a number of different settings. I had the chance to control the robot for the first time at one of our Robotics events a number of years back, and drove one around an obstacle course at Boston Dynamics’ headquarters. More recently, I navigated it via web browser as a test of the robot’s new remote interface.</p>
<p>But a recent test drive was different. For one thing, it wasn’t officially sanctioned by Boston Dynamics. Of course, the highly sophisticated quadrupedal robot has been out in the world for a while, and a few enterprising souls have begun to offer a remote Spot walking experience through the streets of San Francisco.</p>
<p>The latest project form MSCHF isn’t that. That should come as no surprise, of course. The Brooklyn-based company is never that straightforward. It’s the same organization that gave us the “pirate radio” streaming service All The Streams.FM and that wild Amazon Echo ultrasonic jammer. More than anything, their events are comments &#8212; on privacy, on consumerism or this case, a kind of dystopian foreshadowing of what robotics might become.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Like the rest of the world, the company was fascinated when Boston Dynamics put Spot up for sale &#8212; but unlike most of us, MSCHF actually managed to cobble together $75,000 to buy one.</p>
<p>And then it mounted a paintball gun to its back.</p>

<p>Starting Wednesday, users will be able to pilot a <a href="https://spotsrampage.com/">Spot unit through MSCHF’s site</a>, and fire off a paintball gun in a closed setting. The company calls it &#8220;Spot&#8217;s Rampage.&#8221;</p>
<p>“The stream will start Wednesday at 1 PM EST,” MSCHF’s Daniel Greenberg told TechCrunch. “We will have a four-camera livestream going and as long as you&#8217;re on the site on your phone, you will have an equal chance of being able to control Spot, and every two minutes the driver will change. It should go for a few hours.”</p>
<p>Ahead of the launch of Spot’s web portal, the company built an API to remotely control both Spot’s SDK and the paintball gun mounted to the robot’s back. It’s a setup Boston Dynamics isn’t particularly thrilled with. Understandably so. For a company that has long been dealing with the blowback of cautionary science fiction like <em>Black Mirror</em>, the optics of a third-party mounting a gun &#8212; even one that shoots paint &#8212; are less than ideal.</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics tells TechCrunch that it was interested in working with the company early on.</p>
<p>“They came to us with the idea that they were going to do a creative project with Spot,” a rep told TechCrunch. “They’re a creative group of guys, who have done a bunch of creative things. In our conversations, we said that if you want to cooperate with us, we want to make it clear that the robots will not be used in any way that hurts people.”</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics balked when paintball gun entered the conversation. On Friday, it issued the following statement through Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today we learned that an art group is planning a spectacle to draw attention to a provocative use of our industrial robot, Spot. To be clear, we condemn the portrayal of our technology in any way that promotes violence, harm, or intimidation. Our mission is to create and deliver surprisingly capable robots that inspire, delight &amp; positively impact society. We take great care to make sure our customers intend to use our robots for legal uses. We cross-check every purchase request against the U.S. Government&#8217;s denied persons and entities lists, prior to authorizing a sale.</p>
<p>In addition, all buyers must agree to our Terms and Conditions of Sale, which state that our products must be used in compliance with the law, and cannot be used to harm or intimidate people or animals. Any violation of our Terms of Sale will automatically void the product’s warranty and prevent the robot from being updated, serviced, repaired or replaced. Provocative art can help push useful dialogue about the role of technology in our daily lives. This art, however, fundamentally misrepresents Spot and how it is being used to benefit our daily lives.</p></blockquote>
<p>The statement is in line with the language in Spot’s contract, which prohibits using the robot to do anything illegal, or to intimidate or harm people. The company says it does additional “due diligence” with potential customers, including background checks.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115585" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115585" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2115585" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2086.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2115585" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MSCHF</p></div></p>
<p>The application is something of a gray area where Boston Dynamics is concerned. MSCHF approached the robotics company with its idea and Boston Dynamics balked, believing it wasn&#8217;t in-line with the stated mission for the quadrupedal robots. The official Spot’s Rampage site notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>We talked with Boston Dynamics and they HATED [emphasis theirs] this idea. They said they would give us another TWO Spots for FREE if we took the gun off. That just made us want to do this even more and if our Spot stops working just know they have a backdoor override built into each and every one of these little robots.</p></blockquote>
<p>Boston Dynamics says the company’s “understanding of the interaction” is “inaccurate.”</p>
<p>“We get approached by marketing opportunities all the time to create a really fantastic and compelling experience,” the company adds. “Selling one robot is not that interesting. Creating an amazing interactive experience is really compelling for us. One of the things they pitched to us was an interactive idea. It’s an expensive robot and they wanted to create an interactive experience where anybody can control the robot. We thought that was super cool and compelling.”</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics says it pitched the idea of using Spot’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/boston-dynamics-spot-is-getting-an-arm-and-self-charging-dock-next-year/">robot arm</a> to paint the physical space with a brush, rather than using the paintball gun. The company also offered to send technicians to the site to help maintain the robot during the stream, along with a few models as back up.</p>
<p>MSCHF’s inclusion of the paintball gun is, ultimately, about more than simply painting the canvas. The image of the robot with a gun &#8212; even one that only shoots paint &#8212; is menacing. And that’s kind of the point.</p>
<p>“It’s easy to look at these robots dance and cavort and see them as cute semi-sentient little friends,” says Greenberg. “They’re endearing when they mess up and fall over. We’ve adopted the trappings of that scenario by creating a ‘bull-in-a-china-shop&#8217; scenario. Still, it’s worth remembering the big versions of Spot [Big Dog] were explicitly military mules, and that their public deployments tend to be by city agencies and law enforcement. At the end of the day, Spot is a terrestrial UAV &#8211; when you get to drive this robot and experience the thrill of pulling the trigger your adrenaline spikes &#8212; but, we hope, a few minutes later you feel a distinct chill. Anyone in their right mind knows these little cuties will kill people sooner or later.”</p>
<p>While early Boston Dynamics robots were, indeed, funded by DARPA for use as transport vehicles, the company is quick to distance itself from even the remotest hint of ominous imagery. Boston Dynamics <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/the-aclu-wants-details-about-videos-of-boston-dynamics-robot-in-police-exercises/">came under fire from the ACLU</a> after showcasing footage of a Spot being used in Massachusetts State police drills onstage at a TechCrunch robotics event.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115586" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115586" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2115586" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/spot-ramp-gif-1.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /><p id="caption-attachment-2115586" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>MSCHF</p></div></p>
<p>The company told TechCrunch at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>Right now we’re at a scale where we can pick and choose the partners we engage with and make sure that they have a similar deployment and a vision for how robots are used. For example, not using robots in a way that would physically harm or intimidate people. But also have a realistic expectation for what a robot can and cannot do.</p></blockquote>
<p>As MSCHF prepares to launch its event, the company is echoing those sentiments.</p>
<p>“I turned down a customer that wanted to use Spot for a haunted house,” Boston Dynamics tells TechCrunch. “Even putting it in that context of using our technology to scare people was not within our terms of use and not how we imagined the product being beneficial for people, and so we declined that initial sale. Had this concept been brought to us while we were in the initial sales discussions, we probably would have said, ‘there’s Arduino quadruped that you could easily put this activation together. Go do that. This isn’t representative of how we view our technology being used.&#8217; ”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115587" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115587" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2115587" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/G84A2201.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2115587" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> MSCHF</p></div></p>
<p>But the question of whether the company can put the toothpaste back in the tube remains. In cases of violations of the Terms of Service, the company can opt not to renew the license, which effectively deactivates it the next time a firmware update is due. Other cases could essentially void the warranty, meaning the company won’t service it.</p>
<p>A paintball gun being fired in a closed space likely doesn’t fall under harm, intimidation or illegal activity, however. So it’s not entirely clear whether Boston Dynamics has a direct course of action in this case.</p>
<p>“This is something we’re evaluating now, around this particular use case,” Boston Dynamics says. “We do have other terms of service in there, regarding modification of the robot in a way that makes it unsafe. We’re trying to understand what the implications are.”</p>
<p>Boston Dynamics (whose <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/following-hyundai-acquisition-boston-dynamics-ceo-discussing-the-robotics-pioneers-future/">sale to Hyundai is expected to close in June</a>) has devoted a good deal of time to showcasing the various tasks the robot can perform, from routine inspections at hazard sites to the complex dance moves it’s performed in a recent viral video. MSCHF’s primary &#8212; and, really, only &#8212; use is an interactive art piece.</p>
<p>“To be honest, we don&#8217;t have any further plans [for the robot],” says Greenberg. “I know we won&#8217;t do another drop with it as we do not do repeats so we will just have to get really creative. Maybe a waking cup holder.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new market forecast predicts app spending will reach $270 billion by the year 2025, including paid downloads, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. According to data from <a href="https://sensortower.com/">Sensor Tower</a>, in-app spending will return to pre-pandemic levels of stable growth over the next few years, downloads will continue to grow, and, perhaps most notably, it&#8217;s predicting app store spending in non-game apps will overtake mobile game spending by 2024.</p>
<p>This is a big bet, given that, today, consumers spend twice as much on mobile games than on non-games. The firm, however, believes the subscription model now being adopted by a range of mobile apps will cause a shift in the market. By 2024, it expects non-game spending to reach $86 billion compared with $73 billion in game spending. And by 2025, that gap will widen, with non-games reaching $107 billion while mobile games reach $78 billion.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115899" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115899" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2115899" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/non-game-app-spending-vs-mobile-games.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="436" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/non-game-app-spending-vs-mobile-games.png 1450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/non-game-app-spending-vs-mobile-games.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/non-game-app-spending-vs-mobile-games.png?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/non-game-app-spending-vs-mobile-games.png?resize=768,493 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/non-game-app-spending-vs-mobile-games.png?resize=680,436 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/non-game-app-spending-vs-mobile-games.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2115899" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last year, global consumer spending in the top 100 subscription apps <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/top-100-subscription-apps-grew-34-to-13b-in-2020-share-of-total-spend-remained-the-same/">was up by 34%</a>, year-over-year, to give you an idea of the current state of the market. But there were already some indications that subscription growth was being impacted by larger apps, like Netflix and Tinder, which found workarounds to in-app purchases.</p>
<p>What Sensor Tower also can&#8217;t predict is how the regulatory environment of the next several years will play out across the app stores. Today, companies like Apple and Google require apps to charge customers for subscriptions via Google and Apple&#8217;s own payment mechanisms. But new anti-competition laws could be enacted that would allow publishers to market their own subscriptions inside their apps, which then redirect users to their own channels to make those purchases. Such a change would have an outsized impact on app store subscription growth trends, and, therefore, this forecast.</p>
<p>Though the pandemic pushed in-app spending up by 30% year-over-year to a record $111 billion in 2020, the new forecast predicts general in-app spending will return to pre-COVID levels over the next five years. It says gross revenue across both app stores will climb each year with a 19.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) to reach $270 billion by 2025. Of that figure, $185 billion will be App Store spending, versus $85 billion on Google Play.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115897" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115897" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2115897" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/global-consumer-spending-2025-forecast.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="436" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/global-consumer-spending-2025-forecast.png 1450w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/global-consumer-spending-2025-forecast.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/global-consumer-spending-2025-forecast.png?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/global-consumer-spending-2025-forecast.png?resize=768,493 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/global-consumer-spending-2025-forecast.png?resize=680,436 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/global-consumer-spending-2025-forecast.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2115897" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sensor Tower</p></div></p>
<p>The U.S. will grow slightly slower than the rest of the global market, with a CAGR of 17.7% to reach $74 billion by 2025.</p>
<p>European markets will drive growth in app store spending from 2020 through 2025, led by the U.K. This not the equivalent to which markets see the most spending in total, but rather is about where growth is taking place &#8212; in other words, opportunity for app makers. By 2025, 11 European countries will pass the $1 billion in consumer spending milestone, to collectively reach $42 billion in consumer spend.</p>

<p>Downloads, meanwhile, will continue to grow over the next several years, to reach 230 billion by 2025, the forecast predicts, with Google Play accounting for a majority of that figure, with 187 billion global downloads. In the U.S., however, App Store downloads in 2025 (10.6B) will top those from Google Play (6.3B), the report concludes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox</a>. </em></p>
<p>Hi friends and new readers, welcome back to The Station, a newsletter dedicated to all the present and future ways people and packages move from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>Before you get to reading The Station, a small update for you. As transportation editor — a new title I gained last month — I am focused on building a team and deepening our coverage. My first task was to bring on Mark Harris, who will be writing investigative pieces as well as articles for our subscription product Extra Crunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>His first EC piece, which will publish this coming week, is a deep dive into solid-state batteries. This isn&#8217;t some one-off. Each month, EC will publish two &#8220;market map&#8221; articles, which focus on a particular slice of the transportation industry, along with other mobility-related analysis. I&#8217;m also bringing on more reporters to beef up coverage over at TechCrunch. A few of these folks have an expertise in automotive tech and are helping me revamp the traditional car review into something more TechCrunch-y.</p>
<p>Email me at <a href="mailto:kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com">kirsten.korosec@techcrunch.com</a> to share thoughts, criticisms, offer up opinions or tips. You can also send a direct message to me at Twitter — <a href="https://twitter.com/kirstenkorosec">@kirstenkorosec</a>.</p>

<p>Remember last week when I wondered out loud if a new diversification trend was afoot in the micromobility sector? A growing number of companies are either adding new products to their portfolios or technological upgrades. For instance, Lime has added mopeds to its portfolio and Spin is testing out new three-wheeled scooters that can be remotely operated, via software and people power from Tortoise.</p>
<p>Revel has taken this diversification to a new level. The shared electric moped startup said it will start offering <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/shared-scooter-startup-revel-adds-electric-bike-subscriptions-to-its-business/">monthly electric bike subscriptions</a> in New York, making this is the second new business venture the company has announced in the past several weeks.</p>
<p>Until the end of January, Revel was just a shared electric moped startup. Then it added a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/electric-moped-startup-revel-launches-an-ev-charging-business/">DC fast-charging station for electric vehicles</a> in New York City. This new “Superhub&#8221; will contain 30 chargers and be open to the public 24 hours a day. Revel said it will open other Superhubs across New York City.</p>
<p>A week or so later it announced it was expanding into monthly subscriptions for electric bikes. The pedal-assist bikes, which are manufactured by WING Bikes, come equipped with a 36-volt battery that can travel 45 miles on a single charge and can reach speeds of 20 miles per hour.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t seem — based on comments I received from Revel CEO and co-founder Frank Reig — that the company is done adding business ventures or products. &#8220;Safe to say that this will not be our last big announcement in 2021,” Reig told me.</p>
<p><em>Stay tuned. </em></p>
<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p>A few years ago, I thought that lidar — the light detection and ranging radar that measures distance using laser light to generate a highly accurate 3D map of the world — had reached its peak. More than 70 lidar startups existed at that time and the timelines around the deployment of autonomous vehicles, which would theoretically unleash massive demand for the sensors, was slipping.</p>
<p>Consolidation seemed inevitable. Then came the wave of pivots, when lidar companies employed various strategies. Some started to market their sensors to other industries and others touted the perception software that accompanied the lidar. Many targeted automakers with the pitch that their sensors could make the advanced driver assistance systems more robust, reliable and safe.</p>
<p>A new trend is afoot in lidar land. Merging with SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, have become a go-to path for companies wanting to access the level of capital that the public market can provide. Lidar companies have joined the party in recent months with Aeye becoming the latest guest to arrive.</p>
<p><strong>Aeye</strong> announced it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/aeye-becomes-latest-lidar-company-to-go-public-via-spac/">going public through a merger</a> with CF Finance Acquisition Corp. III that will value the company at $2 billion. Under this deal, AEye said it was able to raise $225 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE, from institutional and strategic investors that include GM Ventures, Subaru-SBI, Intel Capital, Hella Ventures and Taiwania Capital. Other undisclosed investors also participated. Through the transaction, AEye will have about $455 million in cash on its balance sheet, proceeds that include $230 million in trust from CF Finance Acquisition Corp. III, a SPAC sponsored by Cantor Fitzgerald.</p>
<p>Aeye is the sixth lidar company to announce a SPAC since last summer. Velodyne Lidar kicked off the trend when it announced that it planned to go public through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Graf Industrial Corp., with a market value of $1.8 billion. Others soon followed, including Luminar, Aeva, Ouster and Innoviz.</p>
<p>Which lidar company will be next?</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that caught my eye this week &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dingdong Maicai</strong>, the Chinese grocery app backed by Sequoia Capital China, is considering an initial public offering in the U.S. as soon as this year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-18/sequoia-backed-grocery-app-dingdong-maicai-said-to-mull-u-s-ipo?srnd=deals&amp;sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a>.</p>
<p class="Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x"><strong>Li-Cycle Corp</strong>, a lithium-ion battery recycler, is close to reaching an agreement to go public through a merger with Peridot Acquisition Corp., <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lifecycle-m-a-peridot-acqsn-exclusive/exclusive-battery-recycler-li-cycle-nears-spac-deal-to-go-public-sources-idUSKBN2AF1VE">Reuters reported</a>. The combined company would have a valuation of about $1.7 billion.</p>
<p class="Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x"><strong>Metropolis</strong>, a new parking payment and management startup based in Los Angeles, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/la-based-metropolis-raises-41-million-to-upgrade-parking-infrastructure/">raised $41 million in financing</a> from investors, including real estate managers Starwood and RXR Realty, Dick Costolo and Adam Bain&#8217;s 01 Advisors, Dragoneer, former Facebook employees Sam Lessin and Kevin Colleran&#8217;s Slow Ventures, Dan Doctoroff, the head of Alphabet&#8217;s Sidewalk Labs initiative; and NBA All Star and early-stage investor, Baron Davis. Global growth equity firm 3L led the round.</p>
<p>Fun fact: founder Alex Israel sold his last company, ParkMe, to Inrix back in 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Recogni Inc</strong>., a startup that is developing an AI-powered vision recognition module for autonomous vehicles, raised $48.9 million in Series B funding round. Investors included BMW i Ventures, Toyota AI Ventures, and existing investors, along with Robert Bosch Venture Capital and Continental.</p>
<p><strong>Super73</strong>, the direct-to-consumer electric bike startup, raised $20 million Volition Capital. The Southern California-based company plans to use the capital to hire more staff, improve customer service operation and expand its product portfolio,<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22278760/super73-ebike-moped-minibike-investment-amount"> The Verge reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Volkswagen</strong> is weighing the possibility of spinning out its Porsche unit, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-18/volkswagen-is-said-to-weigh-listing-of-porsche-sports-car-brand?srnd=deals&amp;sref=gni836kR">Bloomberg reported</a>. The company is reportedly meeting with<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> advisers to evaluate a potential initial public offering or spinoff of the sports car brand.</span></p>
<p><strong>Volta Energy Technologies</strong>, the energy investment and advisory services firm, closed on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/volta-energy-technologies-raises-over-90m-of-a-targeted-150m-fund-to-back-energy-storage-startups/">nearly $90 million</a> of a targeted $150 million investment fund, according to people familiar with the group&#8217;s plans. The venture investment vehicle complements a $180 million existing commitment from Volta&#8217;s four corporate backers, Equinor, Albermarle, Epsilon and Hanon Systems.</p>
<h2>Investor survey 2021</h2>
<p>Once a year, I like to reach out to investors and ask them a bunch of questions in an effort to understand where they&#8217;re putting their capital, identify emerging trends and get a general sense of where the industry, and its many sub sectors, are heading.</p>
<p>I surveyed 10 investors this time around and published the results in our subscription product Extra Crunch, where there will be a lot more transportation analysis in 2021. I encourage you to subscribe. In the meantime, here&#8217;s taste of what a handful (not all 10) had to say when I asked this:</p>
<p><strong>What are the overlooked areas that you want to invest in, now that legacy automakers are shifting their portfolios to electric and new EV manufacturers are preparing to start production?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Clara Brenner, Urban Innovation Fund co-founder/managing partner </strong>: We are very interested in the emerging fleet management space — and this is reflected in a number of our recent investments, including Electriphi (software to help fleets transition to electric) and Kyte (activating underutilized fleets to deliver a magical car rental experience). There are so many efficiencies that come from the fleet model for transportation — we think this will be an increasingly important area in the coming years.</p>
<p><strong>Dave Clark, partner at Expa</strong>: Don’t give the incumbents too much credit. As technology becomes commoditized we’ll see new competitors push their way into the market, especially around new designs more suitable to an autonomous and shared system.</p>
<p>A few specific examples for your readers: EVs are approaching price parity with gas-powered cars with the improvements to carbon-neutral/negative-emission tech, energy storage, microgrids and battery tech. We’re about to see drone infrastructure and service business models scale as we approach an inflection point in consumer adoption and industry regulation.</p>
<p>Finally, as autonomous vehicle tech approaches commoditization, there will be plenty of opportunities in the software layers that optimize routes and orchestrate resources across supply chains.</p>
<p><strong>Abhijit Ganguly, senior manager at Goodyear Ventures</strong>: The secular trend toward electrification presents opportunities to OEMs, Tier 1 vendors and aftermarket participants alike. We continue to see opportunities in EV fleet management, aftermarket solutions for improving uptime, and reducing cost of operations and supportive infrastructure development (software and hardware) for easy deployment. Envoy, a Goodyear Ventures portfolio company, is capitalizing on these opportunities through its shared mobility EV platform.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel Holt, co-founder/general partner at Construct Capital</strong>: We invested in a really interesting company building the software operating layer to help EV hardware manufacturers “connect;” the software layer of EV is going to be a very interesting space.</p>
<p><strong>Sasha Ostojic, Playground Global operating partner</strong>: There seems to be an overlooked opportunity with consumer automotive apps. We have apps to manage our homes (cameras, speakers, sensors, etc.) so it’s only natural that our cars should join that ecosystem. At first it will be OEM-specific apps (like the Tesla app or the terrible GM app), but I expect an evolution of open APIs where you can add any car to your “garage” (like adding a device to Google Home).</p>
<p><strong>Sebastian Peck, InMotion Ventures&#8217;s managing director</strong>: I think the market may not have fully appreciated the vast potential of connected vehicle data yet, in part because that data is currently still hard to access for developers. We see more OEMs making APIs available in 2021 and we expect this will become a very dynamic space with a lot of innovation benefitting consumers and commercial fleet managers.</p>

<h2>Commission on Future Mobility Q&amp;A</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://futuremobilitycommission.org/">Commission on the Future of Mobility</a> is a new global coalition of business, industry, technology and policy leaders with a gigantic mission. The organization recently announced a slew of appointments to its board, notably Mary Nichols, the former chair of the California Air Resources Board and Jim Farley, president and CEO of Ford Motor Co. Other commissioners include, Ola Cabs Chairman Bhavish Aggarwal, Valeo Chairman and CEO Jacques Aschenbroich and Avinash Rugoobur, who is president of Arrival.</p>
<p>I thought it was time to learn more and so I reached out and had a chat with Alisyn Malek, the organization&#8217;s executive director and the former COO and co-founder of May Mobility.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an edited version of our conversation.</p>
<p><strong>ME</strong>: It says here that the ultimate objective of the commission is to recommend a framework for regulations in the American, European, and Asian markets that reflects and facilitates the technological transformation taking place. That&#8217;s a lot.</p>
<p><strong>MALEK</strong>: It&#8217;s a big goal. (laughs)</p>
<p><strong>ME</strong>: Why take a global approach to this?</p>
<p><strong>MALEK</strong>: We think it&#8217;s really important to take a global approach because that allows you to be open to more options of what solutions could look like. If we were only looking at a specific region — yes, it&#8217;s a little bit easier in terms of what you need to focus on and the problems that you need to solve — but we also worried that it would limit us. By taking this global approach, we think it really creates the opportunity to take the best of what everybody is trying to do and put those out as options for people to really understand what the future could look like.</p>
<p><strong>ME</strong>: Will this framework acknowledge that each region has its own demographics and nuances and cultural behaviors and infrastructure?</p>
<p><strong>MALEK</strong>: We realize that there&#8217;s not going to be a one-size-fits-all solution, so our hope is to be able to put together a compelling vision and create options that different policymakers can select from and better understand the trade offs between them.</p>
<p><strong>ME</strong>: The CFM emphasizes that its results are going to be based on data methodologies. Can you explain exactly the type of hard data that&#8217;s going to be used.</p>
<p><strong>MALEK</strong>: We recognize that a lot of work has been done in these spaces before, so we will be looking at the current literature and working to add some new information and insight. We do think that there are areas where data needs to be collected.</p>
<p>For example, the changes in freight and the rise of e-commerce through the pandemic. That may be an area where we go in and try to understand a new data set. I don&#8217;t know that we would be outfitting vehicles to take that type of data — we&#8217;ll be looking for for existing data to feed our studies. That&#8217;s an area that is just so new that there really isn&#8217;t going to be a lot out there, so I think that&#8217;s a place where we may be substantially additive in the data perspective.</p>
<p><strong>ME</strong>: Why does the transportation world need another commission?</p>
<p><strong>MALEK</strong>: When we think about all of the commissions in mobility that exist today — and there are many — they are either focused on the advocacy of a specific topic or are interested in doing the research and adding to the knowledge base, but not necessarily carrying that through to advocacy to help drive change.</p>
<p>A big part of how the Commission on the Future of Mobility is different is the fact that is bringing together industry leaders across the movement of people and goods so we can hash out the hard questions internally as we work on our proposals and then bring those to an advocacy stage and help drive that change.</p>
<h2>One AI thing</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2114880" style="width: 1610px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/levandowski-church-AI-1-1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114880" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2114880 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/levandowski-church-AI-1-1.gif" alt="levandowski-church-AI-" width="1600" height="900" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2114880" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bryce Durbin</p></div></p>
<p>Finally, I have to share my article about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/anthony-levandowski-closes-his-church-of-ai/">Anthony Levandowski</a>, the former Google engineer who avoided an 18-month prison sentence after receiving a presidential pardon last month.</p>
<p>I learned (and reported) that Levandowski has officially closed the church he created to understand and accept a godhead based on artificial intelligence. The church, called Way of the Future, sparked interest and controversy &#8212; much like Levandowski himself &#8212; from the moment it became public in a November 2017 article in Wired.</p>
<p>But as I noted in my article, it wasn&#8217;t just the formation of the church or its purpose that caused a stir in Silicon Valley and the broader tech industry. The church&#8217;s public reveal occurred as Levandowski was steeped in a legal dispute with his former employer Google. He had also become the central figure of a trade secrets lawsuit between Waymo, the former Google self-driving project that is now a business under Alphabet, and Uber.</p>
<p>Levandowski dissolved the church at the end of the year. However, the process had started months before in June 2020, documents filed with the state of California show. The entirety of the church&#8217;s funds &#8212; exactly $175,172 &#8212; were donated to the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund.</p>
<p>I did talk to Levandowski and while he didn&#8217;t get too deep into &#8220;why&#8221; he closed WOTF, he did say that he still believes in its premise. He believes that artificial intelligence will fundamentally change how people live and work and that it can be positive for society. He noted that is not guaranteed. Even without Way of the Future, Levandowski said he&#8217;s focused on making that happen.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>This is Equity Monday, our weekly kickoff that tracks the latest private market news, talks about the coming week, digs into some recent funding rounds and mulls over a larger theme or narrative from the private markets. You can follow the show on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/equitypod">here</a> and myself <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">here</a> — and be sure to check out our last main ep, in which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/equity-monday-the-electric-car-boom-tech-regulation-and-some-sad-american-vc-data/">Natasha coins a slogan for a16z that I both hate, and became the headline of the show</a>!</p>
<p>But enough of all of that, we have a lot to get through this morning. Here&#8217;s what we talked about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Weekend:</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/danprimack/status/1362902732986867713">Coinbase at $100 billion</a>? More on that to come. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/restaurant-software-provider-toast-prepares-205100823.html">Toast is going public</a>! Probably! Wait Toast the company that laid off staff last year? Yep that Toast! It&#8217;s not toast! And <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-internet-loans-china-banks-idUSKBN2AK0F2">new rules</a> on online lending in China.</li>
<li><strong>This Morning:</strong> Oscar Health put together <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1568651/000119312521049832/d28906ds1a.htm">an IPO price range</a> that is <em>interesting</em>, and Apex Clearing is <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210222005281/en/Leading-Fintech-Apex-Clearing-Holdings-to-List-on-NYSE-Through-Merger-With-Northern-Star-Investment-Corp.-II">going public via a SPAC</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Funding Rounds:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/gophr/">Gophr raises money</a>! <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/ageras-nabs-73m-at-a-244m-valuation-for-its-accountancy-marketplace-and-bookkeeping-tech-stack/">Ageras Group raises money</a>! <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/with-20m-a-round-promise-brings-financial-flexibility-to-outdated-government-and-utility-payment-systems/">Promise raises money</a>! It was hard to pick just three, but each of those rounds has something notable about it. Enjoy!</li>
<li><strong>Deeper Dive/Riff: </strong>If the public markets will float even the most leaden of startup via a SPAC-balloon, any late-stage startup that doesn&#8217;t take the ride out of the private markets must either be perfect or too heavy to lift. And if it&#8217;s the second, we can write it off? Maybe?</li>
</ul>
<p>And, finally, this is precisely <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1363849196193857538">what I feel like</a> this Monday morning. Chat soon and stay safe!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://t.co/wK2y740EcS?amp=1">Creatio</a>, a Boston-based software company, announced that it has raised $68 million. <a href="https://www.volitioncapital.com/">Volition Capital</a>, a growth-equity fund, led the round. The deal was a minority investment in the startup.</p>
<p>The deal is notable not merely thanks to its sheer size, but because up until today Creatio had bootstrapped. That&#8217;s according to founder and CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/k_kostereva">Katherine Kostereva</a>, with whom TechCrunch caught up with last week regarding the investment.</p>
<p>Per Kostereva, her company&#8217;s low-code platform helps other companies automate business processes. Creatio&#8217;s competitive edge, she said, comes in part from how quickly it can help companies automate; the faster that companies can get from a low-code platform to live apps matters.</p>
<p>Creatio also has a genre-focus, namely that it touts its platform&#8217;s ability to help automate work in the CRM space &#8212; think marketing and sales-related tasks. But its crowning &#8220;jewel,&#8221; Kostereva said, is Creatio&#8217;s underlying low-code automation platform.</p>
<p>The low-code world that Creatio competes in is a broad space that is seeing active investment from the very-early to the very-late stage. For example, last month TechCrunch covered no-code focused <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/stacker-raises-1-7m-to-help-nocoders-build-apps-from-spreadsheets/">Stacker&#8217;s $1.7 million round</a>. And earlier this month TechCrunch wrote about low-code focused <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/low-code-focused-outsystems-raises-150m-at-a-9-5b-valuation/">OutSystems&#8217; $150 million raise at a $9.5 billion valuation</a>.</p>
<p>To see another low-code company raise a big check was therefore not too surprising.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TRVD2gOX2W"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/22/five-vcs-talk-about-how-no-code-is-going-horizontal-across-the-worlds-industries/">Five VCs discuss how no-code is going horizontal across the world’s industries</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Five VCs discuss how no-code is going horizontal across the world’s industries&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/22/five-vcs-talk-about-how-no-code-is-going-horizontal-across-the-worlds-industries/embed/#?secret=TRVD2gOX2W" data-secret="TRVD2gOX2W" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>TechCrunch was curious where the company and its founder came down on the concept of low-code versus no-code, a topic that is always good to ask players in either space. Kostereva highlighted the importance of citizen developers, folks who can use drag-and-drop interfaces to create apps but who are less adept with code. But she added that with today&#8217;s no-code tools one can only build simple things. Creatio, she continued, is more focused on the mid-market and enterprise. As such, it&#8217;s just not possible for Creatio to go no-code today. But, her view did appear to be that citizen devs should be able to do more and more in time without code.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fair perspective, and an encouraging one. The more that folks can do sans code, the more power that can shift into the hands of business orgs that traditionally had to depend on other departments for dev lift.</p>
<p>Back to the money side of things, Creatio has historically targeted breakeven financial results per its CEO. That means it reinvested in itself as it grew, an arrangement that made us was curious as to why the company would raise capital now; why change up a working formula?</p>
<p>In short the company was getting itself ready for to accelerate, according to its founder. Kostereva said that she wanted Creatio to have &#8220;world class&#8221; numbers for metrics like net retention, revenue growth, and net promoter score before it took on external funds.</p>
<p>Was the wait worth it? The company&#8217;s net retention was 122% last year, and its NPS score is 34, she disclosed. On the growth side of things, Kostereva said that her company started off doubling and tripling and is still close to doubling. Our read of her comments is that Creatio is probably growing its ARR in the high double-digits today.</p>
<p>The company wants to use its capital to invest in sales-and-marketing to help spread the the word about its business, invest in its partner program, a key growth mechanism, and R&amp;D, it said. So, a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has recently noticed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/rapid-growth-in-2020-reveals-okr-software-markets-untapped-potential/">just how big the software world really is</a>, indexing off the fast that there is enough room for a host of OKR-focused startups to grow and raise external capital without weeding weaker players out. Given how many businesses processes there are in the world to automate, it may be that Creatio and other low-code platforms that want to help other companies accelerate will enjoy similar market dynamics. Investors, at least, are betting like that&#8217;s the case.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As live audio chat app Clubhouse ascends in popularity around the world, concerns about its data practices also grow.</p>
<p>The app is currently only available on iOS, so some developers set out in a race to create Android, Windows and Mac versions of the service. While these endeavors may not be ill-intentioned, the fact that it takes programmers little effort to reverse engineer and fork Clubhouse &#8212; that is, when developers create new software based on its original code &#8212; is sounding an alarm about the app&#8217;s security.</p>
<p>The common goal of these unofficial apps, as of now, is to broadcast Clubhouse audio feeds in real-time to users who cannot access the app otherwise because they don&#8217;t have an iPhone. One such effort is called <a href="https://opench.aix.uy/">Open Clubhouse</a>, which describes itself as a &#8220;third-party web application based on flask to play Clubhouse audio.&#8221; The developer confirmed to TechCrunch that Clubhouse blocked its service five days after its launch without providing an explanation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;[Clubhouse] asks a lot of information from users, analyzes those data and even abuses them. Meanwhile, it restricts how people use the app and fails to give them the rights they deserve. To me, this constitutes monopoly or exploitation,&#8221; said Open Clubhouse&#8217;s developer nicknamed AiX.</p>
<p>Clubhouse cannot be immediately reached for comment on this story.</p>
<p>AiX wrote the program &#8220;for fun&#8221; and wanted it to broaden Clubhouse&#8217;s access to more people. Another similar effort came from a developer named Zhuowei Zhang, who created <a href="https://hipster.house/login.html">Hipster House</a> to let those without an invite browse rooms and users, and those with an invite to join rooms as a listener though they can&#8217;t speak &#8212; Clubhouse is invite-only at the moment. Zhang<a href="https://twitter.com/zhuowei/status/1363644865742004226?s=21"> stopped developing</a> the project, however, after noticing a better alternative.</p>
<p>These third-party services, despite their innocuous intentions, can be exploited for surveillance purposes, as Jane Manchun Wong, a researcher known for uncovering upcoming features in popular apps through reverse engineering, <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1359957073841197057">noted</a> in a tweet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if the intent of that webpage is to bring Clubhouse to non-iOS users, without a safeguard, it could be abused,&#8221; said Wong, referring to a website rerouting audio data from Clubhouse&#8217;s public rooms.</p>
<p>Clubhouse lets people create public chat rooms, which are available to any user who joins before a room reaches its maximum capacity, and private rooms, which are only accessible to room hosts and users authorized by the hosts.</p>
<p>But not all users are aware of the open nature of Clubhouse&#8217;s public rooms. During its brief window of availability in China, the app was flooded with mainland Chinese debating politically sensitive issues from Taiwan to Xinjiang, which are heavily censored in the Chinese cybserspace. Some vigilant Chinese users speculated the possibility of being questioned by the police for delivering sensitive remarks. While no such event has been publicly reported, the Chinese authorities have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/clubhouse-is-now-blocked-in-china-after-a-brief-uncensored-period/">banned</a> the app since February 8.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Fv2Km3KTLT"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/clubhouse-is-now-blocked-in-china-after-a-brief-uncensored-period/">Clubhouse is now blocked in China after a brief uncensored period</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clubhouse is now blocked in China after a brief uncensored period&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/clubhouse-is-now-blocked-in-china-after-a-brief-uncensored-period/embed/#?secret=Fv2Km3KTLT" data-secret="Fv2Km3KTLT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Clubhouse&#8217;s design is by nature at odds with the state of communication it aims to achieve. The app encourages people to use their real identity &#8212; registration requires a phone number and an existing user&#8217;s invite. Inside a room, everyone can see who else is there. This setup instills trust and comfort in users when they speak as if speaking at a networking event.</p>
<p>But the third-party apps that are able to extract Clubhouse&#8217;s audio feeds show that the app isn&#8217;t even semi-public: It&#8217;s public.</p>
<p>More troublesome is that users can &#8220;ghost listen,&#8221; as developer Zerforschung <a href="https://zerforschung.org/posts/clubhouse-endless-audio-fun-en/">found</a>. That is, users can hear a room&#8217;s conversation without having their profile displayed to the room participants. Eavesdropping is made possible by establishing communication directly with Agora, a service provider employed by Clubhouse. As multiple security researchers found, Clubhouse relies on Agora&#8217;s real-time audio communication technology. Sources have also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/will-the-clubhouse-model-work-in-china/">confirmed</a> the partnership with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Some technical explanation is needed here. When a user joins a chatroom on Clubhouse, it makes a request to Agora&#8217;s infrastructure, as the <a href="https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/news/clubhouse-china#access">Stanford Internet Observatory</a> discovered. To make the request, the user’s phone contacts Clubhouse’s application programming interface (API), which then creates &#8220;tokens&#8221;, the basic building block in programming that authenticates an action, to establish a communication pathway for the app&#8217;s audio traffic.</p>
<p>Now, the problem is there can be a disconnect between Clubhouse and Agora, allowing the Clubhouse end, which manages user profiles, to be inactive while the Agora end, which transmits audio data, remains active, as technology analyst Daniel Sinclair <a href="https://twitter.com/_DanielSinclair/status/1363738761339826177">noted</a>. That&#8217;s why users can continue to eavesdrop on a room without having their profile displayed to the room&#8217;s participants.</p>
<p>The Agora partnership has sparked other forms of worries. The company, which operates mainly from the U.S. and China, noted in its IPO <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1802883/000162828020009726/agoraf-1a2.htm">prospectus</a> that its data may be subject to China&#8217;s cybersecurity law, which requires network operators in China to assist police investigations. That possibility, as the Stanford Internet Observatory points out, is contingent on whether Clubhouse stores its data in China.</p>
<p>While the Clubhouse API is banned in China, the Agora API appears unblocked. Tests by TechCrunch find that users currently need a VPN to join a room, an action managed by Clubhouse, but can listen to the room conversation, which is facilitated by Agora, with the VPN off. What&#8217;s the safest way for China-based users to access the app, given the official attitude is that it should not exist? It&#8217;s also worth noting that the app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/will-the-clubhouse-model-work-in-china/">was not available on the Chinese App Store</a> even before its ban, and Chinese users had downloaded the app through workarounds.</p>
<p>The Clubhouse team may be overwhelmed by data questions in the past few days, but these early observations from researchers and hackers may urge it to fix its vulnerabilities sooner, paving its way to grow beyond its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/will-the-clubhouse-model-work-in-china/">several million loyal users</a> and<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/clubhouse-gets-investment-interest-at-1-billion-valuation"> $1 billion valuation mark</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After online dating&#8217;s tremendous 2020 growth that culminated in last week&#8217;s epic Bumble IPO, a new entrant has tossed its hat into the dating app ring.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesnackapp.com/">Snack</a>, founded by Kimberly Kaplan, looks to merge the popularity and format of TikTok with the dating world. Kaplan hails from Plenty of Fish, where she was one of the earliest employees at the dating site. She led product, marketing and revenue and was on the executive team that eventually sold PoF to Match Group for $575 million in 2015.</p>
<p>Kaplan said that she noticed a specific user behavior among folks using dating apps, particularly the coveted Gen Z demographic. Essentially, folks would match on Bumble or Tinder and immediately move the connection over to apps like Snap and Instagram, where they would watch each others&#8217; stories and more casually flirt, rather than carrying on in a more high-pressure DM conversation on the dating apps.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Around the same time, TikTok surged in popularity, showing a shift in the average consumer&#8217;s attitude toward creating short-form video on the web.</p>
<p>Snack is a video-first dating app that asks users to create a video and post it to a feed. Other users can scroll through a feed (a la Instagram) rather than swipe right or left on individual profiles, and when someone likes a video, it opens up the ability to comment. Once two users have liked each others&#8217; videos, DMs are open.</p>
<p>The app is still in its early days, so there is no location filtering yet to ensure that everyone who joins the app has a full feed of videos to browse through. Kaplan said that Snack is also working on video editing features similar to that of TikTok to let people get super creative with their profiles.</p>
<p>Thus far, Snack has received $3.5 million in funding, led by Kindred Ventures and Coelius Capital, with participation by Golden Ventures, Garage Capital, Panache Ventures and N49P.</p>
<p>Though we&#8217;re still a ways away from monetization, Kaplan says her experience in the dating space should be beneficial when looking to generate revenue at Snack, and that the startup will likely follow the same playbook as other dating apps, employing premium subscriptions and potentially ads.</p>
<p>There are 10 people on the Snack team, and Kaplan says that the team is 60 percent diverse with 40 percent of employees being visible minorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest challenge is going up against big players that have a lot of capital,&#8221; said Kaplan. &#8220;Starting out is hard and getting that initial foothold is hard. I fundamentally believe in our product and I see this open opportunity in the market. I very much believe someone will come in and usurp Tinder, and it&#8217;s going to be around video.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Many enterprise software startups at some point have faced the invisible wall. For months, your sales team has done everything right. They’ve met with a prospect several times, provided them with demos, free trials, documentation and references, and perhaps even signed a provisional contract.</p>
<p>The stars are all aligned and then, suddenly, the deal falls apart. Someone has put the kibosh on the entire project. Who is this deal-blocker and what can software companies do to identify, support and convince this person to move forward with a contract?</p>
<p>I call this person the Chief Objection Officer.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Who is this deal-blocker and what can software companies do to identify, support and convince this person to move forward with a contract?					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Most software companies spend a lot of time and effort identifying their potential buyers and champions within an organization. They build personas and do targeted marketing to these individuals and then fine-tune their products to meet their needs. These targets may be VPs of engineering, data leaders, CTOs, CISOs, CMOs or anyone else with decision-making authority. But what most software companies neglect to do during this exploratory phase is to identify the person who may block the entire deal.</p>
<p>This person is the anti-champion with the power to scuttle a potential partnership. Like your potential deal-makers, these deal-breakers can have any title with decision-making power. Chief Objection Officers aren’t simply potential buyers who end up deciding your product is not the right fit, but are instead blockers-in-chief who can make departmentwide or companywide decisions. Thus, it’s critical for software companies to identify the Chief Objection Officers that might block deals and, then, address their concerns.</p>
<p>So how do you identify the Chief Objection Officer? The trick is to figure out the main pain points that arise for companies when considering deploying your solution, and then walk backward to figure out which person these challenges impact the most. Here are some common pain points that your potential customers may face when considering your product.</p>
<p>Change is hard. Never underestimate the power of the status quo. Does implementing your product in one part of an organization, such as IT, force another department, such as HR, to change how they do their daily jobs?</p>
<p>Think about which leaders will be most reluctant to make changes; these Chief Objection Officers will likely not be your buyers, but instead the heads of departments most impacted by the implementation of your software. For example, a marketing team may love the ad targeting platform they use and thus a CMO will balk at new database software that would limit or change the way customer segment data is collected. Or field sales would object to new security infrastructure software that makes it harder for them to access the company network from their phones. The head of the department that will bear the brunt of change will often be a Chief Objection Officer.</p>
<h2>Is someone&#8217;s job on the line?</h2>
<p>Another common pain point when deploying a new software solution is that one or more jobs may become obsolete once it’s up and running. Perhaps your software streamlines and outsources most of a company’s accounts payable processes. Maybe your SaaS solution will replace an on-premise homegrown one that a team of developers has built and nurtured for years.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nanit&#8217;s nursery camera pairs computer vision with specially-patterned clothing to help answer the question that most new parents ask themselves roughly every 90 seconds: &#8220;Is my baby still breathing?&#8221;</p>
<p>This morning the company is announcing that it has raised an additional $25 million in a Series C round led by GV.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, GV&#8217;s Frederique Dame will join Nanit&#8217;s Board of Directors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company raises this Series C on the momentum of a strong year. While declining to share exactly how many cameras the company had sold to date, Nanit CEO Sarah Dorsett tells me that camera sales were up 130% in 2020 versus 2019.</p>
<p>Earlier this month Nanit debuted the Nanit Pro, an upgraded model ($299 vs $249 for the Nanit Plus) that increases the camera&#8217;s resolution while improving things like the built-in night light and overall usability. It also launched a line of &#8220;smart sheets&#8221; complete with a custom black-and-white pattern the camera reads to help measure and record your baby&#8217;s height between doctor visits.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/zDh_u9ULtFE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Dorsett tells me the company plans to expand its lineup into a broader ecosystem of nursery items, mentioning things like changing pads and nightlights as things &#8220;that exist today, but that [Nanit] could really amplify because of the app experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>This Series C brings Nanit&#8217;s total raised to $75M. While round-leader GV is a new investor here, it was backed by existing investors Jerusalem Venture Partners, RRE Ventures, Upfront Ventures, and Rho Capital Partners.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Retrofitting buildings to make them more energy efficient and better at withstanding climate change induced extreme weather is going to be a big, multi-billion dollar business. But it&#8217;s one that&#8217;s been hard for low-income communities to tap, thanks to obstacles ranging faulty incentive structures to an inability to adequately plan for which upgrades will be most effective in which buildings.</p>
<p>Enter BlocPower, a New York-based startup founded by a longtime advocate for energy efficiency and the job creation that comes with it, which has a novel solution for identifying, developing and profiting off of building upgrades in low income communities &#8212; all while supporting high-paying jobs for workers in the communities the company hopes to serve.</p>
<p>The company<a href="https://www.blocpower.io/"> also has managed to raise $63 million in equity and debt financing</a> to support its mission. That money is split between an $8 million investment from some of the country&#8217;s top venture firms and a $55 million debt facility structured in part by Goldman Sachs to finance the redevelopment projects that BlocPower is creating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These capital commitments aren&#8217;t charity. Government dollars are coming for the industry and private companies from healthcare providers, to utility companies, to real estate developers and property managers all have a vested interest in seeing this market succeed.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s going to be over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/new-stimulus-bill-includes-35-2-billion-for-new-energy-initiatives/">$1 billion carved out for weatherization and building upgrades</a> in the stimulus package that&#8217;s still making its way through Congress</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="qK0zVoPCre"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/new-stimulus-bill-includes-35-2-billion-for-new-energy-initiatives/">New stimulus bill includes $35.2 billion for new energy initiatives</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;New stimulus bill includes $35.2 billion for new energy initiatives&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/new-stimulus-bill-includes-35-2-billion-for-new-energy-initiatives/embed/#?secret=qK0zVoPCre" data-secret="qK0zVoPCre" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For BlocPower&#8217;s founder, Donnel Baird, the issue of seeing buildings revitalized and good high-paying jobs coming into local communities isn&#8217;t academic. Baird was born in Brooklyn&#8217;s Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood and witnessed firsthand the violence and joblessness that was ripping the fabric of that rich and vibrant community apart during the crack epidemic and economic decline of the 1980s and early 90s.</p>
<p>Seeing that violence firsthand, including a shooting on his way to school, instilled in Baird a desire to &#8220;create jobs for disconnected Black and brown people&#8221; so they would never feel the hopelessness and lack of opportunity that fosters cycles of violence.</p>
<p>Some time after the shooting, Baird&#8217;s family relocated from Brooklyn to Stone Mountain, Georgia, and after graduating from Duke University, Baird became a climate activist and community organizer, with a focus on green jobs. That led to a role in the presidential campaign for Barack Obama and an offer to work in Washington on Obama&#8217;s staff.</p>
<p>Baird declined the opportunity, but did take on a role reaching out to communities and unions to help implement the first stimulus package that Obama and Biden put together to promote green jobs.</p>
<p>And it was while watching the benefits of that stimulus collapse under the weight of a fragmented building industry that Baird came up with the idea for BlocPower.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was all about the implementation challenges that we ran into,&#8221; Baird said. &#8220;If you have ten buildings on a block in Oakland and they were all built by the same developer at the same time. If you rebuild those buildings and you retrofit all of those buildings, in five of those buildings you&#8217;re going to trap carbon monoxide in and kill everybody and in the other five buildings you&#8217;re going to have a reduction in emissions and energy savings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before conducting any retrofits to capture energy savings (and health savings, but more on that later), Baird says developers need to figure out the potential for asbestos contamination in the building; understand the current heating, ventilation, and cooling systems that the building uses; and get an assessment of what actually needs to be done.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the core problem that Baird says BlocPower solves. The company has developed software to analyze a building&#8217;s construction by creating a virtual twin based on blueprints and public records. Using that digital twin the company can identify what upgrades a building needs. Then the company taps lines of credit to work with building owners to manage the retrofits and capture the value of the energy savings and carbon offsets associated with the building upgrades.</p>
<p>For BlocPower to work, the financing piece is just as important as the software. Without getting banks to sign off on loans to make the upgrades, all of those dollars from the federal government remain locked up. &#8220;That&#8217;s why the $7 billion earmarked for investment in green buildings did not work,&#8221; Baird said. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">At BlocPower our view is that we could build software to simulate using government records… we could simulate enough about the mechanicals, electrical, and plumbing across buildings in NYC so that we could avoid that cost.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Along with co-founder Morris Cox, Baird built BlocPower while at Columbia University&#8217;s business school so that he could solve the technical problems and overcome the hurdles for community financing of renewable retrofit projects.</p>
<p>Right before his graduation, in 2014, the company had applied for a contract to do energy efficiency retrofits and was set to receive financing from the Department of Energy. The finalists had to go down to the White House and pitch the President. That pitch was scheduled for the same day as a key final exam for one of Baird&#8217;s Columbia classes, which the professor said was mandatory. Baird skipped the test and won the pitch, but failed the class.</p>
<p>After that it was off to Silicon Valley to pitch the business. Baird met with 200 or more investors who rejected his pitch. Many of these investors had been burned in the first cleantech bubble or had witnessed the fiery conflagrations that engulfed firms that did back cleantech businesses and swore they&#8217;d never make the same mistakes.</p>
<p>That was the initial position at Andreessen Horowitz when Baird pitched them, he said. &#8220;When I went to Andreessen Horowitz, they said &#8216;Our policy is no cleantech whatsoever. You need to figure out how software is going to eat up this energy efficiency market&#8217;,&#8221; Baird recalled.</p>
<p>Working with Mitch Kapor, an investor and advisor, Baird worked on the pitch and got Kapor to talk to Ben Horowitz. Both men agreed to invest and BlocPower was off to the races.</p>
<p>The company has completed retrofits in over 1,000 buildings since its launch, Baird said, mainly to prove out its thesis. Now, with the revolving credit facility in hand, BlocPower can take bigger bites out of the market. That includes a contract with utility companies in New York that will pay $30 million if the company can complete its retrofits and verify the energy savings from that work.</p>
<p>There are also early projects underway in Oakland and Chicago, Baird said.</p>
<p>Building retrofits do more than just provide energy savings, as Goldman Sachs managing director Margaret Anadu noted in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;BlocPower is proving that it is possible to have commercial solutions that improve public health in underserved communities, create quality jobs and lower carbon emissions,&#8221; Anadu said. &#8220;We are so proud to have supported Donnel and his team&#8230;through both equity and debt capital to further expand their reach.&#8221;</p>
<p>These benefits also have potential additional revenue streams associated with them that BlocPower can also capture, according to investor and director, Mitch Kapor.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are significant linkages that are known between buildings and pollution that are a public health issue. In a number of geographies community hospitals are under a mandate to improve health outcomes and BlocPower can get paid from health outcomes associated with the reduction in carbon. That could be a new revenue stream and a financing mechanism,&#8221; Kapor said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of work to be done in essentially taking the value creation engine they have and figuring out where to bring it and which other engines they need to have to have the maximum social impact.&#8221;</p>
<p>Social impact is something that both Kapor and Baird talk about extensively and Baird sees the creation of green jobs as an engine for social justice &#8212; and one that can reunite a lot of working class voters whose alliances were fractured by the previous administration. Baird also believes that putting people to work is the best argument for climate change policies that have met with resistance among many union workers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We will not be able to pass shit unless workers and people of color are on board to force the U.S. senate to pass climate change policy,&#8221; Baird said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have to pass the legislation that’s going to facilitate green infrastructure in a massive way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pointed to the project in Oakland as an example of how climate policies can create jobs and incentivize political action. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In Oakland we’re doing a pilot project in 12 low income buildings in oakland. I sent them $20K to train these workers from local people of color in Oakland… they are being put to work in Oakland,&#8221; Baird said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the model for how this gets built. So now we need them to call Chuck Shumer to push him to the left on green building legislation.&#8221;</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix today is launching a new feature that aims to bring more offline content to users who opt in automatic downloads. With &#8220;Downloads for You&#8221; enabled, the Netflix app will download recommended TV shows and movies to your mobile device based on your tastes, as determined by your Netflix watch history.</p>
<p>After turning on the feature for the first time, you&#8217;ll be able to select the amount of storage space you want to dedicate to saving these recommended downloads on your device: either 1GB, 3GB, or 5GB. The downloads will then take place when you&#8217;re connected to a Wi-Fi network, and will contain a mix of recommendations that Netflix believes you&#8217;ll like. Typically, the app will download the first few episodes of a TV show &#8212; enough to get you started.</p>
<p>You can also cast the downloaded content to a nearby TV, where it will stream directly from your phone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After you&#8217;ve watched the episodes or movies, you can delete them from the device to free up more storage space for the next time you&#8217;re connected to WiFi.</p>
<p>Netflix notes its full catalog is available for download, not just its own original content. However, there will be some titles with download limitations due to licensing restrictions.</p>

<p>The feature is an addition, not a replacement for Netflix&#8217;s existing offline access feature known as Smart Downloads. First launched in 2018 before <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/downloading-on-netflix-just-got-smarter-1">becoming</a> globally available, Smart Downloads allows users to pick which shows or movies they want to save for offline viewing.</p>
<p>Netflix says it began testing Downloads for You in late 2020, but is today making the feature available to all users worldwide, initially on Android. A version for iOS is in the works and will arrive later this year.</p>
<p>Offline downloads can make sense for those who are traveling &#8212; for example, by plane or underground train, where internet access is not a given. But it also makes sense for users in emerging markets, where access to a reliable cellular connection or bandwidth can be a concern.</p>
<p>During tests, Netflix notes it saw high usage of the feature in the U.S. But it considers the emerging market use case &#8212; where Android devices are more heavily used and connections are often unreliable &#8212; to be of particular importance. This especially true for countries like India and Brazil, and elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re excited to introduce Downloads for You. People who choose this new feature will have shows or movies automatically downloaded to their devices, with recommendations based on their tastes,&#8221; said Patrick Flemming, Netflix&#8217;s Director of Product Innovation, in a statement. &#8220;We want to make discovering your next new favorite series or film even easier, whether you’re connected or not.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">David Baga is going to be getting a new paycheck, which is fitting all things considered.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.even.com">Even</a>, an “on-demand pay” startup that ‘evens’ out paychecks for workers to give them financial stability and flexibility, will announce later this morning that Baga is joining the company as its new CEO effective March 1, replacing co-founder and current CEO Jon Schlossberg. Schlossberg will remain full-time at the company as executive chairman.</p>
<p>Baga was most recently at Lightspeed Venture Partners, the prominent VC firm which he joined in late 2019 as chief operating officer. Prior to Lightspeed, Baga was chief business officer at Lyft and chief revenue officer at RocketLawyer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even was founded in 2014 by Schlossberg and a coterie of other co-founders focused on a mission of disrupting the payday loan industry with better tools for workers who increasingly live paycheck-to-paycheck. Workers who get dropped from a shift, for instance, often have to scramble to meet their upcoming financial obligations, forcing them to take usurious payday loans. Even’s product was designed to give workers better visibility and more control over their paycheck, offering tools like <a href="https://www.even.com/platform/product">Instapay</a> that offers an advance on their already earned wages. Notably, Even <a href="https://www.even.com/platform/pricing">works on a subscription model</a> that is designed to align its incentives with its worker-users to avoid the predatory practices that plague the industry.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/19/even-raises-40m-to-transform-the-working-class-to-the-savings-class/">I last covered the company in 2018</a> when it raised a $40 million Series B from Keith Rabois, who was then at Khosla Ventures. Even has had significant traction, reaching 650,000 members today according to the company, and most notably, it has an extensive partnership with Walmart, which just <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-raises-wages-for-425000-store-associates-121301438.html">this week announced it was raising wages for 425,000 of its in-store associates</a>, or roughly a third of its workforce. Even said that 53% of its members use the product daily.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Even raises $40M to transform the working class to the savings class&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/19/even-raises-40m-to-transform-the-working-class-to-the-savings-class/embed/#?secret=NKzikouTyY" data-secret="NKzikouTyY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Schlossberg says that while the company has had significant success in building out a high-quality product, it needs to pivot to a greater focus on revenue growth. “I am a very product-minded CEO and what we needed in the zero-to-one phase,” he said, referencing the concept of reaching product-market fit. But, “I am not an enterprise-growth CEO. This opportunity and problem deserves someone who can massively increase the probability of making [Even] as ubiquitous as 401Ks.”</p>
<p>He said that the company began searching for a COO to add enterprise sales experience to the executive team, but came up empty-handed. “So we offered the top job to get better candidates, and it did and we found David,” he said.</p>
<p>For Baga, the Even story fits in with his own background. I “grew up around a lot of blue-collar, first-generation Canadians — I can relate to Even in a lot of [ways],” he said. He migrated down to the Valley during the dot-com bubble, taking on a variety of sales jobs at companies like Oracle. His first startup experience was at RocketLawyer when it was just 20 people. “RocketLawyer was about making legal services affordable to all Americans,” a mission that resonated with Baga.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2115661" style="width: 464px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115661" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2115661" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_1143.jpg?w=454" alt="" width="454" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_1143.jpg 667w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_1143.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_1143.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_1143.jpg?resize=454,680 454w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IMG_1143.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2115661" class="wp-caption-text">David Baga will join Even as CEO on March 1. Photo via Even.</p></div></p>
<p>From there, he said he eventually linked up with Logan Green and John Zimmer in 2012 when they were still operating Zimride, and would eventually join the rebranded company Lyft in 2015 when it was “thinking about a B2B version with large businesses.” He worked on enterprise and urban partnerships as well as Lyft Health, a rideshare product designed for non-emergency medical transportation.</p>
<p>Baga says that he wanted to stay at smaller orgs, and so as Lyft went public and grew to gargantuan size, he wanted to reset to a smaller company. He eventually landed at Lightspeed as the firm’s COO.</p>
<p>Baga demurred during our call to describe his time at Lightspeed or his reasoning for departing after a year and a half. Notably, Even is not a Lightspeed portfolio company. Instead, he connected with Schlossberg as Even was accelerating its CEO search and found that there was “strong values alignment” and that “they are addressing real pain points … but with a fair business model.”</p>
<p>In an email later, Baga stated that &#8220;It has been a privilege to work with Lightspeed Ventures and I will always be grateful for the opportunity to be a part of such a fantastic organization. At Lightspeed, I had a front row seat to entrepreneurs sharing their vision to change the world. They inspired me to heed the call to build again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taking the reins on March 1, Baga said that his top priorities are to “help the team to get to know me, to understand the customers and our prospects, and to understand the product roadmap and strategy.” Schlossberg said that Even already has “a roster of pretty marquee referenceable customers across verticals of employment” and that “now is the time to scale it.” As Baga transitions into the role, Schlossberg said that the company is likely to raise a Series C round “sometime this year.”</p>
<p>Precarity isn’t going away in America anytime soon, yet as the last year has shown, there are tools that can help more workers find resilience in the labor they do. Even’s hope is that a well-built machine to improve pay can be rapidly expanded to make a difference in this economy.</p>
<p><i>Updated February 22, 2021 to make clear that Instapay provides access to already-earned wages, not a pay advance on future earnings.</i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX is now in the business of flying people to space, and if all goes to plan, it&#8217;ll be the first to provide a trip for a crew made up entirely of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/spacex-is-aiming-to-fly-the-first-all-civilian-human-space-mission-by-the-end-of-2021/">private space tourists later this year</a>. Now, we know who will join billionaire and Shift4Payments founder Jason Isaacman on that trip – St. Jude Children&#8217;s Research Hospital employee, and former patient Hayley Arceneaux.</p>
<p>Arceneaux was already selected by Isaacman to be one of the four members of the crew for the mission aboard a SpaceX Dragon, which will include a flight to an unspecified orbit for a trip likely spanning a few days when it launches. The billionaire tipped that he &#8220;already knew&#8221; who he&#8217;d picked to represent St. Jude during a press call when the trip was originally announced earlier this year, but noted that he was saving the reveal.</p>
<p>Isaacman is running a months-long campaign around <a href="https://www.inspiration4.com">&#8216;Inspiration4,&#8217;</a> which is what he has named the flight. The remaining two seats will be given to winners chosen from two separate ongoing competitions: One pool includes anyone who makes a donation to St. Jude during the course of a fundraising campaign attached to the launch, and the other will be selected from entrepreneurs who build an online store on Shift4&#8217;s newly launched e-commerce platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

She&#8217;s record a number of firsts and records when she gets to space on the upcoming flight, including becoming the youngest American ever in space at just 29, and also becoming the first to enter space with a prosthetic in place – she has an artificial knee and a rod in her thighs bone due to the bone cancer she was treated for at St. Jude when she was 10.</p>
<p>Isaacman is footing the entire bill for the SpaceX launch – including covering the tax obligations of the other winners selected for the St. Jude seats on the mission. He has also committed to donating $100 million to the hospital from his own funds, in addition to whatever is raised through the public donation drive that will be used to select one of the other crew members.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://gophr.com">Gophr</a>, a U.K.-based last-mile delivery provider, has raised £4 million in funding, as it looks to invest in its product off the back of 300% revenue growth during the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Leading the round is pan-European B2B investor Nauta Capital. The company had previously raised £1 million in two rounds, including £500,000 from publicly-listed Auctus Alternative Investments.</p>
<p>Noteworthy, Gophr’s co-founder and CEO, Seb Robert, tells me the 2015-founded company reached monthly net profitability around 3 years ago and was net profitable for the whole of last year. Like other delivery companies, Gophr has benefited from a pandemic bump, but fortitude aside, is aiming to step on the gas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Gophr says it has completed over 2 million same-day deliveries to-date. Customers include leading consumer brands including HelloFresh, Boots, Co-Op and Selfridges. It claims 5,000 clients in total and operates in most U.K. cities.<br />
On being net profitable and in relation to raising new funding, Robert says he felt it was an important proof point to hit, recalling how, just a few years ago, bar a couple of huge successes, we saw “a generation of delivery startups go up in flames along with their investors cash”. They included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/19/london-based-on-demand-delivery-startup-jinn-shutters/">Jinn</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/04/valk-fleetingly/">Valk Fleet</a>, to name just two.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="DRQF0wvic6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/04/valk-fleetingly/">As Valk Fleet is put into administration, drivers claim to be unpaid and staff receive &#8216;death threats&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As Valk Fleet is put into administration, drivers claim to be unpaid and staff receive &#8216;death threats&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/04/valk-fleetingly/embed/#?secret=DRQF0wvic6" data-secret="DRQF0wvic6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“It was all very predictable to anyone who’d done their homework up front (I remember at the time DM’ing you specifically and naming the ones I thought would no longer be around in a year or two!) and as a result figured that a model that proved it could actually make money would have a better chance to raise going forward,” he says.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Robert notes that we are starting to see a renaissance in VC investment in the last-mile delivery space, but argues that, on the surface at least, these newer delivery startups are taking a similar approach to the previous generation.</p>
<p>“Getting a toothbrush to you in 15 minutes is great. But what do you do with the courier who’s now coming back empty handed? That takes time and it costs money. Only time will tell,” he says.</p>
<p>Though Robert doesn’t say it, that’s likely taking a swipe at a new crop of startups either following the Instacart model, such as Getir in Turkey, or the plethora of delivery-only ‘dark stores’, including Berlin’s much-hyped <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/gorillas/">Gorillas</a>, France’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/cajoo-promises-grocery-deliveries-in-15-minutes/">Cajoo</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/gorillas/">,, </a> and U.K.’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/dija/">Dija, </a><a href="https://tryzapp.com/">Zapp, </a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/">Weezy</a>, and Fancy (currently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/go-fancy/">in talks to be acquired</a> by U.S.-based goPuff).</p>
<p>With all the hype around drones and autonomous vehicles, Robert says that people forget or don’t understand that the delivery business, particularly last-mile, is still a people business. This means building a service that works for the couriers that power it.</p>
<p>“Same day at scale is hard, so most players cut corners,” he says. “Legacy companies can deliver at scale, but the sophistication of the service is poor, and then only make money because they squeeze their couriers. Tech startups have great app experiences and big brand budgets, but they don’t know how to deliver sustainably so they burn through VC cash waiting for robots, drones, autonomous vehicles and bionic duckweed to shore up the bottom line”.</p>
<p>“The way we’ve managed to strip out the compromise is by creating a platform that maximises each individual courier’s ability to make money, in whatever direction they&#8217;re traveling in, whilst making sure the end customer gets their stuff on time with no issues”.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="dE7W8OIoVv"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/go-fancy/">Delivery company goPuff is in talks to acquire the UK&#8217;s Fancy</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Delivery company goPuff is in talks to acquire the UK&#8217;s Fancy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/go-fancy/embed/#?secret=dE7W8OIoVv" data-secret="dE7W8OIoVv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Gophr has also built a platform that Robert claims helps couriers “level up”. This required properly understanding the “complexity and variability of the delivery process,” including how individual couriers want to work, and how to best meet customer expectations, which varies per sector.</p>
<p>“I think with most delivery apps and at incumbent carriers the courier is kind of incidental, and seen as replaceable; we try to focus on how we can make them better, and we’re still working on it,” he says. “Being a great courier doesn’t just boil down to being on time &#8212; that’s the basics &#8212; it’s what works for different types of customer needs and expectations. You might get couriers who aren’t great at multi-drop but very good on the circuit, or that need to work on job management but more than make up for it through excellent communication. Sending or receiving a package is a bit of an emotional purchase when you think about it so we have to do our best to manage that in the best way possible. Having happy couriers is a good start”.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Robert is not phased by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/uber-loses-gig-workers-rights-challenge-in-uk-supreme-court/">last week’s Uber ruling</a> that saw U.K. courts reclassify the worker status of gig economy-style drivers, meaning that they are entitled to additional benefits and worker protections.</p>
<p>“I think it’s great news for shutting down bogus self-employment,” he says. “I don’t see how the incumbent U.K. delivery industry can continue to operate under anything else other than this new worker classification. If operators want to stay on the right side of the law, worker status is the one that’s closest to how they currently do business. In the short term they might be able to mitigate the impact through recent 3rd party solutions that have sprung up that provide cover for the new IR35 rules coming into effect later this year, but I can’t imagine that will last forever.</p>
<p>“Fundamentally, we’ve always considered the courier as ‘the talent’ and not a cost centre or a commodity, and that the important relationship to build is between the courier and client, with our platform as an enabler, not a gatekeeper. And that’s always been key to how we operate”.</p>
<p>This means that Gophr doesn’t penalise or sin-bin drivers for non-acceptance of work. Its app show the driver where they would be picking up and delivering to, what the consignment is and what they’ll get paid so they have all the relevant info before they accept a job”.</p>
<p>However, he says the rate setting aspect of the Uber case is interesting, because centrally imposed rates can actually work in favour of couriers as apposed to an entirely free-market. “We do set the rates they&#8217;re paid, but that’s because we looked at other solutions that enabled couriers to set their own price per mile and/or got them to bid for work and all it did was encourage a race to the bottom,” Robert says. “So it’s kind of ironic that that was one of the key parts of the ruling. This could become (quite literally) a law of unintended consequences”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Vertical marketplaces continue to be a key lynchpin in the digital economy, a centralized place where people providing certain goods or services can connect with those specifically looking to buy them, a position that has, it seems, become even <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-new-gig-a-linkedin-freelancer-market-rivaling-upwork-fiverr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more prominent and in-demand</a> in our pandemic economy. In line with that trend, today a startup out of Denmark called <a href="http://ageras.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ageras Group</a>, which has built a dual-purpose platform, providing both accountancy software and a marketplace for small and medium businesses to find accountants, is announcing a round of growth funding to expand its business.</p>
<p>The Copenhagen-based company has closed a round of $73 million from a single investor, Lugard Road Capital.</p>
<p>Ageras is not disclosing its valuation, but <a href="https://borsen.dk/nyheder/finans/ny-investor-giver-ageras-vaerdi-paa-15-mia-kr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this report</a> in Danish publication Borsen pegs it at 1.5 billion Danish Krone, or around $244 million at today&#8217;s rates. We&#8217;ve asked an Ageras spokesperson to confirm the figure and will update this post as we learn more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;re also asking how much it has raised in the past. Founded in 2012, the startup was bootstrapped for its first five years, and PitchBook discloses only around $220,000 before this round. Previous investors include <a href="https://www.assetfinanceinternational.com/index.php/technology/technology-archive/technology-articles/19517-rabobank-invests-in-ageras-to-develop-financial-services-for-smes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Investcorp </a>&#8212; which took a majority stake in the company in 2017 &#8212; and more recently <a href="https://www.assetfinanceinternational.com/index.php/technology/technology-archive/technology-articles/19517-rabobank-invests-in-ageras-to-develop-financial-services-for-smes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rabo Bank</a>.</p>
<p>The new investment comes on the heels of good growth for the company, with plans to capitalize on that. Ageras has now passed 340,000 users across Denmark, the U.S., Sweden, Norway, Holland and Germany. It says that the plan will be to use the funding to expand into what it generally describes as &#8220;growth markets&#8221; &#8212; new countries, new customer segments, and also adding more services to its software stack &#8212; both through organic growth and acquisitions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ageras has established a market leading and best-in-class product offering that is optimally positioned for international expansion and the rising demand for automated business tools,&#8221; said Rico Andersen, Ageras&#8217; CEO who co-founded the company with Martin Hegelund, himself a serial investor who has backed the likes of Slack. “This latest financing round will support our ongoing commitment to scaling the Ageras brand and bringing our software offering to new customers across the globe. We look forward to continuing the Ageras story in the years to come.”</p>
<p>Ageras today follows a fairly typical labor marketplace model: SMEs seeking accountancy services submit their requirements in three areas &#8212; accounting, book keeping or auditing &#8212; and in return they receive three leads to contact. That model is one that Andersen and Hegelund know well, having previously built an online marketplace for home service professionals called &#8220;Fa det Gjort&#8221; (which translates to &#8220;Get it done!&#8221;).</p>
<p>Alongside this &#8212; and to further diversify the business model &#8212; the company has expanded into building accounting software, starting first with its own in-house Meneto suite, and then adding to it with two acquisitions, Billy in Denmark and Tellow in The Netherlands.</p>
<p>The investment underscores the persistent popularity of the marketplace model for online business, made popular in e-commerce by the likes of Amazon and Alibaba but extended to a range of services as well.</p>
<p>The labor marketplace model has been a perennial one in the world of startups &#8212; Uber helped pioneered it to connect those needing a ride with mobility options for getting somewhere, the likes of Deliveroo lets people sign up to deliver food and other goods to people, there are a number of platforms out there providing a way for tradespeople to connect with those needing a home or other job done, and so on.</p>
<p>And the evolution of that to expand to more knowledge worker jobs is not especially new, either. Upwork, <a href="https://www.bark.com/en/gb/accountants/london/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bark</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/26/paro-raises-10-million-series-b-to-offer-corporate-finance-expertise-on-demand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paro</a> and others are among those offering a way for accountants to connect with would-be customers.</p>
<p>What is perhaps more notable is how the space seems to be growing right now: it pandemic has reduced a lot of foot traffic for business districts, changing what &#8220;offices&#8221; look like these days. That has opened the door to a wider range of people providing services to others, while at the same time possibly made it harder for them to be discoverable.</p>
<p>Marketplaces are one way to solve that challenge, and in that regard, it&#8217;s no surprise to see the <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-new-gig-a-linkedin-freelancer-market-rivaling-upwork-fiverr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that LinkedIn is eyeing up building its own marketplace for skilled workers.</p>
<p>That is not the only area where Ageras faces competition, though: in the area of online accounting services, meanwhile, there are a number of players including established companies like Intuit as well as newer entrants like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/pennylane-raises-18-4-million-for-its-accounting-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pennylane</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/22/taxscouts-seed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TaxScouts</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/05/zeitgold-raises-29-2-million-to-automate-bookkeeping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zeitgold</a>, and Stripe-backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/18/index-ventures-stripe-back-bookkeeping-service-pilot-with-40m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pilot</a>.</p>
<p>Lugard appears to be a VC affiliated with U.S. hedge fund <a href="https://nordic9.com/companies/lugard-road-capital-investor5614397573/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luxor Capital Group</a> and it has also backed the delivery platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/spains-glovo-grabs-166m-series-e-for-its-deliver-anything-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glovo</a>, <a href="https://www.inriver.com/news/software-company-inriver-brings-in-heavyweight-investors-for-international-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inRiver</a>, and others. Investcorp, meanwhile, continues to hold a significant stake in the startup as part of its bigger tech investment strategy, which has included <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/nortonlifelock-acquires-avira-in-360m-all-cash-deal-8-months-after-avira-was-acquired-for-180m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquiring and then selling security firm Avira</a>, and recently taking a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/indian-logistics-startup-xpressbees-raises-110-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stake in India&#8217;s logistics startup Xpressbees</a>.</p>
<p>“The combination of Ageras’ mission critical software, backed by a reputation for dependability, insights into the professional service market, an outstanding management team, paired with its cutting-edge research &amp; development has ensured it has continued to grow its market position and deliver an accountancy ecosystem based on high quality recurring revenue,&#8221; said Gilbert Kamieniecky, MD and head of Investcorp’s technology vertical, in a statement. &#8220;The additional financing secured by Ageras will help to drive international expansion and support the continued innovation of its customer offering.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Despite the market impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/08/27/the-rise-of-the-retail-investor-a-new-force-in-indonesias-pandemic-hit-stock-market.html">retail investing is increasing in Indonesia</a>, especially among people aged 18 to 30. Today, investment platform <a href="https://fundtastic.co.id/">FUNDtastic</a> announced it has raised a $7.7 million Series A to tap into that demand, with plans to launch new products for retail investors, <a href="https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/fundtastic-ascend-capital-indivara-228541/">reports DealStreetAsia</a>.</p>
<p>The round was led by Singapore-based Ascend Capital Group, with participation from other investors including tech holding company Indivara Group. FUNDtastic plans to add retail bonds, insurance and peer-to-peer lending to its current roster of mutual funds and gold investment options.</p>
<p>FUNDtastic <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/08/11/investment-fintech-fundtastic-acquires-invisee-for-6-5m-to-expand-to-mutual-funds.html">acquired Invisee</a>, a mutual funds and securities portal, last year for $6.5 million, allowing it to sell mutual fund products directly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Based in Jakarta, FUNDtastic was founded in 2019 by Harry Hartono, Franky Chandra and Medwin Susilo. While capital investing in Indonesia <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/02/07/govt-idx-still-hope-to-attract-more-to-invest-in-stock-market.html">remains relatively low</a>, with many preferring to invest in real estate instead, that number is gradually increasing as young professionals diversify their holdings. The Indonesian Stock Exchange is also launching initiatives to attract more retail investors.</p>
<p>Other startups focused on making retail investment more accessible to Indonesians include Ajaib and Bibit, which both recently raised funding.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter recently held talks to acquire Indian social media startup ShareChat as the company explored ways to expand its presence in the world’s second largest internet market and build a global rival to TikTok, three sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The American firm, which is already an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/sharechat-twitter-seriesd/">investor in Bangalore-based ShareChat</a>, offered to buy the five-year-old Indian startup for $1.1 billion and had committed an additional investment of $900 million, two of the sources said. ShareChat, backed by Lightspeed Partners India, Elevation Capital, and India Quotient among others, has raised about $260 million to date.</p>
<p>The talks did not materialize into a deal, two sources said, requesting anonymity as the matter is private. TechCrunch could not determine the reason the two companies ended the talks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Two sources said Twitter had expressed intention to take Moj, a short-form video app that ShareChat owns, to international markets and position it as a rival to Chinese app TikTok.</p>
<p>Twitter declined to comment and ShareChat did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>India’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">ban on TikTok last year</a> prompted scores of local startups and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/facebook-expands-instagram-reels-to-india/">international giants</a> to try their hands at short-form video format.</p>
<p>Moj, with over 80 million users already, has emerged as one of the largest players in the category. Earlier this month, Snap <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/google-and-snap-in-talks-to-invest-in-india-social-network-sharechat/">inked a deal with ShareChat</a> to integrate its Camera Kit into the Indian short video app. This is the first time Snap had formed a partnership of this kind with a firm in India.</p>
<p>With the buyout offer no longer being entertained, ShareChat has resumed talks with other investors for its new financing round. These investors include Google, Snap, the sources said.</p>
<p>TechCrunch reported in January that the Indian startup was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/google-and-snap-in-talks-to-invest-in-india-social-network-sharechat/">talking to Google and Snap</a> as well as some existing investors including Twitter to raise over $200 million. A potential acquisition by Twitter prolonged the investment talks.</p>
<p>ShareChat, which claims to have over 160 million users, offers its social network app in 15 Indian languages and has a large following in small Indian cities and towns, or what venture capitalist Sajith Pai of Blume Ventures refer as &#8220;India 2.&#8221; Very few players in the Indian startup ecosystem have a reach to this segment of this population, which thanks to users from even smaller towns and villages &#8212; called &#8220;India 3&#8221; &#8212; getting online has expanded in recent years.</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch last year, Ankush Sachdeva, co-founder and chief executive of ShareChat, said the startup&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/indias-sharechat-raises-40-million-says-its-short-video-platform-moj-now-reaches-80-million-users/">marquee app was growing “exponentially”</a> and that users were spending, on an average, more than 30 minutes a day on the service.</p>
<p>Twitter, itself, has struggled to make inroads outside of bigger cities and towns in India. Its app reached about 75 million users in the country in the month of January, according to mobile insight firm AppAnnie, data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch. It inked a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/twitter-moments-dailyhunt-india/">deal with news and social app Dailyhunt</a> to bring Moments &#8212; curated tweets pertaining to news and other local events &#8212; to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">Google-backed Indian app</a>.</p>
<p>The American social network has broadened its product offering in the past year amid pressure from activist investors to accelerate growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Ten years in, <a href="http://www.transferwise.com/">TransferWise</a> is now Wise,&#8221; screams the press release that landed in my in-box late last week. The fintech giant, most recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/28/transferwise-five-unicorns/">valued by private investors at $5 billion</a>, is re-branding ahead of <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/transferwise-picks-banks-to-spearhead-blockbuster-flotation-12194386">an expected IPO</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, the company doesn&#8217;t actually make reference to a public listing &#8212; for regulatory reasons, it probably shouldn&#8217;t even if it wanted to &#8212; but the change of name will certainly make for a more streamlined ticker, while more broadly, the new moniker reflects how decade-old TransferWise has long moved beyond B2C international money transfers alone to build what it now dubs a &#8220;cross-border payments network&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Originally launched in 2011 as a money transfer service for people, the company has expanded to build a cross-border payments network helping to make international banking cheaper, faster and more pleasant for its 10 million personal and business customers,&#8221; explains <del datetime="2021-02-21T17:18:02+00:00">Transfer</del>Wise.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has come far in ten years &#8212; you can view an early funding deck <a href="https://techcrunch.com/gallery/transferwise-pitch-me/">here</a> &#8212; and today processes £4.5 billion in cross-border transactions every month, claiming to help customers save approximately £1 billion a year in reduced fees compared to using legacy banks.</p>

<p>More recently, having launched consumer and business products akin to a multi-currency bank account, including its own debit card, Wise has started to resemble a challenger bank, too, even if it has previously stated that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/dont-bank-on-it/">there are no plans to apply for a full bank license</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the company pitches the current product line:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Wise</strong> &#8211; building the world’s most international account. Send and spend money internationally, hold money in 55 currencies and get real account numbers in 10 currencies. Customers now hold over £3 billion in Wise, with 1.4 million debit cards issued.</p>
<p><strong>Wise Business</strong> &#8211; the business account for going global, it has all the features of the personal account plus extras like bank feeds, mass payouts and multi-user access. Over 150,000 businesses joined Wise in the last 12 months</p>
<p><strong>Wise Platform</strong> &#8211; the platform banks and companies like Monzo, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/06/gocardless-transferwise/">GoCardless</a>, and Xero use to tap into the Wise infrastructure, giving their customers cheaper, faster payments and international banking features. Wise Platform is live with banks in 10 countries across 4 continents.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cue quote from Kristo Käärmann, CEO and co-founder, of Wise: “Today our name catches up with who we’re already building for &#8211; a community of people and businesses with multi-currency lives. That community now even includes the banks themselves. We’ve evolved to fix more than just money transfer, but the core experience of using Wise will remain faster, cheaper, and more convenient than anything else. Our mission remains the same. We’re still making — and always will be making — money work without borders.”</p>
<p>Customers can already opt into the new website at Wise.com. &#8220;The final switchover for all customers to the Wise brand will take place in March 2021,&#8221; says the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zhou Yuxiang doesn&#8217;t have the typical profile for working in China&#8217;s manufacturing world. A soft-spoken yet incisive person in his early thirties, Zhou graduated from Dartmouth College with a degree in government and went on to work in investment banking in Hong Kong, following the path of many Chinese overseas returnees.</p>
<p>But a few years into his career, Zhou realized he wanted to build his own business. This was around 2015, a time when China was consumed by a startup craze amid Premier Li Keqiang&#8217;s campaign for &#8220;mass entrepreneurship and innovation.&#8221; Rather than going into the sleek world of consumer lifestyle, fintech or AI, Zhou picked manufacturing as a starting point.</p>
<p>During his time at Barclays, Zhou helped deep-pocketed Chinese manufacturers scour for merger and acquisition deals in Europe. He saw how factories in Germany digitize their operations using Siemens and SAP solutions. In China, &#8220;factories had a lot of money and could buy top-of-the-line equipment. But on the software management front, they were still very primitive,&#8221; said Zhou in an interview with TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Most of the operation was done on paper. Every day, workers received a stack of papers telling them what to do, and in turn, they filled up the sheets reporting what material they had used&#8230; When you acquire these financially underperforming factories in Europe, you realize their software infrastructure capabilities are still far superior to yours,&#8221; Zhou added.</p>
<p>That digital gap encouraged Zhou to start <a href="https://www.blacklake.cn/">Black Lake</a>, a software platform for factory workers to log their daily tasks and managers to oversee the plant floor. Since its inception in 2016, the startup has raised over $100 million from GGV Capital, Bertelsmann Asia Investments, GSR Ventures, ZhenFund and others. The company recently closed a Series C round, pocketing nearly 500 million yuan ($77 million) and bringing on new backers including Singapore&#8217;s sovereign wealth fund Temasek, who led the round, as well as China Renaissance and Lightspeed Venture Partners.</p>
<p>Black Lake&#8217;s vision is to be a one-stop collaboration platform for factory workers and managers, digitizing data incurred in all stages of production, from client orders, material procurement, quality compliance, warehouse management, to logistics and shipment. The software analyzes these reams of data, churning out reports for bosses to check for abnormalities in production and for workers to see how they could increase their output and income.</p>
<p>Compared to SaaS incumbents from the West, Black Lake&#8217;s more localized services and affordable prices have a greater appeal to China&#8217;s wide swathes of small and medium-sized factories, Zhou argued. Black Lake tries to simplify its user experience to a Lego-like building process so factory bosses can easily customize the software for their own use. Workers access the cloud-based software from their smartphones, which have become ubiquitous in China&#8217;s affluent cities thanks to increasingly friendly device prices and data fees. A foreign SaaS giant&#8217;s solution could cost a factory at least three million yuan a year, while Black Lake charges 300,000 yuan or less, Zhou said.</p>
<p>To date, the company has served nearly 2,000 manufacturers and suppliers across the Greater China Region and Southeast Asia, counting in its customers Tesla, L&#8217;Oréal, Xiaomi, Sinopec, and Chinese state-owned conglomerate China Resources&#8217; pharmaceutical group. In all, the company claims to have reached 500,000 production workers.</p>
<h2>Manufacturing 2.0</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2115705" style="width: 3806px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2115705" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2115705 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/black-lake-e1613910446337.png" alt="" width="3796" height="2515" /><p id="caption-attachment-2115705" class="wp-caption-text">Black Lake&#8217;s collaboration and data management software for factories</p></div></p>
<p>Black Lake is riding a perfect wave of &#8220;upgrading&#8221; in China&#8217;s manufacturing world. For one, the demand for customized products is rising as consumers become savvier. Instead of producing bottled water with the same packaging, for instance, beverage companies now design various looks tailored to different demographics. Factories need to adjust quickly to the flood of customized orders, and a cloud-based data management platform could be the solution, Zhou suggested.</p>
<p>The U.S.-China trade war is another impetus for China&#8217;s push for factory upgrade. Having felt the heat from trade sanctions, Chinese manufacturers look to cut expenses and improve productivity. That shift, along with the government&#8217;s &#8220;new infrastructure&#8221; policy to breathe high tech into traditional industries, makes Zhou all the more bullish about his business.</p>
<p>But Black Lake is certainly not the only one to have spotted opportunities in China&#8217;s efforts to modernize production, and enterprise software in China has a notoriously slow monetization cycle in part due to low adoption and companies&#8217; reluctance to pay for services. The key is finding a viable business model to fund its dream to be the ultimate &#8220;data entry point&#8221; for China&#8217;s millions of factories.</p>
<p>With proceeds from its new funding, Black Lake plans to spend on product development, hiring, market expansion, and building an open platform for third-party developers. The startup realizes it can&#8217;t build everything factories need, and it&#8217;s already working with partners across telecommunications, cloud computing, automation and consulting, such as Huawei, Alibaba, SAP and McKinsey.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Chinese factories &#8216;wake up&#8217;, their speed of digitization will definitely leapfrog that of their American and European counterparts,&#8221; Zhou asserted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been almost 10 years since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/justworks/">Justworks</a> launched. The platform, founded by Isaac Oates, was yet another example of software eating the world; in this particular instance, it was the world of HR. Since, the company has raised nearly $150 million in funding.</p>
<p>All the way back in 2016, Bain Capital Ventures caught a whiff of Justworks&#8217; potential for success. Partner Matt Harris led the company&#8217;s $13 million Series B round back when Justworks hadn&#8217;t even hit $1 million in annual revenue.</p>
<p>On the next episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/extra-crunch-live-is-back-in-2021-connecting-founders-with-tech-giants-and-each-other/">Extra Crunch Live</a>, we&#8217;ll sit down with Oates and Harris to discuss how they met, how the deal went down, and how they&#8217;ve managed their board member/founder relationship over the last five years.</p>
<p>As with any episode of ECL, Oates and Harris will also give live feedback on audience-submitted pitch decks during the Pitch Deck Teardown.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live is a members-only series that goes down each Wednesday at 12pm PT/3pm ET. If you&#8217;re not yet an Extra Crunch member, you should take a hard look in the mirror and then <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=bainjustworks">hit up this link</a>.</p>
<p>Matt Harris started his investing career at Bain Capital private equity in 1995. In 2000, he founded his own firm called Village Ventures where he spent 12 years and invested primarily in fintech startups. In 2012, he returned to Bain Capital Ventures. His portfolio includes Acorns, Finix, Ribbon, and of course, Justworks, among many others.</p>
<p>Oates served for 12 years in the National Guard and Army Reserve as an intelligence officer. He also served as a software engineer at Amazon before starting his first company, Adtuitive, which was acquired by Etsy. Oates led the HR and payments team at both Adtuitive and Etsy, learning first-hand the ways in which the system was fundamentally broken. Justworks was born in 2012 and has gone on to become a household name in enterprise tech.</p>
<p>On Wednesday&#8217;s episode, we&#8217;ll talk about why Harris felt conviction in making a bet on Justworks and why Oates went with Harris over other investors. We&#8217;ll also learn more about how they handle disagreements, build trust, and their broader thoughts on current enterprise trends.</p>
<p>Then, we&#8217;ll dive into the Pitch Deck Teardown. Anyone can submit a pitch deck to be featured on an episode of Extra Crunch Live, but EC members will be prioritized in the list. If you want to get in on the action, <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/Lutrgz8Q">submit your deck right here</a>.</p>
<p>As with just about everything we do here at TechCrunch, audience members can also ask their own questions.</p>
<p>Extra Crunch Live has left room for you to network (you gotta network to get work, amirite?). Networking is open starting at 2:30 p.m. EST/11:30 a.m. PST and stays open a half hour after the episode ends. Make a friend!</p>
<p>As a reminder, Extra Crunch Live is a members-only series that aims to give founders and tech operators actionable advice and insights from leaders across the tech industry. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=bainjustworks">Here&#8217;s yet another chance for you to join</a>.</p>
<p>Harris and Oates join a world-class cast of speakers on Extra Crunch Live. In February alone we spoke to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/pitch-decks-pricing-and-how-to-nail-the-narrative-with-lightspeeds-gaurav-gupta-and-grafanas-raj-dutt/">Lightspeed’s Gaurav Gupta and Grafana’s Raj Dutt</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/felicis-aydin-senkut-and-guidelines-kevin-busque-on-the-value-of-simple-pitch-decks/">Felicis’ Aydin Senkut and Guideline’s Kevin Busque</a>, and Accel&#8217;s Steve Loughlin and Ironclad&#8217;s Jason Boehmig.</p>
