										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Kenyan fintech <a href="https://www.zanifu.com/">Zanifu</a> is set to upgrade its platform and grow the number of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) it extends stock-financing to after securing $1 million in Seed funding.</p>
<p>Saviu Ventures, which invested in the startup’s pre-seed round early 2020, Launch Africa Ventures, Sayani Investments and a number of angel investors from Kenya and Nigeria participated in the round. This latest round brings the total funding so far received by the startup to $1.2 million.</p>
<p>Zanifu provides short-term stock-financing of up to $2,000 to MSMEs in Kenya and is eyeing an additional 15,000 FMCG retailers in the next one year.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259265" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We serve FMCG retailers, especially the ones that are too small to access traditional bank finance for their businesses. The only option these MSMEs have has been digital consumer loans, which are not always suitable for them. We are filling a critical gap in providing stock financing, which enables small businesses to grow their turnovers by more than 40%,&#8221; said Zanifu co-founder and chief operating officer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevebikoke/?originalSubdomain=ke">Steve Biko</a>.</p>
<p>“The FMCG segment has the highest working capital needs within MSMEs, and the velocity of the goods they sell allows us to safely underwrite unsecured business credit to them.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2259268" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2259268" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2259268" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zanifu-Founders.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="837" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zanifu-Founders.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zanifu-Founders.jpg?resize=150,123 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zanifu-Founders.jpg?resize=300,245 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zanifu-Founders.jpg?resize=768,628 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zanifu-Founders.jpg?resize=680,556 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zanifu-Founders.jpg?resize=1536,1255 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zanifu-Founders.jpg?resize=2048,1674 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zanifu-Founders.jpg?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2259268" class="wp-caption-text">Zanifu co-founders, from left to right, Steve Biko and Sebastian Mithika. <strong>Image Credits</strong>: Zanifu.</p></div></p>
<p>Biko and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-kilimo-1570a240/?originalSubdomain=ke">Sebastian Mithika</a> launched the financing business a year after founding the startup in 2017. The startup said it has to date extended 85,000 working capital loans worth over $13 million to 7,000 businesses in Kenya.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mithika said that Zanifu is playing its role in bridging the $20 billion (as estimated by the World Bank) MSME financing gap in the country experienced by 5 million small businesses, most of which are informal.</p>
<p>The informal businesses in Kenya are an integral part of the economy contributing 33.8% of the country’s GDP and <a href="https://www.knbs.or.ke/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Economic-Survey-2021.pdf">providing 83.4% of employment</a> outside of small-scale agriculture. However, <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/262361468914023771/pdf/106986-WP-P151793-PUBLIC-Box.pdf">access to financing</a> remains the main impediment to growth for these micro and small businesses. And thus, over the last few years fintech companies like Zanifu have introduced products that are tailored to the financing needs of the MSMEs.</p>
<p>Zanifu works with a number of manufacturers and distributors to extend the credit to these small businesses with retailers already sourcing products from the startup’s partners qualifying for the financing. Zanifu has created platforms for manufactures, distributors and retailers that ensure seamless ordering, payment, tracking and fulfillment.</p>
<p>Retailers borrow through Zanifu’s loan app, where they upload information that includes historical purchase data. The retailers are then assigned a credit limit, after its algorithm scores them, within six hours after signing up. Retailers have up to a month to pay back the loans, which attract an interest rate of 3.5 to 5%.</p>
<p>Zanifu, which has a presence throughout Kenya, is now eyeing Ghana and Uganda. A regional presence will step-up competition for the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/mfs-africa-leads-2-3m-seed-round-in-ugandan-fintech-startup-numida/">Uganda’s Numida</a> and Nigeria’s Payhippo, some of the fintechs providing unsecured financing to small businesses.</p>
<p>Numida, founded in 2017, extends unsecured credit of up to $3,500 in less than two hours while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/nigerias-lender-payhippo-raises-3-million-in-seed-funding-to-extend-quick-loans-to-smes/">Payhippo, in a past interview, said</a> it disburses average loans of $1,300, with the minimum being about $200. As alternative finance providers, these digital lenders are closing the financing gap for small businesses, but at a higher interest rate when compared to formal banking institutions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Prior to starting Pixis, the co-founders spoke to potential marketing customers about how to scale SaaS companies quickly in a “cookie less” world.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pyxis One, now <a href="https://pixis.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pixis</a>, closed on $100 million in Series C funding to continue developing what it touts as “the world’s only contextual codeless AI infrastructure for complete marketing optimization.”</p>
<p>SoftBank Vision Fund 2 led the round and was joined by new investor General Atlantic, and existing investors Celesta Capital, Premji Invest and Chiratae Ventures. The fresh capital comes just four months after Pixis announced its $17 million Series B to bring its total funding to date to $124 million.</p>
<p>The California-based company was founded three years ago by Shubham A. Mishra, Vrushali Prasade and Hari Valiyath. This is the second company the team has started together; its first was artificial intelligence in the gaming space, Mishra told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259132" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As the company progressed, the team realized that most people were spelling “Pyxis” with an “i” instead of a “y,” so to make it super clean and symmetrical, the company changed its name, he said.</p>
<p>Prior to starting Pixis, the co-founders spoke to chief marketing officers and chief revenue officers about how to scale SaaS companies quickly in a “cookie-less” world that would require companies to deploy their own systems to respect privacy for customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Not many are ready to do that,” Mishra said. “We are solving that by building a no-code AI solution that can be deployed in less than eight seconds.”</p>
<p>In fact, the company has 50 AI models now for self-evolving neural networks to add AI optimization to marketing campaigns and plans to scale to 200 in the next six months. Pixis believes in the vision that people will partially be data scientists driven by no-code solutions, Mishra said.</p>
<p>And it’s not just a ploy saying it’s “no code,” it’s actually no code, he noted. The infrastructure was built like a spectrum of offerings so that you could go full-out and tweak the AI marketing models, gather a team of data scientists and develop something, or just take 30 minutes of training and press a button to deploy the products and plug-ins.</p>
<p>The Series C follows 600% revenue growth since 2018. Pixis will close out January with more than 100 customers, all in the mid to large enterprise range, Mishra said. Customers using the Pixis AI infrastructure saw a 20% decrease in acquisition costs in addition to hours of manual work saved every month, he added.</p>
<p>The funding will help to scale the AI platforms and plug-ins as it expands across North America, Europe and APAC.</p>
<p>“This year is a new horizon for us,” Mishra said. “Last year, we were launching our solution to the BTC and DTC marketing, and by the end of the first quarter of this year, we will have a solution for B2B and software companies.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Priya Saiprasad, partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, said via email that Pixis is unique in that it is a true end-to-end infrastructure for demand generation that “equips marketing functions with cutting-edge data science capabilities to drive better decision-making in a cookie-free world.”</p>
<p>She believes that is a “game-changer” because marketing is a big budget item for companies, but much of the spend is wasted when companies lack the tools for messaging and visuals and therefore don’t target the right customers via the right channel at the right time.</p>
<p>“A validation of Pixis’s product-market fit is the impressive growth rate the company has achieved in just three years since launching, buttressed by a loyal and engaged customer base of large global enterprises,” Saiprasad added. “We believe there is significant runway for Pixis to continue this momentum because of the size of the market — companies spent an estimated $455 billion on digital marketing in 2021 — and Pixis’s sector-agnostic platform enabling it to scale across different verticals.”</p>
<p>Shantanu Rastogi, managing director of General Atlantic, also noted that with the marketing ecosystem shifting, as a result of new limitations on data sharing, Pixis is addressing this and creating new return on investment for customers by leveraging predictive AI models to deliver marketing efficiency.</p>
<p>“Pixis is bringing automation and orchestration to an industry that, until now, has accepted platforms that we believe lean on outdated technology as ‘good enough,’” Rastogi added. “We are thrilled to support the talented team in its efforts to grow and scale globally with this investment.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Buy now pay later (BNPL) startups are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/bnpl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proliferating around the world</a> and the Philippines is no exception. Today, one of the country’s biggest BNPL providers, <a href="https://billease.ph/">BillEase</a>, announced it has raised an $11 million Series B. The round was led by BurdaPrincipal Investments, growth capital arm of Hubert Burda Media. Other participants included Centauri, a joint investment vehicle between MDI Ventures and KB Investment, and Tamaz Georgadze, CEO and co-founder of Raisin DS.</p>
<p>Operated by fintech First Digital Finance Corporation BillEase launched in 2017, with shopping marketplace Lazada as its first merchant partner. It can now be used at more than 500 merchants, including consumer electronics seller Kimstore and Philippine Airlines. Its BNPL is also available through payment gateways Xendit, Paynamics, 2C2P, Dragonpay and BUX, and it offers an app with personal loans, top-ups for digital wallets like GCash, PayMaya, Coins.ph, GrabPay and Shopee Pay and mobile phone and gaming credits.</p>
<p>Since the Philippines’ payment sector is fragmented, customers can pay back their BNPL loans through a variety of ways, including digital wallets, bank transfers, direct debit, linking their bank account or over-the-counter payments in physical stores like 7-11.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259251" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The new funding brings BillEase’s total raised to about $15 million in equity, and will be used for customer acquisition, developing new products and hiring.</p>

<p>One of the main ways BillEase differentiates from other BNPL services in the Philippines is that it allows customers to build formal credit records.</p>
<p>Georg Steiger, First Digital Financial Corporation’s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch in an email that BillEase’s target segment is the Philippines’ emerging middle class, specifically Gen Z and millennials who are early in their careers. “About 80% of our customers are new to the formal credit system and do not have a credit record.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For those customers, BillEase also serves as an on-ramp to the financial system—we are the only credit app in the Philippines that is a member of TransUnion.” It is also part of the state-owned Credit Information Corporation.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mexican BNPL player Kueski secures $202M in debt &#038; equity as it nears $100M+ in ARR&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/mexican-bnpl-player-kueski-secures-202m-as-it-nears-100m-in-arr/embed/#?secret=3hKKOdwpJa" data-secret="3hKKOdwpJa" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Another differentiator is that BillEase built and owns its credit, fraud and payment software stack, and can approve more than 90% of BNPL loans instantly with it model. This means shorter checkout times and also enables BillEase to offer lower interest rates, at about 3.49% compared to 7% to 12% for other BNPL loans, Steiger said. It gives merchants customizable installment plans. For example, they can offer BNPL repayment terms of 10 to 30 days for smaller purchases, payment in four installments or monthly payments for larger purchases, and decide if those loans will be interest-free or not.</p>
<p>Since most of BillEase’s customers don’t have a credit record, it uses “a wide variety of alternative data sources to triangulate and get a good picture of our customers,” including telecom usage, phone metadata, network data and behavioral data points,” Steiger said.</p>
<p>“Credit scoring is also something we constantly tinker with,” he added. “As new data comes in or new variables become available, we upgrade our models. At any given time we usually run a few A/B tests to test new models or process improvements.”</p>

<p>Politics and tech are certainly strange bedfellows. The Gang loves to talk about filibusters and the fall of democracy, but forget it when I try to bring up my fascination with live audio. That is understandable; we never talk about the little stuff until there’s a battling billionaire angle. So it was that Jack Dorsey’s joust with Marc Andreessen over what the meaning of web3 is is brought all the web2 superstars into the thread. Tim O’Reilly, John Battelle, Chris Dixon, Catch 22’s Milo Mindbender (ok, Moxie Marlinspike?) and even web1’s Leo Laporte weighed in.</p>
<p>Since Covid blocked physical events, we’ve reluctantly moved to another buzzword sweepstakes dubbed the Metaverse. I agree with Keith Teare that this dog won’t hunt due to the stylistic reluctance to wear large hardware objects on our forehead, but there’s a lot more to virtual events than meets the eye. Before the pandemic, more and more meetings were moving online as we tried to juggle back-to-back appointments at the office. It was easier to switch from room to room regardless of physical location, travel time or lack of it, and the innate competition with messaging systems like Slack and civilian texts over iMessage, FB Messenger, and whatever Google Chat was renamed this week. With competitive information constantly flowing in in real time, product strategy has morphed into analytic harvesting of that interactive metadata that drives feedback on the network into design, time to market, and distribution.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259245" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Replacing large conferences with virtual working groups mostly goes on behind the corporate firewall, but message testing goes on in the clear. The context is the appsphere, and Clubhouse is a living tutorial in gaining scale through the same kind of access model the old conferences deployed. A gated ropeline establishes a kind of green room access where you can renew connections and establish trust with keynoters and technologists. The possibility of being asked up on stage is where the media is conscripted. Newsletter players like Josh Constine and Casey Newton advance from the tech pub ranks to serve as midwives for the startup churn and casting couch for the venture class. The elixir of media savvy and hallway access is what the conference makers charge for.</p>
<p>A few nights ago I sat transfixed as Adam McKay, the director, and two producers told the story of Don’t Look Up as the movie spooled out on Netflix. The Clubhouse room reverberated for over 2 hours as the filmmakers did a deep dive on the production of the funny, dark, and beautiful story of a meteor heading toward a fatal rendeyvous with Earth. Some of the great books of my fascination with the art and technology of making films flashed through my mind: Truffaut’s conversations with Hitchcock, Pauline Kael’s treatise on Citizen Kane, the moment in Annie Hall when Woody Allen drags Marshall McLuhan out from behind a sign to confront a know it all professor — “You know nothing of my work. How you came to be a professor of anything&#8230;.” Every frame of Kubrick’s lexicon. The great comic minds gathered around the Algonquin rountable.</p>
<p>And to hear in shared real time McKay tell his tale of what the making of the film meant to him and his team, to share the goals and strategies for producing a film which certainly resonates with the pandemic, filmed in the beginnings of the catastrophe when there were NO vaccines yet invented. The nuances of his approach to combining the script he wrote with the magical improvisations of his actors. It went on and on, and you could hear McKay’s delight at being a part of this coming together of technology and the spirit of inspiration. And you can find the link to the replay of the event for your own examination nestled at the top of the Replay list. Virtual yes but tangible in its emotion and flawless execution. I actually liked the Clubhouse a little more than the movie, yet the aftereffect was to like the movie even more for the experience. Maybe this Metaverse is a thing after all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">NFT marketplace OpenSea is putting some of its freshly raised funds to good use, buying up crypto wallet startup Dharma Labs, the company <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/opensea-acquires-dharma-labs-welcomes-new-cto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today. The announcement follows a report earlier this month in <a href="https://www.axios.com/opensea-nft-dharma-acquire-f6df00d5-1cc0-463a-95fd-2f5039947ed8.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Axios</a> that detailed OpenSea was in talks to buy the startup for between $110 million and $130 million.</p>
<p>Dharma&#8217;s Ethereum wallet allowed users to connect their bank accounts, and buy and swap tokens while engaging with other elements of the DeFi ecosystem. OpenSea will be shutting down Dharma&#8217;s app as part of the deal, a move that is sure to be controversial with the crypto wallet&#8217;s users who will have just one month to offload assets from the wallet to a different account.</p>
<p>As part of the deal Dharma Labs co-founder Nadav Hollander will become OpenSea&#8217;s new chief technology officer. The startup&#8217;s previous CTO Alex Atallah will be stepping into a new role &#8220;where he’ll oversee [OpenSea&#8217;s] web3 and NFT ecosystem development efforts,&#8221; the company says.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259129" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our teams share a vision that NFTs will be the cultural focal point of crypto’s adoption for years to come — and that vision can only be realized if using NFTs becomes easy &amp; delightful for the average person,&#8221; OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer wrote in a blog post.</p>
<p>As the OpenSea platform has grown from mom and pop NFT shop to a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/nft-kingpin-opensea-lands-13-3b-valuation-in-300m-raise-from-paradigm-and-coatue/">$13.3 billion crypto decacorn</a>, some in its user base have grown more vocal in expressing views that the platform is too centralized for the &#8220;web3&#8221; world and that early users haven&#8217;t benefitted from the startup&#8217;s swelling valuation as much as its venture capitalist backers. Despite attention being paid to competitors like Rarible, Zora and recent upstart LooksRare, OpenSea is still far-and-away the clear powerhouse in the NFT world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a month-long “</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-steps-back-as-employees-detail-how-he-led-by-fear/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">break</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” Better.com CEO Vishal Garg is back at the helm of the mortgage tech company he co-founded in 2016, according to an internal memo that circulated today that has been shared with TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the memo, the Better board of directors said it was “moving forward with strong, dynamic CEO leadership.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The move comes just weeks after the company announced it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/better-com-lays-off-9-of-its-staff/">laying off 900 people</a>, or about 9% of its staff, via a Zoom meeting with the affected employees that drew widespread criticism from employees and even casual observers. In the 10 days after that meeting took place, the company’s reputation took a very public beating, with senior communications and public relations executives stepping down, memes of Garg circulating on TikTok and the CEO issuing </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-apologizes-to-current-employees-for-blundering-the-execution-of-mass-layoffs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a so-called apology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for his behavior.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259208" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company hired a crisis firm in the aftermath of the botched layoffs and, according to the internal memo from the board, Better will be “implementing a company-wide training program on ensuring a respectful workplace.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The board also said that during this time off, Garg had been working closely with an executive coach so he could “reconnect with the values that make Better great.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following those discussions, direct input from an independent culture review and some organizational changes, the board said Garg would be officially resuming his full-time duties as CEO. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the memo, the board said it was “confident in Vishal and in the changes he is committed to making to provide the type of leadership, focus and vision that Better needs at this pivotal time.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, it was a surprise to many that Garg was not asked to permanently resign. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some surmised that he had super-voting shares and thus could vote to keep himself in the role of CEO despite what others voted. But after digging into the </span><a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-326251/#rom154116_38" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">S-4 filed by Better.com’s SPAC partner, Aurora Acquisition Corp.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in November, TechCrunch’s own Alex Wilhelm and I realized </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/how-does-former-better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-still-have-a-job/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that is not the case</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ffhnbDK8Q7"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/how-does-former-better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-still-have-a-job/">How does former Better.com CEO Vishal Garg still have a job?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How does former Better.com CEO Vishal Garg still have a job?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/21/how-does-former-better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-still-have-a-job/embed/#?secret=ffhnbDK8Q7" data-secret="ffhnbDK8Q7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While laying off employees during Zoom calls is hardly unheard of as the COVID-19 pandemic has forced more remote work, Varg was viewed as being callous and unfeeling in his delivery. As we’ve previously reported, it didn’t help that he had also sent emails to his staff in the past berating them with insults. Last year,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2020/11/20/mortgages-fraud-claims-and-dumb-dolphins-a-tangled-past-haunts-bettercom-ceo-vishal-garg/?sh=57eee6f710f4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forbes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed the contents of an email to employees from Garg: “HELLO — WAKE UP BETTER TEAM. You are TOO DAMN SLOW. You are a bunch of DUMB DOLPHINS and…DUMB DOLPHINS get caught in nets and eaten by sharks. SO STOP IT. STOP IT. STOP IT RIGHT NOW. YOU ARE EMBARRASSING ME.”</span></p>
<p>Garg had also recently reportedly accused “at least 250″ terminated staffers of stealing from the company and customers by working just two hours a day</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better.com employees are reportedly not at all happy that Garg is not being asked to step down from his role as CEO, with one source telling TechCrunch that “everyone is upset, and many people have already quit or are planning to.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new bill seeks to dramatically reshape the online advertising landscape to the detriment of companies like Facebook, Google and data brokers that leverage deep stores of personal information to make money from targeted ads.</p>
<p>The bill, the <a href="https://eshoo.house.gov/media/press-releases/eshoo-schakowsky-booker-introduce-bill-ban-surveillance-advertising" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Banning Surveillance Advertising Act</a>, introduced by Reps. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) and Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) in the House and Cory Booker (D-NJ) in the Senate, would dramatically limit the ways that tech companies serve ads to their users, banning the use of personal data altogether.</p>
<p>Any targeting based on &#8220;protected class information, such as race, gender, and religion, and personal data purchased from data brokers&#8221; would be off-limits were the bill to pass. Platforms could still target ads based on general location data at the city or state level and &#8220;contextual advertising&#8221; based on the content a user is interacting with would still be allowed.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259162" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The bill would empower the FTC and state attorneys general to enforce violations, with fines of up to $5,000 per incident for knowing violations.</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8216;surveillance advertising&#8217; business model is premised on the unseemly collection and hoarding of personal data to enable ad targeting,&#8221; Rep. Eshoo said. &#8220;This pernicious practice allows online platforms to chase user engagement at great cost to our society, and it fuels disinformation, discrimination, voter suppression, privacy abuses, and so many other harms.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today I introduced the Banning Surveillance Advertising Act with <a href="https://twitter.com/RepAnnaEshoo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RepAnnaEshoo</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/RepSchakowsky?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RepSchakowsky</a>. With this act, advertisers will be forced to stop exploiting individuals’ online behavior for profits and our communities will be safer as a result.</p>
<p>&mdash; Sen. Cory Booker (@SenBooker) <a href="https://twitter.com/SenBooker/status/1483597574430994434?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2022</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Sen. Booker called the targeted advertising model &#8220;predatory and invasive,&#8221; stressing how the practice exacerbates misinformation and extremism on social media platforms.</p>
<p>Privacy-minded companies including search engine maker DuckDuckGo and Proton, creator of ProtonMail, backed the legislation along with organizations including the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), the Anti-Defamation League, Accountable Tech and Common Sense Media.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">This was another blockbuster year for global venture funding, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/data-show-2021-was-a-bonkers-record-setting-year-for-venture-capital/">2021 breaking records across the board</a>.</p>
<p>Deal activity is at record highs. Last year, a total of $643 billion was invested globally, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/global-vc-funding-unicorns-2021-monthly-recap/?utm_source=cb_daily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20220105&amp;utm_content=intro&amp;utm_term=content&amp;utm_source=cb_daily&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20220105#Deal%20volume" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Crunchbase News</a>, compared with $335 billion in 2020 – that’s 92% growth year over year.</p>
<p>Beyond being awash in capital, the VC industry has also seen a historic number of exits. A record number of companies went public in 2021, with many at huge valuations: 238 companies debuted on the public markets last year valued above $1 billion. In 2020, only 61 companies went public at this valuation.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			VCs are paying close attention to the opportunities that are materializing not just in Silicon Valley, but all over the world.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>Bigger, better capitalized and more global, the venture industry is poised to take advantage of the transformative technologies coming to market. As of Q4 last year, cumulative dry powder stood at a record $222 billion, according to <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/2021-us-vc-fundraising-exits-deal-flow-charts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PitchBook.</a></p>
<p>Regardless of the macroeconomic challenges ahead, I anticipate startup funding will continue at an accelerated pace this year.</p>
<p>The tech world continues to evolve to meet shifting consumer needs amid a global pandemic. This has created enormous opportunities for founders everywhere to build world-class companies.</p>
<p>I’m seeing this first-hand with several of our investments, such as <a href="https://www.bukalapak.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bukalapak</a>, an Indonesian e-commerce company that went <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/indonesias-bukalapak-kicks-off-11-bln-ipo-biggest-over-decade-2021-07-09/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public in August</a> and operates in a market that benefited in part from consumers staying at home and businesses selling more online during the pandemic.</p>
<p>In terms of where funds will be allocated in the year ahead, there are three transformative global technology trends that many VCs are watching closely, myself included: the rapid rise of web3, capital flows to less obvious founders, and the continued globalization of venture capital.</p>
<h2>Web3 goes mainstream</h2>
<p>In the past few months, investors and companies have been throwing around a lot of buzzwords, from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/how-should-we-regulate-defi/">DeFi</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/the-irrational-exuberance-of-web3/">web3 and the metaverse</a>. The increased focus on these areas is pointing to a fundamental shift in the Internet – one that is decentralized and grounded in public blockchains, where users are in the driver’s seat and intermediaries hold less sway.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for January 18, 2022! Today kicked off the working week with a bang, thanks to Microsoft and another public company. But will all deals announced become deals completed? We’ll see. We also have an acre-feet of startup news items for your enjoyment. Let’s go! – <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2><strong>The TechCrunch Top 3</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-acquire-activision-blizzard/">Microsoft to buy Activision Blizzard</a>: After months of internal turbulence – what TechCrunch described as “sexual harassment controversies and ongoing executive turmoil” – Activision Blizzard is selling itself to Microsoft for a huge premium on its pre-deal share price. Microsoft has purchased other gaming studios in recent years, making the purchase not entirely impossible to parse. But we have to wonder if the transaction won’t catch the eye of regulators, given a generally more active antitrust vibe around the world today. Let’s see.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/apple-returns-to-no-1-as-global-smartphone-shipments-grapple-with-supply-chain-concerns/">Apple takes smartphone crown back</a>: Smartphone shipments grew by 1% in the final quarter of 2021, with Apple passing Samsung as the leading global manufacturer of the category. The two companies have traded the top spot over time, though — thanks to the chips crisis, global pandemic and larger supply chain snarls — volatility in this sort of metric is hardly a surprise. Still, it’s good news for Apple fans.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/chinas-digital-yuan-wallet-now-has-260-million-individual-users/">China’s digital yuan matures</a>: In the wake of China’s ban on cryptocurrencies and related activity – read: mining – the country’s own digital currency is picking up market share. Dubbed the digital yuan in English, the electronic variant of the Chinese currency has been installed by 261 million folks, or about a fifth of the country’s population.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Startups/VC</strong></h2>
<p>Before we dive into the startup news list, our own <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca">Anna Heim</a> has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/for-investors-future-of-work-isnt-only-about-hr/">fascinating interview on the site</a> digging into what impact a changing workplace will have on the startup market; it’s not <em>only</em> communications software and HR tech that are going to see a changed world. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/for-investors-future-of-work-isnt-only-about-hr/">Give it a read</a>!</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259039" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/wayve-raises-200m-series-b-led-by-eclipse-for-its-ai-for-autonomous-delivery-vehicles/">British startup snags $200M for autonomous delivery</a>: Wayve just landed nine figures of capital to keep working on “robo-deliveries and logistics” through the power of autonomous vehicles. This round caught my eye not simply due to its scale, but also the fact that I was, until I read it, completely unfamiliar with Wayve. The startup market is now so big that even mega-rounds can crop up seemingly from nowhere!</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/roll-app-creator-platform/">Roll bets that private photos are the future of creator-fan relationships</a>: The creator economy continues to attract founder attention in 2022, today’s launch of Roll reminds us. The app wants to “give fans access to their favorite creators’ camera rolls,” per the startup’s CEO. It doesn’t <em>literally</em> give access to camera rolls as that would be, we noted, “a disaster waiting to happen,” but the idea is unpublished photos from creator to fan, for a recurring fee. Let’s see how it performs in-market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/mustard-looks-beyond-baseball-as-it-raises-another-3-75m-for-sensor-free-sports-coaching/">Mustard’s sports coaching software raises more capital</a>: After securing $1.7 million back in 2020, Mustard went back to the capital well to raise $3.75 million more, it announced today. The startup is expanding its “sensor-free approach to [sports] data capture” to new domains, TechCrunch reports. The app picked up funds from a number of athletes as part of the round, which could help it secure a larger audience.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/upward-plans-to-open-a-250000-square-foot-vertical-farm-in-pa-early-next-year/">Hell yeah, vertical farming</a>: The idea behind vertical farming — that we should grow food <em>up</em>, instead of<em> wide</em> in urban environments — rules. Why? The potential for fresher food and lower carbon footprints for our eats. Upward, a startup in the vertical farming space, announced that it is going to build a 250,000-square-foot facility in Pennsylvania next year. We want a tour.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/smart-calendar-tool-clockwise-raises-45m-to-use-ai-to-help-remote-teams-avoid-burnout/">Clockwise wants to make your clock, well, more wise</a>: Meeting culture is hell on productivity, and despite everyone claiming that their company doesn’t overly index on meetings, most do regardless. Clockwise landed $45 million in a Series C for its solution to the problem. Per TechCrunch, the startup “uses artificial intelligence to help teams free up their workdays and avoid the challenges associated with remote and hybrid workplaces, such as burnout.” If it works, it sounds pretty neat.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/appcues-nabs-32-1m-for-analytics-and-no-code-tools-to-fix-user-onboarding/">Appcues raises $32.1M for no-code user onboarding</a>: Taking the no-code approach and applying it to different pain points in the user journey is big business. Appcues’ focus on onboarding is apparently finding traction, its new funding round hints. It’s worth noting at this juncture that no-code has gone from buzzword to fad to standard business practice for startups. Why? My guess is that it’s a result of a general developer shortage around the world — and folks just got tired of waiting for eng teams to get to their ticket.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s just the start. The startup game is at full-boil this January, with news landing like raindrops in a storm. Also on TechCrunch today was news about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/castiron-serves-up-a-6m-seed-round-to-support-food-artisans/">what Castiron is up to</a> and what the term “food artisans” means, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/pinwheel-raises-50m-series-b-at-500m-valuation-for-its-income-verification-apis/">Pinwheel raising $50 million in a huge Series B</a>, and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/open-source-developers-who-work-for-free-are-discovering-they-have-power/">great column from Owen Williams</a> about the open-source world and how the free workers who help keep the world running are discovering their true power – which, you know, impacts essentially every single startup in the market today.</p>
<h2 class="article__title">Will quantum computing remain the domain of the specialist VC?</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2258963" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2258963" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2258963" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1346925522.jpg" alt="Central Computer Processor digital technology and innovations" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1346925522.jpg 1400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1346925522.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1346925522.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1346925522.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1346925522.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1346925522.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2258963" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=creative&amp;photographer=Olemedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olemedia <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a> / Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>Quantum computing&#8217;s potential applications include machine learning and computer-aided drug design, but the industry is still very much in its early days.</p>
<p>In 2021, there were approximately 90 quantum investments that totaled $1.4 billion. A significant jump from $700 million the year before, but compared to SaaS, not even a drop in the bucket.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Even so, we&#8217;re already seeing quantum exits: IonQ reached a $2 billion valuation after its 2021 SPAC, and Rigetti plans to do the same this year as it develops its superconducting quantum computer.</p>
<p>In a comprehensive market map of the quantum computing industry, Maria Lepskaya, a senior associate at Runa Capital, sorted the top companies in the space into 12</p>

<h2><strong>Big Tech Inc.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/snapchat-fentanyl-opioid-crisis-update/">Snap cracks down on drug deals</a>: In the wake of an external investigation into folks dying after buying pills on the social service that were laced with fentanyl, Snap claims that it is making progress in finding and removing sales-related content.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/blink-charging-to-supply-ev-chargers-to-general-motors-dealerships/">GM taps Blink Charging for EV chargers</a>: As traditional car companies push headfirst into the electric car game, they need help at times. GM, the U.S. transit behemoth, for example, is tapping an external company to help equip its dealerships with charging points. TechCrunch notes that Blink has “around 30,000 EV chargers set up across 13 countries,” meaning that it has the experience it likely needs to tackle GM’s physical footprint.</li>
<li>And to close out the day’s news roundup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/twitter-expands-misinformation-reporting-feature-to-more-international-markets/">Twitter is expanding its misinformation reporting feature to more international markets</a>, which sounds like a good, if late, idea.</li>

<p>Buying SolAero, a 24-year-old, New Mexico-based company, means Rocket Lab now has another key supplier in-house for its satellite manufacturing. At the same time, having access to Rocket Lab&#8217;s resources will give SolAero the manufacturing capability needed to boost high-volume production and scale, meaning it can better supply other customers, too.</p>
<p>The acquisition helps Rocket Lab&#8217;s long term vision by supporting the company to capture more of the space market, Morgan Bailey, director of communications, told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259067" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;As an example, Rocket Lab may not be launching a specific spacecraft with Electron or Neutron, but by supplying solar panels or other components such as star trackers, reaction wheels, flight software, separation systems, we’re still able to capture revenue and play a role in the mission,&#8221; said Bailey. &#8220;Naturally, SolAero technology will also be incorporated into Rocket Lab’s own line of Photon spacecraft, further supporting our strategy of vertical integration.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deal was originally announced, pending certain closing conditions, in December 2021, just a few months after Rocket Lab announced the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/rocket-lab-acquires-spaceflight-software-and-mission-simulation-company-asi-for-40m/">acquisition of Colorado-based Advanced Solutions</a>, Inc. (ASI), a space software company, for $40 million. The ASI acquisition aimed to help Rocket Lab build out its Space Systems division and achieve its goal of becoming an &#8220;end-to-end&#8221; space company, one that spans spacecraft manufacture, satellite subsystems, flight software, ground operations and launch, according to the company.</p>
<p>The SolAero merger also follows the acquisitions of Planetary Systems Corporation in December 2021, a spacecraft separation systems company, and Sinclair Interplanetary in April 2020, a satellite components manufacturer.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“SolAero is a highly complementary addition to Rocket Lab’s vertically integrated business model, enabling us to deliver complete space mission solutions for our customers,&#8221; said Rocket Lab CEO and founder Peter Beck in a statement. &#8220;With more than 1,000 successful missions under their belt, the team at SolAero have enabled trailblazing missions, providing space solar power solutions for the James Webb Space Telescope, and missions on Mars including InSight and Ingenuity.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Mars Insight Lander was the largest solar array ever deployed on the surface of Mars, and Ingenuity was the helicopter that successfully flew on Mars in April last year.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">SolAero&#8217;s products have supplied power to NASA&#8217;s Parker Solar Probe and several Cygnus Cargo Resupply Missions to the International Space Station. The company has also provided power to OneWeb&#8217;s broadband constellation, and it has been selected to supply Solar Power Modules for NASA&#8217;s Artemis lunar exploration plans, which should enable future missions to Mars.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">SolAero&#8217;s team of 425 will be joining Rocket Lab, bringing the company&#8217;s total headcount to more than 1,100 employees across its facilities in California, Virginia, Colorado, Maryland, Toronto, New Zealand and now Albuquerque. The team will continue to be led by President and CEO Brad Clevenger.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volkswagen and Bosch have signed a memorandum of understanding to explore a joint venture dedicated to providing Europe with battery equipment solutions. The two companies aim to supply integrated battery production systems and on-site ramp-up and maintenance support for battery cell and system manufacturers, Volkswagen said.</p>
<p>The JV is expected to help VW reach its goal to build six cell factories by 2030, but it will also be available to serve other factories across Europe. The companies did not share how much they would invest in the venture.</p>
<p>As automakers set ever more ambitious targets to deliver millions of electric vehicles in the next few years, they&#8217;re working on becoming more self-sustaining and less reliant on getting their battery supplies from abroad, which has become even more problematic with pandemic-related supply chain issues. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/automakers-have-battery-anxiety-so-theyre-taking-control-of-the-supply/">2021 saw a string of battery joint ventures between automakers and cell suppliers</a> keen to build battery cell production facilities close to home, but VW was already there with a <a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagen-and-northvolt-form-joint-venture-for-battery-production-5316" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 JV with Northvolt</a> and its first planned production facility in Saltzgitter, Germany.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259049" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Europe has the unique chance to become a global battery powerhouse in the years to come,&#8221; said Thomas Schmall, a VW board member responsible for the automaker&#8217;s battery plans, <a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagen-and-bosch-want-to-industrialize-manufacturing-processes-for-battery-cells-7707" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a statement</a>. &#8220;There is a strong and growing demand for all aspects of battery production, including the equipment of new gigafactories. Volkswagen and Bosch will explore opportunities to develop and shape this novel, multibillion-euro industry in Europe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Volkswagen is also joining the growing trend of automakers finding ways to diversify revenues by offering services to competitors. On Tuesday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/ford-and-adt-launch-joint-venture-new-product-to-prevent-theft-from-vehicles/">Ford and ADT formed a JV</a> to provide a vehicle monitoring system that can be attached to any car make or model to help prevent thefts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our decision to actively engage in the vertical integration of the battery-making value chain will tap considerable new profit pools,&#8221; added Schmall. &#8220;Setting out to establish a fully localized European supply chain for e-mobility made in Europe certainly marks a rare opportunity in business history.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eba250.com/?cn-reloaded=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European Battery Alliance</a> has said a third of global batteries need to be produced in Europe by the end of the decade to cut dependence on South Korean and Chinese market dominants, but so far battery cell plants capable of generating under 900 gigawatt hours of capacity in Europe are set to make up only 16% of global production by 2029.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tesla is planning to build a battery plant in Berlin with a capacity of 50 GWh next to its 300-hectare site to build Model Y vehicles, but both the plant and factory are still awaiting approval from regional authorities to begin production, despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/10/tesla-hosts-festival-at-berlin-gigafactory-to-announce-start-of-production-by-december/">CEO Elon Musk&#8217;s earlier promises that production would begin in November or December</a> last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a37594789/vw-battery-tech-new-laboratory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Volkswagen’s planned factory in Salzgitter</a> is expected to produce 40 GWh, but if the automaker succeeds in ramping up production and building a total of six factories, it should have a combined output of 240 GWh.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s a sign of the times that on the very same morning, the FTC and Justice Department <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2022/01/ftc-and-justice-department-seek-to-strengthen-enforcement-against-illegal-mergers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a thorough review of corporate merger policies</a> with an eye to preventing anti-competitive acquisitions — and a megacorp announced a $69 billion deal that would further consolidate an industry already dominated by a handful of players.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-acquire-activision-blizzard/">the Microsoft-Activision deal</a> is necessarily anticompetitive, but they certainly will have their job cut out for them in proving that it isn&#8217;t. As a publisher, platform, hardware maker and service provider in gaming, Microsoft&#8217;s acquisition of Activision Blizzard puts several of the world&#8217;s most popular gaming franchises firmly in its stable — and potentially out of arch-rival Sony&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Maybe that&#8217;s just how competition works these days. But what this FTC review presupposes is&#8230; maybe it shouldn&#8217;t?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258923" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>What exactly the new rules are to be isn&#8217;t yet set, the announcement drew very obvious dotted lines around the areas the agencies are hoping to rein in without actually naming names. In fact (as is frequently but not always the process in recasting rules) public comment is called for on all matters, so the areas of focus are ostensibly notional, though one assumes they have a draft ready now. (In fact I suspect FTC Chair Lina Khan had it in her briefcase when she was confirmed.)</p>
<p>The review would seek to revisit the conditions under which a merger or acquisition would be viewed with suspicion, such as whether it will &#8220;tend to create a monopoly,&#8221; a somewhat loose turn of phrase technically in the guidelines now but not very well defined.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4d5KDeyvdT"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/amazon-betrays-its-fear-with-petition-to-sideline-ftc-chair-and-antitrust-hawk-lina-khan/">Amazon betrays its fear with petition to sideline FTC Chair and antitrust hawk Lina Khan</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon betrays its fear with petition to sideline FTC Chair and antitrust hawk Lina Khan&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/amazon-betrays-its-fear-with-petition-to-sideline-ftc-chair-and-antitrust-hawk-lina-khan/embed/#?secret=4d5KDeyvdT" data-secret="4d5KDeyvdT" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Also under consideration would be the way markets themselves are defined, which is key to establishing anticompetitive practices. For instance, what market is Facebook in, legally speaking? Communications, &#8220;social media&#8221; (however we define that), advertising, or what? Unless that sort of thing is pinned down, companies can slip between the cracks, arguing one day that they&#8217;re an advertiser and the next that they&#8217;re a communications provider, usually whichever suits their needs for escaping regulation. (Broadband providers have been drawing out a similar advantageous vacillation for decades.)</p>
<p>The FTC will also be looking at updating guidelines on &#8220;potential and nascent competitors,&#8221; the kind frequently snapped up for tens of billions of dollars when it looks like they can&#8217;t be contained any longer.</p>
<p>Monopsony power and how it relates to labor markets is also being looked at, which is where one company (or more than one in collusion) dominates the market for buying a particular service. Say if Uber for some reason employs 90% of all personal transportation drivers in a state, what opportunities for leverage and abuse does that offer, and how can those be counteracted?</p>
<p>The most explicit call-out, however, is certainly the final bullet on the list of items:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Unique characteristics of digital markets</strong>: The agencies seek information on how to account for key areas of the modern economy like digital markets in the guidelines, which often have characteristics like zero-price products, multi-sided markets, and data aggregation that the current guidelines do not address in detail.</p></blockquote>
<p>What exactly is the effect of things like Amazon Prime, which despite being unquestionably convenient in many ways is part of a complex market and system of markets, and as such may prove problematic from a competition standpoint? Without the ability to even ask and answer such questions, Amazon will fall through the aforementioned cracks and its policies may be blindly accepted as beneficial upon superficial inquiry.</p>
<p>Asking the general public whether they think a company amounts to a monopsony, or whether their acquisition of a competitor amounts is questionable, seems on the face of it a little unaccountable. But the public comment period does two things.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>First, it creates an opportunity for soliciting broad support from the public across the U.S., establishing the process as good politics. Some canny Representative may require a bit of convincing that their constituency cares about such things. Though as we saw with the net neutrality push, this is hardly sufficient to guarantee success.</p>
<p>Second, it allows for real input from interested parties — trade associations, activists, NGOs, and so on — who can put together serious comments that make substantive policy and research suggestions. Having a basket of non-partisan think tanks to sprinkle in as footnotes justifying various approaches is a bulwark against rules being considered &#8220;arbitrary or capricious&#8221; and being nullified or challenged.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/2022/01/statement-chair-lina-m-khan-regarding-request-information-merger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A highly readable statement by Khan</a> summarizes the situation well and gives important context to the idea of updating rules — it&#8217;s something we&#8217;ve been doing all along, and it&#8217;s long past time we do it again. It&#8217;s hard to put it better than she does, with the directness that made her Amazon&#8217;s Antitrust Paradox paper so compelling:</p>
<blockquote><p>Major technological and economic changes, meanwhile, have led to shifts in how businesses compete and grow, creating new interconnections and dynamics across multiple dimensions.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that decades of mergers have been a key driver of consolidation across industries, with this latest merger wave threatening to concentrate our markets further yet.</p>
<p>While the current merger boom has delivered massive fees for investment banks, evidence suggests that many Americans historically have lost out, with diminished opportunity, higher prices, lower wages, and lagging innovation. 7 A lack of competition also appears to have left segments of our economy more brittle, as consolidated supply and reduced investment in capacity can render us less resilient in the face of shocks.</p>
<p>Just as we must revise our theories and models to fit new facts and evidence, we must ensure our merger guidelines accurately reflect the realities of the modern economy. Matching our analysis to contemporary business strategy requires that our tools be dynamic and holistic rather than static and atomistic.</p></blockquote>
<p>The comments are open now and will remain so for 60 days. <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FTC-2022-0003/document" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feel free to add your own</a>.</p>

<p>According to a spokesperson for the firm, the capital raise involved the issue of 111,173,515 new shares, which investors bought from Animoca Brands at the equivalent of $3.24 per share in a &#8220;pretty standard equity-based raise.&#8221; It&#8217;s worth noting, given that Animoca &#8212; which previously traded on the Australian Securities Exchange and was <a href="https://www.animocabrands.com/delisting-faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delisted</a> in early 2020 because “it didn’t like the fact that we were dealing with crypto,” Animoca founder Yat Siu <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/a-peek-into-web3-power-player-animoca-brands/">recently told us</a> &#8212; now operates as an unlisted public company. (As Siu explained it, the company&#8217;s roughly 2,500 shareholders can sell their shares privately to other individuals. You just have to know who owns some to buy these.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Secondary placement of shares is occurring because there was high demand that could not be fulfilled in the primary placement,&#8221; added the spokesperson, &#8220;however secondary placement is not considered part of this capital raise and any sums exchanged via secondary sales do not count toward the company&#8217;s finances.&#8221;</p>
<p>Liberty City Ventures &#8212; and earlier investor in Animoca &#8212; led the new round, along with a mix of other earlier and new investors, including 10T Holdings, C Ventures, Delta Fund, Gemini Frontier Fund, Gobi Partners Greater Bay Area, Kingsway, L2 Capital, Mirae Asset, Pacific Century Group, ParaFi Capital, Provident, Senator Investment Group, Sequoia China, Smile Group, Stable Asset Management, Soros Fund Management, Wildcat Capital Management and Winklevoss Capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to appreciate Animoca&#8217;s appeal right now. As we noted in our recent piece on Animoca, the outfit controls what it describes as a &#8220;broad portfolio of game products, both centralized and decentralized, branded and original, with coverage across most primary platforms including mobile devices, game consoles, PC, web, and blockchain&#8221; with products, including games, ranging from hyper casual to hardcore, as well as collectibles, utility tokens, e-sports titles&#8221; and more.</p>

<p>Some of those products tie to subsidiaries of the company, which got its start by developing games for smartphones and tablets and dove headlong into blockchain gaming roughly four years ago. Others represents stakes that Animoca has taken in other companies, including Dapper Labs; Sky Mavis, the developer of global sensation &#8220;Axie Infinity;&#8221; and the NFT trading platform OpenSea.</p>
<p>According to Siu, those various holdings were worth around $16 billion as of late November, though their value remains theoretical for now given that Animoca has not tried exiting from those positions. “They would be really what you describe as balance sheet items; they basically just accrue to the value of the equity of Animoca Brands,” he explained.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Animoca is continuing to invest actively. Among the outfits that have announced Animoca&#8217;s involvement already this year are nCore Games, an Indian gaming firm that is preparing to enable users to &#8220;own&#8221; more of the assets they use to play and says it just raised $10 million in funding co-led by Animoca Brands and another high-profile investor in the crypto space, Galaxy Interactive.</p>
<p>Animoca also recently led a $9 million Series A round in CryptoSlam, a Kansas-based non-fungible token (NFT) industry data aggregator, and it led an $8 million Series A in Burnt Finance, a New York-based company developing an NFT auction protocol that&#8217;s built on the Solana blockchain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Jibo may have breathed its last robotic breaths back in 2019, but researchers at MIT believe the social robot may have been onto something. Sure, the world wasn’t ready for a pricey social robot a few years back, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t some positives to take away from the experience &#8212; namely, the value of imbuing smart home products with more humanlike attributes.</p>
<p>A team at MIT’s media lab recently <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/hey-alexa-are-you-trustworthy-0114" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a paper</a> looking into the value of attaching simple human gestures to smart home interfaces. It’s worth mentioning up front here that former Jibo CEO Cynthia Breazeal, who currently works at Media Lab, was one of four co-authors of the study, which pitted the bygone home robot against a Google Nest and Amazon Echo.</p>
<p>According to the study, users are more likely to engage with both the device &#8212; and each other &#8212; more when it exhibits some form of social cues. That can mean something as simple as the face/screen of the device rotating to meet the speaker’s gaze.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259033" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Per MIT, “In the first experiment, participants interacted with a Jibo robot, Amazon Echo, and Google Home, with no modifications. Most found the Jibo to be far more outgoing, dependable, and sympathetic. Because the users perceived that Jibo had a more humanlike personality, they were more likely to interact with it, [research assistant Anastasia] Ostrowski explains.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1192682" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1192682" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1192682 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/jibo.gif" alt="" width="400" height="225" /><p id="caption-attachment-1192682" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jibo</p></div></p>
<p>Future studies will likely include additional robots &#8212; Amazon’s Astro seems like a prime candidate, effectively serving as a rolling Echo with a built-in personality. Obviously, however, full robotic functionality comes at a much higher premium. The $1,500 robot is not going to replace the wildly successful Echo line any time soon.</p>
<p>There are those devices, like the Echo Show 10, which follow the user around the room, using object tracking. Though that technology doesn’t engender the same sort of warm feelings as a Wall-E-like robot. “Users found the modified Amazon Echo Spot to be no more engaging than the Amazon Echo Show, suggesting that repetitive movement without social embodiment may not be an effective way to increase user engagement,” the study notes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Branding, too, was found to have an impact on how users perceived the devices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla&#8217;s shareholders have urged a judge to find that CEO Elon Musk coerced the company&#8217;s board to acquire SolarCity in 2016, a transaction that a group of shareholders allege was a &#8220;bailout&#8221; of the failing solar company of which Musk was the top shareholder. During a Zoom hearing on Tuesday, the shareholders asked that Musk be ordered to return the stock he received from the deal and pay Tesla $13 billion.</p>
<p>The all-stock deal was valued at $2.6 billion at the time, but Tesla stock has gone up massively since then.</p>
<p>In July 2021, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/elon-musk-defends-teslas-2-6b-acquisition-of-solarcity-in-delaware-court/">Musk testified in a 10-day lawsuit over the acquisition</a>, with his lawyers saying the CEO recused himself from board discussions and negotiations relating to the acquisition of SolarCity, a purchase that was approved by 85% of shareholders at the time. The resounding question is whether or not Musk exerted undue influence over the transaction and whether he and other board members concealed information relating to the transaction from shareholders.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2259009" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;This case has always been about whether the acquisition of SolarCity was a rescue from financial distress, a bailout, orchestrated by Elon Musk,&#8221; said Randy Baron, an attorney for shareholders, at the hearing, <a href="http://reuters.com/business/telsa-investors-urge-judge-order-musk-repay-13-bln-solarcity-deal-2022-01-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p class="Text__text___3eVx1j Text__dark-grey___AS2I_p Text__regular___Bh17t- Text__large___1i0u1F Body__base___25kqPt Body__large_body___3g04wK ArticleBody__element___3UrnEs" data-testid="paragraph-1">The lawsuit by union pension funds and asset managers said that SolarCity “had consistently failed to turn a profit, had mounting debt, and was burning through cash at an unsustainable rate,” noting that the company had accumulated over $3 billion in debt in its 10-year history, nearly half of which was due for repayment by 2017.</p>
<p data-testid="paragraph-1">Musk&#8217;s attorney&#8217;s argued back in July that the acquisition was part of the CEO&#8217;s long-term vision to transform Tesla into an energy company. The <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CEO has said</a> that combining SolarCity and Tesla was the key to his vision of combining Tesla&#8217;s battery storage product, Powerwall, with its solar roof panels.</p>
<div class="SpacingContainer__container___2kvuUN SpacingContainer__max-width___1aBoiA">At the hearing on Tuesday, Evan Chesler, one of Musk&#8217;s lawyers, alleged that the deal was not a bailout and that SolarCity&#8217;s finances were on par with many high-growth tech companies.</div>
<p class="Text__text___3eVx1j Text__dark-grey___AS2I_p Text__regular___Bh17t- Text__large___1i0u1F Body__base___25kqPt Body__large_body___3g04wK ArticleBody__element___3UrnEs" data-testid="paragraph-6">&#8220;They were building billions of dollars of long-term value,&#8221; said Chesler, according to Reuters.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="Text__text___3eVx1j Text__dark-grey___AS2I_p Text__regular___Bh17t- Text__large___1i0u1F Body__base___25kqPt Body__large_body___3g04wK ArticleBody__element___3UrnEs" data-testid="paragraph-8">Things got a bit spicy when shareholder attorney Lee Rudy asked Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights of Delaware&#8217;s Court of Chancery to consider the contempt Musk held for the deposition and trial process, in which he repeatedly insulted shareholder attorneys.</p>
<p class="Text__text___3eVx1j Text__dark-grey___AS2I_p Text__regular___Bh17t- Text__large___1i0u1F Body__base___25kqPt Body__large_body___3g04wK ArticleBody__element___3UrnEs" data-testid="paragraph-17">Slights said he expects to rule in about three months, around the same time he expects to retire. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/delaware-chancery-court-judge-joseph-slights-iii-set-retire-2022-01-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A related shareholder lawsuit challenging Musk&#8217;s giant pay package was transferred from Slights to another judge</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blink Charging, an electric vehicle charger manufacturer, will be deploying EV chargers at General Motors dealerships across the U.S. and Canada, according to the company. The startup will be teaming up with facility solutions provider ABM to supply its new IQ 200 Level 2 chargers to GM.</p>
<p>While Blink is by no means a small EV charging company, it has historically had a smaller market share compared to companies like Chargepoint, EVBox, Tesla and even Shell. Blink said it has around 30,000 EV chargers set up across 13 countries, so this deal with GM might help the company as it aims to scale even bigger and gain more brand recognition.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t GM&#8217;s first deal with Blink, though. Last April, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/gm-partners-with-7-charging-networks-ahead-of-new-electric-vehicles/">GM unveiled a plan to integrate the public charge plugs of seven different charging companies &#8212;</a> including Blink, ChargePoint, EV Connect, EVgo, FLO, Greenlots and SemaConnect &#8212; into the GM mobile app so that customers could easily find a place to refuel. Now, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/gm-says-it-will-double-revenue-by-2030-take-ev-market-share-from-tesla/">as GM plans to scale up its EV production to the point of taking market share from Tesla</a>, it looks like it&#8217;s taking Blink with it.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258964" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p dir="ltr">After receiving its first order from GM in May 2021, Blink has already started shipping chargers to certain GM dealerships via ABM, which provides EV installations, and is at the ready with additional charging stations as needed over the next several months, according to the company. There are no target charging station amounts for this agreement, nor is there a date for widespread deployment, because the purchase and installation are on a dealer-by-dealer basis. So far, Blink has seen &#8220;nearly 1,000 orders from GM dealers totaling 1,505 EV chargers,&#8221; according to a spokesperson for the company.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The deal with GM does not involve an investment from the automaker, says Blink. GM dealers are purchasing Blink outright through their procurement partner, ABM, which gives GM dealers equipment purchase rates.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Blink&#8217;s IQ 200 chargers are designed for fleets and built with local load management that can allow for up to 20 chargers on a single shared circuit without overwhelming the power grid. The 80-amp chargers provide fast Level 2 charging on a 100-amp circuit and get up to 65 miles of charge per hour with an output of 19.2 kW. It can be deployed in a wall mount, pole mount or pedestal mount.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/ev-charging-companies-push-faster-at-home-charges-v2g-and-connectivity-at-ces/">At CES this year, Blink showed off its next gen MQ 200 Level 2 chargers</a>, which will be available by the end of the first quarter. Blink did not respond to a request for information as to whether GM would be getting these new chargers when they&#8217;re ready to go to market. The MQ 200s are faster and smarter, with software that connects Blink chargers to the cloud and to the new Blink Fleet Management Portal, which would be ideal for dealership operations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snapchat has faced increasing criticism in recent years as the opioid crisis plays out on social media, often with tragic results.</p>
<p>In October, an <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/pills-bought-on-snapchat-deadly/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NBC investigation</a> reported the stories of a number of young people aged 13 to 23 who died after purchasing fentanyl-laced pills on Snapchat. That month, Snapchat parent company Snap committed to improving its ability to detect illicit drug sales on the social network and began ushering users who search for drug-related content to an educational harm reduction portal.</p>
<p>Snapchat provided a glimpse at its progress Tuesday, noting that 88% of the drug-related content it finds is now identified proactively by automated systems, with community reporting accounting for the other 12%. Snap says this number is up by a third since its October update, indicating that more of this content is being detected before being identified by users.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258868" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Since this fall, we have also seen another important indicator of progress: a decline in community-reported content related to drug sales,&#8221; Snap wrote in a <a href="https://snap.com/en-US/safety-and-impact/post/expanding-our-work-to-combat-the-fentanyl-epidemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>. &#8220;In September, over 23% of drug-related reports from Snapchatters contained content specifically related to sales, and as a result of proactive detection work, we have driven that down to 16% as of this month. This marks a decline of 31% in drug-related reports. We will keep working to get this number as low as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company says that it also recently introduced a new safeguard that prevents 13 to 17-year-old users from showing up in its Quick Add user search results unless they have friends in common with the person searching. That precaution is meant to discourage minors from connecting with users they don&#8217;t know, in this case to deter online drug transactions.</p>
<p>Snapchat is also adding information from the CDC on the dangers of fentanyl into its &#8220;Heads Up&#8221; harm reduction portal and partnering with the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA), a global nonprofit working to &#8220;prevent substance misuse through collaborative community efforts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company works with experts to identify new search terms that sellers use to get around its rules against selling illicit substances. Snapchat calls the work to keep its lexicon of drug sales jargon up to date &#8220;a constant, ongoing effort.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration published a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/dea-warning-counterfeit-drugs/2021/09/27/448fcb18-1f27-11ec-b3d6-8cdebe60d3e2_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">warning</a> last month about the dangers of pills purchased online that contain fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2016/09/29/why-fentanyl-is-deadlier-than-heroin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deadlier in much smaller doses</a> than heroin. Because fentanyl increasingly shows up in illicitly purchased drugs, including those purchased online, it can prove fatal to users who believed they were ingesting other substances.</p>
<p>In December, DEA Administrator Anne Milgram called Snapchat and other social media apps &#8220;haven[s] for drug traffickers&#8221; in a December <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-dea-administrator-anne-milgram-face-the-nation-12-19-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with CBS</a>. &#8220;Because drug traffickers are harnessing social media because it is accessible, they&#8217;re able to access millions of Americans and it is anonymous and they&#8217;re able to sell these fake pills that are not what they say they are,&#8221; Milgram said.</p>
<p>While social media platforms dragged their feet about investing in proactive, aggressive content moderation, online drug sales took root. Companies have sealed up some of the more obvious ways to find illicit drugs online (a few years ago it was as simple as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/instagram-has-a-drug-problem-its-algorithms-make-it-worse/2018/09/25/c45bf730-bdbf-11e8-b7d2-0773aa1e33da_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_38" target="_blank" rel="noopener">searching #painpills on Instagram</a>, for instance) but savvy sellers adapt their practices to get around new rules as they&#8217;re made.</p>
<p>The rise of fentanyl is a significant factor exacerbating the American opioid epidemic and the substance&#8217;s prevalence in online sales presents unique challenges. In an<a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/10/video-at-senate-hearing-on-protecting-kids-online-klobuchar-demands-answers-on-snapchat-s-role-in-death-of-young-minnesotans-calls-for-changes-to-avoid-future-tragedies" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> October hearing on children&#8217;s online safety</a>, Snap called the issue the company&#8217;s &#8220;top priority,&#8221; but many lawmakers and families affected by online drug sales remain skeptical that social media companies are taking their role in the opioid crisis seriously.</p>

		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-lepskaya/">Maria Lepskaya</a> is a senior associate at <a href="https://runacap.com/">Runa Capital</a>, leading investments in different branches of quantum technologies and advanced materials.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Market trends are the best indicators we have to judge the maturity of the quantum industry. While they don&#8217;t perfectly reflect technological progress, they showcase investors’ willingness to write checks for the industry.</p>
<p>In the next three to five years, quantum computers manufacturers are expected to <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2021/building-quantum-advantage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generate revenue of $5 billion to $10 billion</a>, according to Boston Consulting Group. McKinsey expects the chemical and pharma industries to be the first potential users of quantum computing, enabling the accurate simulation of larger numbers of atoms and molecules, which is not possible today using classical supercomputers.</p>
<p>Although many VCs seem to be new to quantum technologies, some investors foresaw this movement several years ago and are now making their first quantum exits.</p>
<p>Take IonQ, a U.S.-based manufacturer of ion-trapped quantum computers, for instance. The company was founded in 2015, and it went public in 2021 through a SPAC at a $2 billion valuation. Berkeley-based Rigetti will also go public through a SPAC this year, raising $458 million at a $1.5 billion valuation. The company is developing a superconducting quantum computer, which already could scale up to 80 qubits.</p>
<p>IonQ and Rigetti&#8217;s IPOs set the valuation benchmarks for the whole industry, which impact the valuations of all quantum deals. More importantly, these IPOs show venture capitalists could make money from the quantum industry without significant commercialization of the technology.</p>
<p>Today, a quantum processor is a complicated device requiring a lab environment. This makes cloud access to quantum processors preferable, which was not possible during the emergence of classical computers. As a result, quantum hardware manufacturers develop their own cloud-based operating systems. Right now, it is hard to imagine someone would build a large quantum OS company as Microsoft did in the 1980s.</p>
<p>“Although technology maturity will still take many years, the future winners in the quantum computing market will be determined in the next two years. We are expecting a first consolidation phase led by the 10 leading full-stack quantum hardware players,&#8221; said Benno Broer, CEO at <a href="https://quandco.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qu&amp;Co</a>. This is a path the quantum industry may follow, collecting pieces of the stack via acquisitions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today marks the launch of the <a href="https://joinroll.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roll</a> app, which aims to create an easy way for creators to make an extra buck while portraying a potentially more authentic version of themselves to their fans. Already, some creators will charge for access to their Instagram close friends story, a private Snapchat account or a secret Discord server, where they post content that&#8217;s still on-brand and safe-for-work, but maybe not as polished and professional as what they post &#8220;on main.&#8221; Roll takes this creator tactic and streamlines it &#8212; instead of subscribing to a creator&#8217;s Patreon to get access to their secret Instagram, this entire transaction can be facilitated on Roll, which is available for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/roll-unlock-creators-cameras/id1553618986">iOS</a> and Android.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our punch line is essentially that we give fans access to their favorite creators&#8217; camera rolls,&#8221; said founder and CEO Erik Zamudio. &#8220;The way that it works is fans subscribe to see content from creators that they&#8217;re not going to be able to see anywhere else. I think it lets creators be the most authentic and real versions of themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be clear, Roll isn&#8217;t sharing access to these creators&#8217; literal camera roll &#8212; that would be a disaster waiting to happen. But the idea is that Roll gives creators a chance to make money while connecting with their fans in a more casual way. Even when posting on social media is your job, it&#8217;s not as though you upload everything in your camera roll &#8212; you might take a photo of the perfect (or not-so-perfect) omelet you made, a bad selfie, a screenshot of a meme you like, or something weird you saw on a walk. Those images may not make sense on your carefully planned Instagram grid, but they could work on a platform like Roll. Plus, like a real camera roll, there&#8217;s no liking or commenting on Roll posts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258148" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Creators keep 80% of their earnings on Roll, where they can charge monthly subscriptions between $5 and $50. Zamudio says that most creators so far have chosen the $5 mark, but people making more specialized content might veer toward the higher end of the range &#8212; for example, a TikTok chef would charge more for videos with exclusive recipes than if they posted a few behind the scenes photos per month. Unlike a competitor like OnlyFans, Roll doesn&#8217;t allow adult content.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2258302" style="width: 520px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2258302" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2258302" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tana-w-App.jpeg?w=510" alt="Tana Mongeau with her Roll account open on her phone" width="510" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tana-w-App.jpeg 2268w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tana-w-App.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tana-w-App.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tana-w-App.jpeg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tana-w-App.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tana-w-App.jpeg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tana-w-App.jpeg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tana-w-App.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2258302" class="wp-caption-text">Tana Mongeau with her Roll account open on her phone. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roll</p></div></p>
<p>At launch, about 20 creators are on Roll, but the team will add 10-15 more stars each week until they&#8217;re ready to open their creator portal to the public. Roll&#8217;s current roster includes musician Dillon Francis, &#8220;Stranger Things&#8221; actor Noah Schnapp, social media personalities like Tana Mongeau, S<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ommer Ray and Stassie Karanikolaou, and YouTuber David Dobrik.</span></p>
<p>Of course, this isn&#8217;t Dobrik&#8217;s first time being involved with a photo-based social startup. He co-founded David&#8217;s Disposable, the app that became Dispo. Zamudio and three others on Roll&#8217;s staff also helped build David&#8217;s Disposable, but Zamudio left in mid-2020, shortly before the app rebranded to Dispo. He declined to say why he and his colleagues left.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/25/style/dispo-david-dobrik-disposable-camera-app.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much-hyped</a> Dispo app launched in March 2021, but just one week later, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider reported</a> on sexual assault allegations regarding a member of Vlog Squad, Dobrik&#8217;s YouTube prank ensemble. The alleged assault occurred while filming a video for Dobrik&#8217;s channel about group sex. Seth Francois, a former Vlog Squad member who is Black, posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmflQbdyULA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube video</a> outlining the racism he experienced in David&#8217;s videos &#8212; he also said he <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/seth-david-dobrik-prank-sexual-assault" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experienced</a> sexual assault on Dobrik&#8217;s set. Shortly after the Insider article was published, Dobrik stepped down from the board of Dispo.</p>
<p>Amid these many controversies, early investors in Dispo like Spark Capital, Seven Seven Six and Unshackled committed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/early-investors-in-dispo-to-donate-any-profits-from-the-photo-sharing-app/">donating any potential profits</a> from their investment in the app to organizations working with survivors of sexual assault. But even though Dobrik <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/sponsors-drop-youtuber-david-dobrik-after-his-former-collaborator-accused-n1261719" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost</a> a variety of brand deals, his YouTube subscriber count only dropped from 18.8 million to 18.3 million, and he still posts three videos per week, which rake in around 6 to 10 million views each. And now, Dobrik&#8217;s dabbling in consumer tech again. But while <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Dobrik was a co-founder of Dispo, Zamudio says that the controversial YouTuber is just a creator who uses the Roll app (and also appears in their promotional content). </span></p>
<p class="p1">“[David] was not the first large creator that committed to Roll,&#8221; Zamudio told TechCrunch. &#8220;That’s definitely something that I don’t want to get misconstrued, is that this isn&#8217;t like… ‘David left Dispo and now David’s doing his own other thing,’ because it’s definitely not like that. David’s not one of the founding team members.”</p>
<p>He later elaborated via email: &#8220;At the end of the day, David is a creative and smart individual and we’re happy to have him involved alongside our other amazing creators. We really look at all of our roster on an equal playing field and value all of their input. I’m sure ties will be made to Dispo since David has had involvement in both, but as we discussed, David is a creator (not founder or team member) on Roll.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Dispo and Roll have a similar DNA in that they both encourage more authentic posting &#8212; on Dispo, you can only see the photos you take the following morning, mimicking the nature of a disposable camera. But while Dispo is a social network, Roll is a creator monetization platform.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;After David&#8217;s Disposable blew up the way that it did, it pushed us way further into that creator economy world,&#8221; Zamudio told TechCrunch. &#8220;And as we got kind of closer to a lot of creators and just started hearing about the type of stuff they were going through, we kept hearing this one kind of problem keep coming up, and basically it was that they wanted to be able to get into the paywall space.&#8221;</p>
<p>So far, Roll has raised a $500,000 angel investor round, led by Dan Beldy of Airwing Ventures.</p>
<p><em>Update, 1/18/21, 2:30 PM EST: The article&#8217;s original headline said that Roll was created by ex-Dispo founding members. While his Linkedin says he is a founding member at Dispo, Zamudio clarified to TechCrunch that he worked directly on the David&#8217;s Disposable app and not on Dispo. The headline has been changed to reflect this.</em></p>
