										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amid a growing number of banking apps aimed at teens, Square&#8217;s Cash App today is broadening its reach by making its payments app <a href="https://cash.app/13+">available to younger teens</a> between the ages of 13 and 17. Previously, the app required users to be at least 18 years old, like <a href="https://help.venmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/209690188-Requirements">rival</a> Venmo. The company says younger teens will need to get a parent or guardian to <a href="https://cash.app/help/us/en-us/6486-authorized-users-under-18">authorize</a> their account, but can then begin to send peer-to-peer payments and take delivery of a customized Cash Card, powered by Visa.</p>
<p>The Cash Card, essentially a Visa debit card tied to the teen&#8217;s Cash App account, can be personalized using the Cash App mobile app. Teens (or any user, really) can pick out the card&#8217;s color, add stamps, draw on it, or even make it glow in the dark, the company&#8217;s website explains.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228572" style="width: 623px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228572" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2228572" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_02.png?w=613" alt="" width="613" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_02.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_02.png?resize=135,150 135w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_02.png?resize=270,300 270w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_02.png?resize=768,852 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_02.png?resize=613,680 613w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_02.png?resize=45,50 45w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228572" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cash App</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228555" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In addition, teens will be able to send and receive peer-to-peer payments with family and friends, or anyone else on Cash App&#8217;s network of over 40 million monthly active users.  Other features also mirror the existing version of Cash App, including access to spending rewards at top retailers, ATM access with a $2 fee, and support for paycheck direct deposit.</p>
<p>However, teens will not be able to access either Bitcoin or stock investing at this time, the comapny notes. Other features limited to user 18 and up include Borrow, Check Deposit, Paper Money Deposit and cross-border payments.</p>
<p>The teens&#8217; accounts are designed to be managed with parental oversight. Parents who authorize Cash App for their kids are the account&#8217;s legal owner and will be able to review their teen&#8217;s monthly activity through Statements. They&#8217;ll also be able to pause or cancel the teen&#8217;s account and Cash Card at any time.</p>
<p>The company believes the expansion will open Cash App up to a large market of new users, noting that there are approximately 20 million teens in the U.S. today, who will soon represent a greater portion of spending power in the years to come.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2228568" style="width: 623px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228568" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2228568" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_06.png?w=613" alt="" width="613" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_06.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_06.png?resize=135,150 135w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_06.png?resize=270,300 270w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_06.png?resize=768,852 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_06.png?resize=613,680 613w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CashApp13_Press_06.png?resize=45,50 45w" sizes="(max-width: 613px) 100vw, 613px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228568" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cash App</p></div></p>
<p>The expansion comes at a time when Cash App has become one of the fastest-growing digital payments apps in the U.S. Today, it counts<a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/09/20/dont-look-now-cash-app-almost-as-big-as-venmo/"> 70 million</a> annual transacting customers and, recently, introduced tighter integrations with parent company Square via the September <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/cash-app-pay">launch</a> of Cash App Pay, a Cash App-based checkout experience for Square merchants.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s growth also benefitted from the broader shift to digital payments that took place during the pandemic and its support for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cash-apps-surge-during-covid-19-pandemic-fuels-square-stock-11599039003">accepting users&#8217; Covid stimulus checks</a> and unemployment benefits. That&#8217;s put Cash App <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/09/20/dont-look-now-cash-app-almost-as-big-as-venmo/">within striking distance</a> of Venmo, which as of its most recent report, had 76 million users. Now, by opening up to a new teenage userbase, Cash App could close that gap even further.</p>
<p>However, Cash App won&#8217;t be without its competition. The mobile banking market has seen a number of entrants in recent years developing solutions aimed at addressing the needs of teenage users and their families, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/03/greenlight-is-a-debit-card-for-kids-that-parents-manage-from-their-phones/">Greenlight</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/teen-banking-service-step-raises-100m-series-c-announces-steph-currys-investment/">Step</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/mobile-banking-app-current-raises-20m-series-b-tops-half-a-million-users/">Current</a>, <a href="https://www.revolut.com/en-US/get-junior-card">Revolut</a>,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/forget-the-piggy-bank-till-financials-kids-spend-management-app-gets-gates-backing/"> Till Financial,</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/07/gohenry-a-pre-paid-card-and-finance-app-for-6-18-year-olds-raises-40m/">Go Henry</a>, and others outside the U.S. But what Cash App may have going for it is that its app is not just a &#8220;teen banking service&#8221; &#8212; it&#8217;s an app that users can continue to use even when they age up.</p>
<p>The Cash App for teens is available starting today across iOS and Android in the U.S. Teens and families can learn more through the dedicated website, <a href="http://cash.app/13+">cash.app/13+</a>.</p>

		Victoria Pettibone is managing partner of Astia Fund, a program of <a href="https://www.astia.org/">Astia</a>, a global organization that invests in women-led companies.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">There is a growing body of articles about the important issue of the lack of investment dollars flowing to Black women founders. For anyone following venture news, this data should not be new: <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/12/02/black-women-female-founders-venture-capital-funding-vc-2020-project-diane/">Fortune</a> reported that while the numbers have tripled since 2018, Black women still only receive 0.27% of all venture dollars in the U.S.;<a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/black-entrepreneurs-vc-funding/"> Sifted</a> reported the number in the U.K. to be 0.24%.</p>
<p>But data, though important for building a case, rarely seems to change behavior (just look at vaccination rates or climate change policy). And data does not begin to articulate the complexity and interconnectedness of the hurdles and barriers causing those numbers, meaning that even well-intentioned investors may be unwittingly contributing to the paltry statistics.</p>
<p>We must do better. As we have worked at Astia to improve our own investment statistics around racial inclusion, we have come face-to-face with some of the nuances behind the numbers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2223454" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As a white female investor, I am conscious that my vantage point is one of privilege looking from the outside in, and that there are many more layers that I am not in a position to address. I believe, however, it is important to share some of what I have observed as these are problems that must be addressed &#8212; not just talked about &#8212; by all investors if we are ever to actually change the investment landscape.</p>
<p>Attention must be paid to the many repercussions of the prior-funding hurdle. Because systemic racism in the U.S. has stymied wealth creation over generations for Black women, most Black women founders do not have family and close friends to tap into for that first essential round of funding.</p>
<p>Even if a CEO has broken through barriers and made it to a top university, as was the case in one Astia deal I led, she is less likely to be included in the kind of network that could provide that initial round of funding because networks still, for the most part, divide along gender and race.</p>
<p>One outcome of this lack of a &#8220;friends and family round&#8221; is that a CEO ends up raising in dribs and drabs over many years with smaller check sizes spaced out over a longer time. This can result in her never being able to make key senior hires, invest adequately in marketing or hire top legal professionals, as just a few examples.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The result is a double bind &#8212; the key performance indicators compared to competitors are deemed not good enough to attract investment, but without investment, those KPIs cannot be improved.</p>
<p>Another outcome of raising small checks over time is a cap table can become bloated with hundreds of investors. Most VCs walk away from such a large cap table, missing out on potentially great companies founded by CEOs who lack a wealthy circle of initial investors.</p>
<p>In these moments, it is important to double down and do the work to get the company investment-ready, as a large and potentially messy cap table is the result of a problem with the system, rather than the company or an entrepreneurial red flag.</p>
<p>Coupled with the above, what I have observed is that investors judge Black women to a far higher standard than their counterparts, including white women and <em>especially</em> white men. Rather than being praised for how much she has accomplished with such limited resources, she is judged for what she has achieved to date and not a day further.</p>
<p>Conversely, men &#8212; again, especially white men &#8212; are judged on the vision of what they <em>will</em> create, the promise of what will be. In all cases, when I held conversations with potential syndicate investors, I was struck by how often the reasons for not investing sounded rational but never would have been reasons to <em>not</em> invest were the founder a white man.</p>
<p>Because the reasons sound rational and are connected to KPIs, however, the investor can avoid considering that their own bias might be at play. Never did an investor flip their logic and remark how incredible it was that the KPIs were what they were given the meager funding history to date.</p>
<p>We need to shift the perspective from one of insufficiency &#8212; what hasn’t the founder accomplished? &#8212; to one of opportunity &#8212; what <em>has</em> she accomplished despite the odds and what could be accomplished with resources?</p>
<hr />
<p>The first time I heard an investor use the word “trust” when discussing his interest (or lack thereof) in investing in a Black woman founder, I was struck.</p>
<p>In my experience, that word had never come up in conversations about non-Black CEOs. “I don’t trust her numbers<em>”</em> is a different sentiment than &#8220;That’s an aggressive financial projection,<em>&#8220;</em> which would be the more likely phrasing if she were a man (and were she a man, the reaction would more likely be, &#8220;That CEO has great vision&#8221;).</p>
<p>A huge driver of early-stage investing is betting on the CEO and their team. But through media depictions of male leadership, stories and culture, we have, for the most part, been socialized to more easily <em>trust</em> a white male persona, so when it comes to early-stage investing, this concept of trust is quite insidious.</p>
<p>It is important we pay attention to what words and concepts are being used and point out when words like <em>trust</em> are thrown around. We must question the investor to look deeply at where that is coming from and try to help them see that they are applying a biased lens to their assessment. Sometimes having an uncomfortable conversation directly can help shift a perspective.</p>
<p>Venture capital places substantial value on a company having a lead investor who brings in a significant portion of the round. This construct is potentially problematic for the success of Black women CEOs given that less than 0.3% of venture capital is invested into them. Not only this, but the majority of new funds coming to market that have a focus on underrepresented founders are sub-$100-million funds, due in part to allocators not committing enough capital to that segment (but that is the subject for another column entirely).</p>
<p>Taking these stats into consideration, finding a lead investor who can support a majority of the round is far more challenging &#8212; if not impossible &#8212; for a Black woman CEO. While having one investor negotiate and set terms can be helpful, the idea that a lead has to take a majority position in the round is one that we have chosen to ignore.</p>
<p>Twice we have led the deal into a company run by a Black woman with only a fraction of the full raise to deploy. Eyebrows were raised, especially when we claimed a board seat. We countered those raised eyebrows by saying, &#8220;If you would like to lead, please step in.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one did in either case. By putting a stake in the ground, however, and backing the companies with our reputation, support, contacts and connections, we were able to start attracting additional investment. So while Silicon Valley lawyers or other investors may insist “that’s not how it is done,” remember that what they are saying is “that is not how it is done for white men”<em> &#8212;</em> and go ahead and be a non-traditional lead.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it often seems that naysayers need to experience the problem themselves or be overridden by converts. In the case of funding to Black women CEOs, the overall trend may not change very much until the small number of VCs who are making the bets on Black women CEOs show the world that those bets are paying off.</p>
<p>Happily, there are several new firms taking proactive steps to invest in Black women CEOs, but many have limited pools of capital dedicated to that strategy. My experience with the deals I’ve worked on was that I often had to call upon social capital to pressure other investors to step up as advocates within their own investment committees.</p>
<p>Extra time and thought were required to clean up the historic investment mess that was a result of the prior lack of funding and get the company investment-ready. With far less capital to deploy than I would have wanted, we had to structure investor-attractive deals that gave other investors little reason to say “no” and forced them to push past their biases.</p>
<p>For two of the deals, we held a first close at only 15% of the round, which also raised eyebrows because, again, “that’s not how it is done,” but we had to get cash in the door to support the companies so that they could get through the raise, again due to the lack of prior funding. By taking these <em>abnormal</em> steps, we were finally able to get the ball rolling and investors started to come to the table. In one case, the story ended up a success &#8212; the round was oversubscribed.</p>
<p>But this happened due to a huge amount of intentionality, of constantly facing and confronting biases &#8212; including our own &#8212; and working through them and of learning to become comfortable with uncomfortable conversations.</p>
<p>Without intentionality, these investments could easily have not happened at all, and one &#8212; or four &#8212; more exceptional founders could have ended up out of business, not because of a lack of vision or execution or market size or product-market fit, but because of the numerous barriers tied up in race and gender and that unfortunately are too often overlooked or misunderstood, even by a “well-intentioned” investor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Scale AI, the five-year-old visual data labeling company, has <a href="https://scale.com/blog/siasearch-acquisition">acquired a small startup</a> that could help expand its reach in Europe and speed up development of its newest product.</p>
<p>Financial terms were not disclosed.</p>
<p>SiaSearch, which spun out of European venture studio Merantix, has built out a data management platform that acts as a search engine for petabyte-scale data captured by advanced driving assistance and automated driving systems. The startup, which is already working with automakers like Volkswagen and Porsche, is able to automatically index and structure the raw sensor data collected by fleets of vehicles.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228163" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>That capability fits in nicely with Scale AI&#8217;s existing technology. Scale uses software and people to label image, text, voice and video data for companies building machine learning algorithms. It initially launched to provide autonomous vehicle companies with the labeled data needed to train machine learning models to develop and deploy robotaxis, self-driving trucks and automated bots used in warehouses and on-demand delivery. The company has long since expanded into other industries such as government, enterprise and real estate and is now working with companies like Airbnb, Doordash and Pinterest.</p>
<p>Berlin-based SiaSearch could be particularly beneficial in the build out of Nucleus, which co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang has previously called &#8220;the first product of our future,.&#8221; The plan is to fold the team into the Nucleus effort, according to Wang.</p>
<p>Nucleus is an AI development platform that Wang describes as the &#8220;Google Photos for machine learning data sets.&#8221; The product provides customers a way to organize, curate and manage massive data sets, giving companies a means to test their models and measure performance among other tasks. SiaSearch allows Scale AI to accelerate its efforts and even expand the functions to support the entire machine learning lifecycle, Wang said.</p>
<p>The aim is weave SiaSearch&#8217;s tech into Nucleus to offer a full data engine that any AI developer can use — even outside of automotive or AV tech. That could prove enormously useful to any company — including robotics companies and automakers — that needs to not only capture, label and organize data, but also to have additional tools to continually redefine what new kinds of data are needed to improve algorithms used in its products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s akin to what Tesla has done, Wang said, who pointed out the company spearheaded the data engine concept to help engineers improve the Autopilot advanced driver assistance system.</p>
<p>Wang said that automotive and robotics companies have struggled with how to make the most of the vast amounts of data, especially as its fleets of vehicles, robots or other devices expand. Merely uploading all of this data back into the cloud would cost literally billions and billions of dollars, Wang said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically what every AI team is really looking for, is how do we supercharge our machine learning development and accelerate our data set efforts, as much as as Tesla&#8217;s been able to,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re just going to give them the same superpowers that Tesla has in terms of being able to constantly supercharge their algorithms with the most relevant most interesting data from their mobile fleets.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We’ll have a clearer view of 2021 when all the data trickles in after the conclusion of Q4, but it’s clear that female-founded startups are having a better year than they did in 2020.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The coronavirus pandemic disproportionately <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/02/pandemics-impact-disproportionately-reduced-vc-funding-for-female-founders/">reduced venture capital funding</a> for female founders last year, despite a greater boom in fundraising thanks to mega-funds and the advent of Zoom investing. The result was an uneven landscape in which capital flowed more towards men than was normal historically.</p>
<p>But the gender-gap in startup fundraising is closing slightly, new PitchBook data shows. Female-founded companies raised $40.4 billion across 2,661 deals through the first three quarters of 2021, almost doubling 2019’s total of $23.7 billion, and over ten times 2011’s total of $3.6 billion.</p>
<p>There’s still significant work to be done, as we remain far from even, far from fair, and far from seeing enough change to stop tracking this data set. Companies started by women still raise less and receive lower valuations from investors.</p>
<p>While the rising tide of venture hasn’t lifted all boats, we’ll use this data to explore early inklings of a comeback for the historically overlooked group, from funding to exits to decision-makers.</p>
<h2>Rising investment in female-founded startups</h2>
<p>Venture capital totals are surging around the world, bouncing back sharply from a short period of COVID-induced conservatism that caused some startups to struggle to raise capital at the start of the pandemic. PitchBook, which analyzed investment activity in U.S.-based startups with at least one female founder, shows that female founders are breaking records in this environment.</p>
<p>If you didn’t expect to see improved numbers for female-founded startups this year, you weren’t overly pessimistic: In 2020, despite rising venture capital totals in general, U.S.-based startups founded by women actually saw their deal count fall by 2%, and total dollars invested in their enterprises fall by 3%.</p>
<p>As the venture capital pie got larger, female-founded startups raised fewer dollars from fewer rounds, a sharp decline compared to previous years. PitchBook said that in 2019, female founders landed 150 to 200 deals per quarter, worth between $700 million and $950 million. In Q3 2020, the cohort only landed 136 rounds, worth just $434 million. That was in an <em>upmarket</em>.</p>
<p>In better news, thus far in 2021, the backsliding has more than stopped. Indeed, it has shot the other direction.</p>
<p>The headline number of $40.04 billion for U.S.-headquartered, female-founded startups actually doesn&#8217;t pay enough respect to the accelerating pace at which female founders have raised capital. Observe the following chart from the PitchBook-NVCA report:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2227957" style="width: 872px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2227957" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2227957 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-1.59.56-PM.png" alt="" width="862" height="496" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-1.59.56-PM.png 862w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-1.59.56-PM.png?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-1.59.56-PM.png?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-1.59.56-PM.png?resize=768,442 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-1.59.56-PM.png?resize=680,391 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-1.59.56-PM.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2227957" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PitchBook</p></div></p>
<p>The data is clear that female-founded startups just had their best quarter on record in terms of total deal value, despite a modest dip in deal volume from recent all-time highs. This chart is more than bullish, just as its 2020 data points are gobsmackingly bad.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Paytm has raised $1.104 billion in India’s largest ever anchor round as part of its initial public offering, which is also shaping to be the nation’s largest, as the poster child of the Indian startup ecosystem moves closer to listing in the public markets.</p>
<p>Blackrock, GIC, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Birla MF are among the investors who financed the anchor round, which was oversubscribed by 10 times, Paytm <a href="https://www.bseindia.com/markets/MarketInfo/DispNewNoticesCirculars.aspx?page=20211103-64">said</a> in a filing with local exchange.</p>
<p>With Wednesday&#8217;s investment, Paytm has now secured nearly half of the $2.45 billion capital it is looking to raise from the IPO. The startup, which offers a range of financial services, is seeking a valuation of over $19 billion in the IPO, it said in a call with reporters last week. Backed by Alibaba, Berkshire Hathaway and SoftBank, Paytm was<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/24/paytm-1-billion/"> valued at $16 billion in its previous funding round</a> in the second half of 2019.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228519" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The investments of $140 million by Blackrock, and $126 million by CPPIB are also their largest by institutional investors in an Indian IPO. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Dutch pension investment firm APG, City of New York, Texas Teachers Retirement, NPS Japan, University of Texas, NTUC Pension out of Singapore, University of Cambridge, UBS, Mirae Asset, and Standard Life Aberdeen also participated in the anchor round.</p>
<p>Paytm, which will open the bid for its shares for three days starting November 8, has kept the share price range between 2,080 to 2,150 Indian rupees ($27.9 to $28.85). The startup is planning to list around November 18, TechCrunch has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/paytm-seeks-20-billion-valuation-in-indias-biggest-ipo/">previously reported</a>.</p>
<p>A successful listing would enable Paytm to attain the title of the biggest IPO in India, surpassing a record $2.07 billion initial public offering by government-owned coal mining and refining firm Coal India 11 years ago.</p>
<p>Paytm launched in 2009 to help users easily make digital payments from their phones and top up credit. It has since expanded to a wide range of services such as payment gateway, e-commerce marketplace, movie and travel ticket booking, as well as insurance and digital gold.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, led by Vijay Shekhar Sharma, describes itself as having “created a payments-led super app, through which we offer our consumers innovative and intuitive digital products and services.” The startup says it has amassed over 330 million users across its services, more than a third of whom transact annually.</p>
<p>In a filing last week, Paytm disclosed that it clocked $118 million in revenue from its operations in the quarter that ended in June this year, up 62% from the prior quarter. In Q2, the startup’s losses surged to $50.9 million, Paytm said, citing additional marketing and promotional campaigns in the run up to the IPO.</p>
<p>Paytm’s IPO comes at a time when the pandemic has fuelled India’s digital economy and local stock exchanges are showing growing appetite for consumer tech stocks. Indian food delivery giant Zomato made a stellar debut earlier this year. Shares of Nykaa, a fashion e-commerce startup, and Indian insurance aggregator PolicyBazaar were also strongly subscribed by institutional investors.</p>
<p>In the filing last week, Paytm said that it plans to deploy over $250 million of the total capital it is seeking to raise in the IPO to enter new initiatives and explore acquisition opportunities. The startup’s offerings compete with a range of services including Google Pay, WhatsApp Pay, PhonePe, MakeMyTrip and BookMyShow.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Surveillance software developer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-nso-spyware-attack-215334253.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">NSO Group</a> may have a very tough road ahead. The US Commerce Department has added NSO to its Entity List, effectively banning trade with the firm. The move bars American companies from doing business with NSO unless they receive explicit permission. That&#8217;s unlikely, too, when the rule doesn&#8217;t allow license exceptions for exports and the US will default to rejecting reviews.</p>
<p>NSO and fellow Israeli company Candiru (also on the Entity List) face accusations of enabling hostile spying by authoritarian governments. They&#8217;ve allegedly supplied spyware like NSO&#8217;s Pegasus to &#8220;authoritarian governments&#8221; that used the tools to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nso-spyware-targeted-journalists-politicians-190234376.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">track activists, journalists</a> and other critics in a bid to crush political dissent. This is part of the Biden-Harris administration&#8217;s push to make human rights &#8220;the center&#8221; of American foreign policy, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p>The latest round of trade bans also affects Russian company Positive Technologies and Singapore&#8217;s Computer Security Initiative Consultancy, bot of which were accused of peddling hacking tools.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228563" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We&#8217;ve asked NSO Group for comment, although its official media contact address produced an error. The company has strongly rejected claims of enabling abuses in the past, including denials that Pegasus was used to target murdered journalist <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-26-khashoggi-saudi-arabia-hacking-team-tech-blood-money.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">Jamal Khashoggi</a>. NSO said it had blocked access for previous abuses, and it even hired a libel attorney who accused investigative journalists and their partners of misinterpretation and making unfounded assumptions.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department claims to have evidence of NSO&#8217;s actions, though. The net effect is the same. NSO isn&#8217;t necessarily doomed. Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-expands-huawei-trade-restrictions-140237627.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">blocklist member Huawei</a>, though, it may struggle to operate without access to any American partners it used before.</p>
<p><strong>Update 11/3 12PM ET:</strong> An NSO Group spokesperson told Engadget the company was &#8220;dismayed&#8221; by the decision, and claimed its tools helped the US by &#8220;preventing terrorism and crime.&#8221; NSO said it would call for a reversal of the ban and reiterated claims it had the &#8220;world’s most rigorous&#8221; human rights and compliance systems. You can read the full statement below.</p>
<blockquote><p>NSO Group is dismayed by the decision given that our technologies support US national security interests and policies by preventing terrorism and crime, and thus we will advocate for this decision to be reversed. We look forward to presenting the full information regarding how we have the world’s most rigorous compliance and human rights programs that are based the American values we deeply share, which already resulted in multiple terminations of contacts with government agencies that misused our products.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify is <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-11-03/spotify-and-peloton-partner-to-help-you-break-a-sweat-without-missing-a-beat/">partnering</a> with Peloton to launch a new dedicated ‘Curated by Peloton’ shelf within the streaming service’s &#8216;Workout Hub.&#8217; Starting today, Spotify users will get access to seven rotating playlists from Peloton instructors. The playlists include “Running by Peloton,” “Tunde Oyeneyin’s Playlist,” “Strength by Peloton,” and more. The curated playlists offer users an inside look into the songs featured in their workout classes.</p>
<p>Spotify has also launched a new “Find Your Instructor” quiz to help users find out which Peloton instructor’s music tastes align with their own. The quiz asks users a few questions and also looks at their listening behavior to find their best match.</p>
<p>Peloton also notes that it&#8217;s marking the partnership with 11 classes featuring songs from some of Spotify’s popular playlists, including “Today’s Top Hits,” “Door Knockers,” “Lofi Beats,” “Indigo,” and “Baila Reggaeton.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228510" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s worth noting that this isn’t the first time Spotify and Peloton have collaborated. Last year, Peloton introduced dozens of classes that featured songs from Spotify’s “Power Hour,” “Rock This,” and “Viva Latino” playlists. Spotify also launched a ‘Track Love’ feature, which allows Peloton users to save their favorite songs as they play during a class.</p>
<p>The partnership expansion comes as both Spotify and Peloton have fared well over the past year, as the pandemic forced people to explore ways to work out and stay motivated at home.</p>
<p>It also comes as Spotify has been looking to expand its service and partner with other digital companies. Last month, the streaming service partnered with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/spotify-partners-with-shopify-to-add-merch-to-artists-profiles/">e-commerce platform Shopify</a> to allow artists on its service to connect their profiles to their Shopify stores in order to market their merchandise directly to fans through the Spotify app. Spotify also announced a partnership with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/spotify-partners-with-giphy-to-connect-users-with-artists-music-via-gifs/">online GIF database GIPHY</a> earlier this year to enable the discovery of new music through GIFs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple is furthering its investment in Original Podcasts with today&#8217;s debut of the new true crime-focused Apple Original Podcast &#8220;<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/hooked/id1592401710?ign-itscg=80085&amp;ign-itsct=pod_show_AppleOG_hooked">Hooked</a>.&#8221; The nine-part series will explore the story of a top engineer, Tony Hathaway, whose addiction to opioids led him to become one of the most prolific bank robbers in U.S. history. The podcast is produced by Campside Media and is hosted by its co-founder, Josh Dean. It features interviews conducted over three years with Hathaway, his family, law enforcement officers, and others involved in the story.</p>
<p>While the subject matter may be compelling, what makes this podcast stand out is that, despite being branded an &#8220;Apple TV+ podcast,&#8221; the show &#8220;Hooked&#8221; is not a tie-in to another Apple TV+ series or film. (At least not one that&#8217;s been announced.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228543" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228543" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2228543" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/PD_ShowCover_Original_Hooked-1.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228543" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228505" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Other Apple TV+ branded podcasts, meanwhile, serve as companions to the streaming platform&#8217;s original video programming, including &#8220;The Line&#8221; (tied to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/originals/the-line/">warfare documentary</a> airing later this month), as well as &#8220;For All Mankind: The Official Podcast,&#8221; &#8220;Foundation: The Official Podcast,&#8221; and &#8220;The Problem With Jon Stewart: The Official Podcast.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not the first time Apple has experimented with a standalone podcast of some kind, however.</p>
<p>Last year, it launched the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/apple-further-expands-into-original-podcasts-with-launch-of-the-zane-lowe-interview-series/">music interview podcast &#8220;The Zane Lowe Interview Series,</a>&#8221; which saw Apple&#8217;s Global Creative Director Lowe having conversations with popular artists like Billie Eilish, Justin Bieber, Kanye West, Hayley Williams and, Lady Gaga. Before that, Apple published corporate news as podcasts, including its <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-keynotes/id275834665">keynotes</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-keynotes/id275834665">earnings calls</a>, and <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/artist/events-at-the-apple-store/409812684">events</a> at the Apple Store. It also once used the podcasting medium to distribute its 2019 Grammy&#8217;s Celebration, which had first live-streamed on Beats 1.</p>
<p>Although produced by Campside Media, the new &#8220;Hooked&#8221; podcast was developed through the Apple TV+ creative team, which is why Apple TV+ is credited on the podcast&#8217;s page alongside the media company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The launch of a standalone podcast in a top genre like true crime could indicate an interest in testing the market for more Originals that aren&#8217;t necessarily tied to other efforts, like Apple TV+ or Apple Music.</p>
<p>Unlike some of rival Spotify&#8217;s Originals and Exclusives, this show won&#8217;t be locked into the Apple Podcasts app. Instead, users can choose to tune in via an app of their choosing, as the episodes are published both on Apple Podcasts and via RSS.</p>
<p>Apple Podcasts is available in over 100 languages and in over 170 countries and regions across iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple Tv, HomePod mini, CarPlay, iTunes on Windows, and via other smart speakers and car systems, notes Apple.</p>
<p>But RSS means the show can also be streamed via a third-party podcast app, like Pocket Casts, Overcast, Castbox, Podbean, and others.</p>
<p>The first three episodes of &#8220;Hooked&#8221; are live today and new episodes will subsequently roll out every Wednesday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Take a dollop of machine learning, a handful of radar sensors and a market that is clamoring for autonomous cars not mowing down hordes of pedestrians, and you&#8217;ve got yourself a particularly frothy fundraising environment. Hot on the heels from the $10 million round <a href="https://spartanradar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spartan Radar</a> announced <a href="https://spartanradar.com/blog/spartan-radar-raises-10-million-in-seed-funding-to-advance-autonomous-vehicle-radar-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in August</a>, the company today announced it snagged another $15 million from investors led by <a href="https://www.primemoverslab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prime Movers Lab</a>. Additional investors include 8VC and Mac VC.</p>
<p>Not half shabby for a company that didn&#8217;t exist two years ago &#8212; it was founded in 2020. The company is putting itself in the mix in the intersection between the car&#8217;s radar and its self-driving tech. It argues that the radar technology on current and next-generation autonomous vehicles (AV) is pretty decent, but that the car often doesn&#8217;t know what to make of what the radar &#8220;sees,&#8221; and ends up making mistakes in the process.</p>
<p>&#8220;The automotive industry&#8217;s pivot to lower levels of automation makes radar more attractive than lidar,&#8221; Spartan Radar founder and CEO Nathan Mintz maintains. &#8220;While showing lots of initial promise, lidar is failing to live up to all the hype, but the need for high-resolution systems hasn&#8217;t gone away. The processing power finally exists to utilize advanced algorithms like super-resolution in real time to make radar a far better option for automakers.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228270" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company calls its product Biomimetic Radar and claims that it can mimic <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">human perception processes for enhanced focus and context. It says its algorithms dramatically speed up processing and reduce radar’s historic shortcomings, including lower resolution and false detections. This, in turn, clears the way for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_driver-assistance_systems#ADAS_levels" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADAS level 2</a> and beyond in terms of safety and commercial deployment of autonomous vehicles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> The company’s software can be deployed on almost all existing radar systems, and while the company didn&#8217;t comment on any specific deals it has in the pipeline, the two rapid-fire funding rounds would suggest there are customers waiting in the wings.</span></p>
<p>“Unfortunately, we are seeing evidence that lidar-based systems can behave like the distracted drivers they were intended to replace. Spartan’s radar systems are a leap forward in autonomous vehicle technology, bringing AVs and ADAS systems to where they need to be for the needs of the industry today,” said David Siminoff, general partner at Prime Movers Lab, who will be joining the company&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>“After billions of dollars in investments and several AV companies going public, the industry is finally ready to move beyond R&amp;D to commercialize at scale in defined use-cases like last-mile delivery, trucking and robo-taxi. OEMs and AV developers need safe, robust sensor solutions that are ready to go to market next year and we&#8217;re prepared to meet that need,” Mintz said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

Ford has <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/11/02/all-electric-f-100-eluminator-concept.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">introduced</a> an F-100 Eluminator concept that upgrades the circa-1978 pickup truck with two of the company&#8217;s new Eluminator electric crate motor kit. The powerplants, taken from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-mach-e-gt-hands-on-american-muscle-car-for-the-21st-century-100005360.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">Mustang Mach-E GT</a>Performance Edition, give the F-100 a total 480HP and 634lb/ft of torque. Ford didn&#8217;t discuss performance benchmarks or range, but it&#8217;s safe to presume you could smoke some sports cars with that kind of power.</p>
<p>The truck has more customizations beyond the EV motors, including the vertical center-stack touchscreen from the Mach-E. You&#8217;ll also see custom aluminum Forgeline wheels, a billet aluminum dash from JJR Fabrication and avocado-tanned leather from MDM Upholstery. This may look like a classic truck, but it&#8217;s not appointed like one.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t buy this concept, as you might have guessed. Instead, Ford would rather you buy the $3,900 Eluminator motor for your project car. The automaker eventually hopes to supply everything you might need for an EV retrofit, including batteries, controllers and traction inverters. You&#8217;d only want to buy the motor right now if you have the resources to complete the rest of the puzzle yourself. This does, however, hint at a future where many beloved combustion engine cars can get a second life through an EV transplant.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228477" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/clearview-ai-ruled-illegal-by-canadian-privacy-authorities/">Canada</a>, now Australia has found that controversial facial recognition company, Clearview AI, broke national privacy laws when it covertly collected citizens&#8217; facial biometrics and incorporated them into its AI-powered identity matching service &#8212; which it sells to law enforcement agencies and others.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/updates/news-and-media/clearview-ai-breached-australians-privacy">statement</a> today, Australia&#8217;s information commissioner and privacy commissioner, Angelene Falk, said Clearview AI&#8217;s facial recognition tool breached the country&#8217;s Privacy Act 198<em>8 </em>by:</p>
<ul>
<li>collecting Australians’ sensitive information without consent</li>
<li>collecting personal information by unfair means</li>
<li>not taking reasonable steps to notify individuals of the collection of personal information</li>
<li>not taking reasonable steps to ensure that personal information it disclosed was accurate, having regard to the purpose of disclosure</li>
<li>not taking reasonable steps to implement practices, procedures and systems to ensure compliance with the Australian Privacy Principles.</li>
</ul>
<p>In what looks like a major win for privacy down under, the regulator has ordered Clearview to stop collecting facial biometrics and biometric templates from Australians; and to destroy all existing images and templates that it holds.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228433" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) undertook a joint investigation into Clearview with the UK data protection agency, the Information Commission&#8217;s Office (IOC).</p>
<p>However the UK regulator has yet to announce any conclusions.</p>
<p>In a separate <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2021/11/clearview-statement/">statement</a> today &#8212; which possibly reads slightly flustered &#8212; the ICO said it is &#8220;considering its next steps and any formal regulatory action that may be appropriate under the UK data protection laws&#8221;.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the ICO declined to elaborate further &#8212; such as on how long it will be thinking about maybe doing something.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>UK citizens should be hoping the regulator doesn&#8217;t take as long &#8220;considering&#8221; Clearview as it has chewing over (but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/adtech-told-to-keep-calm-and-fix-its-lawfulness-problem/">failing to act against) adtech&#8217;s lawfulness problem</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other European regulators have already hit users of Clearview with sanctions&#8230;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Sweden&#8217;s data watchdog slaps police for unlawful use of Clearview AI&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/swedens-data-watchdog-slaps-police-for-unlawful-use-of-clearview-ai/embed/#?secret=GT1atsyXsB" data-secret="GT1atsyXsB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Back on the other side of the world, the OAIC isn&#8217;t wasting any time acting against Clearview nor mincing its words.</p>
<p>In public comments on the OAIC&#8217;s decision (<a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/11284/Commissioner-initiated-investigation-into-Clearview-AI,-Inc.-Privacy-2021-AICmr-54-14-October-2021.pdf">pdf</a>) finding Clearview breached Australian law, Falk said: &#8220;The covert collection of this kind of sensitive information is unreasonably intrusive and unfair. It carries significant risk of harm to individuals, including vulnerable groups such as children and victims of crime, whose images can be searched on Clearview AI’s database.&#8221;</p>
<p>“By its nature, this biometric identity information cannot be reissued or cancelled and may also be replicated and used for identity theft. Individuals featured in the database may also be at risk of misidentification,&#8221; she also said, adding: “These practices fall well short of Australians’ expectations for the protection of their personal information.”</p>
<p>The OAIC also found the privacy impacts of Clearview AI’s biometric system were &#8220;not necessary, legitimate and proportionate, having regard to any public interest benefits&#8221;.</p>
<p>“When Australians use social media or professional networking sites, they don’t expect their facial images to be collected without their consent by a commercial entity to create biometric templates for completely unrelated identification purposes,” said Falk.</p>
<p>“The indiscriminate scraping of people’s facial images, only a fraction of whom would ever be connected with law enforcement investigations, may adversely impact the personal freedoms of all Australians who perceive themselves to be under surveillance.”</p>
<p>Australia&#8217;s regulator said that between October 2019 and March 2020 Clearview AI provided trials of its tool to some local police forces &#8212; which conducted searches using facial images of individuals located in Australia.</p>
<p>The OAIC added that it is currently finalising an investigation into the Australian Federal Police’s trial use of the tech to decide whether the force complied with requirements under the Australian Government Agencies Privacy Code to assess and mitigate privacy risks. So it remains to be seen if local law enforcement will get a sanction.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Sweden&#8217;s data protection watchdog warned the country&#8217;s cops over what it said was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/swedens-data-watchdog-slaps-police-for-unlawful-use-of-clearview-ai/">unlawful use of Clearview&#8217;s tool</a> &#8212; issuing a €250,000 fine in that instance.</p>
<p>Returning to the OAIC, it said Clearview defended itself by arguing that the information it handled was not personal data &#8212; and that, as a company based in the US, it did not fall under the jurisdiction of Australia&#8217;s Privacy Act’s. Clearview also claimed to the regulator that it had stopped offering services to Australian law enforcement shortly after the OAIC’s investigation began.</p>
<p>However Falk dismissed Clearview&#8217;s arguments, saying she was satisfied it must comply with Australian law and that the information it handled was personal information covered by the Privacy Act.</p>
<p>She also said the case reinforces the need for Australia to strengthen protections through a <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/the-privacy-act/review-of-the-privacy-act">current review of the Privacy Act</a>, including restricting or prohibiting practices such as data scraping personal information from online platforms. And she added that the case raises<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> additional questions about whether online platforms are doing enough to prevent and detect scraping of personal data.</span></p>
<p>“Clearview AI’s activities in Australia involve the automated and repetitious collection of sensitive biometric information from Australians on a large scale, for profit. These transactions are fundamental to their commercial enterprise,” said Falk. “The company’s patent application also demonstrates the capability of the technology to be used for other purposes such as dating, retail, dispensing social benefits, and granting or denying access to a facility, venue or device.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearview was contacted for comment on the OAIC&#8217;s decision.</p>
<p>The company confirmed that it will be appealing &#8212; sending this statement (below), attributed to Mark Love, BAL Lawyers, representing Clearview AI:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Clearview AI has gone to considerable lengths to co-operate with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. In doing so, Clearview AI has volunteered considerable information, yet it is apparent to us and to Clearview AI that the Commissioner has not correctly understood how Clearview AI conducts its business. Clearview AI operates legitimately according to the laws of its places of business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clearview AI intends to seek review of the Commissioner&#8217;s decision by the (Australian) Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Not only has the Commissioner’s decision missed the mark on the manner of Clearview AI’s manner of operation, the Commissioner lacks jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&#8220;To be clear, Clearview AI has not violated any law nor has it interfered with the privacy of Australians. Clearview AI does not do business in Australia, does not have any Australian users.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The controversial facial recognition company has faced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/14/class-action-suit-against-clearview-ai-cites-illinois-law-that-cost-facebook-550m/">litigation on home soil in the US</a> &#8212; under Illinois&#8217; Biometric Information Privacy Act.</p>
<p>While, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/minneapolis-facial-recognition-ban/">earlier this year</a>, Minneapolis voted to ban the use of facial recognition software for its police department &#8212; effectively outlawing local law enforcement&#8217;s use of tools like Clearview.</p>
<p>The fallout from Clearview AI&#8217;s scraping of the public web and social media sites to amass a database of over 3BN images in order to sell a global identity-matching service to law enforcement may have contributed to an announcement made by Facebook&#8217;s parent company Meta yesterday &#8212; which said it would be deleting its own facial biometric data mountain.</p>
<p>The tech giant cited &#8220;growing concerns about the use of the technology as a whole&#8221;.</p>

<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr">
<div dir="ltr">&#8220;I grew up in Australia before moving to San Francisco at age 19 to pursue my career and create consequential crime fighting facial recognition technology known the world over.  I am a dual citizen of Australia and the United States, the two countries about which I care most deeply.  My company and I have acted in the best interests of these two nations and their people by assisting law enforcement in solving heinous crimes against children, seniors and other victims of unscrupulous acts.  We only collect public data from the open internet and comply with all standards of privacy and law. I respect the time and effort that the Australian officials spent evaluating aspects of the technology I built.  But I am disheartened by the misinterpretation of its value to society.  I look forward to engaging in conversation with leaders and lawmakers to fully discuss the privacy issues, so the true value of Clearview AI’s technology, which has proven so essential to law enforcement, can continue to make communities safe.&#8221;</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tinder has already undergone a big revamp with its recent <a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-06-22-Tinder-Expands-Into-Video-and-Social-Experiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> of &#8220;Explore,&#8221; a new section inside the app that will enable more interactive experiences, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/tinders-new-murder-mystery-themed-swipe-night-returns-november-7/">the second &#8220;Swipe Night&#8221; series</a>, real-time chat, interest-based matching and more. Now, parent company Match Group is detailing its longer-term vision for Tinder and Explore, which will expand to include exclusive, shared and live experiences and a virtual goods-based economy, supported by Tinder&#8217;s new in-app currency, Tinder Coins. In addition, Match spoke today about its broader plans for a dating &#8220;metaverse,&#8221; and avatar-based virtual experiences that may later roll out to apps across its portfolio, including Tinder.</p>
<p>In terms of the virtual economy, the first phase of its development includes Tinder Coins, which are already being tested in several markets, including a few countries in Europe, Match said.</p>
<p>Next year, Tinder Coins will become available to global users to make in-app purchases of Tinder&#8217;s à la carte products, like Boost and Super Like &#8212; tools aimed at helping online daters get more matches. They&#8217;ll also be used for new pay-as-you-go products that were previously only available with a subscription, like the See Who Likes You feature. And they&#8217;ll be used to incentivize certain behaviors on the app, like encouraging members to verify their profiles or add videos to their bio, for example.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228395" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2228443" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228443" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2228443" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-03-at-10.48.01-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228443" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Match Group</p></div></p>
<p>Longer-term, however, Tinder will evolve its app to include virtual goods and a trading ecosystem, which is being planned for 2022 and beyond. This strategic initiative was detailed during Tinder parent company Match Group&#8217;s Q3 earnings, including in its Shareholder Letter and on its earnings call with investors on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>Across its dating app portfolio, Match Group had <a href="https://ir.mtch.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Match-Group-Reports-Third-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> Q3 revenue of $802 million, up 25% year-over-year, and 16.3 million paid subscribers, up 16%. But the company was transparent about the fact that the COVID pandemic has had an impact on its business &#8212; lockdowns early in the pandemic had forced a pivot toward virtual experiences. And now, some users are still less inclined to meet in-person, compared with before the pandemic. In addition, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-02/match-forecast-misses-estimates-on-lingering-covid-in-asia?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">citing lingering COVID effects in Asia</a>, Match Group forecasted weaker Q4 growth than expected, with $810-$820 million in revenue instead of the analyst forecast of $838 million.</p>
<p>To address this changing market for online dating, Tinder has leaned into virtual experiences that take place inside the app, instead of only pushing people to get offline for connections. That&#8217;s led to the launch of Tinder Explore, and now, it&#8217;s driving plans for the forthcoming virtual goods-based economy Tinder has in the works.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2228456" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228456" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2228456" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tinder-explore.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tinder-explore.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tinder-explore.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tinder-explore.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tinder-explore.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tinder-explore.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tinder-explore.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tinder-explore.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228456" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tinder</p></div></p>
<p>According to Match Group CEO Shar Dubey, speaking to investors on today&#8217;s call, Tinder&#8217;s virtual goods will &#8220;help users with both self-expression as well as the ability to stand out &#8212; particularly in a one-to-many surface area that &#8216;Explore&#8217; experiences will enable,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And so the way we envision virtual goods is that it&#8217;s something users will be able to collect, as well as give and gift to others.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dubey said Tinder in 2022 would be working to design the virtual goods, categorize them, create their value structure and determine where to best showcase the items on users&#8217; Tinder profiles. This will involve testing virtual goods then iterating and refining the product further, based on those tests. Despite the work that still needs to be done, the exec was optimistic about this plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we get this right, I do think this could be a multi-year revenue vector for Tinder, which doesn&#8217;t exist today,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>In addition to developing a virtual goods economy inside Tinder, Match Group also spoke to its larger plans for leveraging Hyperconnect, the Seoul-based social app maker it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/match-hyperconnect-acquisition/">acquired for $1.73 billion</a> earlier in 2021. So far, Hyperconnect has not performed as well as expected, in part due to COVID and in part due to other issues &#8212; including marketing performance and product delays, the company admitted.</p>
<p>But Match still believes in Hyperconnect&#8217;s long-term value to its business, Dubey said.</p>
<p>She talked specifically about Hyperconnect&#8217;s test of an avatar-based dating app and &#8220;metaverse&#8221; experience called Single Town, where users interact using real-time audio and meet each other in virtual spaces, like a bar, where they have live audio conversations. Users can express interest in one another in the virtual world, then choose to connect privately to continue their conversations.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is metaverse experiences coming to life in a way that is transformative to how people meet and get to know each other on a dating or social discovery platform, and is much more akin to how people interact in the real world,&#8221; Dubey said of the test.</p>
<p>This type of interactivity is something Match Group eventually wants to leverage across its portfolio, the company said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This next phase of dating apps, in particular, is going to be all about richer, more organic and more akin to real-life ways of discovering, meeting and getting to know people. Technology is finally getting there. And this underlying technology platform Hyperconnect has built that powers Single Town has been built in a way that it can be leveraged by other platforms easily,&#8221; Dubey noted, but without naming which Match-owned apps she had in mind.</p>
<p>However, it seems a metaverse-like platform for dating could later tie into something like Tinder&#8217;s virtual goods economy, though the company didn&#8217;t state this was the plan. But based on current social trends, it&#8217;s obvious how a dating app&#8217;s users could one day buy items to accessorize their avatar or buy gifts for other users, which are purchased with virtual currency &#8212; much like in other &#8220;metaverse&#8221; platforms, like Roblox, Fortnite or within Meta&#8217;s (Facebook&#8217;s) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751220/facebook-portal-oculus-quest-meta-horizon-renaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon.</a></p>
<p>In its Shareholder Letter, Match Group only hinted toward the possibilities for this dating metaverse and the experiences it creates.</p>
<p>&#8220;This new experience provides a glimpse into how metaverse experiences could be applicable to dating and it is the sort of innovation that will help us evolve our portfolio as we enter the next phase of dating,&#8221; the letter stated.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re still very optimistic about the long-term prospects for Hyperconnect,&#8221; explained Match Group CFO and COO Gary Swidler, on the call. &#8220;It can contribute extremely significantly to the long-term growth of the overall Match Group. There&#8217;s many ways that we can do that. We think that we can leverage video, audio, AI capabilities that they&#8217;ve got, things in moderation, and safety. There&#8217;s a number of things that we&#8217;re working very hard at leveraging,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;The new metaverse elements and the experience that we&#8217;re seeing in that beta test &#8212; that is something that potentially we can build into either standalone app and/or potentially leverage that user experience into some of our apps in the portfolio,&#8221; Swidler said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GitHub CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natfriedman/">Nat Friedman</a> is stepping down from his role on November 15 to become the Chairman Emeritus of the Microsoft-owned service. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-dohmke-24855b10/">Thomas Dohmke</a>, who only recently became GitHub&#8217;s chief product officer, will step into the CEO role.</p>
<p>When Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018, there was quite a bit of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-promises-to-keep-github-independent-and-open/">worry in the developer community</a> that it would be an overbearing presence and turn the code sharing and collaboration service into a Microsoft-first platform. With Friedman, who thanks to his developer and open source background brought a lot of community goodwill with him when he took the job, GitHub remained independent and platform-neutral during his three-year tenure.</p>
<p>As Dohmke told me, that&#8217;s not going to change under his leadership. As he noted in an interview ahead of today&#8217;s announcement, Friedman had asked him to come on board after the acquisition. The German-born Dohmke is probably best known as the co-founder and CEO of HockeyApp, which Microsoft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/11/microsoft-buys-hockeyapp-to-add-developer-tools-to-its-mobile-effort/">acquired in 2015</a>.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228056" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;In 2018, Nat picked me to lead the GitHub deal from the Microsoft side,&#8221; said Dohmke, who had risen in the ranks of Microsoft&#8217;s developer division since the acquisition of HockeyApp. &#8220;It was a really exciting time for me. It was kind of like getting back to my CEO roots even then because I was leading all the different deal functions. GitHub has a lot of aspects outside of the product and engineering world that needed to be figured out. And then Nat asked me to join GitHub with him, which I gladly accepted. I ran strategic programs and special projects at GitHub.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228438" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thomas-82-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228438" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2228438" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thomas-82-1.jpg" alt="new GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thomas-82-1.jpg 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thomas-82-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thomas-82-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thomas-82-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thomas-82-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thomas-82-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thomas-82-1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/thomas-82-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2228438" class="wp-caption-text">new GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke</p></div></p>
<p>One of his first projects was to make <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/github-free-users-now-get-unlimited-private-repositories/">private repos free for all developers</a> in early 2019. And while most developers are probably aware of that, Dohmke himself admits that he doesn&#8217;t have the public profile that Friedman had when he stepped into the CEO role, but he stressed that his background as a developer and open source advocate fits into the overall line of GitHub CEOs of the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope people will look back on the last few years with Nat as the leader of GitHub and be excited and grateful for all the things that have shipped and made GitHub a better place for software development,&#8221; Dohmke said. &#8220;I hope they&#8217;re looking back at this era as one of the great eras of GitHub. During the time of the Microsoft deal, people were nervous about what this will mean for GitHub&#8217;s independence. Are we getting closer to Microsoft? I think we have proven over the last few years that we will stay independent, that we will stay cloud-neutral and that we do the right thing for the developers and that we put the developers first. Hopefully, they see this transition as a continuation of the tradition of GitHub CEOs being developers. The previous CEOs, we are all developers, Nat was a developer, I&#8217;m a developer. I hope everybody&#8217;s excited about where we will go as a company and how we will innovate and make developers more productive.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He did note that his overall style is a bit different, though, with his focus more on execution than necessarily being a visionary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last few years that we have been working together very closely, a lot of our styles have aligned and we have very close conversations almost daily. I think Nat is a little bit more visionary and seeing the future &#8212; and I have a little more of the execution-style of focusing on what has to ship now. But I think we both share that we are very customer-obsessed,&#8221; Dohmke explained.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, though, Dohmke, who still likes to take on a few mobile-centric <a href="https://github.com/ashtom?tab=repositories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">private coding projects in his spare time</a>, isn&#8217;t planning to make any major changes right away. Instead, a lot of what he described is the continuation of the trajectory that GitHub is already on &#8212; and to continue its march to getting 100 million developers onto its platform. In his view, there are four pillars to this.</p>
<p>First of all, the company will continue to build out AI projects like <a href="https://copilot.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Copilot</a>. As Dohmke noted, in the last few years, GitHub worked a lot on the CI/CD side of software development &#8212; everything that happens after the pull request. &#8220;With artificial intelligence and Copilot, we&#8217;re bringing this to the inner loop, to what developers are doing on their laptops, what they&#8217;re doing in their editor,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The second pillar he described is <a href="https://github.com/features/codespaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codespaces</a>, GitHub&#8217;s cloud-based developer environment, backed by Visual Studio Code. The idea here, he said, is to ensure that GitHub can meet developers where they are &#8212; and free them from having to set up complex development environments for every new project.</p>
<p>The third pillar is, unsurprisingly, the GitHub community. &#8220;If you think about creator communities today, we think about TikTok, and YouTube and Substack,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But really, open source was one of the original creative communities going back to the &#8217;90s. If you think about the early days of open source, the early days of Linux &#8212; this is all about creating stuff and sharing stuff with the world and partnering with each other to create this universe of software. And so we think GitHub is becoming more and more of a creative community, or, if you will, it was one of the original creator communities when it started in 2008.&#8221;</p>
<p>Security, in Dohmke&#8217;s mind, is the fourth pillar for GitHub to build on top off &#8212; and that has obviously been a focus for the company for a while. Dohmke himself helped lead some of the acquisitions in this space, including the <a href="https://dependabot.com/blog/hello-github/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dependabot</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/18/github-acquires-code-analysis-tool-semmle/">Semmle</a> acquisitions in 2019.</p>
<p>Dohmke only became GitHub&#8217;s CPO in August, and it looks like he didn&#8217;t expect to be in this new role quite this quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;In August, I didn&#8217;t know that I would already become the CEO, but from talking to Nat as a friend, from talking to Nat as a peer, a partner within GitHub, I knew at some point that his heart is elsewhere and he wants to go back to his entrepreneurial roots and explore the startup scene more,&#8221; Dohmke told me. &#8220;So this has been for a while coming and we were preparing for an orderly transition.&#8221; As part of his role in the GitHub leadership team, he had already been in all product reviews for the last three years.</p>
<p>Friedman confirms that he wants to return to the startup scene. &#8220;With all that we’ve accomplished in mind, and more than five great years at Microsoft under my belt, I’ve decided it’s time for me to go back to my startup roots,&#8221; he writes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;What drives me is enabling builders to create the future. I’ve loved working with and learning from developers who are building new tools and new projects, solving thorny problems, and creating magic out of code. That’s why I’m moving on to my next adventure: to support, advise, and invest in the founders and developers who are creating the future with technology and tackling some of the biggest opportunities of our day.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to blame him. He sold the Xamarin to Microsoft in 2016 and stayed longer than most would&#8217;ve expected. In part, that&#8217;s surely due to the fact that he was offered the role as GitHub&#8217;s CEO. We&#8217;ll keep an eye on what he does next. There is a good chance it will involve a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ximian">monkey</a> as a mascot, after all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/9488f53d-f57e-4a0a-919d-49010fe58123?dark=false" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. This is our Wednesday show, the time of the week when we niche down to a single topic. Today? The issue of venture capital expectations in certain sectors where startups may not be the best fit. And what happens when they raise a mountain of capital.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Natasha</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a> had former founder and present-day indie journalist <a href="https://twitter.com/fulligin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vincent Woo</a> come on the show. Why? Because he&#8217;s written extensively about Lambda School, one of our subjects of the day:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228118" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>We started with Ro, and Natasha&#8217;s excellent piece on the matter: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/ro/">Employees detail rising tensions at Ro as healthcare unicorn struggles to grow beyond first win.</a></li>
<li>Next we chatted about Lambda School, which has a well-documented history of raising venture capital and attracting controversy. Most recently, Woo published a piece about the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lambda-school-promised-lucrative-tech-coding-career-low-job-placement-2021-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coding bootcamp&#8217;s misleading claims on job placement</a>. The company is perhaps a cautionary tale of how venture-level growth can struggle in certain sectors. Education is hard and may not scale like software.</li>
<li>At the heart of conversation was a question: <em>In this time of high valuations and easy access to large amounts of capital, how can VC incentives lead some startups into a cycle of pain? </em>We didn&#8217;t land on a single conclusion, and that was kind of the point of the episode. Venture capital isn&#8217;t inherently bad or good, but the money can come with a list of demands (and pressures) that cause risk-taking founders to make mistakes. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/30/startups/">A recalibration is necessary, </a>but, as we talk about every week, the &#8220;up and to the right&#8221; market will take its time getting there.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was good fun to focus on a single topic, but we&#8217;re back with our news roundup Friday morning! Chat soon!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The market is speaking with activity numbers that lower-priced, more-useful NFTs connected to an interactive world can generate not only lots of economic value, but also lots of fans.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I&#8217;ve been thinking about the NFT market quite a lot lately, mostly scratching my head at some of the prices folks are willing to pay for certain ownership signatures on particular blockchains. I just can&#8217;t get that excited about a pixelated ape.</p>
<p>Notably, I am in the huge majority on that point, even amongst the crypto faithful. Data <a href="https://dappradar.com/nft">from DappRadar indicates</a> that in the last 24 hours, just 31 traders swapped a mere 18 Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs. That&#8217;s a pretty darn slim market. You might even call it illiquid.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>But there are areas of activity in the NFT market that are both liquid and lower cost that make far more sense to me.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220370 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-red-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Again leaning on DappRadar data, the busiest hive of NFT activity is <a href="https://axieinfinity.com/">Axie Infinity</a>, which has seen 56,099 traders execute 88,027 transactions in the last day. Axie&#8217;s world is seeing a multiple of trading activity that the second-busiest NFT grouping saw in the last day, NBA Top Shot with 16,113 traders and 27,929 total transactions.</p>
<p>We can divvy up the NFT market into a few categories, I think, to help understand what we&#8217;re seeing here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Value-extracting NFTs:</strong> The transference of real-world value into a digital item. A famous sports moment, for example.</li>
<li><strong>Value-defending NFTs:</strong> Low-volume image sets that earn digital cachet, leading to low-volume but expensive digital items.</li>
<li><strong>Value-generating NFTs:</strong> NFTs that unlock an activity that are not artificially supply constrained.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon unloaded a whole slew of new smart home devices <a href="https://techcrunch.com/gallery/heres-everything-amazon-announced-today/">back in late September</a>, but a smattering of products are still trickling out ahead of the holidays. Certainly a <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/how-alexa-can-help-you-create-a-smarter-healthier-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smart Air Quality Monitor</a> isn’t as exciting as, say, a giant Echo Show, home robot or even a thermostat, but at least the inherent value in such a product is clear.</p>
<p>The device is designed to measure the air for particulate matter, including carbon monoxide, dust and volatile organic compounds &#8212; essentially chemicals in the air that could harm you. There’s also built-in temperature and humidity detection. As<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08W8KS8D3?th=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the product page</a> notes, the device doesn’t have a built-in microphone or speaker, meaning it relies on a connected Echo device or the Alexa app to send alerts when something is off. So, one fewer microphone in your house. That&#8217;s a plus.</p>
<p>The company says the device was the product of user feedback during a testing period, noting:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228439" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p>By making small adjustments like venting rooms more frequently, opening windows while cooking, and opting to turn on air purifiers and humidifiers, testers experienced a noticeable improvement in their overall air quality. With these small adjustments, they also told us they were able to breathe easier in their homes and sleep better throughout the night.</p></blockquote>
<p>Along with alerts, it also gauges changes over time to the levels it monitors, so users can see how different activities impact these issues. The Smart Air Quality Monitor is up for preorder today and starts shipping next month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://ethyca.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethyca</a>, the privacy-by-design technology startup that has built a unique set of APIs, detection tools and analytics to make it easier for organizations to adhere to data privacy policies like GDPR, is taking a couple of big steps today as it gets deeper into the business of data protection.</p>
<p>First, the New York-based startup is open sourcing a set of developer tools it has built, called <a href="https://ethyca.com/fides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fides</a>, so that developers can build privacy tools and monitoring mechanisms directly into their codebases. Second, it has picked up an additional $7.5 million in funding so that it can continue developing and commercializing its proprietary tools, specifically APIs to make it easier for those building or monitoring privacy compliance to do so.</p>
<p>The funding, an extension to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/ethyca-raises-13-5m-to-help-businesses-automate-data-privacy-and-compliance/">June 2020 Series A</a> of $13.5 million, is coming from existing investors &#8212; specifically Lee Fixel, IA Ventures, Lachy Groom’s LGF and Table Management (Bill Ackman), and it brings that Series A to $21 million. Ethyca has raised $27.5 million to date, and has amassed dozens of customers that include the likes of Away, IDEO and InVision.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228362" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p data-wp-editing="1">Founder and CEO Cillian Kieran said that Fides was actually the motivation for starting Ethyca in the first place. His thesis in 2018 was that privacy was becoming a more critical and essential aspect of building and running digital services &#8212; not only because data protection regulations and the demands of cybersecurity challenges were increasingly demanding it, but so too were the users of those services who were becoming more aware of how their data was being used (and sometimes abused).</p>
<p>Added to that, of course, is the role of the developer, or the organization itself, in the equation. Many believe that to get data protection right, you have to build it in from the very beginning, both as a priority and as an actual technical part of how a system works &#8212; a concept that people often refer to as &#8220;privacy by design.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Ethyca&#8217;s APIs are aimed at essentially building versions of those tools to make it easier to monitor and account for privacy within an existing workflow, Fides gets to the heart of it all for those who are building, to program it in from the start. Fides itself is described by Ethyca as an open source definition and configuration language for describing privacy constructs in data and software systems. It is being released initially with two OSS tools, Fides Ops and Fides Control, that respectively cover orchestration of privacy rights in an organization&#8217;s data infrastructure, and the validation of privacy rules in CI/CD workflows.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Essentially, we have inserted privacy into the CI/CD pipeline,&#8221; Kieran said. He likens how it works to companies like Snyk, which is used by developers and starts looking for security loopholes and vulnerabilities before code is ever put into production. &#8220;Fides can do the same with the privacy.&#8221; Snyk, I&#8217;ll point out, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/snyk-snags-another-530m-as-valuation-rises-to-8-4b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skyrocketed in valuation</a> in recent times, a sign of the high priority placed right now on addressing security and data protection at the DevOps level.</p>
<p>In the case of Fides, the idea is that the toolkit will, for example, be able to detect when code is calling in user behavior, data and location at the same time. If the business doesn&#8217;t permit that, Fides will flag the relevant part of the code to fix it before it goes into production. It can also be used to automate data rights requests, such as when a person asks to be unsubscribed or have their data deleted from a system &#8212; something that typically can take many hours or weeks to carry out manually (as it often is).</p>
<p>Ethyca&#8217;s Pro (paid) tools already integrate with some 700 apps to monitor for data protection and privacy policy alignment, and in addition to the many private companies on its books, works with a number of publicly traded larger enterprises and technology companies that it declines to name (but believe me when I say&#8230; they are big and exactly the kinds of companies that have needed to home in on better privacy and data protection measures).</p>
<p>Fides meanwhile already integrates with database platforms like Amazon&#8217;s DynamoDB and Redshift, Snowflake, Databricks, MongoDB, MariaDB, Microsoft&#8217;s SQL Server, MySQL and PostgreSQL, and it has signed on Slack and GitHub as supporters of its open source community.</p>
<p>The funding will let Ethyca continue to hire to build out that commercial business while continuing to contribute to what it believes needs to be at the heart of how privacy is built in the future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our investment and ongoing excitement in Ethyca reflects the need for a developer-first approach to privacy and compliance as code,&#8221; said IA Ventures’ Brad Gillespie, in a statement. &#8220;The release of Fides is the culmination of three years of work for the team and a first step towards defining a much-needed open standard for privacy. With Fides, Ethyca shows they’re thinking proactively about how best to solve the higher-order challenges that will shape data privacy discussions over the coming decade. We&#8217;re thrilled to support them in their ambitious plan to shift privacy left into the Software Development Life Cycle through open-source developer tools.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As companies deal with a growing array of privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA, they are looking for solutions that help them not only understand their customers better, but also help them comply with those laws in a less labor-intensive way.</p>
<p><a href="https://blotout.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blotout</a>, a member of the <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/blotout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Y Combinator Winter 2021</a> cohort, announced a $3 million seed round today to help solve that problem. The early-stage startup has built a customer data platform (CDP) from the ground up with a focus on data privacy. The round was led by First Rays Venture Partners with participation from Y Combinator, Pascal Capital, Launchpad Capital and FuboTV co-founder Sung Ho Choi.</p>
<p>Company founder and CEO ​​Mandar Shinde says that companies need access to the full breadth of customer data to both understand them better and to comply with a growing number of privacy laws. He says that many of today&#8217;s tools miss key data, and Blotout has been designed specifically for those requirements.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228397" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Unlike most of the companies that analyze data post collection, we are actually enabling the pipe at collection time and integrating all of the privacy stack into the collection itself. So you have consent and collection [built] into your own infrastructure,&#8221; Shinde explained.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2228406" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228406" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2228406" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg?w=680" alt="TC - Blotout Product Screenshot" width="680" height="425" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg 3841w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TC-Blotout-Product-Screenshot.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2228406" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Blotout</p></div></p>
<p>The company lets you install their solution on your cloud of choice such as Amazon, Microsoft or Google and then capture the data as it comes into your system, using Blotout to collect the permissions and comply with each law, while giving the customer full control of the data.</p>
<p>Alok Nandan, partner at lead investor First Rays Ventures, says that Blotout&#8217;s approach to build a new compliance solution from the ground up on top of a CDP was what attracted his firm to invest in the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;A lot of people talk about first-party data, but to execute first-party data you need to build the whole martech stack from the ground up. People are kind of band-aiding it together and saying it&#8217;s first-party data by doing post facto data processing, but the way to build it is in a clean-slate way, which is what Blotout has done,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company currently has 30 employees spread out across the Bay Area, India and Europe. COO Matthew Boulos says he is growing the team pretty aggressively because it&#8217;s an ambitious product and will require lots of data engineering talent. Boulos acknowledges that it&#8217;s a challenge to build a diverse team in this hiring environment, but he says being a worldwide team helps in this regard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to pretend that we solved all of this, but one of the things that we are learning is how to not only bring in that diverse talent, but also how to create an environment that makes it possible for people to function as they are, where they don&#8217;t need to sort of comport themselves to something that may not be, but to be authentic…,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company founders went through Y Combinator last winter, and even though they both have industry experience, they felt it would give them a leg up on financing, and as today&#8217;s announcement bears out, that seems to have worked.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Singapore-based Neuron Mobility, an e-scooter-sharing company, is updating its N3 scooters with a new operating system and additional on-board sensors that will help it detect and correct dangerous or inconsiderate riding behavior. The company will be trialing about 1,500 upgraded scooters in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom over the next six months.</p>
<p>Neuron&#8217;s new scooters will rely on high-accuracy location technology and rapid geo-fence detection in order to correct or warn users of unsafe behaviors, like aggressive swerving, skidding, curb jumping, tandem riding and sidewalk riding. The new sensors and IoT layer allow the scooter to speak to the rider in many different languages and guide them toward correcting their own behavior, or it might give riders a safety evaluation after a ride and send educational materials on how to ride safely via email. In extreme circumstances, the scooter will be able to simply slow riders to a stop, combined with an audio message like: &#8220;You are leaving the service area, head back or power will be cut off.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the long-term, all riders will get an individual safety rating, which Neuron hopes will incentivize good behavior, target certain riders for safety training and ban repeat offenders.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2227494" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;But what is the actual impact of this technology layer in a real-world setting, in the hands of real users?&#8221; Zachary Wang, CEO of Neuron, told TechCrunch. &#8220;That is the key focus of the trial. We want to study across thousands of scooters and different geographical areas, working with different city councils to really understand where do we want to draw the line? How should we implement this technology in a way that best suits the needs of cities?&#8221;</p>
<p>Neuron is the latest e-scooter operator to implement this type of rider assistance system. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/bird-vehicles-can-now-accurately-detect-sidewalk-riding-and-slow-riders-to-a-stop/">Bird recently launched its new location-based sidewalk riding detection technology</a> in hundreds of scooters in Milwaukee and San Diego. Over the summer, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/superpedestrian-acquires-navmatic-to-detect-and-control-unsafe-e-scooter-rider-behavior/">Superpedestrian acquired Navmatic</a> so it could implement the company&#8217;s high-accuracy positioning software in order to detect dangerous riding behavior and stop it in real time.</p>
<p>Companies like Spin, Voi and Helbiz are also trialing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/advanced-rider-assistance-systems-tech-spawned-by-the-politics-of-micromobility/">scooter advanced driver assistance systems</a> (ADAS), but their systems use cameras attached to the vehicles, along with other sensors, to come to similar conclusions about a rider&#8217;s behavior or parking.</p>
<p>While Neuron is, admittedly, a little late to the party, it is probably the only company publicly introducing this kind of tech that has developed it purely in-house. Bird&#8217;s location accuracy is made possible through a partnership with u-blox, a Swiss company that produces wireless semiconductors and high-precision positioning modules; Spin and Helbiz are working with Drover AI, and Voi with Luna, on their respective computer vision modules.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For accurate location tracking, Neuron is implementing a multi-constellation, multi-band global navigation satellite system (GNSS), which uses radio from satellites to provide highly precise geo-spatial positioning. New accelerometers and six-axis gyroscope sensors help detect how fast the vehicle is traveling, what the acceleration is like, what angles the vehicle is turning on and whether or not it&#8217;s going up or down a slope &#8212; all of which help the vehicle determine if the rider is driving aggressively, as well as work in tandem with the positioning software to get an even more accurate location.</p>
<p>The rapid geo-fence detection takes in all of this data and processes it locally and quickly using edge computing, rather than cloud computing, which Neuron says results in 10 centimeter-level accuracy.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been working over the past 12 months to bundle all this technology together, because to make one work, we need a lot of additional sensors, and we need to be able to know the position before we can process the information locally,&#8221; said Wang.</p>
<p>While all of Neuron&#8217;s new technological capabilities are present at the same time on each scooter, not all features will be tested simultaneously. For example, in cities like Ottawa, e-scooters are only allowed to ride on the road or bike paths, so it&#8217;s the sidewalk detection technology that will be featured heavily there. Meanwhile in Australia, riders must ride on the sidewalk, so Neuron will trial its high-accuracy location technology as it relates to designated parking locations, according to the company.</p>
<p>Neuron is currently present in 23 markets throughout Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the U.K. and Korea. The trial will be taking place in<span style="font-weight: 400;"> Ottawa in Canada, Brisbane and Darwin in Australia, and Slough in the United Kingdom.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Merge, an integrations platform that focuses on B2B use cases, today announced that it has raised a $15 million Series A funding round led by Addition, with participation from existing investor NEA, which led the company&#8217;s $4.5 million seed round, and a number of angel investors. In addition to the new funding, the company also today announced partnerships with HR providers BambooHR and application tracking system Lever.</p>
<p>Merge co-founders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shensiding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shensi Ding</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilfeig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gil Feig</a> told me that when the company announced its seed funding, there were about 100 companies on its platform. Today that number is 600 and Ding noted that this now includes a number of public companies. As is often the case with seed-stage startups, Merge spent a lot of the last few months building the right tools for these larger customers, including single-tenant hosting for those enterprises that need those kinds of assurances. But the team also added features like CSV uploads, SAML SSO custom field mapping, more detailed logging and more.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s vision is to become the de facto standard for B2B integrations. Right now, its focus is on HR, payroll, accounting and recruiting, but that&#8217;s mainly because the team is still small and had to focus its efforts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228173" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2228211" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Merge-Preview-1-1500x844-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2228211" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2228211" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Merge-Preview-1-1500x844-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Merge-Preview-1-1500x844-1.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Merge-Preview-1-1500x844-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Merge-Preview-1-1500x844-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Merge-Preview-1-1500x844-1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Merge-Preview-1-1500x844-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Merge-Preview-1-1500x844-1.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Merge-Preview-1-1500x844-1.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Merge-Preview-1-1500x844-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2228211" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Merge</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We are planning on crossing many categories and not only focusing on a few,&#8221; Ding said. &#8220;This was just the beginning. But to be honest, one thing that Gil and I previously experienced at our previous companies was that those broad integrations companies are too broad. They don&#8217;t really cover enough players in a space where if you have a customer who&#8217;s on one platform, sure, that one customer might be covered, but then the 10 other customers you&#8217;re trying to onboard probably aren&#8217;t covered by those broad integrations platforms. Having comprehensive coverage in existing categories has been really huge for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Feig also stressed, Merge doesn&#8217;t see itself as a workflow automation platform that wants to compete with Microsoft&#8217;s Power Automate and similar platforms. Instead, the team is positioning Merge as a tool to help B2B companies build customer-facing integrations. The average B2B company needs to integrate with dozens of vendors &#8212; and those integrations can often be brittle. Merge offers them a unified API that can then power all of these user-facing experiences.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing these bigger companies work on or acquire products like <a href="https://boomi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dell Boomi</a> and that sort of thing,&#8221; Feig explained. &#8220;They really are still workflow automation, which are mainly beneficial for internal use cases, like &#8216;when something happened on Salesforce, notify the sales team on Slack.&#8217; The benefit overall of what we&#8217;re doing is the fact that we&#8217;re unified, the fact that you get 20, 30, 40 API&#8217;s all unified into a single format. That one build produces all of those integrations whereas those classic workflow products that more and more people are rolling out still require you to build one-by-one. They just move the implementation from code to having to drag and drop blocks in a UI.&#8221;</p>
<p>Currently, Merge features about 50 integrations. Unsurprisingly, the team plans to use the new funding to expand into more categories and to expand its engineering and sales team to do so.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Merge is revolutionizing customer-facing integrations in the B2B space by helping developers integrate fast and integrate once,&#8221; said Lee Fixel, Founder of Addition. &#8220;Their track record demonstrates Merge is solving a common problem with the right product, and we’re excited to support the company on its continued growth trajectory.&#8221;</p>
