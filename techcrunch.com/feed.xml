					<description><![CDATA[Database technology can change the world, but the world in these parts changes very, very slowly. That’s made building a startup in the sector a tough equation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every application is a palimpsest of technologies, each layer forming a base that enables the next layer to function. Web front ends rely on JavaScript and browser DOM, which rely on back-end APIs, which themselves rely on databases.</p>
<p>As one goes deeper down the stack, engineering decisions become ever more conservative — changing the location of a button in a web app is an inconvenience; changing a database engine can radically upend an entire project.</p>
<p>It’s little surprise then that database technologies are among the longest-lasting engineering projects in the modern software developer toolkit. MySQL, which remains one of the most popular database engines in the world, was first released in the mid-1990s, and Oracle Database, launched more than four decades ago, is still widely used in high-performance corporate environments.</p>
<p>Database technology can change the world, but the world in these parts changes very, very slowly. That’s made building a startup in the sector a tough equation: Sales cycles can be painfully slow, even when new features can dramatically expand a developer’s capabilities. Competition is stiff and comes from some of the largest and most entrenched tech companies in the world. Exits have also been few and far between.</p>
<p>That challenge — and opportunity — is what makes studying Cockroach Labs so interesting. The company behind <b>CockroachDB</b> attempts to solve a long-standing problem in large-scale, distributed database architecture: How to make it so that data created in one place on the planet is <i>always</i> available for consumption by applications that are thousands of miles away, <i>immediately</i> and <i>accurately</i>. Making global data always available immediately and accurately might sound like a simple use case, but in reality it’s quite the herculean task. Cockroach Labs’ story is one of an uphill struggle, but one that saw it turn into a next-generation, $2-billion-valued database contender.</p>
<p>The lead writer of this EC-1 is <b>Bob Reselman</b>. Reselman has been writing about the enterprise software market for more than two decades, with a particular emphasis on teaching and educating engineers on technology. The lead editor for this package was <b>Danny Crichton</b>, the assistant editor was <b>Ram Iyer</b>, the copy editor was <b>Richard Dal Porto</b>, figures were designed by <strong>Bob Reselman</strong> and stylized by <strong>Bryce Durbin</strong>, and illustrations were drawn by <b>Nigel Sussman</b>.</p>
<p><i>CockroachDB had no say in the content of this analysis and did not get advance access to it. Reselman has no financial ties to CockroachDB or other conflicts of interest to disclose.</i></p>
<p>The CockroachDB EC-1 comprises four main articles numbering 9,100 words and a reading time of 37 minutes. Here’s what we’ll be crawling over:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Part 1: Origin story</b> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-origin/">CockroachDB, the database that just won’t die</a>&#8221; (2,100 words/8 minutes) — Looks at the origins of CockroachDB, from the creation of the popular open-source image editor GIMP to some of Google&#8217;s most well-known infrastructure products.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Part 2: Technical design </strong>&#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-technology/">How engineers fought the CAP theorem in the global war on latency</a>&#8221; (2,400 words/10 minutes) — Analyzes the key differentiation that CockroachDB offers the relational database market, particularly its focus on geography and data storage.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Part 3: Developer relations and business</strong> &#8220;&#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-developers/">Developers, as you know, do not like to pay for things</a>&#8216;&#8221; (2,200 words/9 minutes) — Explores how CockroachDB engages with developers while also pivoting to the cloud at a key inflection point in its business.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Part 4: Competitive landscape and future</strong> &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-future/">Scaling CockroachDB in the red ocean of relational databases</a>&#8221; (2,400 words/10 minutes) — Evaluates the future of the startup within the extremely competitive landscape of relational databases and what possible exit routes might look like.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There is an art to engineering, and sometimes engineering can transform art. For Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis, those two worlds collided when they created the widely successful open-source graphics program, GIMP, as college students at Berkeley.</p>
<p>That project was so successful that when the two joined Google in 2002, Sergey Brin and Larry Page personally stopped by to tell the new hires how much they liked it and explained how they used the program to create the first Google logo.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Cockroach Labs was started by developers and stays true to its roots to this day.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In terms of good fortune in the corporate hierarchy, when you get this type of recognition in a company such as Google, there’s only one way you can go — up. They went from rising stars to stars at Google, becoming the go-to guys on the Infrastructure Team. They could easily have looked forward to a lifetime of lucrative employment.</p>
<p>But Kimball, Mattis and another Google employee, Ben Darnell, wanted more — a company of their own. To realize their ambitions, they created Cockroach Labs, the business entity behind their ambitious open-source database CockroachDB. Can some of the smartest former engineers in Google’s arsenal upend the world of databases in a market spotted with the gravesites of storage dreams past? That’s what we are here to find out.</p>
<h2>Berkeley software distribution</h2>
<p>Mattis and Kimball were roommates at Berkeley majoring in computer science in the early-to-mid-1990s. In addition to their usual studies, they also became involved with the <a href="https://xcf.berkeley.edu/">eXperimental Computing Facility</a> (XCF), an organization of undergraduates who have a keen, almost obsessive interest in CS.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">CockroachDB was intended to be a global database from the beginning. The founders of Cockroach Labs wanted to ensure that data written in one location would be viewable immediately in another location 10,000 miles away. The use case was simple, but the work needed to make it happen was herculean.</p>
<p>The company is betting the farm that it can solve one of the largest challenges for web-scale applications. The approach it’s taking is clever, but it’s a bit complicated, particularly for the non-technical reader. Given its history and engineering talent, the company is in the process of pulling it off and making a big impact on the database market, making it a technology well worth understanding. In short, there’s value in digging into the details.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Using CockroachDB’s multiregion feature to segment data according to geographic proximity fulfills Cockroach Labs’ primary directive: To get data as close to the user as possible.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-origin/">In part 1 of this EC-1</a>, I provided a general overview and a look at the origins of Cockroach Labs. In this installment, I’m going to cover the technical details of the technology with an eye to the non-technical reader. I’m going to describe the CockroachDB technology through three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What makes reading and writing data over a global geography so hard?</li>
<li>How does CockroachDB address the problem?</li>
<li>What does it all mean for those using CockroachDB?</li>
</ol>
<h2>What makes reading and writing data over a global geography so hard?</h2>
<p>Spencer Kimball, CEO and co-founder of Cockroach Labs, describes the situation this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s lots of other stuff you need to consider when building global applications, particularly around data management. Take, for example, the question and answer website Quora. Let’s say you live in Australia. You have an account and you store the particulars of your Quora user identity on a database partition in Australia.</p>
<p>But when you post a question, you actually don&#8217;t want that data to just be posted in Australia. You want that data to be posted everywhere so that all the answers to all the questions are the same for everybody, anywhere. You don’t want to have a situation where you answer a question in Sydney and then you can see it in Hong Kong, but you can&#8217;t see it in the EU. When that’s the case, you end up getting different answers depending where you are. That&#8217;s a huge problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reading and writing data over a global geography is challenging for pretty much the same reason that it’s faster to get a pizza delivered from across the street than from across the city. The essential constraints of time and space apply. Whether it’s digital data or a pepperoni pizza, the further away you are from the source, the longer stuff takes to get to you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The company behind ubiquitous livestreaming software <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/streamlabs/">Streamlabs</a> is introducing a new way for streamers to share their gaming highlights to platforms well beyond Twitch. Streamlabs calls the new tool <a href="https://crossclip.com/">Crossclip</a>, and it&#8217;s available now as an <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crossclip-clip-post-grow/id1568560633">iOS app</a> and as a lightweight web tool.</p>
<p>With Crossclip, creators can easily convert Twitch clips into a format friendly to TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts and Facebook videos. Adapting a snippet from Twitch that you&#8217;d like to share is as simple as putting in the clip&#8217;s URL and choosing an output format (landscape, vertical or square) and a pre-loaded layout.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2178092" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png?w=680" alt="Crossclip iOS app" width="680" height="347" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png 2080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png?resize=300,153 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png?resize=768,391 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png?resize=680,347 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png?resize=1536,783 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png?resize=2048,1044 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.32.16-AM.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You can crop the clip&#8217;s length within Crossclip, blur part of the background and choose from a handful of layouts that let you place the frames in different places (to show the camera view and the livestream view together in vertical orientation, for example).</p>
<p>Crossclip&#8217;s core functionality is free, but a premium subscription version ($4.99/month or $49.99/year) removes a branded watermark and unlocks exports in 1080/60fps, larger uploads, added layers and pushes your edits to the front of the processing queue.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2178091" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.26.08-AM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="403" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.26.08-AM.png 1406w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.26.08-AM.png?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.26.08-AM.png?resize=300,178 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.26.08-AM.png?resize=768,456 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.26.08-AM.png?resize=680,403 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screen-Shot-2021-07-15-at-7.26.08-AM.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Discovery on Twitch is tough. Established streamers grow their audiences easily but anybody just getting started usually has to slog through long stretches of lonely Stardew Valley sessions with only the occasional viewer popping in to say hi. The idea behind Crossclip is to make it easier for streamers to build audiences on other social networks that have better discoverability features, subcommunities and tags to make that process less grueling.</p>
<div><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&#8220;For a creator, making your content more discoverable is a huge advantage,&#8221; Streamlabs Head of Product Ashray Urs told TechCrunch. </span><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">&#8220;When you consider the most popular Twitch streamers, you will notice that they have extremely popular YouTube channels and actively post on Twitter, Instagram, TikTok. If you aren&#8217;t sharing content and building your audience with different platforms, you&#8217;re making things more difficult for yourself.&#8221;<b></b></span></div>
<div></div>
<div>Urs notes that creators are increasingly using TikTok&#8217;s algorithmic discovery abilities to grow their audiences. TikTok&#8217;s recent addition of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiktok-expands-max-video-length-to-3-minutes-up-from-60-seconds/"> longer, three-minute videos</a> is a boon for many kinds of creators interested in leveraging the platform, including gamers and other Twitch streamers.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Anyone with an established audience will find Crossclip a breeze to use too, making it dead-simple to share gaming highlights or Just Chatting clips wherever they&#8217;re trying to build up a following. The average clip conversation takes two to three minutes and is a simple one-click process. There are a few tools out there that have similar functionality, independent web tool <a href="https://streamladder.com/">StreamLadder</a> probably being the most notable, but Streamlabs takes the same idea, refines it and adds a mobile app.</div>
<p>Streamlabs, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/27/logitech-acquires-popular-game-streaming-tool-streamlabs-for-around-89m/">now owned by Logitech</a>, has released a few useful products in recent months. In February, the company launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/streamlabs-launches-a-link-in-bio-website-builder-that-includes-tipping/">Willow</a>, its own link-in-bio tool with built-in tipping. In May, Streamlabs <a href="https://streamlabs.com/content-hub/post/streamlabs-announces-integration-with-tiktok">deepened its relationship with TikTok</a> — an emerging hub for all kinds of gaming content — adding the ability to &#8220;go live&#8221; on TikTok into its core livestreaming platform, Streamlabs OBS.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cockroach Labs has many things going for it. The company’s approach to distributed database technology is novel, and it has the potential to gain significant market share internationally.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-technology/">In the previous part of this EC-1</a>, we looked at the technical details of CockroachDB and how it provides accurate data instantaneously anywhere on the planet. In this installment, we’re going to take a look at the product side of Cockroach, with a particular focus on developer relations.</p>
<p>As a business, Cockroach Labs has many things going for it. The company’s approach to distributed database technology is novel. And, as more companies operate on a global level, CockroachDB has the potential to gain some significant market share internationally. The company is seven years into a typical 10-year maturity model for databases, has raised $355 million, and holds a $2 billion market value. It’s considered a <a href="https://www.builtinnyc.com/2021/01/12/cockroach-labs-raises-160m-series-e-hiring">double unicorn.</a> Few database companies can say this.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The company is now aggressively expanding into the database-as-a-service space, offering its own technology in a fully managed package, expanding the spectrum of clients who can take immediate advantage of its products.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>But its growth depends upon securing the love of developers while also making its product easier to use for new customers. To that end, I’m going to analyze the company’s pivot to the cloud as well as its extensive outreach to developers as it works to set itself up for long-term, sustainable success.</p>
<h2>Cockroach Labs looks to the cloud</h2>
<p>These days, just about any company of consequence provides services via the internet, and a growing number of these services are powered by products and services from native cloud providers. Gartner forecasted in 2019 that cloud services are growing at an annual rate of 17.5%, and there’s no sign that the growth has abated at all.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-origin/">Its founders’ history with Google back in the mid-2000s</a> has meant that Cockroach Labs has always been aware of the impact of cloud services on the commercial web. Unsurprisingly, CockroachDB could run cloud native right from its first release, given that its architecture presupposes the cloud in its operation — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-technology/">as we saw in part 2 of this EC-1</a>.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[CockroachDB’s success is not guaranteed. It has to overcome significant hurdles to secure a profitable place among well-established database technologies owned by companies with very deep pockets.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Most database startups avoid building relational databases, since that market is dominated by a few goliaths. Oracle, MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server have embedded themselves into the technical fabric of large- and medium-size companies going back decades. These established companies have a lot of market share and a lot of money to quash the competition.</p>
<p>So rather than trying to compete in the relational database market, over the past decade, many database startups focused on alternative architectures such as document-centric databases (like MongoDB), key-value stores (like Redis) and graph databases (like Neo4J). But Cockroach Labs went against conventional wisdom with CockroachDB: It intentionally competed in the relational database market with its relational database product.</p>
<p>While it did face an uphill battle to penetrate the market, Cockroach Labs saw a surprising benefit: It didn’t have to invent a market. All it needed to do was grab a share of a market that also happened to be growing rapidly.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Cockroach Labs has a bright future, compelling technology, a lot of money in the bank and has an experienced, technically astute executive team.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>In previous parts of this EC-1, I looked at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-origin/">the origins of CockroachDB</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-technology/">presented an in-depth technical description of its product</a> as well as an analysis of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1-developers/">the company’s developer relations and cloud service</a>, CockroachCloud. In this final installment, we’ll look at the future of the company, the competitive landscape within the relational database market, its ability to retain talent as it looks toward a potential IPO or acquisition, and the risks it faces.</p>
<p>CockroachDB’s success is not guaranteed. It has to overcome significant hurdles to secure a profitable place for itself among a set of well-established database technologies that are owned by companies with very deep pockets.</p>
<p>It’s not impossible, though. We’ll first look at MongoDB as an example of how a company can break through the barriers for database startups competing with incumbents.</p>
<h2>When life gives you Mongos, make MongoDB</h2>

<p>MongoDB is a good example of the risks that come with trying to invent a new database market. The company started out as a purely document-centric database at a time when that approach was the exception rather than the rule.</p>
<p>Web developers like document-centric databases because they address a number of common use cases in their work. For example, a document-centric database works well for storing comments to a blog post or a customer’s entire order history and profile.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The more specialized the BNPL startup, the less likely that Apple's foray into the BNPL space may prove combative; the more general the BNPL player, the more likely that Apple could snag its business.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-13/apple-goldman-plan-buy-now-pay-later-service-to-rival-paypal">broke news</a> earlier this week that Apple, the consumer hardware giant with a rising services focus, is building a buy now, pay later (BNPL) service that will integrate with its Apple Pay system. The news sent shares of Affirm down just over 10% by the end of the day, and it shed 2.5% of its value yesterday. It&#8217;s off a little more than 61% from the highs it set after debuting earlier this year.</p>
<p>In light of information that Apple could cut into Affirm&#8217;s business, investors decided the former consumer fintech unicorn and present-day public BNPL company was worth less. Why? Because rising competition from a player like Apple may limit its growth over time, impacting later profitability. Or more simply, public-market investors decided that the present value of its future cash flows had declined.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not fair to focus on Affirm, of course. Afterpay is also a public BNPL firm; its shares also fell this week, slipping a similar 10% since its close on July 12, the day before the Apple news broke.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Those are just two names. There are a host of rival BNPL concerns in the world, from small startups to private-market giants like Klarna. Affirm and Afterpay, however, as focused companies in the space that also float, make for a useful window into how investors&#8217; views on the sector are changing in light of the recent Apple announcement.</p>
<p>Our question is what impact the Apple news item may have on <em>startups, </em>given that Apple Pay itself already accounts for about 5% of global card transactions (<a href="https://qz.com/1799912/apple-pay-on-pace-to-account-for-10-percent-of-global-card-transactions/">according to one analysis at least</a>). The answer, I think, is that it will vary a lot based on the focus of the BNPL startup in question. The more specialized the BNPL provider, the less likely that Apple&#8217;s eventual foray into the BNPL space may prove combative; the more general the BNPL player, the more likely that Apple could cut into its business.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995212 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Why? Distribution and customer expertise.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t to say that Affirm, Afterpay and other BNPL players are set to follow the dodo; far from it. But if Apple wades into the BNPL market as anticipated, its Apple Pay service could provide a strong distribution network that may ease consumer onboarding. That Apple has also launched a credit card tied to its Apple Pay efforts and offers a lightweight cash-management solution in the United States could also lower the threshold for uptake of the product because consumers are already becoming comfortable with Apple as a banking player of sorts.</p>
<p>Apple also controls massive digital marketplaces, albeit places where BNPL services may prove less pertinent. But it controls brick-and-mortar stores for its own goods around the world, and a global e-commerce operation via its own websites that could provide extra distribution for BNPL services from the company. Simply: Apple sells a lot of pricey products that would be good candidates for BNPL purchases.</p>
<p>All of that will hit some startups. Let&#8217;s talk about which are going to dodge the incoming competitive bullet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It seems like everything is being pushed online now, but network procurement stubbornly has remained an in-person or phone-based negotiation. Lightyear, an early stage New York City startup decided to change that last year, and the company announced a $13.1 million Series A today.</p>
<p>The round was led by Ridge Ventures with participation from Zigg Capital and a slew of individual investors. Today&#8217;s investment comes on the heels of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/lightyear-scores-3-7m-seed-to-simplify-networking-infrastructure-procurement/">a $3.7 million seed round</a> last October, bringing the total raised to $16.8 million.</p>
<p>CEO and co-founder Dennis Thankachan says that the company has been able to gain customers by offering a new way to procure network resources, which was a great improvement over manual negotiating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Last year we launched Lightyear, which was the first tool for buying your telecom infrastructure on the web. And although changing behaviors and the way that enterprises have done things for years is difficult, the status quo in telecom has been zero transparency, no web-based ways to do things, and oftentimes interfacing with really, really large vendors where you have no negotiating leverage even if you&#8217;re a big enterprise. That experience was so poor that a lot of enterprises were extremely happy to see what we put in the market,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>What Lightyear offers is an online marketplace where companies can interact with vendors and get a range of price quotes to make a more informed buying decision. The company spent a lot of time improving the product since last October when you could configure some basic stuff, get a price quote, and Lightyear would help you buy it.</p>
<p>Now Thankachan says that the solution covers the full lifecycle of services including configuring a bigger array of services, helping manage the installation of the services and helping reduce the amount of delays and errors in installs. Finally, they help track and manage network inventory and can automate renewal for a whole group of services,</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="EdTAluaPM1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/embedded-procurement-will-make-every-company-its-own-marketplace/">Embedded procurement will make every company its own marketplace</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Embedded procurement will make every company its own marketplace&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/embedded-procurement-will-make-every-company-its-own-marketplace/embed/#?secret=EdTAluaPM1" data-secret="EdTAluaPM1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That has resulted in 4X growth in just 9 months since the last round. In addition, the company had relationships with 400 vendors in October and has grown that to mid-500 vendors today. The startup has also doubled the number of employees to around 20.</p>
<p>Thankachan says that as a person of color he is particularly cognizant about building a diverse and inclusive culture. &#8220;I&#8217;m a person of color, who has been a minority in different work environments in the past, and I know how that feels and how frustrating that can be for a person who feels like their voice is not heard. [&#8230;] So I think we can start to build a culture that is not necessarily the norm in [the telecommunications industry] by trying to give opportunities to [underrepresented] people,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Yousuf Khan, a partner at Ridge Ventures, who is leading the round and will be joining the board under the terms of the deal, says that as a former CIO he found Lightyear&#8217;s approach quite appealing.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a former CIO and someone who has led global technology operations, it’s refreshing to see Lightyear transforming the way business infrastructure gets bought&#8230;I wish Lightyear existed during my years as a CIO,&#8221; Khan said in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The mystery of who will occupy the final seat on Blue Origin&#8217;s debut human spaceflight next week is a mystery no longer: The company revealed today that the winning bidder who forked over $28 million for the privilege is actually going to fly on a later mission, and instead the final seat on the debut flight will go to Oliver Daeman, an 18-year-old high school graduate bound for the University of Utrecht. He&#8217;ll be the youngest person to travel to space, which means this launch will include both the youngest and the oldest people ever to make the trip.</p>
<p>Blue Origin is planning to fly its founder Jeff Bezos to space in just a few days on July 20, on its debut human spaceflight. That spacecraft will also be carrying Bezos&#8217; brother, along with 82-year old aerospace pioneer Wally Funk, on the trip to suborbital space for a few minutes of weightlessness and unparalleled views before coming back down for a controlled landing in West Texas.</p>
<p>The final seat was auctioned off via a multi-stage process that culminated in a live online bidding rally, which brought the final total paid for the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-auctions-off-seat-on-first-human-spaceflight-for-28m/">ticket to that whopping $28 million,</a> which is much more than the regular price of the average seat will be during regular commercial flight of the New Shepard spacecraft. That winner, who remains anonymous for now, has declined to go on this one due to &#8220;scheduling conflicts.&#8221; The funds from the ticket auction are actually being donated to charity, however, rather than acting as revenue for Blue Origin in a commercial sense, going instead to its registered non-profit Club for the Future, which is dedicated to furthering STEM education.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Blue Origin&#8217;s New Shepard launch vehicle is designed for suborbital commercial human spaceflight, including both tourism and research uses. The fully reusable system consists of a booster and an upper stage that includes a crew capsule, and after a series of test flights that began in 2015, Blue Origin is now ready to fly it with people on board for the first time, as a final set of demonstrations before commercial operations start up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Aurora Innovation, the autonomous vehicle startup that acquired Uber&#8217;s self-driving unit in December, is going public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Reinvent Technology Partners Y.</p>
<p>The deal announced Thursday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/autonomous-vehicle-startup-aurora-in-final-talks-to-merge-with-reid-hoffmans-newest-spac/">confirms TechCrunch&#8217;s reporting</a> in June that the startup was in final talks with the SPAC launched by LinkedIn co-founder and investor Reid Hoffman, Zynga founder Mark Pincus and managing partner Michael Thompson.</p>
<p>The combined company, which is will  be listed on Nasdaq with the ticker symbol AUR, will have an implied valuation of $13 billion. Aurora was last valued at $10 billion following its acquisition of Uber&#8217;s self-driving unit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Through the deal, Aurora is capturing $1 billion from private investors including Baillie Gifford, funds and accounts managed by Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley), funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., PRIMECAP Management Company, Reinvent Capital, XN, Fidelity Management and Research LLC, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Index Ventures, and Sequoia Capital, as well as strategic investments from Uber, PACCAR, and Volvo Group.</p>
<p>The combined company said it&#8217;s expected to have about $2.5 billion in cash at closing, including up to $977.5 million of cash held in Reinvent&#8217;s trust account from its initial public offering which <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1828108/000119312521085839/d128504d8k.htm">closed on March 18, 2021</a>, according to regulatory filings.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a big next step for the company,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Chris Urmson said in an interview Thursday. &#8220;Obviously we need to bring our product to the market, but we really couldn&#8217;t be more excited for our team, the resources this transaction brings and our partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aurora has gone from buzzy startup to publicly traded company-via-SPAC in a span of four years. The company was founded in 2017 by Sterling Anderson, Drew Bagnell and Urmson, all whom have a history of working on automated vehicle technology.</p>
<p>In December, the company reached an agreement with Uber to buy the ride-hailing firm&#8217;s self-driving unit in a complex deal that valued the combined company at $10 billion. Under the terms of that acquisition, Aurora did not pay cash for Uber ATG, a company that was valued at $7.25 billion following a $1 billion investment in 2019 from Toyota, DENSO and SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund. Instead, Uber handed over its equity in ATG and invested $400 million into Aurora. Uber received a 26% stake in the combined company, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Since the acquisition, Aurora has spent the past several months integrating Uber ATG employees and now has a workforce of about 1,600 people. Aurora more recently said it reached an agreement with Volvo to jointly develop autonomous semi-trucks for North America. That partnership, which is expected to last several years and is through Volvo&#8217;s Autonomous Solutions unit, will focus on developing and deploying trucks built to operate autonomously on highways between hubs for Volvo customers.</p>
<h2>Venture capital at scale</h2>
<p>Hoffman, Pincus and Thompson have promoted a concept  that they call &#8220;venture capital at scale.&#8221; To date, SPACs have been the conduit to reach that scale. The trio have formed three SPACs, or blank-check companies.</p>
<p>Two of those SPACs have announced mergers with private companies. Reinvent Technology Partners announced a deal in February to merge with the electric vertical take off and landing company Joby Aviation, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange later this year. Reinvent Technology Partners Z merged with home insurance startup Hippo.</p>
<p>Their third SPAC — the one now merging with Aurora — is called Reinvent Technology Partners Y, priced its initial public offering of 85 million units at $10 per unit to raise $850 million. The SPAC issued an additional 12.7 million shares to cover over allotments with total gross proceeds of $977 million, according to regulatory filings. The units are listed on the Nasdaq exchange and trade under the ticker symbol &#8220;RTPYU.&#8221;</p>
<p>In many ways, the Aurora-Reinvent SPAC is a union that makes sense.</p>
<p>Aurora already has a relationship with Hoffman. In February 2018, Aurora raised $90 million from Greylock Partners and Index Ventures. Hoffman, who is a partner at Greylock, and Index Ventures&#8217; Mike Volpi became board members of Aurora as part of the Series A round. The following year, Aurora raised more than $530 million in a Series B round led by Sequoia Capital and included Amazon and T. Rowe Price Associates. Lightspeed Venture Partners, Geodesic, Shell Ventures and Reinvent Capital also participated in the round, as well as previous investors Greylock and Index Ventures.</p>
<p>Hoffman and Reinvent showing up on two sides of a SPAC deal is not unprecedented. It&#8217;s not commonplace either. Urmson told TechCrunch that to avoid potential conflicts of interest Hoffman didn&#8217;t particpate in discussions</p>
<p>&#8220;On the one hand, Reid, given his understanding and history with the company, is one of the people best suited to understand the opportunity here,&#8221; Urmson said in an interview Thursday morning, adding that to avoid a conflict of interest on both sides Hoffman wasn&#8217;t involved in any discussions on the Aurora or Reinveint side.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Doug Landis joined the TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising event to discuss the value of storytelling for startups -- and how to do it. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">How do you go beyond the names and numbers with your startup pitch deck? For Doug Landis, the answer is one simple compound gerund: storytelling. It’s a word that gets thrown around a lot of late in Silicon Valley, but it’s one that could legitimately help your startup stand out from the pack amid the pile of pitches.</p>
<p>Landis knows a fair bit about the concept. Following stints at Salesforce and Google, he served as the “chief storyteller” at Box. These days, Landis is the growth partner at Emergence Capital, where he helps tell the stories of the firm’s portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Landis joined us on the first day of TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising event to offer a presentation about the value of storytelling for startups, whittling down the standard two-hour conversation to a 30-minute version. Though he still managed to rewind things pretty far, opening with, “400,000 years ago, men and women used to sit around the fire pit and tell stories about their day, about their hunt, about the one that got away.”</p>
<h2>Connect the dots</h2>
<p>More often than not, decks include a series of numbers and charts. The job of a story pitch is weaving a good narrative around these figures.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you think about storytelling, and you think about the physiological and psychological elements &#8212; what&#8217;s happening between the storytelling and the listener &#8212; we’re actually looking for the patterns. If you think about it, it&#8217;s why those jingles and commercials get stuck in our head, and we can&#8217;t forget it, even though we don&#8217;t even know much about the product. But we remember the jingle, remember the commercial, we remember the brand. Because as humans, we&#8217;re looking for the patterns in our communication. Our job is to connect the facts and fill in the holes. And from those connections, we create a story. We create a story in our brain, because our brain actually processes information through story form.<em><strong> (Timestamp 3:20)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h2>Get to the point</h2>
<p>They don’t call it an elevator pitch for nothing. And sometimes even the best storytellers have a habit of rambling. Here’s an exercise for cutting away some of the excess when attempting to get your story in front of VCs.</p>
<blockquote><p>When you tell the story at work, ask your peers or the listener to share back with you in one sentence what the point of that story was. Get immediate feedback, and you can then identify whether or not your story was on target or not. The story needs to be relevant to the audience who&#8217;s there, but the reality is, you need to be very clear about the point you&#8217;re trying to make with a story.<em><strong> (Timestamp 6:33)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zūm, the startup that provides child transportation for school districts and families, is aiming to use its fleet of electric school buses to deliver power back to grid when it&#8217;s needed most. </span></p>
<p>The company is partnering with AutoGrid, which provides energy management and distribution software, to transform <span style="font-weight: 400;">Zūm&#8217;s fleet of electric school buses into one of the largest virtual power plants in the world, according to a statement from the companies. Zūm eventually plans to have a fleet of 10,000 electric buses by 2025. Once Zūm hits that 10,000 EV bus goal, the company says it will have the capacity to send one gigawatt of energy back to the grid. To put that to scale, that&#8217;s enough to power 110 million LED lightbulbs or 300,000 homes. However, Zum is far short of that 10,000-bus goal. Currently only 10% of the company&#8217;s buses are electric due to a shortage of supply, CEO and co-founder Ritu Narayan told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;School buses are the largest battery on wheels,&#8221; said Narayan. &#8220;Interestingly, they are not utilized when there is a peak time for electricity, so either in the evenings or in summertime. So our bigger plan is not only what we are actually using the vehicles for during the daytime.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This scope of the partnership, while a creative way to repurpose school bus fleets, is becoming more common in the electric vehicle industry. As EV ownership increases, companies like Zūm are recognizing the need for a give-and-take when it comes to an increasingly strained energy grid. This week, mobility company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/revel-turns-to-software-to-keep-its-e-moped-fleet-powered-without-straining-nycs-grid/">Revel announced it would work with GridRewards</a>, an app that offers similar services to AutoGrid, in order to adjust its e-moped fleet charging schedule so it can provide power back to the grid if needed. </span></p>
<p>School buses do present a big opportunity for such energy sharing, today more than ever. The Biden Administration has proposed a $25 billion investment in electric school buses. There are more than 500,000 yellow school buses transporting over 27 million students everyday.</p>
<p>The companies plan are launching the partnership in San Francisco, where Zūm has a fleet of 206 school buses, and in Oakland Unified School District, where it has 70 buses, according to Narayan. Zūm does have aspirations to expand nationwide. The company already works with schools districts in California, as well as Seattle, Chicago and Dallas, and it&#8217;s targeting Washington D.C. next.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The transition to EVs for the school transportation sector will play a critical role in help</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ing communities improve air quality and environmental health for student passengers a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd area residents,&#8221; the company said in a statement.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Daloopa will continue developing its data extraction technology for financial institutions, which is now being expanded globally.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.daloopa.com">Daloopa</a> closed on a $20 million Series A round, led by Credit Suisse Asset Management’s NEXT Investors, to continue developing its data extraction technology for financial institutions, which is now being expanded globally.</p>
<p>When company co-founder and CEO Thomas Li worked as a hedge fund analyst, he often performed repetitive data extraction in order to gather insights for analysis and forecasts.</p>
<p>In fact, he found lawyers and similar financial professionals at financial institutions were spending about a third of their time on those same tasks, while also manually entering everything into spreadsheets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“This was a big enough problem for one company to support all of the data analysis and forecasting without having to manually convert the data,” Li told TechCrunch. “This frees up analysts to then do what they are supposed to do.”</p>
<p>The idea for Daloopa came to Li five years ago, but he said the data extraction technology was not in place to get it off the ground. Then in 2019, the state of technology was such that Li and co-founders Daniel Chen and Jeremy Huang could create data extraction capabilities through the use of artificial intelligence-driven software. Customers can request data sets with a couple of clicks of a button and have it delivered the next day.</p>
<p>Accuracy in financial data collection “is mission critical,” but artificial intelligence models aren’t often able to get to 99% accuracy, whereas Daloopa is able to surpass that, Li said. Latency and volume also need to be at a point where infrastructure can support the algorithms needed to gather data from thousands of different documents.</p>
<p>Joining Credit Suisse in the Series A were existing investors Nexus Venture Partners, Uncorrelated Ventures and Hack VC. Daloopa previously raised both pre-seed and seed funds to give it $24 million to date.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, NEXT Investors and Nexus Venture Partners will each assign a member to Daloopa’s board of directors.</p>
<p>“Daloopa is disrupting how financial data is extracted and consumed,” said Abhishek Sharma, managing director at Nexus Venture Partners, via email. Nexus led both the pre-seed and seed rounds into the company. “Its intelligent automation approach eliminates the cost bloat and makes data extraction scalable, accurate and referenceable.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company will use the new funding on R&amp;D for product development, hiring additional staff members and building out the tech stack for those people to work on. It will also focus on sales, marketing and operations functions.</p>
<p>Li did not disclose revenue metrics, but said Daloopa self-launched its product six months ago, and today has 40 enterprise customers. It is headquartered in New York with offices in New Delhi and Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>Initially, Daloopa focused on public company financials, but plans to move into data extraction for more private documents, like documents a bank uses with its customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Walking into an auto repair shop can sometimes feel like taking a step into the past. The handwritten notes and receipts, the clunky point-of-sales system and scheduling tools — if those are even there — can make customers feel like they’re in the 1990s, not the 21st century.</p>
<p>Shopmonkey is trying to change that.</p>
<p>“It’s been an amazing industry to serve that I just feel like has trailed modern times and modern services by a factor of five to 10 years,” Shopmonkey CEO Ashot Iskandarian said in a recent interview with TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>His company offers a cloud-based shop management software designed for the auto repair industry. Now, less than a year after announcing a $25 million Series B, Shopmonkey has garnered another fresh round of capital. The company has raised a $75 million Series C led by previous investors Bessemer Venture Partners and Index Ventures, as well as additional participation from returning investors Headline and I2BF, and new investor ICONIQ Growth.</p>
<p>The financing will be used to grow Shopmonkey’s product, sales and marketing teams, and further fuel development of its platform.</p>
<p>Iskandarian noticed that many auto repair shops were victims to their own processes: owners bogged down using many different tools and platforms to perform tasks like invoicing, scheduling and parts ordering. Or else they’re using a shop management system that’s downloaded on a single, local machine. “That’s the world that these shops are coming from,” he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2177847" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2177847" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2177847" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Copy-of-Web_Workflow_Performance_1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Copy-of-Web_Workflow_Performance_1.jpg 5760w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Copy-of-Web_Workflow_Performance_1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Copy-of-Web_Workflow_Performance_1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Copy-of-Web_Workflow_Performance_1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Copy-of-Web_Workflow_Performance_1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Copy-of-Web_Workflow_Performance_1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Copy-of-Web_Workflow_Performance_1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Copy-of-Web_Workflow_Performance_1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2177847" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="https://www.shopmonkey.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopmonkey <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Shopmonkey consolidates these different functions into a single cloud-based tool, so it can be accessed on multiple computers, tablets or smartphones. The software also helps the shop communicate with customers, by providing appointment reminders, confirmations and upsell offers.</p>
<p>Iskandarian founded Shopmonkey in 2017. Since that time, its workforce has grown to more than 125 people, and over 2,500 shops use the software. He said that changing demographic trends amongst shop owners and customer pressure has led more and more auto repair shops to look for a management solution.</p>
<p>Like many sectors, the auto repair industry took a hit during the coronavirus pandemic. But it’s bouncing back: according to one <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/automotive-repair--maintenance-market-analysis---trends-developments-and-growth-deviations-resulting-from-covid-19-301084303.html#:~:text=The%20global%20automotive%20repair%20and,CAGR)%20of%20%2D0.3%25.&amp;text=The%20market%20is%20then%20expected,reach%20%24828.6%20billion%20in%202023.">report</a>, it’s expected to recover and grow 7% this year, as millions of people get back on the road or decide to purchase a used car. That’s good news for auto repair shops – and for Shopmonkey, which sees opportunity in this increased demand.</p>
<p>COVID and other dynamics have placed “massive tailwinds on the automotive aftermarket with used cars, used cars repairs, and just that whole sector,” Iskandarian said. “It’s a good time to be a founder and it’s a good time to be an auto repairer.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook&#8217;s lead regulator in the European Union must &#8220;swiftly&#8221; investigate the legality of data-sharing related to a controversial WhatsApp policy update, following an order by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB).</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) for a response.</p>
<p>Updated terms had been set to be imposed upon users of the Facebook-owned messaging app early this year &#8212; but in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/whatsapp-delays-new-data-sharing-policy-enforcement-to-may-15/">January</a> Facebook delayed the WhatsApp terms update until May after a major privacy backlash and ongoing confusion over the details of its user data processing.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite WhatsApp going ahead with the policy update, the ToS has continued to face scrutiny from regulators and rights organizations around the world.</p>
<p>The Indian government, for example, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/india-asks-whatsapp-to-withdraw-new-privacy-policy-expresses-grave-concerns/">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/india-tells-whatsapp-to-withdraw-its-new-policy-terms/">ordered</a> Facebook to withdraw the new terms. While, in Europe, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/14/confusion-over-whatsapps-new-tcs-triggers-privacy-warning-from-italy/">privacy regulators</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/controversial-whatsapp-policy-change-hit-with-consumer-law-complaint-in-europe/">consumer protection organizations</a> have raised objections about how opaque terms are being pushed on users &#8212; and in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/facebook-ordered-not-to-apply-controversial-whatsapp-tcs-in-germany/">May</a> a German data protection authority issued a temporary (national) blocking order.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s development follows that and is significant as it&#8217;s the first urgent binding decision adopted by the EDPB under the bloc&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p>Although the Board has <em>not</em> agreed to order the adoption of final measures against Facebook-WhatsApp as the requesting data supervisor, the Hamburg DPA, had asked &#8212; saying that &#8220;conditions to demonstrate the existence of an infringement and an urgency are not met&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Board&#8217;s intervention in the confusing mess around the WhatsApp policy update follows the use of GDPR Article 66 powers by Hamburg&#8217;s data protection authority.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/facebook-ordered-not-to-apply-controversial-whatsapp-tcs-in-germany/">May </a>the latter ordered Facebook not to apply the new terms to users in Germany &#8212; saying its analysis found the policy granted &#8220;far-reaching powers&#8221; to WhatsApp to share data with Facebook, without it being clear what legal basis the tech giant was relying upon to be able process users&#8217; data.</p>
<p>Hamburg also accused the Irish DPC of failing to investigate the Facebook-WhatsApp data sharing when it raised concerns &#8212; hence seeking to take matters into its own hands by making an Article 66 intervention.</p>
<p>As part of the process it <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">asked the EDPB to take a binding decision &#8212; asking it to take definitive steps to block data-sharing between WhatsApp and Facebook &#8212; in a bid to circumvent the Irish regulator&#8217;s glacial procedures by getting the Board to order enforcement measures that could be applied stat across the whole bloc.</span></p>
<p>However the Board&#8217;s assessment found that Hamburg had not met the bar for demonstrating the Irish DPC &#8220;failed to provide information in the context of a formal request for mutual assistance under Article 61 GDPR&#8221;, as it puts it.</p>
<p>It also decided that the adoption of updated terms by WhatsApp &#8212; which it nonetheless says &#8220;contain similar problematic elements as the previous version&#8221; &#8212; cannot &#8220;on its own&#8221; justify the urgency for the <span class="il">EDPB</span> to order the lead supervisor to adopt final measures under Article 66(2) GDPR.</p>
<p>The upshot &#8212; as the Hamburg DPA puts it &#8212; is that data exchange between WhatsApp and Facebook remains &#8220;unregulated at the European level&#8221;.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Facebook ordered not to apply controversial WhatsApp T&#038;Cs in Germany&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/facebook-ordered-not-to-apply-controversial-whatsapp-tcs-in-germany/embed/#?secret=pDOcPeXShB" data-secret="pDOcPeXShB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>Article 66 powers</h2>
<p>The importance of Article 66 of the GDPR is that it allows EU data protection authorities to derogate from the regulation&#8217;s one-stop-shop mechanism &#8212; which otherwise funnels cross border complaints (such as those against Big Tech) via a lead data supervisor (oftentimes the Irish DPC), and is thus widely seen as a bottleneck to effective enforcement of data protection (especially against tech giants).</p>
<p>An Article<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> 66 urgency proceeding allows <em>any</em> data supervisor across the EU to immediately adopt provisional measures &#8212; provided a situation meets the criteria for this kind of emergency intervention. Which is one way to get around a bottleneck, even if only for a time-limited period.</span></p>
<p>A number of EU data protection authorities have used (or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/google-ordered-to-halt-human-review-of-voice-ai-recordings-over-privacy-risks/">threatened to use</a>) Article 66 powers in recent years, since GDPR came into application in 2018, and the power is increasingly proving its worth in reconfiguring certain Big Tech practices &#8212; with, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/tiktok-removes-500k-accounts-in-italy-after-dpa-order-to-block-underage-users/">Italy&#8217;s DPA using it recently to force TikTok</a> to remove hundreds of thousands of suspected underage accounts.</p>
<p>Just the threat of Article 66&#8217;s use <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/02/google-ordered-to-halt-human-review-of-voice-ai-recordings-over-privacy-risks/">back in 2019</a> (also by Hamburg) was enough to encourage Google to suspend manual reviews of audio reviews of recordings captured by its voice AI, Google Assistant. (And later led to a number of major policy changes by several tech giants who had similarly been manually reviewing users&#8217; interactions with their voice AIs.)</p>
<p>At the same time, Article 66 provisional measures can only last three months &#8212; and only apply nationally, not across the whole EU. So it&#8217;s a bounded power. (Perhaps especially in this WhatsApp-Facebook case, where the target is a ToS update, and Facebook could just wait out the three months and apply the policy anyway in Germany after the suspension order lapses.)</p>
<p>This is why Hamburg wanted the EDPB to make a binding decision. And it&#8217;s certainly a blow to privacy watchers eager for GDPR enforcement to fall on tech giants like Facebook that the Board has declined to do so in this case.</p>
<h2>Unregulated data-sharing</h2>
<p>Responding to the Board&#8217;s decision not to impose definitive measures to prevent data sharing between WhatsApp and Facebook, the Hamburg authority expressed disappointment &#8212; see below for its full statement &#8212; and also lamented that the EDPB has not set a deadline for the Irish DPC to conduct the investigation into the legal basis of the data-sharing.</p>
<p>Ireland&#8217;s data protection authority has only issued one final GDPR decision against a tech giant to date (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/twitter-fined-550k-over-a-data-breach-in-irelands-first-major-gdpr-decision/">Twitter</a>) &#8212; so there is plenty of cause to be concerned that without a concrete deadline the ordered probe could be kicked down the road for years.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the EDPB&#8217;s order to the Irish DPC to &#8220;swiftly&#8221; investigate the finer-grained detail of the Facebook-WhatsApp data-sharing does look like <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">a significant intervention by a pan-EU body &#8212; as it very publicly pokes a regulator with a now infamous reputation for reluctance to actually do the job of rigorously investigating privacy concerns. </span></p>
<p>Demonstrably it has failed to do so in this WhatsApp case. Despite major concerns being raised about the policy update &#8212; within Europe and globally &#8212; Facebook&#8217;s lead EU data supervisor did not open a formal investigation and has not raised any public objections to the update.</p>
<p>Back in January when we asked about concerns over the update, the DPC told TechCrunch it had obtained a &#8216;confirmation&#8217; from<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Facebook-owned WhatsApp that there was no change to data-sharing practices that would affect EU users &#8212; reiterating Facebook&#8217;s line that the update didn&#8217;t change anything, ergo &#8216;nothing to see here&#8217;. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;The updates made by WhatsApp last week are about providing clearer, more detailed information to users on how and why they use data. WhatsApp have confirmed to us that there is no change to data-sharing practices either in the European Region or the rest of the world arising from these updates,&#8221; the DPC told us then, although it also noted that it had received &#8220;numerous queries&#8221; from stakeholders who it described as &#8220;confused and concerned about these updates&#8221;, mirroring Facebook&#8217;s own characterization of complaints.</p>
<p>&#8220;We engaged with WhatsApp on the matter and they confirmed to us that they will delay the date by which people will be asked to review and accept the terms from February 8th to May 15th,&#8221; the DPC went on, referring to a pause in the ToS application deadline which Facebook enacted after a public backlash that saw scores of users signing up to alternative messaging apps, before adding: &#8220;In the meantime, WhatsApp will launch information campaigns to provide further clarity about how privacy and security works on the platform. We will continue to engage with WhatsApp on these updates.&#8221;</p>
<p>The EDPB&#8217;s assessment of the knotty WhatsApp-Facebook data-sharing terms looks rather different &#8212; with the Board calling out WhatsApp&#8217;s user communications as confusing and simultaneously raising concerns about the legal basis for the data exchange.</p>
<p>In a press release, the EDPB writes that there&#8217;s a &#8220;high likelihood of infringements&#8221; &#8212; highlighting purposes contained in the updated ToS in the areas of &#8220;safety, security and integrity of WhatsApp IE [Ireland] and the other Facebook Companies, as well as for the purpose of improvement of the products of the Facebook Companies&#8221; as being of particular concern.</p>
<p>From the Board&#8217;s PR [emphasis its]:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Considering the high likelihood of infringements in particular for the purpose of safety, security and integrity of WhatsApp IE [Ireland] and the other Facebook Companies, as well as for the purpose of improvement of the products of the Facebook Companies, the EDPB considered that this matter requires swift further investigations. In particular to verify if, in practice, Facebook Companies are carrying out processing operations which imply the combination or comparison of WhatsApp IE’s [Ireland] user data with other data sets processed by other Facebook Companies in the context of other apps or services offered by the Facebook Companies, facilitated <i>inter alia</i> by the use of unique identifiers. For this reason, <b>the EDPB requests the IE </b><b>SA </b>[Irish supervisory authority] <b>to carry out, as a matter of priority, a statutory investigation</b> to determine whether such processing activities are taking place or not, and if this is the case, whether they have a proper legal basis under Article 5(1)(a) and Article 6(1) GDPR.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>NB: It&#8217;s worth recalling that WhatsApp users were initially told they must accept the updated policy or else the app would stop working. (Although Facebook later changed its approach &#8212; after the public backlash.) While WhatsApp users who still haven&#8217;t accepted the terms continue to be nagged to do so via regular pop-ups, although the tech giant does not appear to be taking steps to degrade the user experience further as yet (i.e. beyond annoying, recurring pop-ups).</p>
<p>The EDPB&#8217;s concerns over the WhatsApp-Facebook data-sharing extend to what it says is &#8220;a lack of information around how data is processed for marketing purposes, cooperation with the other Facebook Companies and in relation to WhatsApp Business API&#8221; &#8212; hence its order to Ireland to fully investigate.</p>
<p>The Board also essentially confirms the view that WhatsApp users themselves have no hope of understanding what Facebook is doing with their data by reading the comms material it has provided them with &#8212; with the Board writing [emphasis ours]:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Based on the evidence provided, the EDPB concluded that there is a high likelihood that Facebook IE [Ireland] already processes WhatsApp IE [Ireland] user data as a (joint) controller for the common purpose of safety, security and integrity of WhatsApp IE [Ireland] and the other Facebook Companies, and for the common purpose of improvement of the products of the Facebook Companies. However, in the face of <strong>the various contradictions, ambiguities and uncertainties noted in WhatsApp’s user-facing information</strong>, some written commitments adopted by Facebook IE [Ireland] and WhatsApp IE’s [Ireland] written submissions, the EDPB concluded that<strong> it is not in a position to determine with certainty which processing operations are actually being carried out and in which capacity</strong>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We contacted Facebook for a response to the EDPB&#8217;s order, and the company sent us this statement &#8212; attributed to a WhatsApp spokesperson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“We welcome the EDPB’s decision not to extend the Hamburg DPA&#8217;s order, which was based on fundamental misunderstandings as to the purpose and effect of the update to our terms of service. We remain fully committed to delivering secure and private communications for everyone and will work with the Irish Data Protection Commission as our lead regulator in the region in order to fully address the questions raised by the EDPB.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Facebook also claimed it has controls in place for &#8216;controller to processor data sharing&#8217; (i.e. between WhatsApp and Facebook) &#8212; which it said prohibit it (Facebook) from using WhatsApp user data for its own purposes.</p>
<p>The tech giant went on to reiterate its line that the update does not expand WhatsApp’s ability to share data with Facebook.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;WhatsApp delays enforcement of privacy terms by 3 months, following backlash&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/whatsapp-delays-new-data-sharing-policy-enforcement-to-may-15/embed/#?secret=lFA7xPvfl7" data-secret="lFA7xPvfl7" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2>GDPR enforcement stalemate</h2>
<p>A further vital component to this saga is the fact the Irish DPC has, for years, been investigating long-standing complaints against WhatsApp&#8217;s compliance with GDPR&#8217;s transparency requirements &#8212; and still hasn&#8217;t issued a final decision.</p>
<p>So when the EDPB says it&#8217;s highly likely that some of the WhatsApp-Facebook data-processing being objected to is already going on it doesn&#8217;t mean Facebook gets a pass for that &#8212; because the DPC hasn&#8217;t issued a verdict on whether or not WhatsApp has been up front enough with users.</p>
<p>tl;dr: The regulatory oversight process is <em>still</em> ongoing.</p>
<p>The DPC provisionally concluded its WhatsApp transparency investigation last year &#8212; saying in January that it sent a draft decision to the other EU data protection authorities for review (and the chance to object) on December 24, 2020; a step that&#8217;s required under the GDPR&#8217;s co-decision-making process.</p>
<p>In January, when it said it was still waiting to receive comments on the draft decision, it also said: &#8220;When the process is completed and a final decision issues, it will make clear the standard of transparency to which WhatsApp is expected to adhere as articulated by EU Data Protection Authorities.”</p>
<p>Over a half a year later and WhatsApp users in the EU are still waiting to find out whether the company&#8217;s comms lives up to the required legal standard of transparency or not &#8212; with their data continuing to pass between Facebook and WhatsApp in the meanwhile.</p>
<p>The Irish DPC was contacted for comment on the EDPB&#8217;s order today and with questions on the current status of the WhatsApp transparency investigation.</p>
<p>It told us it would have a response later today &#8212; we&#8217;ll update this report when we get it.</p>
<p>Back in November the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/whatsapp-ireland-sets-aside-77-5m-for-possible-data-compliance-fines-1.4412449">Irish Times</a> reported that WhatsApp Ireland had set aside €77.5M for &#8220;possible administrative fines arising from regulatory compliance matters presently under investigation&#8221;. No fines against Facebook have yet been forthcoming, though.</p>
<p>Indeed, the DPC has yet to issue a single final GDPR decision against Facebook (or a Facebook-owned company) &#8212; despite more than three years having passed since the regulation started being applied.</p>
<p>Scores of GDPR complaints against the Facebook&#8217;s data-processing empire &#8212; such as this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">May 2018 complaint against Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp&#8217;s use of so-called &#8216;forced consent&#8217; </a>&#8212; continue to languish without regulatory enforcement in the EU because there&#8217;s been no decisions from Ireland (and sometimes no investigations either).</p>
<p>The situation is a huge black mark against the EU&#8217;s flagship data protection regulation. So the Board&#8217;s failure to step in more firmly now &#8212; to course-correct &#8212; does look like a missed opportunity to tackle a problematic GDPR enforcement bottleneck.</p>
<p>That said, any failure to follow the procedural letter of the law could invite a legal challenge that unpicked any progress. So it&#8217;s hard to see any quick wins in the glacial game of GDPR enforcement.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the winners of the stalemate are of course the tech giants who get to continue processing people&#8217;s data how they choose, with plenty of time to work on reconfiguring their legal, business and system structures to route around any enforcement damage that does eventually come.</p>
<p>Hamburg&#8217;s deputy commissioner for data protection, Ulrich Kühn, essentially warns as much in a statement responding to the EDPB&#8217;s decision in a statement &#8212; in which he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The decision of the European Data Protection Board is disappointing. The body, which was created to ensure the uniform application of the GDPR throughout the European Union, is missing the opportunity to clearly stand up for the protection of the rights and freedoms of millions of data subjects in Europe. It continues to leave this solely to the Irish supervisory authority. Despite our repeated requests over more than two years to investigate and, if necessary, sanction the matter of data exchanges between WhatsApp and Facebook, the IDPC has not taken action in this regard. It is a success of our efforts over many years that IDPC is now being urged to conduct an investigation. Nonetheless, this non-binding measure does not do justice to the importance of the issue. It is hard to imagine a case in which, against the background of the risks for the rights and freedoms of a very large number of data subjects and their de facto powerlessness vis-à-vis monopoly-like providers, the urgent need for concrete action is more obvious. The EDPB is thus depriving itself of a crucial instrument for enforcing the GDPR throughout Europe. This is no good news for data subjects and data protection in Europe as a whole.“</p></blockquote>
<p>In further remarks the Hamburg authority emphasizes that the Board noted &#8220;considerable inconsistencies between the information with which WhatsApp users are informed about the extensive use of their data by Facebook on the one hand, and on the other the commitments made by the company to data protection authorities not (yet) to do so&#8221;; and also that it &#8220;expressed considerable doubts about the legal basis on which Facebook intends to rely when using WhatsApp data for its own or joint processing&#8221; &#8212; arguing that the Board therefore agrees with the &#8220;essential parts&#8221; of its arguments against WhatsApp-Facebook data sharing.</p>
<p>Despite carrying that weight of argument, the call for action is once again back in Ireland&#8217;s court.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Netradyne, a startup that uses cameras and edge computing to improve commercial driver safety, has scored $150 million in Series C funding. The fresh cash will help the company double down on its current product, Driveri, according to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Avneesh Agrawal, CEO and co-founder.</span></p>

<div>Agrawal told TechCrunch the company is very confident in its product, which rewards good driver behavior while sending real-time notifications to drivers for bad behavior, and will now focus on expanding outside its <span style="font-weight: 400;">current markets in North America and India and into Europe.</span></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22265031/amazon-netradyne-driveri-survelliance-cameras-delivery-monitor-packages"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netradyne partnered with Amazon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to install its hardware and software in its delivery vehicles. The tech giant has faced accusations that it puts speed and efficiency over driver safety, all the while avoiding liability for accidents by employing third-party firms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other companies may not have that same morally dubious luxury, which makes Netradyne’s service all the more relevant for fleets. Commercial auto insurance rates are expected to climb 14.2% in 2021, in large part due to distracted drivers using smartphones, which has increased the number of accidents resulting in death, according to a <a href="https://www.iwins.com/survey-commercial-insurance-rates-to-continue-rising-in-2021/">report</a> by insurance company Alera Group. The study also found the cost of repairing modern vehicles and medical costs continue rising at rates higher than inflation. Fleet managers looking to cut costs might be lured by promises of safer driving behavior. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nuclear verdicts, in which judgements exceed $10 million, have gone up by almost 500% according to some statistics,&#8221; Agrawal told TechCrunch. &#8220;It’s becoming the biggest expense for commercial fleets, pretty much after the drivers and fuel. There are a lot of commercial insurance carriers actually going out of business, or they’re passing on the risk to the fleets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Agrawal is to be believed, Netradyne’s service is very much in demand, with subscribers and annual recurring revenue increasing three times in 2020. The CEO would not share the base, but he did say Netradyne has over 1,000 customers today. </span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Traffic management platform NoTraffic raises $17.5M in Series A to double team size&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/traffic-management-platform-notraffic-raises-17-5m-in-series-a-to-double-team-size/embed/#?secret=oFJZTynxLb" data-secret="oFJZTynxLb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netradyne has an agreement with National Interstate Insurance that subsidizes the company’s product, but generally Netradyne sells to a fleet. The pitch is that the fleet should see a reduction in accidents and can then take that data to insurance companies to negotiate better claims. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netradyne doesn’t provide an average of how its cameras and software has made driving safer, but anecdotally, Agrawal said a couple of the companies that have used the product saw claims decrease by up to 80% in a year.</span></p>
<h3><b>So how does it work?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Netradyne, which combines <i>netra</i> which means “vision” in Sanskrit and <i>dyne</i> which is a unit of power or force in Greek, has built a full stack system that is purely vision-based, according to Agrawal. That means cameras in simpler terms. The system comes in two form factors. The D-210, built for small-to-medium-sized vehicles </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a dual-facing dashcam featuring both an inward and outward-facing camera, recording both the driver and the road. The D-410 has four HD cameras providing a 360-degree picture, which includes two side window views, and is better suited for heavy duty vehicles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cameras pick up anything from a driver being cut off and correctly slowing down to create space between the vehicles to a driver being distracted by texting. A device that connects to the cloud is on board the vehicle, and it’s on the edge of that device that real-time computations are done, which might result in the driver getting feedback and automated suggestions like “please slow down” or “distracted driving.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most importantly, we track the positive driving behavior because we want to change the discussion with the drivers,” said Agrawal. “Drivers are so used to being penalized, and in most cases, it&#8217;s actually after the incident has happened or based on a customer&#8217;s complaint. This is very proactive and it&#8217;s positive.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the moment, rewarding behavior can look like a notification to the driver, giving them a little dopamine hit that might encourage continued good driving. Drivers are rewarded with DriverStars, an attempt to gamify commercial operations by encouraging them to rack up points. Those points may be converted to bonuses or other incentives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The drivers are the biggest assets for the fleet, and traditionally, if you ask the fleets, who are your worst drivers, they&#8217;ll tell you who because they are the ones who got into accidents, who customers have complained about,” said Agrawal. “If you ask them who are your safer drivers, they can&#8217;t really tell, but in our situation because we micro identify not just the drivers who haven&#8217;t gotten into accidents, but also drivers are actually being proactive with safe driving behaviour, fleets can focus on those drivers and create retention packages, give them incentives, make them into managers and leadership positions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, there’s another upside to all this data collection on driver behavior. Agrawal says his company collects about 700 million miles per month worth of data, analyzing it to identify every potential scenario a driver can get themselves into. And it’s all being done on the edge, which is an experiment in and of itself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Investing in autonomous driving is definitely a possibility, but it’s not our focus right now,” said Agrawal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This Series C round was led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2. Existing investors Point72 Ventures and M12 also participated in the round, bringing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Netradyne’s total funding to over $197 million. Agrawal told TechCrunch the company aims to make $100 million in revenue by the end of the year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A number of companies are attempting to combine gamification and payments in creative ways. And today, one such company, </span><a href="https://play2pay.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play2Pay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has raised $13 million in a Series A round of funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based startup has a straightforward mission. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It wants to give consumers a way to reduce their bills &#8212; it claims by an average of 30%! &#8212; by playing games, watching videos and completing daily challenges, offers and surveys.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Play2Pay was bootstrapped for the first five years of its life, raising its first external capital in June of 2020 &#8212; a $7.5 million seed round from individual angel investors. <a href="https://www.telesoftvc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.telesoftvc.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626375657609000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH_jweeiHvgtK8S5mf6pjtim28iRQ">Telesoft Partners </a>led its Series A round, which included participation from Harbor Spring Capital and individual investors including former AT&amp;T vice chairman Ralph de la Vega, former Reuters CEO Tom Glocer, Madison Dearborn Partners co-founder and senior advisor Jim Perry and Virtusa founder and former CEO, Kris Canekeratne.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The alternative payment platform says it brokers a “value exchange” between brands and consumers, converting attention and engagement into a currency, which can be redeemed for bill payment. Meanwhile, brands get a new way to promote their products and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Play2Pay founder and CEO Brian Boroff started the company in 2015 based on a vision that prepaid mobile phone users should have an alternative way to pay for their mobile phone service and that wireless carriers would adopt an ad-funded commercial model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the company claims to be positioned to be the world&#8217;s first &#8220;ad supported payment rail&#8221; directly integrated into payments platforms of major service providers and financial institutions. It also claims to be the only company that converts user engagement directly into bill payment.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2177670" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2177670" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2177670 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Play2Pay.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="455" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Play2Pay.jpg 1300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Play2Pay.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Play2Pay.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Play2Pay.jpg?resize=768,514 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Play2Pay.jpg?resize=680,455 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Play2Pay.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2177670" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Play2Pay</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “opt-in” offering is currently available to more than 100 million mobile subscribers across the United States, United Kingdom, Mexico, Brazil and Indonesia through partnerships with telecom companies such as AT&amp;T Mexico, Cricket in the U.S., TIM in Brazil, lndosat Ooredoo in Indonesia and U.K.-based Lycamobile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rewarding approach seems to be resonating with users. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">June 2020 to June 2021, the startup saw its ARR (annual recurring revenue) spike by nearly 300%, according to Boroff, a telecom veteran.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the users engaged on the platform, about 25% generated revenue daily, he said. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">service providers realized up to 17% revenue expansion as a result of subscriber engagement on the Play2Pay platform, according to Boroff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our distribution model is B2B2C, with Tier-1 service providers worldwide directly integrating our bill payment capability. We’re growing our audience through promotion of the service to their customer base,” he told TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">End users, he added, can share their targeting preferences in exchange for value, giving mobile app developers and brands more information when promoting their own products and services to Play2Pay’s audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform is free for service providers and merchants, meaning the payment does not have costs or fees from interchange, acquirers, chargebacks or gateways.</span></p>

<p>Instead, Play2Pay generates revenue from mobile app developers and brands. Those developers and brands pay to access Play2Pay’s mobile audience in order to promote their products and services. For example, a mobile gaming company might pay Play2Pay $100 for every user that downloads their app from the Play2Pay app and plays the game for a period of time (such as two hours). Through its technology and partner network, Play2Pay has attribution tracking to ensure that the end user and mobile gaming company both know how much progress has been made toward completing that goal. Other formats include watching videos, completing surveys and more conventional native advertising in some areas.</p>
<div>All of this revenue is aggregated by Play2Pay, the majority of which is passed on to the end user in the form of in-app currency. The balance goes to service providers such as its wireless carrier partners for promoting the Play2Pay platform and to Play2Pay for running the service and processing payment. Play2Pay collects all of the cash and pays out the various parties accordingly.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The company will use the new capital toward product development, hiring and partner engagement.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://leap.so/">Leap</a>, a platform for people over 55 to learn via social interaction, has raised $3.1M funding in a seed round led by European early-stage investor Creandum, and SF-based South Park Commons. Also participating was Learn Start/Learn Capital, alongside angels Michelle Kennedy (Peanut founder), Sahil Lavingia, and Tim Tuttle.</p>
<p>Leap members gather online to collectively &#8220;learn, connect and grow together,” says the company, via small online groups built around shared interests. Users connect over audio and video, in groups of between five and ten. The current beta features conversations and classes hosted by specially recruited members.</p>
<p>Leap was founded by Swedish entrepreneur Caroline Ingeborn, former CEO of Toca Boca, a Swedish app development studio that builds learning apps for kids, and Vishal Kapur, former CTO and co-founder of Screenhero, which was acquired by Slack in 2015. The two founders met through South Park Commons, an intentional learning community that practices many of the concepts applied in Leap. </p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement, Caroline Ingeborn said: &#8220;When I looked at other online offerings created for this demographic, I didn&#8217;t feel that they particularly encouraged meaningful connections. Groups described as &#8216;small&#8217; were often bursting at the seams, and experiences often felt flimsy and random. In most instances, it felt like we were all just alone, together. It motivated me to create something far more tailored and intimate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fredrik Cassel, General Partner at Creandum: “Leap is targeting an interesting segment of society: retirees – the wealthiest and fastest-growing demographic who have been largely overlooked by tech developers. It is a generation of people with considerable time, energy, and spending power that have smartphones at their fingertips. The diverse founding team convinced us with their determination and unique experiences to build a product that is truly engaging.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influencer marketing is one of the fastest-growing and one of the most impactful media channels today. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s a growing ad-blocking movement and key demographics are spending less time in front of TVs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marketers have now realized that their customers trust the recommendations of people they relate with</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, despite this being an impactful channel, brand teams globally face a major dilemma: determining the ROI of influencer marketing campaigns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ai-fluence.com/">AIfluence</a> is a two-year-old startup with an AI-driven influencer marketing approach to measuring these campaigns. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the company is announcing that it has raised $1 million in seed investment led by Dubai-based EQ2 Ventures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investors include Antler East Africa, Oui Capital, ArabyAds, and an unnamed European family office</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AIfluence </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ke.linkedin.com/in/nelson-aseka-5656a216"> Nelson Aseka,</a> George Issaias, Lamusia Anzaya, and Ankit Jindal in 2019</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Placing AI at the core of the product, the founders started AIfluence to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">accurately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> match influencers to brands, run end to end influencer marketing campaigns, and bring transparency to the measurement of impact (ROI)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CEO Aseka, AIfluence </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is developed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for an audience-first approach. It identifies and gains deep insights into a target audience and works backwards to identify influencers that impact this target audience. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is built</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on a trust network model where it deploys thousands of nano influencers and followers who have a natural affinity to a brand and exhibit a high emotional connection with the target audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are at the cusp of a revolution. Globally the way marketing works is changing. We find ourselves at an intersection of advanced technology and the fastest-growing region in the world </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> digital and social media penetration. It’s an exciting place to be. Africa’s rich tradition for storytelling is alive and kicking,&#8221; Aseka said in a statement. &#8220;We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">simply</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> enable such stories to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be shared</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> between peers who know and trust each other, and can place our brand messages into the heart of this communication ecosystem.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform was launched out of company builder and VC firm <a href="https://www.antler.co/nairobi">Antler East Africa</a> in late 2019 as one of its first cohorts before officially going live in April 2020</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antler </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for bringing together professionals with, on average, 10 years of experience in their respective industries to start companies. That is the case with AIfluence, where its C-level executives have varying experiences in influencer marketing, growing brands, and consumer tech products.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How Antler East Africa is building early-stage startups with experienced professionals&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/how-antler-east-africa-is-building-early-stage-startups-with-experienced-professionals/embed/#?secret=v33aaai25B" data-secret="v33aaai25B" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AIfluence is the first startup from the builder to have raised up to $1 million. “We‌ ‌are‌ ‌excited‌ ‌to‌ ‌see‌ ‌local‌ ‌founders‌ ‌with‌ ‌deep‌ ‌expertise‌ ‌in‌ ‌the‌ ‌African‌ ‌market‌ ‌take‌ ‌a‌ ‌global‌ ‌problem‌ ‌head-on,‌ ‌and‌ ‌in‌ ‌a‌ ‌short‌ ‌time‌ ‌</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">demonstrate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">‌ ‌a‌ ‌tech‌ ‌solution‌ ‌that‌ ‌is‌ ‌fast‌ ‌attracting‌ ‌demand‌ ‌in‌ ‌Africa‌ ‌and‌ ‌beyond,”‌  Antler‌ ‌East‌ ‌Africa’s‌ ‌partner‌ Melalite‌ ‌Ayenew ‌said in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about tackling a global problem, AIfluence says it is currently running campaigns for clients across 13 countries in African and Asia. These clients are regional and global advertisers that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">span across</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> FMCG, banking, travel and electronics sectors. Aseka says Alfluence has closed over $1 million in contracts from these clients.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AIfluence makes money by running brand campaigns that drive awareness of products and services, and lead generation and conversion campaigns that drive sales. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is currently working on a SaaS offering it says will &#8220;lace the power of the platform in the hands of its customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major challenge the company has had, Aseka describes, is identifying robust payments solutions to cater to its thousands of influencers across different regions. However, it is in the past now. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fortunately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we have so far been able to solve this by identifying a reliable payment partner, who we will grow with as we expand across new markets,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These markets include the rest of Africa, the Middle East and Asia. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the recently raised investment, AIfluence plans to launch into these markets by the end of the year and invest in its tech and SaaS platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People are the new media in today’s digital world, and AIfluence is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">uniquely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> positioned to turn this reality into tangible results for advertisers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been impressed by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the team’s obsession to use data </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in order to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spread authentic and relevant messages to the right audience</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is what advertising should always be. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re looking forward to AIfluence’s journey ahead,”  CEO of EQ2 Ventures Patrick Thiriet CEO said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The global social market is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> growing. With over 1.25 million online social sellers in Egypt alone, the Egyptian social e-commerce market is forecast to be worth more than $14.8 billion by 2024</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of its players, <a href="https://taager.com/">Taager</a>, is a social e-commerce platform enabling online merchants with end-to-end logistics</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Today, it is announcing that it has secured $6.4 million in seed funding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seed round </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was led by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Pan-African focused VC <a href="https://www.4dxventures.com/">4DX Ventures</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also included participation from Raed Ventures, Beco Capital, Breyer Capital and some private investors, including Magnus Olsson, co-founder of Careem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Breyer Capital’s first investment in the MENA region, and the round brings Taager’s total investment to more than $7 million since launching in December 2019</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and more recently TikTok have made advertising easier for online merchants to target customers with their products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Offline, there&#8217;s a wide range of last-mile companies to distribute these products. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there is a fragmentation between these processes for new merchants. They </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are left</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to fend for themselves when starting out and during the delivery of products; a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">perfectly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> executed end-to-end cycle, if you will</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Consider I&#8217;m an undergraduate, and I want to own my own e-commerce store. Where do I get the product from? How do I ship them, where do I store them? Where do I make the fulfilment, what about financing it, how am I going to deliver it?&#8221; CEO Mohammed Elhorishy said to TechCrunch concerning the dilemma new merchants face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elhorishy argues that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a merchant would need to meet different suppliers to strike deals before proceeding to do the same with shipping and last-mile delivery companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With Taager, we can now see the trend of people who would never have been able to build businesses on their own, now using Taager and getting the exact outcome of the very painful processing they would have gone through if they went about it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">manually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; he added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how does this work exactly? Essentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Taager has built a B2B platform to provide a one-stop shop for these online merchants and suppliers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform provides online merchants and suppliers with a suite of backend and integrated services, from operational and logistical infrastructure such as storage and shipping to an online marketplace to host their products, connecting sellers with wholesalers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2177899" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2177899" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2177899" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Taager-Team-.jpg?w=680" alt="Taager" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Taager-Team-.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Taager-Team-.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Taager-Team-.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Taager-Team-.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Taager-Team-.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Taager-Team-.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Taager-Team-.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Taager-Team-.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2177899" class="wp-caption-text">Taager Team</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims to use AI and data science to enable first-time sellers to start and scale their online business with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">relatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> low risk</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It offers a transparent pricing structure and an enhanced product selection process, freeing online sellers to focus on running their business while Taager handles end-to-end operations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After getting products from suppliers on Taager, merchants can take pictures and descriptions to Facebook (via ads or its Marketplace platform), TikTok or Instagram</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They start utilising their marketing skills. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They do advertising, run campaigns, and once an order </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is fulfilled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the merchants will put it on our site and Taager fulfils the end-to-end cycle</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This way, merchants, without any inventory or stock or cash, can start a business and scale it from one order to a thousand orders per day because Taager made it seamless for them,&#8221; said the CEO</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other end, Taager takes a margin of every sale and aggregates data points. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform does this </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggest the products that often sell to merchants and what pricing is best</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elhorishy explains the need to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">employ</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this strategy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to him, while Taager is not involved with the day-to-day sale of merchant&#8217;s products, the data it provides will act as growth engines alongside the heavy lifting performed by providing warehousing and last-mile services</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s all about phases. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You need to reach specific data-critical points where you can suggest products that make sense to the merchants</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We perceive ourselves </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a technology and data company that has the necessary presence on the ground </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fulfil this</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We&#8217;re trying to automate operations as much as possible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Taager claims to have 5,000 merchants on its platform, critical components to the 40% month-on-month increase in Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) Elhorishy says the startup enjoys</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While he did not comment on the platform&#8217;s number of suppliers, he talks about how difficult it was to onboard them initially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These suppliers, currently in their hundreds, have a plethora of options to sell their products, so Taager&#8217;s catch was to provide them with better pricing and thousands of merchants, meaning their products get sold faster</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to this was insights on how to expand their products and make faster imports.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Now they come to us asking what </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the market needs, whereas it was a very big challenge in the beginning because they weren&#8217;t used to this kind of business</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another challenge was managing the last-mile operations, and now we have teams managing relationships with a wide variety of last-mile companies,&#8221; Elhorishy said of some challenges faced by the company early on</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A high margin business, as Elhorishy claims, Taager will be looking to deploy the new capital into its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> growing operations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is also making hires across all levels in the company and plans to scale across MENA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social e-commerce globally is on the rise, and in MENA as well. Jim Breyer of Breyer Capital </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is enthused by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this growth and Taager&#8217;s traction in the space. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He believes there’s a great opportunity for Taager to replicate its unique data-driven approach for further growth across the region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taager&#8217;s growth also proved decisive in getting a check from its lead investor. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peter Orth, co-founder and managing partner at 4DX Ventures, said, &#8220;The Taager team have achieved very impressive results </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">incredibly</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and also built one of the most impressive teams in the ecosystem</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Their focus on quality and execution and a very unique approach to empowering e-commerce entrepreneurs is a dominant combination</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We’re thrilled to partner with the team in the next phase of the company’s growth.&#8221;</span></p>
