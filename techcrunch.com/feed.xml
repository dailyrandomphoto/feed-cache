										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few things have captured Silicon Valley-based investors&#8217; attention in recent years quite like the quest to back the successor[s] to Google Docs. The estimable and entrenched productivity suite has been unbundled and repackaged into products that a number of multi-billion dollar tech startups have been built around.</p>
<p>All the while, entrepreneurs are continuing to poke holes in their predecessors&#8217; lore, creating something faster, sleeker or more intuitive. For plenty of the current generation productivity startups, the journey to replace Google Docs and Microsoft Office got a historic shot in the arm this past year as a global pandemic gave remote work software companies a jot of attention.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Covid has made everybody realize that the way that we were working had to change,&#8221; Almanac CEO Adam Nathan told TechCrunch. &#8220;The core tools we used for productivity, Microsoft Word and Google Docs were for when we did a completely different type of work.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://almanac.io/">Almanac</a> is trying to revamp the document editor in a package that&#8217;s quicker than products like Notion and far more intuitive than legacy software suites, Nathan says. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Last year, the startup raised a $9 million seed round led by Floodgate and has been quietly building out its network of users in early access beta.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2163082" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-8.39.52-AM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="614" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-8.39.52-AM.png 2016w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-8.39.52-AM.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-8.39.52-AM.png?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-8.39.52-AM.png?resize=768,460 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-8.39.52-AM.png?resize=680,407 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-8.39.52-AM.png?resize=1536,920 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-8.39.52-AM.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The document editor found its way into a diverse number of offices outside tech startups &#8212; from a Domino&#8217;s branch to a veterinary office &#8212; through its open source template library <em>Core</em>, a hub for user-submitted guides on everything from how to run a one-on-one meeting to how to structure salaries for your customer service team. There are 5,000 documents on Core which are accessible to any logged-in user, something that has been a sizable customer channel for the startup as more companies and offices across the country have begun to question some entrenched ways of doing things.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are way more people working in docs outside of Silicon Valley than in it,&#8221; Nathan says.</p>
<p>As a document editor, Almanac&#8217;s core offering is the ability to keep files organized in the way that companies actually organize themselves.</p>
<p>One of its hallmark features is the ability to track document changes in a way that makes Google Docs look completely unintelligible. User can easily make their own copies of documents, merge them with the original and quickly approve changes. Users can also get approval from their manager or another user in their network and ask for feedback along the way.</p>
<p>For tasks that require a bit more thought, people can use Almanac to add tasks to another users to-do list inside the documents themselves, a feature that they might have needed a project management tool like Asana to handle in the past. Updates for items a user has been assigned or has assigned to others live inside their own inbox where notifications flow automatically as documents evolve. The team believes that functionality like this inside Almanac will help teams cut down on unnecessary Slacking and let the documents speak for themselves.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This week we shipped a feature that makes writing in Almanac even faster: snippets. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f680.png" alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Snippets enable you to save content (or whole docs) and easily reinsert them into a doc. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f447.png" alt="👇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/YvmHBZM7dG">pic.twitter.com/YvmHBZM7dG</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Almanac <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f331.png" alt="🌱" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@AlmanacDocs) <a href="https://twitter.com/AlmanacDocs/status/1393212447381762049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The company is quickly iterating itself into new workflows &#8212; they recently launched a feature specifically around building and updating handbooks, and they also just shipped a feature called Snippets which allows users to save oft-used blocks of texts so they can quickly build up new documents.</p>
<p>In a crowded productivity software space, Almanac&#8217;s sell relies on users fully committing to the offering, that&#8217;s been a central struggle in the post-Microsoft Office era where users have often seen their productivity toolsets swell with tools claiming to cut down on confusion. This often isn&#8217;t the fault of the tools themselves, but with how organizations adopt new software. Almanac hopes that by focusing on common workflows inside documents, its users can resist the urge to open another app and instead realize the gains that come from centralizing feedback in one platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many companies talk the talk when it comes to diversity, but it&#8217;s harder to know if a firm is actually going the extra mile to hire more qualified people from underrepresented groups, or if they just make noise about it. <a href="https://www.blendoor.com/">Blendoor</a>, a six-year-old startup, wants to put data to work on the problem by giving companies a score based on publicly available data to let the world know just how diverse a company actually is.</p>
<p>Blendoor founder and CEO Stephanie Lampkin says that when she launched the company, it was more focused on finding qualified diverse candidates by mitigating unconscious bias in the hiring process. That involved removing name, age, gender or any other indications that could potentially create bias and just let the person&#8217;s work record stand on its own. She said that the startup targeted companies that had made public DEI pledges as a natural place to start.</p>
<p>As the company directed its efforts in this direction, however, Lampkin says that it quickly became apparent that the public positioning of a company, and how it directed its hiring resources, were often two different things, and she decided to switch focus. &#8220;So we decided to create an index, a credit score, and we pulled in a ton of data from their diversity reports, their EEO One forms if they publish them and all of this buzz around different pledges and investments and partnerships, etc.,&#8221; Lampkin told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She then took this data and structured it, normalized it and built an algorithm that could dynamically score companies much the same way that our credit rating or security scorecards work and make that information public.</p>
<p>She said the George Floyd killing was a turning point for her and the company. &#8220;When George Floyd [was killed] and I saw this resurgence of the diversity pledge, I decided that I don&#8217;t want to play in this diversity theater anymore and just be another check-the-box-solution that companies are using to demonstrate that they care,&#8221; she said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vqfYjE6GS1"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/indy-vc-firm-sixty8-capital-launches-20m-fund-aimed-at-underrepresented-founders/">Indy VC firm Sixty8 Capital launches $20M fund aimed at underrepresented founders</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Indy VC firm Sixty8 Capital launches $20M fund aimed at underrepresented founders&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/indy-vc-firm-sixty8-capital-launches-20m-fund-aimed-at-underrepresented-founders/embed/#?secret=vqfYjE6GS1" data-secret="vqfYjE6GS1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>She added, &#8220;So we decided to double down on BlendScore and in doing so hold companies accountable for all of these big financial commitments that they&#8217;re making in order to track the deployment of that capital, but also the downstream effects in terms of their hiring, retention, promotion rates, compensation equality, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>That culminated in <a href="https://www.blendoor.com/resources">a report the company recent published</a> looking at the data and finding that companies&#8217; public stance doesn&#8217;t always match its public face, especially with pledges following Floyd&#8217;s death. &#8220;My initial purpose was to demonstrate if there is a negative correlation between pledges and performance &#8212; and the only area where we found that to be true was with Black employees versus Black Lives Matter pledges.&#8221; She says that everywhere else there was pretty consistent positive correlation around companies that said they wanted to improve in areas like gender diversity and pay equality, and those that were actually doing that.</p>
<p>In terms of making money, Lampkin says that she wants to focus on helping companies with governance when it comes to diversity pledges, especially for public companies, which will have to answer to a variety of constituencies, from investors to consumers. She also believes that their approach to measuring diversity will also increasingly have an impact on who wants to work at a company and the ability to attract the best talent.</p>
<p>She says that if people are insisting on making diversity a political stance, she&#8217;s going to focus on diversity as a fiduciary responsibility. While it may be good for society as a natural byproduct of that, some companies only see it through that governance lens, and if that&#8217;s the case, she intends to work that angle.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What to consider before publishing your diversity memo&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/what-to-consider-before-publishing-your-diversity-memo/embed/#?secret=LJx5l3G8dQ" data-secret="LJx5l3G8dQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m doubling down on ESG and fiduciary responsibility. No more talk about what&#8217;s good for a society. [It doesn&#8217;t matter] what you believe is good for society. This is now about risk management and ESG,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>So far the company has 13 employees and she reports she&#8217;s raised about $1.7 million. She acknowledges raising money is a challenge, especially for a Black woman founder. It&#8217;s worth noting that <a href="https://afrotech.com/black-women-founders-have-tripled-raising-more-than-1m-since-2018">fewer than 100 Black women</a> have ever raised more than $1 million as of last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been really challenging. We&#8217;ve had to just survive off revenue, and think in part it&#8217;s because we sit at the intersection of social activism and for-profit venture, when a lot of investors are like Marc Andreessen they don&#8217;t see a path [for <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/01/klaus-schwab-on-what-is-stakeholder-capitalism-history-relevance/">Stakeholder Capitalism</a>], but I think that&#8217;s changing and the investor community claims to be on board for more impact investing, so we&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has launched a vulnerability disclosure program allowing ethical hackers to report security flaws to federal agencies.</p>
<p>The platform, launched with the help of cybersecurity companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/31/bugcrowd-crowdsourcing-cybersecurity/">Bugcrowd</a> and Endyna, will allow civilian federal agencies to receive, triage and fix security vulnerabilities from the wider security community.</p>
<p>The move to launch the platform comes less than a year after the federal cybersecurity agency, better known as CISA, <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news/2020/09/02/cisa-issues-final-vulnerability-disclosure-policy-directive-federal-agencies">directed</a> the civilian federal agencies that it oversees to develop and publish their own vulnerability disclosure policies. These policies are designed to set the rules of engagement for security researchers by outlining what (and how) online systems can be tested, and which can&#8217;t be.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon for private companies to run VDP programs to allow hackers to report bugs, often in conjunction with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/the-dos-and-donts-of-bug-bounty-programs-with-katie-moussouris/">bug bounty</a> to pay hackers for their work. The U.S. Department of Defense has for years <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/17/department-of-defense-expanding-hack-the-pentagon-program/">warmed to hackers</a>, the civilian federal government has been slow to adopt.</p>
<p>Bugcrowd, which last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/bugcrowd-series-d/">raised $30 million</a> at Series D, said the platform will &#8220;give agencies access to the same commercial technologies, world-class expertise, and global community of helpful ethical hackers currently used to identify security gaps for enterprise businesses.&#8221;</p>
<p>The platform will also help CISA share information about security flaws between other agencies.</p>
<p>The platform launches after a bruising few months for government cybersecurity, including a Russian-led espionage campaign <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/">against at least nine U.S. federal government agencies</a> by hacking software house SolarWinds, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/america-small-business-hafnium-exchange-hacks/">a China-linked cyberattack</a> that backdoored thousands of Microsoft Exchange servers, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/microsoft-says-china-backed-hackers-are-exploiting-exchange-zero-days/">in the federal government</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last month, Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/apple-to-add-lossless-audio-at-no-additional-cost/">announced</a> it would soon add lossless audio streaming and Spatial Audio with support for Dolby Atmos to its Apple Music subscription at no extra charge. That upgrade has now gone live, Apple announced this morning &#8212; though <a href="https://twitter.com/ttam110/status/1401990179557097474">many</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/iupdate/status/1402154297765335046">noticed</a> the additions actually rolled out yesterday, following the WWDC keynote.</p>
<p>The entire Apple Music catalog of 75+ million songs will support lossless audio.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212183">lossless tier</a> begins at CD quality &#8212; 16 bit at 44.1 kHz, and goes up to 24 bit at 48 kHz, Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-music-announces-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio/">previously said</a>. Audiophiles can also opt for the high-resolution lossless that goes up to 24 bit at 192 kHz. Apple has said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/apple-to-add-lossless-audio-at-no-additional-cost/">you&#8217;ll need to use</a> an external, USB digital-to-analog converter to take advantage of the latter &#8212; simply plugging in a pair of headphones to an iPhone won&#8217;t work.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple Music subscribers will be able to enable the new lossless option under Settings &gt; Music &gt; Audio quality. Here, you&#8217;ll be able to choose the different resolutions you want to use for different connections, including Wi-Fi, cellular, and download.</p>
<p>When you make your selection in Settings, iOS warns that lossless files will use &#8220;significantly more space&#8221; on your device, as 10 GB of storage would allow you to store approximately 3,000 songs at high quality, 1,000 songs with lossless, or 200 songs with high-res lossless.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212182">Spatial Audio</a> will be enabled by default on hardware that supports Dolby Atmos, like Apple&#8217;s AirPods and Beats headphones with an H1 or W1 chip. The latest iPhone, iPad, and Mac models also support Dolby Atmos. Spatial Audio on Apple Music will also be &#8220;coming soon&#8221; to Android devices, Apple said.</p>
<p>To kick off launch, Apple Music is today rolling out new playlists designed to showcase Spatial Audio. These include:</p>

</ul>
<p>Apple is also adding a <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/introducing-spatial-audio/pl.af1ad34ef38543dd8bcdfc11356bd00e">special guide</a> to Spatial Audio on Apple Music, which will help music listeners hear the difference. This will include tracks from artists like Marvin Gaye and The Weeknd, among others. And Apple will air a roundtable <a href="https://music.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewMultiRoom?fcId=1561370672">conversation</a> about Spatial Audio featuring top sound engineers and experts, hosted by Zane Lowe at 9 am PT today on Apple Music.</p>
<p>Because songs have to be remastered for Dolby Atmos specifically, these guides and playlists will help music fans experience the new format without having to hunt around. Apple says it&#8217;s working with artists and labels to add more new releases and the best catalog tracks in Spatial Audio. To help on this front, Apple notes there are various initiatives underway &#8212; including doubling the number of Dolby-enabled studios in major markets, offering educational programs, and providing resources to independent artists.</p>
<p>Apple also said it will build music-authoring tools directly into Logic Pro. Later this year, the company plans to release an update to Logic Pro that will allow any musician to create and mix their songs in Spatial Audio for Apple Music.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[You'd expect an expense management company to have a large sales department and advertise heavily. But like we’ve seen over and over, Expensify just doesn’t do what you think it should.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You&#8217;d expect an expense management company to have a large sales department and advertise through all kinds of channels to maximize customer acquisition. But like we’ve seen over and over through the course of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1/">this EC-1</a>, Expensify just doesn’t do what you think it should.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind this company’s propensity to just stick to its guts, it’s not much of a surprise that it got to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/expensify-ec1-culture/">more than $100M in annual recurring revenue</a> and millions of users with a staff of 130, some contractors, and an almost non-existent sales team.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re wondering how its possible to grow to such a level without an established sales team, the short answer is: Word of mouth. To an extent, Expensify can do this due to the space it’s in, as expense reporting is such a thankless, almost mind numbingly boring task that anyone who found a good solution is bound to recommend it to their colleagues and friends.</p>
<p>But it’s more interesting how Expensify grows bottom-up within SMBs, its core customer base. By providing an easy and meaningful experience via the product itself, the company has come to a point where it only takes one or two users who love the service to turn their company into customers.</p>
<p>This approach flips the traditional sales model on its head and is now known as product-led growth, but Expensify did it long before it was an accepted business model. Though that was harder than it sounds, it also put the company in a uniquely privileged position, which it is fully intent on leveraging.</p>
<h2>Starting the flywheel</h2>
<p>There are many ways to get such a business model started, but as usual, Expensify threw caution and all advice out the window and banked on turning its users into evangelizers for its product.</p>

<p>The auction model was Google&#8217;s &#8216;remedy&#8217; of choice &#8212; following the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/google-gets-slapped-5bn-by-eu-for-android-antitrust-abuse/">2018 EU $5BN antitrust enforcement against Android</a> &#8212; but rivals have always maintained it&#8217;s anything but fair, as we&#8217;ve reported previously (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/googles-no-choice-screen-on-android-isnt-working-says-ecosia-querying-the-eus-approach-to-antitrust-enforcement/">here</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/googles-eu-android-choice-screen-isnt-working-say-search-rivals-calling-for-a-joint-process-to-devise-a-fair-remedy/">here</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/10/duckduckgo-still-critical-of-googles-eu-android-choice-screen-auction-after-wining-a-universal-slot/">here</a>, for eg).</p>
<p>The Android choice screen presents users in the region with a selection of search engines to choose as a default at the point of device set up (or factory reset). The offered choices depend on sealed bids made by search engine companies bidding to pay Google to win one of three available slots.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Google&#8217;s own search engine is a staple &#8216;choice&#8217; on the screen regardless of EU market.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google&#8217;s EU Android choice screen isn&#8217;t working say search rivals, calling for a joint process to devise a fair remedy&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/googles-eu-android-choice-screen-isnt-working-say-search-rivals-calling-for-a-joint-process-to-devise-a-fair-remedy/embed/#?secret=05OWd6fuY1" data-secret="05OWd6fuY1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The pay-to-play model Google devised is not only loudly hated by smaller search engine players (including those with alternative business models, such as the Ecosia tree-planting search engine), but it been entirely ineffectual at restoring competitive balance in search marketshare so it&#8217;s not surprising Google has been forced to ditch it.</p>
<p>The Commission had signalled a change might be coming, with <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/antitrust/eus-vestager-actively-working-on-google-android-antitrust-fix">Bloomberg</a> reporting in May remarks by the EU&#8217;s competition chief, Margrethe Vesager, that it was “actively working on making” Google’s Android choice screen for search and browser rivals work. So it evidently heard the repeated cries of &#8216;foul&#8217; and &#8216;it&#8217;s not working, yo!&#8217;. And &#8212; finally &#8212; it acted.</p>
<p>However, framing its own narrative, Google writes that it&#8217;s been in &#8220;constructive discussions&#8221; with EU lawmakers for years about &#8220;how to promote even more choice on Android devices, while ensuring that we can continue to invest in, and provide, the Android platform for free for the long term&#8221;, as it puts it.</p>
<p>It also seems to be trying to throw some shade/blame back at the EU &#8212; writing that it only introduced what it calls a &#8220;promotional opportunity&#8221; (lol) &#8220;in consultation with the Commission&#8221;. (Ergo, &#8216;don&#8217;t blame us gov, blame them!&#8217;)</p>
<p>In another detail-light paragraph of its blog, Google says it&#8217;s now making &#8220;some final changes&#8221; &#8212; including making participation free for &#8220;eligible search providers&#8221; &#8212; after what it describes as &#8220;further feedback from the Commission&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will also be increasing the number of search providers shown on the screen. These changes will come into effect from September this year on Android devices,&#8221; it adds.</p>
<p>The planned changes raise new questions &#8212; such as what criteria it will be using to determine eligibility; and will Google&#8217;s criteria be transparent or, like the problematic auction, sealed from view? And how many search engines will be presented to users? More than the current four, that&#8217;s clear.</p>
<p>Where Google&#8217;s own search engine will appear in the list will also be very interesting to see, as well as the criteria for ranking all the options (marketshare? random allocation?).</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s blog is mealy mouthed on any/all such detail &#8212; but the Commission gave us a pretty good glimpse when we asked (see their comment below).</p>
<p>It still remains to seen whether any other devilish dark pattern design details will appear when we see the full implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> More details on how the choice screen will work can be found <a href="https://www.android.com/choicescreen/">here</a> &#8212; including some details on eligibility where Google says vertical search engines won&#8217;t be able to participate; only general search engines can. It will also weed out multiple search brands owned by the same entity, with only one able to appear. Companies that syndicate Google&#8217;s search results and ads also won&#8217;t be eligible.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that it&#8217;s not in Google&#8217;s gift to claim these changes are &#8220;final&#8221;. EU regulators are responsible for monitoring antitrust compliance &#8212; so if fresh complaints flow they will be duty bound to listen and react.</p>
<p>In one response to Google&#8217;s auction U-turn, pro-privacy search player DuckDuckGo was already critical &#8212; but more on the scope than the detail.</p>
<p>Founder Gabriel Weinberg pointed out that not only is the switch three years too late but Google should also be applying it across all platforms (desktop and Chrome too), as well as making it seamlessly easy for Android users to switch default, rather than gating the choice screen to set-up and/or factory reset (as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/duckduckgo-presses-the-case-for-true-one-click-search-competition-on-android/">we&#8217;ve reported before</a>).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Google is now doing what it should have done 3yr ago: a free search preference menu on Android in the EU: <a href="https://t.co/M9XmB1VuGr">https://t.co/M9XmB1VuGr</a></p>
<p>However, it should be on all platforms (e.g., also desktop Chrome), accessible at all times (i.e., not just on factory reset), and in all countries. <a href="https://t.co/HcIrE8KJx3">https://t.co/HcIrE8KJx3</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Gabriel Weinberg (@yegg) <a href="https://twitter.com/yegg/status/1402258047737774082?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Another long-time critic of the auction model, tiny not-for-profit Ecosia, was jubilant that its fight against the search behemonth has finally paid off.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, CEO Christian Kroll said: “This is a real life David versus Goliath story &#8212; and David has won. This is a momentous day, and a real moment of celebration for Ecosia. We’ve campaigned for fairness in the search engine market for several years, and with this, we have something that resembles a level playing field in the market. Search providers now have a chance to compete more fairly in the Android market, based on the appeal of their product, rather than being shut out by monopolistic behaviour.”</p>
<p>The Commission, meanwhile, confirmed to TechCrunch that it acted after a number of <span lang="EN-IE">competitors raised concerns over the auction model &#8212; with a spokeswoman saying it had &#8220;discussed with Google means to improve that choice screen to address those concerns&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IE">&#8220;We welcome the changes introduced by Google to the choice screen. Being included on the choice screen will now be free for rival search providers,&#8221; she went on. </span><u></u><u></u><u></u><span lang="EN-IE">&#8220;In addition, more search providers will be included in the choice screen. Therefore, users will have even more opportunities to choose an alternative.&#8221;<u></u><u></u></span></p>
<p>The Commission also offered a little more detail of how the choice screen will look come fall, saying that &#8220;o<u></u><span lang="EN-IE">n almost all devices, five search providers will be immediately visible&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IE">&#8220;They will be selected based on their market share in the user’s country and displayed in a randomised order which ensures that Google will not always be the first. Users will be able to scroll down to see up to seven more search providers, bringing the total search providers displayed in the choice screen to 12.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-IE">&#8220;These are positive developments for the implementation of the remedy following our Android decision,&#8221; the spokeswoman added.</span></p>
<p>So it will certainly be very interesting indeed to see whether this Commission-reconfigured much bigger and more open choice screen helps move the regional need on Google&#8217;s search engine market share.</p>
<p>Interesting times indeed!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">What&#8217;s the top-rated hotel in New York City? According to Tripadvisor users, it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60763-d8501479-Reviews-Mint_House_at_70_Pine-New_York_City_New_York.html">Mint House at 70 Pine</a>, and it&#8217;s easy to see why as you click through the photos. Throughout NYC, hotel rooms are essentially bento boxes, carefully constructed to contain all the necessary bits. But not Mint House rooms. Mint House rooms are virtually complete apartments, and travelers have taken notice.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic changed the way Mint House operates, and as the world starts to reopen, the company is well-positioned to serve business and pleasure travelers alike.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.minthouse.com/">Mint House</a> launched in 2017 and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/09/mint-house-raises-15m-to-give-business-travelers-a-better-hotel/">raised $15M in 2019</a> as it expanded its offering. At the time Tige Savage, Revolution Venture managing partner and Mint House investor, described the company like this: &#8220;Mint House is the best of a hotel without the worst of a hotel and the best of an Airbnb without the worst of an Airbnb.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is different from traditional hotels by offering products more similar to those rented by Airbnb, but while still offering similar features as a hotel. Another company called Lyric tried to walk this line, too, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/17/lyric-raises-160-million-series-b-led-by-airbnb/">raised $150m</a> before ultimately shutting down.</p>
<p>Initially, Mint House targeted business travelers in secondary markets (read: not New York City). Pre-COVID Mint House rooms were primarily available in Indianapolis, Denver, Nashville, Miami, and Detroit. Mint House CEO Will Lucas explained at the time that there were opportunities in these markets as often accommodations are worse than in major markets.</p>
<p>COVID changed Mint House&#8217;s trajectory, Lucas explained in an interview with TechCrunch. At the beginning of the pandemic, the hospitality industry fell off. Mint House saw occupancy rates fall from 60% to single digits, and Mint House had to refund customers and furlough employees. Eventually, through new sales team members, Mint House discovered their product offering was well suited for the pandemic. Displaced workers needed a place to live and work. Traveling healthcare professionals needed a home away from home. Some university students were shut out of student housing but still required to attend school. Mint House&#8217;s apartment-like rooms presented a compelling alternative to a traditional hotel room where kitchens are often, at most, just an instant coffee pot and a mini-fridge. But with Mint House rooms, guests have in-room kitchens, living space, and recently rising in importance, an actual workspace.</p>
<p>As the pandemic settled in, Mint House saw a drastic change in length of stay. Before COVID-19, the average stay length was four nights. During COVID-19, the average stay length was 21 nights as the needs for travelers shifted. Instead of flying in for a quick meeting, workers and travelers needed a place to hunker down and work remotely. During the height of the pandemic, 81% of Mint House guests were working remotely.</p>
<p>Mint House&#8217;s key features seem purpose-built for social distancing, but they were in place before the pandemic. Guests do not have to check in with a front desk and there are no key cards. Guests can order groceries, and the room will be stocked before arrival &#8212; a service rarely found outside of business-centric hotels but now in demand even with leisure travelers too. Customer service for all of the properties is centralized, too.</p>
<p>While most of the hospitality industry languished throughout 2020, Mint House saw terrific growth. Several months into the pandemic, Mint House saw occupancy rates hit new highs. By June, 84% of Mint House&#8217;s rooms were booked, and the company averaged 80% over the rest of 2020. The company doubled down and grew its portfolio by over 50% in the last half of 2020, too.</p>
<p>Today, nearly a year after the bottom fell out, Mint House is in 24 buildings in 13 markets.</p>
<p>In New York City, Mint House is competing with giants. CEO Lucas explains.</p>
<p>&#8220;This year, in New York City, we have been earning on average 2.2x the RevPAR (revenue per available room),&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our CompSet (Competitive set, or rather, competing hotels) is incredibly formidable competition that includes two Thompson hotels, three Marriott Hotels, and Hilton Hotels. We are number one in occupancy, number one in ADR (Average Daily Rate), and putting them together, we&#8217;re more than double the CompSet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lucas believes these rankings show Mint House&#8217;s strengths and how the company is different from traditional hospitality brands. And yet, Mint House turned to executives from classic hospitality brands to fuel growth.</p>
<p>Mint House recently announced the addition of several new executives. Jim Mrha, who previously worked at Domio, Hilton, MGM Hospitality, and Marriott, will serve as Mint House&#8217;s CFO. Paul Sacco, a former investment officer and executive at TPG Hotels &amp; Resorts and Starwood, joined Mint House as Chief Development Officer. Jess Berkin, another former hospitality executive of the travel e-commerce startup Porter &amp; Sail, is Mint House&#8217;s new marketing and communication executive.</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels like we&#8217;re about to really blast off,&#8221; Lucas said with a bit of pride.</p>
<p>Mint House is engaged in an aggressive growth strategy just as the world is set to reopen. The company is looking to double the number of available units and go international, starting with London in a month and eventually in South America.</p>
<p>Now, halfway through 2021, the pandemic is receding, and travel is starting to change again. Mint House is seeing the average stay drop back down from 21 nights in 2020 to something around six nights. According to Lucas, leisure travelers are increasing, and Mint House is seeing the return of short business stays. And then there&#8217;s the new type of business traveler who leaves behind their home office to work remotely from somewhere new, like Miami.</p>
<p>Mint House straddles an interesting line between hotels and short-term rentals like those offered by Airbnb. On one side, they offer the convenience and trust found in a hotel with the style and comfort of a short-term rental. If the company can execute its plan and its recent executive hires should help, the company is well suited to compete with the Hilton and Marriotts in NYC and throughout the States and world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to sustainable livestock production and agriculture, measurement is the first &#8212; and sometimes most elusive &#8212; step in the process of turning our food system from a carbon emitter into a carbon sink. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So <a href="https://www.dsm.com/corporate/home.html">DSM</a>, a science-based company that focuses on agriculture and other parts of our food systems, and <a href="https://www.blonkconsultants.nl/">Blonk</a>, a data analytics for sustainability consultancy, developed </span><a href="https://sustell.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sustell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a combination software and practical service for ranchers to understand and improve the sustainability of their operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While sustainable and regenerative agriculture doesn’t have a universally agreed-upon definition, it usually involves changing land management practices to sequester more carbon in the soil, using more environmentally friendly animal feeds and reducing fossil fuel usage of tractors and other farm equipment among many other changes. The goal is to reduce the 7.1 gigatonnes of CO2 released into the atmosphere, about </span><a href="http://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/#:~:text=Total%20emissions%20from%20global%20livestock,of%20all%20anthropogenic%20GHG%20emissions."><span style="font-weight: 400;">14.5%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of all greenhouse gas emissions, created by the livestock industry.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s this tremendous need for accurate footprinting of animal production down to the individual farm level,” said David Nickell, vice president of sustainability and business solutions at DSM. “And each farm, of course, is very different. And you have to have a system which is able to use actual farm data, and to get an accurate picture of that particular farm.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The system analyzes the environmental impact of a farm’s activity on 19 different categories, including climate change, resource use, water scarcity, runoff and ozone depletion. Farmers provide data on their daily operations, including feed composition and use, manure management practices, animal mortality, the electricity system and the other infrastructure, transportation logistics and mitigation technologies employed, like scrubbers or excess heat circulation systems, and sometimes packaging to the software. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blonk’s environmental footprint technology then produces a life cycle assessment of the farm, an analysis of the environmental impact of rearing an animal from inception to when it exits the farm gate. DSM and Blonk have created Sustell modules for most land farm animals, including chickens, pigs and dairy and egg production, and plans to extend it to cover beef and aquaculture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is really key is that we were able to build on this momentum of methodologies and standards that have been developed,” said Hans Blonk, CEO of Blonk Consultants and Blonk Sustainability Tools. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blonk was able to combine agriculture environmental standards from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, European Commission and many others in one place to create the vast library of background data needed for the software to produce useful and actionable insights.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Customers at the moment really want to understand what they&#8217;re doing,” Nickell said. “They want to understand their baseline [footprint] and rank them. Understand what&#8217;s good, and what’s not so good. Customers want to understand how they rate compared to peer benchmarking, whether it&#8217;s a country or an industry benchmark.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the Sustell software gives farmers clarity on the emissions on their farms, they can then identify where improvements need to be made and DSM helps implement ways of reducing those emissions, creating an end-to-end service for customers and hopefully a positive impact on the planet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Practical interventions make change happen,” Nickell said. “We’ve invested in technologies which reduce the footprint of animal products production. The service is measurement and marry that up with bringing solutions, which make a difference. That’s the complete solution to making this much-needed change happen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in order for Sustell to create that change, it needs to be adopted widely and the learnings need to be shared between competitors. Right now, DSM and, in some ways, the capitalist system, isn’t set up for that. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Nickell, DSM is first focusing Sustell on big integrated livestock companies. This is a common challenge with new innovative environmental technologies that can be adopted by big farming conglomerates or co-ops with money and resources to spend, while smaller family farms get left behind. But Nickell hopes that Sustell can scale to work with smaller farms, as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second issue is around data sharing. While Nickell was very clear that Sustell will be following all applicable data privacy and ownership rules &#8212; and that’s usually a good thing &#8212; in order to really create meaningful environmental change, transparency is actually key. Competitors need to share the best ways for reducing emissions so everyone can adopt them and save the planet, but many companies are very data protective. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think maybe that [data sharing] develops in time,” Nickell said. “I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re there yet. Maybe it will get to that level as more and more customers are transparent on their footprint and their reporting.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Proving that Central and Eastern Europe remains a powerhouse of hardware engineering matched with software, <a href="https://www.gideonbros.ai/">Gideon Brothers</a> (GB), a Zagreb, Croatia-based robotics and AI startup, has raised a $31 million Series A round led by Koch Disruptive Technologies (KDT), the venture and growth arm of Koch Industries Inc., with participation from DB Schenker, Prologis Ventures, and Rite-Hite.</p>
<p>The round also includes participation from several of Gideon Brothers&#8217; existing backers: Taavet Hinrikus (co-founder of TransferWise), Pentland Ventures, Peaksjah, HCVC (Hardware Club), Ivan Topčić, Nenad Bakić, and Luca Ascani.</p>
<p>The investment will be used to accelerate the development and commercialization of GB’s AI and 3D vision-based ‘autonomous mobile robots’ or ‘AMRs’. These perform simple tasks such as transporting, picking up, and dropping off products in order to free up humans to perform more valuable tasks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company will also expand its operations in the EU and US by opening offices in Munich, Germany and Boston, Massachusetts, respectively.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2162980" style="width: 508px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162980" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2162980" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Gideon-Brothers-founders.jpg" alt="Gideon Brothers founders" width="498" height="332" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Gideon-Brothers-founders.jpg 498w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Gideon-Brothers-founders.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Gideon-Brothers-founders.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Gideon-Brothers-founders.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2162980" class="wp-caption-text">Gideon Brothers founders</p></div></p>
<p>Gideon Brothers make robots and the accompanying software platform that specializes in horizontal and vertical handling processes for logistics, warehousing, manufacturing, and retail businesses. For obvious reasons, the need to roboticize supply chains has exploded during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Matija Kopić, CEO of Gideon Brothers, said: “The pandemic has greatly accelerated the adoption of smart automation, and we are ready to meet the unprecedented market demand. The best way to do it is by marrying our proprietary solutions with the largest, most demanding customers out there. Our strategic partners have real challenges that our robots are already solving, and, with us, they’re seizing the incredible opportunity right now to effect robotic-powered change to some of the world’s most innovative organizations.”</p>
<p>He added: “Partnering with these forward-thinking industry leaders will help us expand our global footprint, but we will always stay true to our Croatian roots. That is our superpower. The Croatian start-up scene is growing exponentially and we want to unlock further opportunities for our country to become a robotics &amp; AI powerhouse.”</p>
<p>Annant Patel, Director at Koch Disruptive Technologies said: “With more than 300 Koch operations and production units globally, KDT recognizes the unique capabilities of and potential for Gideon Brothers&#8217; technology to substantially transform how businesses can approach warehouse and manufacturing processes through cutting edge AI and 3D AMR technology.”</p>
<p>Xavier Garijo, Member of the Board of Management for Contract Logistics, DB Schenker added: “Our partnership with Gideon Brothers secures our access to best in class robotics and intelligent material handling solutions to serve our customers in the most efficient way.”</p>
<p>GB’s competitors include Seegrid, Teradyne (MiR), Vecna Robotics, Fetch Robotics, AutoGuide Mobile Robots, Geek+ and Otto Motors.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Compose.ai, which built its own language model to help folks write faster, landed a $2.1 million seed round led by Craft Ventures.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In today&#8217;s GPT-3 world, it&#8217;s not uncommon to hear about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/gpt-3-powered-copy-ai-raises-2-9m-in-a-round-led-by-craft-ventures/">new software services</a> that deal with text. <a href="https://www.compose.ai/">Compose.ai</a> is one such company, though it built its own language model to help folks write faster. Its early product work was enough for it to land a $2.1 million seed round led by Craft Ventures, it announced this morning.</p>
<p>Compose.ai is essentially an auto-complete function that works wherever you browse the web. The company is also building the capability for its AI-powered backend to learn your voice, imbibe context to help provide better responses, and, in time, absorb a company&#8217;s larger voice to help align its aggregate writing output.</p>
<p>Co-founders Landon Sanford and Michael Shuffett told TechCrunch that Compose.ai believes that in five years, average folks won&#8217;t type every word that they write. They want to bring that future to more people through the Compose.ai Chrome extension, which hopefully workers can access without having to get corporate permission.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sanford and Shuffett described their language algorithm as a multi-tier product. Its first tier learns from reading the internet itself, learning English. The second tier deals with specific domains, like email. The third tier learns a user&#8217;s voice, and, in time, a fourth tier will deal with a company&#8217;s generalized approach to language.</p>
<p>The ability for a company to provide its workers with a shared language model that could offer linguistic and word-choice preferences as they write is an interesting concept. The idea of such a strong, centrally held tone lands somewhere between helpful and intellectually rigid. But lots of folks don&#8217;t want to put their own spin on writing; many people don&#8217;t like writing at all. So perhaps having more central support won&#8217;t be onerous to most &#8212; but rather a time-saving hack.</p>
<p>Regardless, Compose.ai is going to staff up modestly with its new raise. The company currently has three full-time workers and some contract help. Sanford and Shuffett told TechCrunch that the company intends to stay small, hiring a few experienced engineering and machine-learning staff to help flesh out its product team.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s ahead for Compose? Its founders told TechCrunch that they are starting to talk to the corporate world a bit more than before and are planning on launching a paid service toward the end of the quarter. That could mean early revenue, extending the startup&#8217;s runway substantially.</p>
<p>What Compose is building isn&#8217;t technically simple, and the company has interesting work ahead of it to get its economics properly tuned. The company&#8217;s founders told TechCrunch that the personalization work that its product will execute for customers can be expensive if done incorrectly; the pair said that they could make a future, $10/month plan attractive economically, but if done in a &#8220;naive&#8221; fashion, Compose.ai could spend $500 in compute costs to support the same account.</p>
<p>That would be bad.</p>
<p>But the company is confident that its impending paid plans should shake out well in financial terms, which makes us all the more interested in giving that version of its product a spin when we get the chance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As people live longer and longer and have long-term health issues like cancer and dementia, caring for elderly relatives is becoming a huge societal and political issue. Right now this care is antiquated and run by incumbents, many of which still run off paper and Excel. We are now seeing a new wave of startups turn up to tackle this space by applying Apple’s age-old model of owning the experience end-to-end and running everything on a platform.</p>
<p>The latest to join this race is UK startup <a href="https://www.liftedcare.com/">Lifted</a>, which has now raised $6.2 million in a Series A funding round led by Fuel Ventures. Also participating were existing investor 1818 Venture Capital as well as new investors Novit Ventures, Perivoli Innovations, the J.B. Ugland family office, and a number of Angels. This latest funding round takes the total raised by Lifted to $11.2M.</p>
<p>Lifted says its UK market is increasing and claims the number of people caring for adult loved ones has risen exponentially during the pandemic, with almost 1 in 2 people supporting people outside their household.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup is entering a perfect storm of increasing need, unpopular care homes, and the UK Government still without a long-term plan for social care.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2162968" style="width: 586px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162968" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lifted-tech-1.png" alt="Lifted app" width="576" height="686" class="size-full wp-image-2162968" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lifted-tech-1.png 576w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lifted-tech-1.png?resize=126,150 126w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lifted-tech-1.png?resize=252,300 252w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lifted-tech-1.png?resize=571,680 571w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lifted-tech-1.png?resize=42,50 42w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2162968" class="wp-caption-text">Lifted app</p></div></p>
<p>In contrast to a raft of agencies and freelancers, Lifted directly employs its care workforce and uses its platform to “gamify and improve the experience of carers to make them perform better in people&#8217;s lives and also to restore respect to the caring profession” with its  Care Management Platform, says the company.</p>
<p>Lifted has also acquired the ‘Live Better With Dementia’ website and launched the Lifted Dementia Hub, an online community with a marketplace of products.</p>
<p>Rachael Crook co-founded Lifted with Sam Cohen. She says she was inspired to get into the sector when, at the age of 24, she had to care for her mother, who was diagnosed with dementia at age 56.</p>
<p>Rachael Crook, Lifted CEO sold me at an interview: “I was in that position much younger than most people. And it seemed abundantly clear to me that it was an experience that was hugely emotionally important to me, and financially expensive, was really convoluted and frustrating. It made an already really difficult time, more difficult. My mum brought me up to really fight for the underdog and I felt like the carers themselves were getting a really poor deal. And yet, it&#8217;s a huge colossal market. The care market is set to double in the next 20 years, and for the next 10 years, we will look to compete against traditional care companies. We want to transform the care experience. This is a product that is worth four and a half times your mortgage. And yet, it&#8217;s predominantly bought in a really antiquated way with paper and pen systems. It’s really hard to keep up to date with your loved ones’ care. We&#8217;re also competing against new entrants.”</p>
<p>She added: “In 12 months, we have tripled revenue, launched the first App in the world to offer free care advice, and cut Carer churn to half the industry average, all while maintaining exclusively 5-star reviews on Trustpilot.”</p>
<p>Mark Pearson, Managing Partner of Fuel Ventures said: “Rachael, Sam and their team have delivered exceptional growth in the past year. They have a unique vision of the future for care and their model is delivering clear results for both sides of the marketplace.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://liteboxer.com/">Liteboxer</a>, the Peloton for boxing, has announced the close of a $20 million Series A funding round led by Nimble Ventures. B. Riley Venture Capital participated, alongside existing investors Raptor Group and Will Ventures.</p>
<p>Liteboxer launched publicly to the world in July of 2020, announcing an in-home device that brings gamification, hit music, and a touch of entertainment to a boxing workout. The patented hardware includes a system of lights that smartly pair with music to give the user an intense workout that feels more like a game. Hit where the light goes off, on beat with the music, until your ass has sufficiently been kicked.</p>
<p>Content is a big piece of the puzzle with Liteboxer. For $29/month, users get access to unlimited training sessions and workouts led by Liteboxer trainers. The Liteboxer also has a Quick Play option, that forgoes the trainer content and lets users workout based on the song they choose.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This comes by way of an exclusive partnership with Universal Music. Liteboxer always has a rotation of 100 Universal Music songs available to users, and the system is able to automatically pair the lighting with the beat of the music for lighter-weight workouts.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Liteboxer, the Peloton for boxing, enters the ring&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/14/liteboxer-the-peloton-for-boxing-enters-the-ring/embed/#?secret=Zh2o9Znhnb" data-secret="Zh2o9Znhnb" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Not only are users competing with themselves, but they can also connect with other friends to compete against one another.</p>
<p>Engagement is the name of the game for Liteboxer, according to cofounders Jeff Morin (CEO) and Todd Dagres (Chairman). They say that since shipping equipment in October, they&#8217;re seeing users, on average, doing a Liteboxer workout four to five times a week.</p>
<p>Since launch, the company has made some tweaks. For one, the original focus on the trainer side was on the technique of boxing. But given. the importance of music to the workouts, Liteboxer has realized the impact that an entertaining trainer can have.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rhythm has been so important,&#8221; said Morin. &#8220;We&#8217;ve learned that you can&#8217;t train rhythm if someone doesn&#8217;t have that. We&#8217;ve seen trainers with more spin class experience be able to feel the cadence. of the music, and know when the beat drop is coming, and craft these programs that are basically an art piece or performance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is also looking at its employment of these trainers, shifting from 1099 to part-time employment and seriously considering full-time W2 employment for them, as well.</p>
<div></div>
<div>This latest round of funding is meant to fuel growth and power initiatives aimed at getting the device out in the wild so more people can see and experience it. The cofounders explained that this was one of the big challenges of launching during the pandemic with a product like this.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $28.5 million.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Early stage investor Version One, which consists of partners Boris Wertz and Angela Tran, has <a href="https://versionone.vc/announcing-fund-iv-and-opportunities-fund-ii/">raised its fourth fund</a>, as well as a second opportunity fund specifically dedicated to making follow-on investments. Fund IV pools $70 million from LPs to invest, and Opportunities Fund II is $30 million, both up from the $45 million Fund III and roughly $20 million original Opportunity Fund.</p>
<p>Version One is unveiling this new pool of capital after a very successful year for the firm, which is based in Vancouver and San Francisco. 2021 saw its first true blockbuster exit, with Coinbase&#8217;s IPO. The investor also saw big valuation boosts on paper for a number of its portfolio companies, including Ada (which raises at a $1.2 billion valuation in May); Dapper Labs (valued at $7.5 billion after riding the NFT wave); and Jobber (no valuation disclosed but raised a $60 million round in January).</p>
<p>I spoke to both Wertz and Tran about their run of good fortune, how they think the fund has achieved the wins it recorded thus far, and what Version One has planned for this Fund IV and its investment strategy going forward.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We have this pretty broad focus of mission-driven founders, and not necessarily just investing in SaaS, or just investing in marketplaces, or crypto,&#8221; Wertz said regarding their focus. &#8220;We obviously love staying early — pre-seed and seed — we&#8217;re really the investors that love investing in people, not necessarily in existing traction and numbers. We love being contrarian, both in terms of the verticals we go in to, and and the entrepreneurs we back; we&#8217;re happy to be backing first-time entrepreneurs that nobody else has ever backed.&#8221;</p>
<p>In speaking to different startups that Version One has backed over the years, I&#8217;ve always been struck by how connected the founders seem to the firm and both Wertz and Tran — even much later in the startups&#8217; maturation. Tran said that one of their advantages is following the journey of their entrepreneurs, across both good times and bad.</p>
<p>&#8220;We get to learn,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s so cool to watch these companies scale [&#8230;] we get to see how these companies grow, because we stick with them. Even the smallest things we&#8217;re just constantly thinking about— we&#8217;re constantly thinking about Laura [Behrens Wu] at Shippo, we&#8217;re constantly thinking about Mike [Murchison] and David [Hariri] at Ada, even though it&#8217;s getting harder to really help them move the needle on their business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wertz also discussed the knack Version One seems to have for getting into a hot investment area early, anticipating hype cycles when many other firms are still reticent.</p>
<p>&#8220;We we went into crypto early in 2016, when most people didn&#8217;t really believe in crypto,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We started investing pretty aggressively in in climate last year, when nobody was really invested in climate tech. Having a conviction in in a few areas, as well as the type of entrepreneurs that nobody else really has conviction is what really makes these returns possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since climate tech is a relatively new focus for Version One, I asked Wertz about why they&#8217;re betting on it now, and why this is not just another green bubble like the one we saw around the end of the first decade of the 2000s.</p>
<p>&#8220;First of all, we deeply care about it,&#8221; he said. Secondly, we think there is obviously a new urgency needed for technology to jump into to what is probably one of the biggest problems of humankind. Thirdly, is that the clean tech boom has put a lot of infrastructure into the ground. It really drove down the cost of the infrastructure, and the hardware, of electric cars, of batteries in general, of solar and renewable energies in general. And so now it feels like there&#8217;s more opportunity to actually build a more sophisticated application layer on top of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tran added that Version One also made its existing climate bet at what she sees as a crucial inflection point — effectively at the height of the pandemic, when most were focused on healthcare crises instead of other imminent existential threats.</p>
<p>I also asked her about the new Opportunity Fund, and how that fits in with the early stage focus and their overall functional approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t require much change in the way we operate, because we&#8217;re not doing any net new investments,&#8221; Tran said. &#8220;So we recognize we&#8217;re not growth investors, or Series A/Series B investors that need to have a different lens in the way that they evaluate companies. For us, we just say we want to double down on these companies. We have such close relationships with them, we know what the opportunities are. It&#8217;s almost like we have information arbitrage.&#8221;</p>
<p>That works well for all involved, including LPs, because Tran said that it&#8217;s appealing to them to be able to invest more in companies doing well without having to build a new direct relationship with target companies, or doing something like creating an SPV designated for the purpose, which is costly and time-consuming.</p>
<p>Looking forward to what&#8217;s going to change with this fund and their investment approach, Wertz points to a broadened international focus made possible by the increasingly distributed nature of the tech industry following the pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that the thing that probably will change the most is just much more international investing in this one, and I think it&#8217;s just direct result of the pandemic and Zoom investing, that suddenly the pipeline has opened up,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve certainly learned a lot about ourselves over the past year and a half,&#8221; Tran added. &#8220;I mean, we&#8217;ve always been distributed, [&#8230;] and being remote was one of our advantages. So we certainly benefited and we didn&#8217;t have to adjust our working style too much, right. But now everyone&#8217;s working like this, [&#8230;] so it&#8217;s going to be fun to see what advantage we come up with next.&#8221;</p>

<p>Selling enterprise software is much more complicated than convincing a potential customer that your solution is the best and signing a contract. A <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/sales/insights/b2b-buying-journey">recent Gartner study </a>found that buying groups for B2B solutions can involve up to six to 10 decision makers, and that the majority of buyers said their most recent purchase was “very complex or difficult” as they came to a consensus while negotiating with vendors.</p>
<p><a href="https://buyerassist.io/">BuyerAssist</a>, a new startup founded by former employees of sales readiness platform MindTickle, wants to make the buying process as smooth as possible. The company is launching its beta product to the public today with $2 million in seed funding led by Stellaris Venture Partners and Emergent Ventures, with participation from angel investors. The capital will be used for hiring in the U.S. and India, with plans to bring BuyerAssist’s platform out of beta later this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Headquartered in San Francisco, with an office in Pune, India, BuyerAssist.io was founded last year by Amit Dugar, Shankar Ganapathy and Shyam HN, all alumni of SoftBank Vision 2-backed MindTickle, a platform that enables companies to train their sales staff at scale. The philosophy behind BuyerAssist draws on HN and Ganapathy’s experience on the sales and marketing side of MindTickle: Ganapathy was its director of strategic accounts, while HN served as head of global sales development.</p>
<p>“We’ve sold half a million dollar deals, and deals where you have anywhere form 10 to 25 people involved from the buyer side,” HN told TechCrunch. “There’s a core team of about five to 10 people, but then there is also an extended team that comes and goes during the process.”</p>

<p>The pandemic added an extra layer of complexity to B2B sales, because many deals were done remotely. Furthermore, sales representatives get less time to interact with buyers. The Gartner report found that when B2B buying teams consider a purchase, they spend only 17% of that time meeting with potential suppliers, and the amount of time they spend interacting with any sales representative may be only 5% to 6%. This means vendors have to find ways to keep potential buyers engaged, while making the process easier for them.</p>
<p>BuyerAssist describes itself as a &#8220;operating system for B2B companies to deliver the most effective buying experience.&#8221; It helps by providing a centralized place to gather information that would usually be buried in emails and notes, and make it searchable. It also lets both vendors and buyers share information about their needs (like pricing, information security reviews and when they want to deploy software by), creating more transparency for each side, and stores important files like proposals, contracts and legal documentation.</p>
<p>For vendors, having information and questions from potential buyers organized in one place can help them better understand their deals pipeline and meet revenue goals. BuyerAssist also provides analytics that can help them retain more contracts. For example, it alerts vendors when buyers become less engaged, which may mean they are losing interest.</p>
<p>During its beta stage, BuyerAssist worked with four companies. The platform is currently focused on enterprise software and SaaS companies that do a lot of their sales remotely, but can be used for any complex sales process that involves multiple calls and emails. Other sectors BuyerAssist wants to enter include manufacturing and financial services.</p>
<p>BuyerAssist is part of a new crop of startups focused on helping vendors and buyers work together on complicated sales. Others include Accord, MetaCX, Dealpoint and Recapped.io. HN said that the space is still very new, so companies are still figuring out their positioning. In BuyerAssist’s case, this means focusing on buyer engagement, instead of mutual success plans or collaborations, from the beginning. HN said the company will double down on investing in two key areas of product development: building its enterprise grade product to support complex sales and becoming the preferred way for buying teams to engage with BuyerAssist’s clients.</p>
<p>In statement about the investment, Stellaris Venture Partners partner Alok Goyal said, “As a venture capitalist focusing on the SaaS space, we get to see hundreds of teams. But it is very rare to find teams that create a perfect storm of domain expertise, functional expertise in different areas of building SaaS companies and at the same time bringing the perfect complementarity between the founders.”</p>
<p>Anupam Rastogi, a partner at Emergent Ventures, said “What excites me about BuyerAssist is that it focuses on reducing friction between buyers and sellers. Buyers want more flexibility and less noise. Sellers want to run a more consistent sales process. BuyerAssist facilitates this, and enables both to build a long term partnership. This is where we see the industry heading in the years and decades to come.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">3D-printed rocket startup Relativity Space has raised a $650 million Series E, bringing its total raised to over $1.2 billion. Relativity’s post-money valuation now stands at $4.2 billion, a source familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The round was led by Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, with participation from new investors with funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Centricus, Coatue, and Soroban Capital, and participation from existing investors Baillie Gifford, K5 Global, Tiger Global, Tribe Capital, XN, Brad Buss, Mark Cuban, Jared Leto, and Spencer Rascoff.</p>
<p>The funds from the Series E will go toward accelerating the production of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/26/relativity-space-unveils-plans-for-a-new-much-larger-and-fully-reusable-rocket/">Terran R, the company’s heavy-lift, fully reusable two-stage rocket</a>. Terran R joins Terran 1, Relativity’s debut rocket, which will conduct its first orbital flight at the end of 2021.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has been pretty tight-lipped about Terran R, but are now releasing further details alongside the funding announcement. As expected, Terran 1 and Terran R differ in pretty significant ways: the former is expendable, the latter reusable; the former is designed for small payloads, the latter for large. Even the Terran R’s payload fairing is reusable, and Relativity has devised a system that makes it easier to recover and recycle as it stays attached to the second stage.</p>
<p>The larger rocket will clock in at 216 feet tall with a maximum payload capacity of 20,000 pounds to low Earth orbit. (For comparison, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket stands at around 230 feet with a maximum payload to LEO of 22,800 pounds.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2162730" style="width: 4454px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29.1018_BLACK_WPERSON_Logo.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2162730" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2162730 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29.1018_BLACK_WPERSON_Logo.png" alt="" width="4444" height="2500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29.1018_BLACK_WPERSON_Logo.png 4444w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29.1018_BLACK_WPERSON_Logo.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29.1018_BLACK_WPERSON_Logo.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29.1018_BLACK_WPERSON_Logo.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29.1018_BLACK_WPERSON_Logo.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29.1018_BLACK_WPERSON_Logo.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29.1018_BLACK_WPERSON_Logo.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29.1018_BLACK_WPERSON_Logo.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4444px) 100vw, 4444px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2162730" class="wp-caption-text">Relativity&#8217;s Terran 1 on the left, and Terran R on the right. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Relativity</p></div></p>
<p>Terran R will use seven of its new Aeon R engines on the first stage, each capable of 302,000 pounds of thrust. The same 3D printers that will produce Terran R&#8217;s engines and rockets also currently make the nine Aeon 1 engines that power the Terran 1, which means Relativity doesn&#8217;t have to drastically reconfigure its production line to build the new launch vehicle.</p>
<p>A single Terran R should take around 60 days to build, Ellis estimated. That&#8217;s an incredible pace for a rocket with this kind of payload capacity.</p>
<p>Even though Terran 1 has not seen a launch yet, Relativity shows no signs of slowing down Terran R’s development: Ellis said the company will also launch Terran R from its launch site at Cape Canaveral as early as 2024 and that it signed its first anchor customer, “a well-known blue-chip company,” for the new rocket.</p>
<p>Relativity has printed around 85% of the rocket that will perform the company’s first orbital flight at the end of this year. The Terran 1 that will perform that mission will not be carrying any payload. Terran 1’s second launch is scheduled to take place in June &#8217;22, and will carry cubesats to LEO as part of NASA’s Venture Class Launch Services Demonstration 2 (VCLS Demo 2) contract.</p>
<p>Relativity CEO Tim Ellis in an interview with TechCrunch likened 3D printing to a paradigm shift in manufacturing. “I think really the thing people haven&#8217;t gotten about our approach, or 3D printing in general, is it&#8217;s actually more like transitioning from gas internal combustion engines to electric, or on-premise service to cloud,” Ellis said. “3D printing is a cool technology but more than that, it&#8217;s actually software and data-driven manufacturing and automation technology.”</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/9BhkjEc6Q64?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Because the core of 3D printing is a technology stack, the company can produce algorithmically generated structures with “geometries that couldn’t be possible” with traditional manufacturing, Ellis said. And the design can be easily adjusted to fit market demand.</p>
<p>Ellis, who started the metal 3D printing division at Blue Origin before founding Relativity, said that the strategy from day one was to design and build Terran 1 and a heavy-lift counterpart.</p>
<p>The actual mechanisms involved in 3D printing can technically occur in environments even when gravity is much lower – like the gravity on Mars, which is only about 38% of the gravity on Earth. But more importantly, Ellis said it’s an approach that’s “inevitably required” in an uncertain off-planet environment.</p>
<p>“When we founded Relativity, the inspiration was watching SpaceX land rockets and dock with the space station. They were 13 years old and they were, despite all of that pretty inspiring success, the only company that wanted to make humanity a multi-planetary and go to Mars,” Ellis said. “And I thought that 3D printing tech was inevitable to actually build an industrial base on another planet. No one else had actually even tried to go to Mars or said that was their core mission. And that&#8217;s still true today, actually, even five years later, it&#8217;s still just us and SpaceX. And I really do hope to inspire dozens to hundreds of companies to go after that mission.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">&#8220;Digital transformation&#8221; has been on the mind of many an organization in the last year: the pandemic and the shift it&#8217;s brought to how we work are speeding up investments in new apps, infrastructure and work practices to improve productivity regardless of where we sit all day. Now, it looks like we&#8217;re on to the next stage of that journey: actually figuring out how to adopt and run with all that new tech.</p>
<p>In a sign of the times, today a startup called <a href="https://whatfix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whatfix</a> &#8212; which has built a platform that helps make better use of tech investments by giving chatbot-style guidance to users on how to use apps, with the option also to apply AI to understand what a person is doing to suggest what actions to take next &#8212; is announcing $90 million in funding. It will use the money to continue expanding its tech platform and hiring more talent to meet demand, said CEO Khadim Batti, who co-founded the company with Vara Kumar (CTO), in an interview this week.</p>
<p>Sources close to the company &#8212; co-headquartered in San Jose and Bangalore &#8212; confirmed that the Series D round was made at a valuation of around $600 million, triple Whatfix&#8217;s value in its Series C round last year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That sharp rise is due in part to the state of the market today, but also the company&#8217;s growth within that bigger trend. Whatfix today has some 500 global customers on its books, The Netherlands Red Cross, Experian, Sentry Financial Services, Cardinal Health Canada, BMC Software Inc., and Bausch &amp; Lomb among them. Some 75% of its business is coming out of the U.S., with another 18% from Europe. Revenues in the last six months have been growing at a rate of 100% quarter-on-quarter.</p>
<p>&#8220;This pandemic has proven an inflection point for adoption,&#8221; said Batti (pictured above, left with Kumar, right).</p>
<p>This latest tranche of equity funding is coming from a mix of financial and strategic investors.</p>
<p>SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 2 is leading the round, with Eight Roads Ventures, Sequoia Capital India, Dragoneer Investment Group, F-Prime Capital and Cisco Investments also investing. The company has raised just under $140 million in total.</p>
<p>&#8220;Digital adoption solutions&#8221; &#8212; the general term describing what Whatfix has built &#8212; have become a popular solution for enterprises that have found themselves in an IT pickle, Batti said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen more than $500 billion spent on enterprise software, with areas like SaaS growing very fast. There is so much there, and every employee has access to do better work. But most are not adopting or using that software. This means a lot [of inefficiency] in &#8216;digital transformation,'&#8221; said Batti. &#8220;We are focusing on fixing this problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Digital adoption and digital experience overall can come in many forms these days.</p>
<p>They include assistants that are embedded directly into apps themselves (with some versions of this &#8212; such as Clippy on Word &#8212; nearly as old as software itself). The category also includes separate platforms that integrate at the back end with the apps that you use, providing not just a single ingestion point for data but intelligence on how best to use it, and what to use. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/dooly-raises-80m-more-for-its-ai-tools-to-help-salespeople-manage-their-busywork/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dooly</a> for sales teams is an example of that, although I don&#8217;t know if it would describe itself as a &#8220;digital adoption solution&#8221; per se.)</p>
<p>Others like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/17/pendo-scores-100m-series-e-on-1-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pendo</a> are geared more at observing how your sites and apps are being adopted and used by others. And there are a number of others out there specifically looking at digital adoption by enterprises and competing directly with Whatfix: they include Apty, Userlane, Applearn.</p>
<p>One of the biggest &#8212; WalkMe &#8212; yesterday <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/walkme-announces-launch-of-initial-public-offering-301306903.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced an IPO</a> at an estimated $2.5 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Overall digital adoption and digital experience are big businesses: one analyst <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/digital-experience-platform-market-size-to-be-valued-at-15-80-billion-by-2025--owing-to-adoption-of-digital-platforms-for-developing-marketing-strategies-by-industry-participants--million-insights-301259286.html#:~:text=All%20Products-,Digital%20Experience%20Platform%20Market%20Size%20To%20Be%20Valued%20At%20%2415.80,By%20Industry%20Participants%20%7C%20Million%20Insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimates</a> that the market is growing currently at a rate of just under 11% annually and will be worth $15.8 billion by 2025.</p>

That includes Whatfix being able to provide assistance on apps even when they have been customised for a particular workplace. It most commonly appears like a little chatbot on the user&#8217;s screen, like the one in this paragraph, which can expand with more details and information as needed, like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2162944" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-1.51.03-PM.png?w=179" alt="" width="179" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-1.51.03-PM.png 706w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-1.51.03-PM.png?resize=89,150 89w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-1.51.03-PM.png?resize=179,300 179w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-1.51.03-PM.png?resize=405,680 405w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-08-at-1.51.03-PM.png?resize=30,50 30w" sizes="(max-width: 179px) 100vw, 179px" /></p>
<p>The company works with the most popular software packages &#8212; including Salesforce, MS Dynamics, Oracle&#8217;s CRM platform, ServiceNow, SuccessFactors, SharePoint, Workday &#8212; but, since it is used in the form of a browser extension or an overlay integrated by a company&#8217;s IT department, it can be used to help guide people with any application that&#8217;s available over the web. Batti said that one priority the startup has is to build deeper integrations with specific apps so that Whatfix can be used better across mobile and with local apps in future, not just via the web.</p>
<p>Many might think of &#8220;digital adoption&#8221; as training someone to use a particular software package, and while Whatfix is used for that, the company has also found a lot of traction as a tool beyond it, providing support on a more regular basis and across a wider variety of use cases, whether it&#8217;s to help guide people through app usage, or to monitor what they are doing in order to help suggest what to do next, and even populate relevant fields if &#8220;next&#8221; means using a different app.</p>
<p>The platform can be used to create usage guides, multilingual support, multi-device support, user tracking and more, and it comes with low-code options (it can be intergrated into an app with a single line of code, the company says).</p>
<p>The company claims its assistants can increase employee productivity by 35%, reduce training time and costs by 60%, reduce employee case tickets by 50% and increase application data accuracy by 20%.</p>
<p>While the field for digital adoption is very crowded today, it&#8217;s numbers like these, Whatfix&#8217;s own growth, and the fact that software is continuing to get more capable, but also more complex, that have interested investors.</p>
<p>“Digital Adoption Solutions are enhancing the growth and importance of SaaS products for enterprises globally,” said Munish Varma, Managing Partner, SoftBank Investment Advisers, in a statement. &#8220;Whatfix makes it easier for companies to use SaaS products, which increases productivity. Whatfix, with its roster of global clients, is well placed to become a DAS leader, and we are excited to be part of their journey.” Sumer Juneja, Partner, SoftBank Investment Advisers, added: “Enterprises spend billions on applications across multiple functions and yet employee adoption is low. Quick adoption ensures payback on software investments. Whatfix’s solutions will be a key driver for enterprises to achieve this goal, which is reflected in their growth.”</p>
<p>What will be interesting to watch is how platforms like Whatfix&#8217;s will evolve over time, and what further functions they might take on. For example, in enterprises, one of the biggest vulnerabilities in security has been how people mistakenly click on dodgy links in emails or otherwise inadvertently pass on information to malicious hackers. Could there be a role for digital adoption assistants to identify when this might happen and alert people before they click the wrong way? Regardless, the question and very existence of loopholes like that are signals for why we&#8217;ll probably why we&#8217;ll continue to see tools like Whatfix&#8217;s around for some time to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An update to an existing art app that allows artists to access NFT marketplaces directly, could have the potential to democratize access to the NFT world for artists not currently in crypto. <a href="https://sketchar.io/">SketchAR</a>, is an existing mobile app that allows artists to turn photos into illustrations using its AI-based computer vision. It is now is launching a new feature that allows users to turn their art into NFTs directly inside the app, and then sell it. Content produced on the app can also include a public community feed and digital learning courses.</p>
<p>The app, which boasts it has almost a million users already, will start off selecting a single ‘Creator of the Week’ from its community for their art to be NFT’d on the OpenSea marketplace. But a new feature will shortly enable any artist using the platform to create and auction an NFT on-demand.</p>
<p>However, there a catch. The artwork will have to be created directly in the SketchAR app in order to prove the artist is the legitimate rights holder, says the startup. This is, however, an advantage, says the startup, since very few marketplaces monitor the derivation and authenticity of artworks uploaded proactively.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And for now, it looks like there is no real equivalent app on the market, although there are of course plenty of ways to create an artwork and then upload it to an NFT marketplace in a separate process.</p>
<p>Andrey Drobitko, CEO and founder told me: “It’s a unique offer since it allows even amateur designers to create an art piece and turn it into an NFT without diving deep into the ecosystem, connecting their wallet to their OpenSea account and paying significant gas fees to minting.”</p>
<p>He said: “Since the art piece comes from the app SketchAR, it also ensures it’s authentic and wasn’t stolen &#8211; something that happened quite a few times with NFTs.&#8221;</p>
<p>SketchAR said it also built its own infrastructure that allows it to use Ethereum and other 2-layer solutions like Flow, Immutable, or Binance Smart Chain, to reduce costs.</p>
<p>“Basically it competes with artists and designers learning a lot about blockchain, how to work with it, and working directly with marketplaces like OpenSea or Rarible” added Drobitko.</p>
<p>&#8220;15 years ago I realized I couldn’t make much money as an artist and only continued to make art for pleasure. It’s different now and we’re excited to support artists, help them develop creative skills, and successfully monetize their artworks,” he said.</p>
<p>It’s estimated there are roughly 50 million artists globally, but fewer than 10% are able to make it their primary source of income.</p>
<p>According to NonFungible.com more than $2 billion was spent on NFTs during the first quarter of 2021 representing an increase of about 2,100% from Q4 2020.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New York-based Simulate today announced a $50 million fundraise. Led by Alexis Ohanian’s 776, the Series B brings the meat alternative’s total funding to north of $60 million and values it at $260 million.</p>
<p>Simulate’s first product, Nuggs (formerly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/nuggs-rebrands-as-simulate-with-new-cash-a-new-cto-and-an-expanded-line-of-faux-meat-foods/">also the startup&#8217;s name</a>), has already caused a splash, thanks in no small part to aggressive online advertising. The company notes a massive push in retail availability in the last six months. The chicken nugget alternative was available direct to consumers through online ordering when it launched in Summer 2019 &#8212; availability that moved the needle during U.S. shutdowns over the past year.</p>
<p>“During the height of the pandemic, people really wanted frozen food shipped directly to their door,” founder and CEO Ben Pasternak tells TechCrunch. “At the time, we were DTC only, so we saw a lot of growth there prior to our pivot to retail.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He adds that the majority of the company’s sales now currently come from retail, due to accessibility and more restrictive DTC pricing. Currently, the product is available in 5,000 retail locations, a list that includes pretty massive retail names like Walmart/ Sam’s Club, Target and Whole Foods.</p>
<p>“We are getting ready to launch in restaurants and in fast food,” says Pasternak. “Internationally, we recently launched across Canada, and have plans to expand to other countries too.”</p>
<p>Funding will also go toward expanding the company’s headcount. Currently at 20, Simulate expects to expand employment to 50 people by 2022. “Over half of that expansion will be focused on growing our engineering team,” Pasternak says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.airbase.com/">Airbase</a>, a corporate spend startup, announced that it has closed a $60 million Series B led by Menlo Ventures. The deal&#8217;s announcement comes after Divvy, another corporate-spend focused startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/why-did-bill-com-pay-2-5b-for-divvy/">sold to Bill.com for several billion dollars</a>, and other unicorns in the space like Brex and Divvy each raised nine-figure rounds.</p>
<p>According to Airbase CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/thejo?lang=en">Thejo Kote</a>, his company&#8217;s round is not a response to the Divvy sale. Instead, he told TechCrunch in an interview, his company kicked off its fundraising process before that deal was announced.</p>
<p>Not that what Airbase undertook was a process in the traditional sense; Kote did not spend months schlepping a deck along Sand Hill Road, imbibing mediocre architecture, overdressed MBAs and good weather in equal quantities. Instead, he decided that his firm was open to raising more capital in April despite having capital in the bank from previous investments, and 10 days later had signed a term sheet with Menlo.</p>
<p>Menlo partner and new Airbase board member Matt Murphy told TechCrunch in a separate interview that his firm had had its eye on the company for some time before its deal, allowing it to move quickly when Kote opened the door to more funding. (Murphy was candid in sharing that he had spent quite some time getting in front of Airbase, which we pass along as evidence of just how competitive the venture capital market can be in 2021.)</p>

<p>According to Kote, his firm&#8217;s new capital was raised on a $600 million valuation, post-money, which means that the Menlo-led transaction involved 10% of the company&#8217;s shares.</p>
<h2>A segmenting market</h2>
<p>TechCrunch&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/as-corporate-cards-are-subsumed-into-software-airbase-posts-rapid-growth/">coverage of the corporate spend market</a> has largely focused on the revenue growth of the competing players, and their decision to either charge for the software that they offer along with corporate cards or not. But Kote views the market as segmenting in a somewhat different manner, namely along target customer scale. Divvy, for example, went after SMBs, while Airbase has more of a mid-market focus.</p>
<p>The customer targeting matters, with Kote telling TechCrunch that mid-market companies are looking for a single solution to replace various point-services that they have traditionally paid for. In the case of corporate spend, that could mean that many companies are willing to pay for new software so long as it can replace several services that they were buying discretely before; say, corporate cards and expense management software.</p>

<p>Kote said that the Divvy-Bill.com news was a &#8220;massive validation&#8221; of his company&#8217;s thesis that software would prove key in the market formerly focused on corporate cards, and that offering cards was itself a &#8220;race to the bottom.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the view of Airbase&#8217;s CEO, his company has a six to eight quarter lead on its competitors in product terms. The market will vet that perspective, but the company&#8217;s confidence in its vision and new capital should provide it with ample opportunity to prove out its thesis in the coming quarters, and see whether where it views its product in terms of market positioning viz. demand and competitors is correct.</p>
<h2>The investor perspective</h2>
<p>Menlo Ventures seems to think so, to the tune of its largest single check to date from a non-growth fund. What did Murphy et al. find so compelling about the company? In the investor&#8217;s view, Airbase has a shot at replacing point-solutions in mid-market companies, precisely as Kote imagines:</p>
<blockquote><p>Airbase consolidates all the different spend apps which greatly decreases complexity in workflows as finance teams previously had to jump from app to app and don’t have a real time, holistic view in one place. [&#8230;] Of course there is an advantage in not having to pay for multiple apps, but the biggest benefits are simplicity of workflows which is where we heard most of the product love.</p></blockquote>
<p>Murphy continued, adding that at many companies &#8220;a manager won’t know until after [a quarter ends] whether the team for example spent above or below budget,&#8221; which makes integrated solutions more attractive.</p>
<p>Why does the viewpoint matter? It implies that the market that Airbase can sell into is rather large; instead of considering the aggregate non-payroll spend that its possible customer companies may generate and then applying an interchange vig to the total to calculate its potential scale, we might tabulate mid-market software spend on expenses, accounting and other categories as the startup&#8217;s true TAM. And as Airbase can still generate top-line from interchange and other sources, it could be well-situated for long-term growth.</p>
<p>Of course, its competitors are not interested in letting Airbase have all the fun. Ramp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/spend-management-startup-ramp-confirms-115m-raise-1-6b-valuation/">recently raised lots of capital</a>, and is investing in its own software stack. With a free price point, it&#8217;s perhaps the most aggressive player on the interchange-first side of its market. And Brex is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/22/2156073/">working to make lots of public noise</a>, again, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/brex-raises-425m-at-a-7-4b-valuation-as-the-corporate-spend-war-rages-on/">has its own tower of cash</a>, software focus and recently launched paid-SaaS service.</p>

<p>Now Airbase has more cash than it has ever had in its accounts, and has been busy hiring. The company has picked up a CFO, a general counsel and a VP of sales, from Mattermost, Robinhood and Dropbox, respectively.</p>
<p>Which all sounds very much like the long-term prep work for an eventual IPO. Set your timers for 2024.</p>
