										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram has <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1461034689632686082?s=20">introduced</a> a new &#8220;Rage Shake&#8221; feature that lets users shake their phones to report a problem with the app. Instagram head Adam Mosseri announced the launch of the new feature in a video on Twitter and explained how it works.</p>
<p>&#8220;You ever use Instagram and it wasn&#8217;t working like it was supposed to? Maybe Stories didn&#8217;t load, maybe the audio wasn&#8217;t working, maybe you just couldn&#8217;t upload a photo and it was just really getting you, really just pissing you off? Now, you can literally shake the phone and a little option will come up that allows you to report a problem,&#8221; Mosseri said in the video.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Once you shake to report, you can explain what happened with the app and report the issue. Mosseri says this will help the company prioritize bugs and learn about other things to fix in the app. For now, the feature is only available in the U.S. for both iOS and Android users.</p>
<p>The social media giant is also rolling out the ability to delete single items from a carousel post with at least three images or videos. For context, carousel feed posts can combine up to 10 photos and videos in one post. With this latest update, you can delete items from an existing carousel. It&#8217;s worth noting that you can&#8217;t add to the carousel, replace one item for another, or reorder items in the carousel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2236536" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236536" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2236536" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/instagram-delete-post.jpeg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/instagram-delete-post.jpeg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/instagram-delete-post.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/instagram-delete-post.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/instagram-delete-post.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/instagram-delete-post.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/instagram-delete-post.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236536" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>Mosseri says this new option should have been rolled out a while ago and that it was a highly requested feature. The social media giant notes that sometimes users have made a mistake, no longer want a certain photo on their grid but still want to keep the overall carousel, or they just want to change things up with a certain post.</p>
<p>To remove an image or a video from a carousel, you have to tap on the three dots in the right-hand corner of a post and then select &#8220;edit.&#8221; Then, you can swipe to the photo or image you want to get rid of and click the &#8220;delete&#8221; icon in the top left corner. The new feature is currently only available on iOS, with support for Android coming soon.</p>
<p>These two new launches come as Instagram has been introducing several new features over the past few weeks. Last week, it began testing a new feature called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/instagram-tests-take-a-break-reminders-on-an-opt-in-basis/">‚ÄúTake a Break,‚Äù</a> which allows users to remind themselves to take a break from Instagram after either 10, 20 or 30 minutes. The social media giant also recently rolled out a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/instagram-rolls-out-an-add-yours-sticker-in-stories-to-create-threads-users-can-respond-to/">‚ÄúAdd Yours‚Äù sticker</a> that creates public threads in Stories. The new feature allows users to respond to other users‚Äô Stories with their own following a prompt or a certain topic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Before we get started, two quick notes. <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">We‚Äôre launching Actuator as a newsletter in a few short weeks! Make sure you‚Äôre in on the ground floor </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">by signing up (for free!) over here.</a> Also, t<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">he powers that be helpfully noted that I‚Äôve not taken any days off this year, so I‚Äôll be doing that next week.

<p>Last week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/cmus-new-robotics-institute-director-on-the-future-of-robot-research/">Carnegie Mellon announced that it had appointed Matthew Johnson-Roberson</a> the sixth director of its Robotics Institute. We‚Äôve spoken to Johnson-Roberson a number of times in the last few years, primarily in his capacity as Refraction AI‚Äôs co-founder and CTO. When I sat down with him again last week to discuss his new role, he called me from the University of Michigan‚Äôs Ford-funded robotics wing, where he served as co-director.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a smart hire for a number of reasons &#8212; not the least of which is the CMU grad‚Äôs experience in both founding a startup and working as part of a corporate-university alliance. We‚Äôve devoted a lot of words to Pittsburgh and CMU on this site over the past few years, and the consensus is that the former has been doing a better job incubating startups, but things could always improve.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235842" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2164730" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2164730" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2164730" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg" alt="Matthew Johnson-roberson" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg 3200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Johnson-roberson.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2164730" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Bryce Durbin</p></div></p>
<p>Pittsburgh is quite possibly the strongest example of how a vibrant startup scene can revitalize a region suffering from economic depression. There are, of course, broader economic issues around potentially leaving residents behind through gentrification, but on the whole, Pittsburgh has largely been regarded as a success story, bouncing back from the rust belt region‚Äôs economic devastation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clearly something U of M is focused on for the Ann Arbor/Detroit regions. And Ford‚Äôs model will likely prove an increasingly popular one, as corporations look to research facilities for bleeding-edge technologies, while universities look for funding beyond the traditional endowment model (something which, granted, has worked for a university named for two of America‚Äôs most powerful industrialists).</p>
<p>As Johnson-Roberson tells TechCrunch:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>So many of the technologies that were developed in the 90s and 00s are now reaching a level of maturity where they are getting rolled out in commercial products and making a big difference to the future of a lot of industries. I think it‚Äôs a natural extension of that. You begin to see relationships between universities and companies. Even if you look at Pittsburgh as a city, the transformation that it‚Äôs undergone from heavy industry focused around natural resources and steel, that transformation is only going to accelerate.</p>
<p>Part of my goal is to continue relations and build new ones. Beyond just industries, thinking about government and policy and all the other things that are now going to become more relevant for robotics ‚Äî making sure we make those relationships and build on the strengths of the technical work that already goes on at the institute. That is something I‚Äôm particularly excited about.</p></blockquote>

<p>Part of me is hoping the robotics news slows down a bit next week, if only for my nagging FONB (fear of not blogging) while I‚Äôm out. It‚Äôs not healthy, I know. But there are worse addictions (maybe?). I get the sense things will slow down a bit for American Thanksgiving week, if only because it seems like everyone is rushing to get their news out this week. There‚Äôs a LOT to crawl through here.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs start with a pair of acquisitions. As we noted in this column last week, iRobot has been getting aggressive about smart home. That‚Äôs largely meant things like Amazon Alexa integration up to now, but today‚Äôs news marks an interesting new angle. The Roomba maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/irobot-is-buying-air-purifier-maker-aeris/">purchased a Swiss company that makes air purifiers</a> &#8212; a move it believes can improve its footprint in users&#8217; homes.</p>
<p>CEO Colin Angle says in a release:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today‚Äôs acquisition of Aeris is an important step in iRobot‚Äôs strategy to expand our total addressable market and diversify our product portfolio in ways that will provide consumers with new ways to keep their homes cleaner and healthier. We are enthusiastic about the growth potential for Aeris‚Äô products, especially as the pandemic has raised greater consumer awareness of the value of maintaining a cleaner, healthier home. We are also excited about the potential to leverage our Genius Home Intelligence platform and existing ecosystem of home robots to bring the iRobot experience to air purification.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/home-star-trucker/">As we noted last week</a>, most of iRobot‚Äôs biggest non-Roomba successes have come in the form of acquisitions of brands like Braava and Root. So hopefully this will open up some interesting avenues, in terms of having devices that can double as smart home beacons and improve home mapping.</p>

<p>In the agtech space, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/fieldin-buys-fellow-agtech-firm-midnight-robotics/">Fieldin has acquired Midnight Robotics</a>. It‚Äôs a deal that makes a lot of sense. Fieldin makes technology that allows farms to collect data for accelerating automation, while Midnight‚Äôs tech retrofits tractors and other farming machinery with lidar-based sensors.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs Fieldin CEO Boaz Bachar:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the past eight years we‚Äôve digitized hundreds of farms and over 10,000 tractors and pieces of farming equipment ‚Äî more than anyone else in the high-value crop world ‚Äî and amassed a trove of invaluable data that can offer insights into best practices in farm management. By acquiring Midnight Robotics, we‚Äôre helping farmers close the loop from insight to autonomous action, so they know exactly what they need to do and execute it autonomously, all through the same platform.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/autonomous-tractor-maker-monarch-raises-61-million/">Monarch‚Äôs tractor</a>, meanwhile, is more of an all-in-one solution. The company just announced a $61 million Series B. Like Fieldin, the company cites pandemic-related job shortages as a driving force in interest around its technology.</p>

<p>From fields to the dinner table, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/nommi-announces-plans-for-rollout-of-its-food-bowl-making-kitchen-robot/">Nommi just announced a distribution deal</a> with C3 (Creating Culinary Communities) that is set to bring up to 1,000 of its robotic food prep kiosks to locations across the country. The deal also brings Iron Chef‚Äôs Masaharu Morimoto‚Äôs Sa‚ÄôMoto brand to the machines, which can operate 24/7, unlike even the ironest of human chefs.</p>

<p>As hot as robotics are becoming in food, however, there‚Äôs probably an even brighter future in sustainable packaging &#8212; because, let‚Äôs face it, whatever direction we‚Äôre currently headed in isn‚Äôt great. In one of the wilder pivots in recent memory, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/zume-kills-plastics/">Zume moved from pizza robots to bio-degradable packaging.</a> The company is, however, returning to robotics (in a sense) courtesy of a new deal with industrial giant ABB to produce its food packaging.</p>
<p>And one final Tiger Global investment before I leave you (it wouldn‚Äôt be a robotics roundup without it). The firm<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/11/17/2336690/0/en/SVT-Robotics-Announces-25-Million-in-Series-A-Funding-Round-Led-by-Tiger-Global.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> just led a $25 million Series A</a> for SVT Robotics. The Virginia-based company is working to develop a ‚Äúplug-and-play‚Äù solution for industrial robotic deployment. Here‚Äôs co-founder and CEO A.K. Schultz:</p>
<blockquote><p>The demand for industrial automation is even higher, but industry growth has been limited by capacity to execute. Integrations are typically all custom coded, meaning long development cycles. It‚Äôs expensive, and companies wait as much as a year or more for new automation to go live. Solving that problem with the SOFTBOT Platform empowers the market to grow at its full potential.</p></blockquote>
<p>That‚Äôs it for me this week. Happy Turkey Day to those who celebrate. And don&#8217;t forget to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">sign up for Actuator here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you had &#8220;my shower head needs a small turbine, a Bluetooth connection, an app and a fine-spray mist&#8221; on your 2021 bingo card, congratulations, you win the prize. The prize is knowing that <a href="https://gethai.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hai</a> exists &#8212; and this fine news story, which will tell you all about how the company raised $6 million to get all up in your biz. And we&#8217;ll probably have some good, clean fun &#8212; i.e. shower puns &#8212; thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p><em>A propos</em> good measure, that, in a nutshell, is kind of the point of Hai. The founders claim that your daily de-grimification routine is one of the biggest users of water in a residential context. A lot of people care about the environment, but how do you know how much water you actually blast through on your way to a haven of godliness-adjacency? The answer is some really expensive electronics, or this (possibly equally expensive) $250 shower head. Hai is designed to be easy to install and remove using just your hands. Aimed in particular at apartment-dwellers who want &#8220;a spa-like shower experience&#8221; that they can take with them as they nomad their way from apartment to apartment, the Hai shower head is somewhat of a platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;During my 20s I moved to a new apartment every year. One of the things that I looked at every time I moved was the shower. I&#8217;m quite tall, and it was very important for me to have a shower that was tall enough &#8212; and the pressure was obviously important,&#8221; Leah Stigile, co-founder and CEO of Hai reminisced. &#8220;I&#8217;m a mom to two small children, and the time that I get in the shower every day is crucially important to my personal well-being. As I talked to other people, I realized the ritual of showering is super important to other people as well, but for a whole variety of different reasons. I was inspired to be a part of building a company that delivered an amazing experience but also helps you be mindful of the resources that you&#8217;re using.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236180" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It appears that a gaggle of investors agree with the Hai team that this is a space worth exploring in more depth. <a href="https://trousdalevc.com/">Trousdale Ventures</a> led the $6 million round, and is joined by¬†Will Smith‚Äôs <a href="https://www.dreamers.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dreamers VC</a>, <a href="https://www.arodcorp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A-Rod Corp</a>, The <a href="https://najafi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Najafi Companies</a> (owners of the Phoenix Suns and McLaren F1), Amity Supply (Jesse Derris), social media stars Josh Richards and Griffin Johnson, Noah Beck‚Äôs Animal Capital (Marshall Sandman), former board member and early investor in Peloton, Howard Draft and Local Globe.</p>
<p>&#8220;We invested in Hai because they have created an innovative, high-quality showerhead that meets consumer demand for sustainable home products,&#8221; said Phillip Sarofim, founder of Trousdale Ventures. &#8220;We believe that Hai delivers the best shower experience as consumers continue to shift toward personalized and environmentally conscious products.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are looking at a $9 billion market. In my calculation when you look at the size of the space, there&#8217;s room for five or six big new entrants in this market. The interesting thing is that the $9 billion has been carved out by the same five companies for the last 75 years. What is interesting is that brand was almost irrelevant in the space,&#8221; explains Leonard Brody, co-founder of Hai. &#8220;More than <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">85% of millennials said the shower was the most important self-care ritual in their home, but the vast majority of them couldn&#8217;t tell you the brand of shower head they stood under every day. That is highly unusual in a consumer space. I bet you 60% of the same people could tell you what toilet paper brand they use.&#8221;</span></p>

Best of all: No leaks and no tools required. Photo by Haje Kamps for TechCrunch</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So, with a huge market and no clear winner, we&#8217;ve seen a number of new companies enter the fray. It seems like the newest dribble of companies started with <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nebia/nebia-shower-better-experience-70-less-water" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kickstarter darling Nebia pre-selling $3 million of fine-misting shower heads</a> back in 2015, before <a href="https://www.moen.com/press-room/press-releases/nebia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raising investment from</a>, and later getting swallowed up by, bathroom giant Moen.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the largest wastes of water in the shower is actually when you flip on the water and you wander away and are busy while you&#8217;re waiting for it to warm. The shower is running and before you know it you&#8217;ve done three loads of laundry. We&#8217;ve developed a little hydropower Bluetooth turbine and it does a couple of things. First of all, it powers the LED light on the shower that will notify you when the water is warm and ready to get in. Also, if you&#8217;ve wandered away, it&#8217;ll send you a push notification to your phone,&#8221; explains Brody. &#8220;Secondly, with a partner app that we developed, it will you can set the number of gallons of water that you want to use during your shower. The average shower is about 20 gallons of water. You can configure that, of course, but our product default is set to 20 gallons. When you hit that limit, a little light will notify you, reminding you to wrap up and hop out of the shower.&#8221;</p>
<p>The device tracks your water consumption over time, which takes care of one of the first challenges of awareness; namely, awareness. The company suggests that by measuring your baseline and then setting goals for yourself, you can do your bit for the environment and use a bit less water. The company also wants to use the data it gathers to make the shower experience more custom.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next step on the roadmap for us that&#8217;s coming in early 2022, we are taking our product and adding a layer of consumables. First up, we have what we&#8217;re calling infusions. We&#8217;ve developed a single-use no-waste pill that can be added to a capsule that fits onto the existing showerhead,&#8221; explains Stigile. &#8220;You can infuse aromatherapy or hair and skin treatments directly into the water. That really helps deliver that spa experience that we are trying to create in your home bathroom. And then the next step beyond that is filtration. With the sensors we have, we can actually be quite sophisticated about telling you what&#8217;s in your water delivering, a very personalized experience. We can even take the temperature you like to shower at into consideration and recommend the consumables that are best for your particular use case. That&#8217;s a huge opportunity there for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company only started shipping its products a few weeks ago, but so far they&#8217;re off to a <em>lather</em> good start, with promising sales through its direct channels and retail presence <a href="https://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/hai-4-spray-bluetooth-enabled-handheld-showerhead/5655910" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the Bed Bath &amp; Beyond website</a> and its New York flagship store.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">California Pizza Kitchen has revealed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/data-breach/">data breach</a> that exposed the Social Security numbers of over a hundred thousand current and former employees.</p>
<p>The U.S. pizza chain, which has more than 250 locations across 32 states, confirmed the incident in a data breach notification posted this week. The company said it learned of a ‚Äúdisruption‚Äù to its systems on September 15 and moved to ‚Äúimmediately secure‚Äù its environment. By October 4, the company said it had determined cybercriminals had infiltrated its systems and gained obtained access to certain files, including employee names and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/social-security/">SSNs</a>.</p>
<p>While CPK didn&#8217;t confirm how many people are impacted by the breach, <a href="https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/ea812f00-c605-4b8e-a6e2-9dd53169b256.shtml">a notification from the Maine attorney general&#8217;s office</a> reported a total of 103,767 current and former employees ‚Äî including eight Maine residents ‚Äî are affected. CPK employed around 14,000 people as of 2017, suggesting the bulk of those affected are former employees. (TechCrunch contacted CPK for more but did not immediately hear back.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236522" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>‚ÄúInformation security is among our highest priorities, and we have strict security measures in place to protect information in our care,‚Äù CPK added. ‚ÄúUpon discovering this incident, we immediately took steps to review and reinforce the security of our computing environment. We are reviewing existing security policies and have implemented additional measures to further protect against similar incidents moving forward.‚Äù</p>
<p>However, while CPK is shoring up its security in light of the incident, it&#8217;s unclear why it took the company two months to notify state authorities of the intrusion. The company said its data breach notification ‚Äúhas not been delayed by law enforcement.‚Äù</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As machine learning becomes a more integral part of running businesses, the model-building process still requires iteration and experimentation. <a href="http://comet.ml">Comet</a> has created an entire platform to get models from idea to product, and today the company announced a $50 million Series B.</p>
<p>The investment comes on the heels of the company&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/comet-announces-13m-series-a-for-ml-model-building-tool/">$13 million A round</a> in April.</p>
<p>OpenView led the round with participation from existing investors Scale Venture Partners, Trilogy Equity Partners and Two Sigma Ventures. The company has now raised almost $70 million, according to Crunchbase data.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236494" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Gideon Mendels said that the product works on any platform from a laptop to the cloud to an on-prem cluster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Comet is a platform that empowers data scientists and machine learning engineers to accelerate machine learning development, and the way we do that is by managing and optimizing the entire machine learning lifecycle, so all the way from experiment tracking to model production monitoring,&#8221; Mendels told me.</p>
<p>He said that the approach has been working: The company&#8217;s annual recurring revenue (ARR) grew 5x this year, and Comet now counts 150 businesses using the platform, including Uber, Zappos and Etsy.</p>
<p>Mackey Craven, partner at lead investor OpenView, said that he was attracted to Comet because he sees it as a startup building a viable product for an emerging market with a big opportunity.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we see that rare combination of an exceptional founding team that can be the core of a large and enduring market opportunity that is large enough to support them and then transition in that market, either because it&#8217;s the creation of a new market or [because of] technological dislocation that allows a new entrant to create and capture the value in that market going forward, we step up and we step up big,&#8221; Craven explained.</p>
<p>Today, the company has 50 employees in nine different countries on four continents with plans to reach 100 by next year. Mendels said that diversity and inclusion are a key part of the company&#8217;s value system.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just really a key part of our culture,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have 35% of the team from underrepresented groups today and that continues to be a focus for future hires.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company is also launching a new product called Artifacts, a data versioning tool that works in the same way as a document versioning function, letting data scientists track the ways that the data has changed over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Comet Artifacts, essentially when you&#8217;re working on a machine learning pipeline, we automatically version every snapshot of the data. So every time you make a change, we make a version of it,&#8221; Mendels said, adding that this offers a number of advantages, primarily enabling data scientists to see how the data they used to train the model changes over time and compare the training model data to what&#8217;s in the model in production.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The battle between the appetites of European Union Member States&#8217; governments to retain their citizens&#8217; data &#8212; for fuzzy, catch-all &#8216;security&#8217; purposes &#8212; and the region&#8217;s top court, the CJEU, which continues to defend fundamental rights by reiterating that <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">indiscriminate mass surveillance is incompatible with general principles of EU law (such as proportionality and respect for privacy) &#8212; has led to another pointed legal critique of national law on bulk data retention.</span></p>
<p>This time it&#8217;s a German data retention law that&#8217;s earned the slap-down &#8212; via a CJEU referral which joins a couple of cases, involving ISPs SpaceNet and Telekom Deutschland which are <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">challenging the obligation to store their customers‚Äô telecommunications traffic data.</span></p>
<p>The court&#8217;s judgement is still pending but an influential opinion put out today by an advisor to the CJEU takes the view that general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data can only be permitted exceptionally &#8212; in relation to a threat to national security &#8212; and nor can data be retained permanently.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236466" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="page" title="Page 1">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>In a press release announcing the opinion of advocate general Manuel Campos SaÃÅnchez-Bordona, the court writes that the AG &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">considers that the answers to all the questions referred are already in the Court‚Äôs case-law or can be inferred from them without difficulty&#8221;; going on to set out his view that the German law&#8217;s &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">general and indiscriminate storage obligation&#8221; &#8212; which covers &#8220;a very wide range of traffic and location data&#8221; &#8212; cannot be reconciled with EU law by a time limit imposed on storage as data is being sucked up in bulk, not in a targeted fashion (i.e. for a specific national security purpose). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The AG notes that indiscriminate bulk collection generates a</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> &#8220;serious risk&#8221; &#8212; such as the people&#8217;s data might leak or be improperly accessed. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">And reiterates that it</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> also entails a &#8220;serious interference&#8221; with citizens&#8217; fundamental rights to private and family life and the protection of personal data.</span></p>
<p>While the opinion is not legally binding, CJEU rulings tend to align with its advisors. But it will be months more before a final ruling on this particular challenge is issued.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The CJEU ruled on a similar case <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/06/europes-top-court-confirms-no-mass-surveillance-without-legal-limits/">over a year ago</a> &#8212; involving legal challenges brought by a couple of digital rights groups to national bulk data collection and retention regimes operating under UK and French law &#8212; when the court ruled that only limited data collection and temporary retention was permissible.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>(Although France has since been seeking to circumvent the judgement, per <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/france-data-retention-bypass-eu-top-court/">Politico</a> &#8212; which reported back in March that the government had asked its highest administrative court not to follow the ruling.)</p>
<p>In a landmark ruling back in 2014 the CJEU struck down a 2006 EU directive that had been intended to harmonize data retention rules across the bloc &#8212; finding the regime had constituted a disproportionate interference with citizens&#8217; rights.¬†So you&#8217;d think Member States would have got the message by now.</p>
<p>However it seems unlikely this legal clash will be put to bed any time soon &#8212; not least because there are fresh moves afoot by national governments to revive a pan-EU data retention law, per a <a href="https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2021/07/wk07294.en211.pdf">leaked discussion paper</a> that <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2021/urgently-needed-france-spain-push-for-new-eu-data-retention-law/">Netzpolitik</a> obtained and reported on this summer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This summer, Netflix <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/introducing-netflix-shop">launched</a> its own shopping <a href="https://www.netflix.shop/">site</a> that allowed fans to purchase apparel, accessories and other lifestyle products from their favorite shows, like &#8220;Stranger Things.&#8221; Now, Hulu is doing the same thing. The Disney-owned streamer announced the launch of <a href="https://shop.hulu.com/">Shop Hulu</a>, which will feature limited-edition collections of apparel and lifestyle products from Hulu Originals and other titles in the company&#8217;s on-demand library, as well as Hulu-branded swag. The site will also make Hulu&#8217;s annual release of its &#8220;Ugly Holiday Sweaters&#8221; available for purchase for the first time.</p>
<p>Hulu began <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveIslandTV/comments/e5loxg/hulu_is_giving_away_free_christmas_sweaters_in/">giving away</a> its ugly sweaters to random fans as a promotional perk in 2019. The giveaway was popular enough that Hulu turned it into a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CIYjW_xh6xL/">sweepstakes</a> event last year, giving everyone a chance to win one of the sweaters, which had then <a href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/hulu-has-live-sports-and-ugly-holiday-sweaters">featured</a> Hulu shows like &#8220;Little Fires Everywhere,&#8221; &#8220;Shrill,&#8221; &#8220;The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale,&#8221; and others.</p>
<p>Its 2021 selection of holiday sweaters will be available for purchase starting on Tuesday, November 30.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236469" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This year, the lineup includes &#8220;Love, Victor,&#8221; &#8220;Solar Opposites,&#8221; &#8220;The Great,&#8221; &#8220;The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale,&#8221; and &#8220;Wu-Tang: An American Saga,&#8221; many of which had proved popular in previous years. However, unlike Netflix &#8212; which invested in its online store as a new arm of its broader retail business &#8212; Hulu&#8217;s leading product line is designed to raise funds for charity. Through December 31, 100% of the purchase price from the sale of the Ugly Holiday Sweater collection, minus taxes and shipping fees, is being donated to Feeding America, says Hulu.</p>
<p>In the fine print, the company notes it&#8217;s capping its donation at 1,000 sweaters, which is $54,950.</p>

<p>Hulu&#8217;s shop will continue to feature other products throughout the year, outside its charitable fundraising initiative for the holidays.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fans of &#8220;Solar Opposites&#8221; will be able to shop apparel, glassware, stickers, and more as the show&#8217;s holiday special premieres on November 22. The collection was designed in collaboration with Executive Producers Mike McMahan, Justin Roiland, and Josh Bycel, the company says.</p>
<p>Also available are household items and apparel from shows like &#8220;The Orville,&#8221; &#8220;Wu-Tang: An American Saga&#8221; (select items from the capsule collection from Mitchell &amp; Ness are available), and themed merchandise from acquired shows like &#8220;Grey&#8217;s Anatomy,&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,&#8221; &#8220;American Horror Story,&#8221; and &#8220;What We Do In The Shadows,&#8221; among others.</p>
<p>Hulu will offer shoppers a discount for signing up for its newsletter and plans to make special offers available throughout the year, starting with Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Of the top 10 countries for healthtech VC investment (between 2016-2021YTD), the US leads globally with $31.9bn in VC investment so far this year, according to new research. In second place was China on $4.1bn, while the UK comes in third with $3.8bn. UK healthtech investment has risen from just $420m in 2016, an increase of nine times, whilst US investment has increased by 3.4 times.¬†<br />
¬†<br />
US-based healthtech companies continue to attract the lion‚Äôs share of global VC investment, clustered around the Bay Area, New York and Boston. Over the last two years investment has started to become more globally distributed, with investment less concentrated around the US and China, said the research findings released by Dealroom.co for London &amp; Partners.</p>
<p>UK healthtech growth has traditionally been driven by the so-called ‚ÄúGolden Triangle‚Äù of London, Oxford and Cambridge, a region home to five universities in the top 25 for life sciences and medicine.</p>
<p>Europe is now the fastest-growing region globally for healthtech according to the findings, with¬†European healthtech startups raising $8.1B in 2021, up from $1.7B in 2016 and growing at a rate of 4.9 times (compared to North America at 3.5x and Asia 3.7x).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236504" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Austin, Texas, is becoming the new home for large companies (Tesla), investors and startups alike.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is now also the new home for Tim Draper‚Äôs newest initiative to help support early-stage founders: Draper Startup House Accelerator Program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backed by Draper, of course, the program will launch in April 2022. As founder of the famed Silicon Valley venture capital firm known as Draper Fisher Jurvetson, or DFJ, Draper in 2018 introduced the Startup House </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">concept. Today, there are more than 15 locations globally that are either hostels and/or co-working spaces aimed at traveling startup founders, digital nomads and other remote workers. Locations include Bali, Indonesia; Bangalore, India; and Valencia, Spain, among others. Besides Austin, the only other site in the U.S. is located in San Mateo, California, but that is a co-living space inside of Draper University.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236247" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This latest effort marks Draper Startup House‚Äôs only accelerator program, according to Daniel Wiegand, co-founder and president of DSH Accelerator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DSH will hold two cohorts in 2022 &#8212; both in Austin, consisting of 10 startup teams from around the world. The first cohort will take place in April and the second in August. As part of the program, DSH will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">invest up to $100,000 in pre-seed startups.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each cohort will last three months, take place two times per year and be located in Austin in 2022 and across the globe in 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThis will not be your typical accelerator, but in addition to standard practices such as investment from the newly raised Draper Startup House Accelerator Fund, mentors, workshops and a demo day, DSH plans to incorporate a strong leadership building component as well as unique activities that will test the founders‚Äô grit, creativity and push them outside of their comfort zone,‚Äù Wiegand said.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will be a mix of Draper University and a typical accelerator, he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program will feature ‚Äúunconventional twists to the standard accelerator model,‚Äù Wiegand told TechCrunch, and will be focused on early-stage deals across all industries. While the accelerator will accept applications from startups all over the world, the hope is that many of the startups will decide to continue their growth from Austin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startups will be required to live together for the entirety of the program, dedicating the three months entirely to building their business. Interested entrepreneurs, founders or startups that want to learn more or apply to be in either cohort can fill out the application </span><a href="http://dshaccelerator.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWe look for really great founders who are building big companies and have huge ideas,‚Äù Wiegand told TechCrunch. ‚ÄúIt&#8217;s really all about the founder, which is why through the program, we will do a lot of leadership training to see if they are founders that are poised to take their company to where they want to take it.‚Äù</span></p>
<div class="gmail_default">DSH has also decided to add a co-living option for entrepreneurs who want to live in the house amongst the portfolio companies and participate in the programming, which is a paid program. They can get a single room for $2,500 a month or a shared bunk room for $900/month.</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initially, Draper‚Äôs intent was to launch its first U.S. location in Austin at SXSW as a hostel for entrepreneurs. The vision was to create a landing pad for entrepreneurs and startups traveling to Austin to get familiar with the local startup scene as well as the greater Draper network.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then the COVID-19 pandemic led to SXSW being canceled and the city essentially shutting down.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recognizing that the pandemic would present extreme challenges, founders Katie Russel and Wiegand quickly pivoted to turn what was to be a hostel into a flexible coworking space for startups and entrepreneurs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past 18 months or so, Draper Startup House helped facilitate funding rounds for multiple Austin startups such as CoachTube, Mentor Method and Tabella.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWe saw the talent in Austin, as well as inquiries from startups across the globe looking to enter the U.S. and talent-rich Austin ecosystem,‚Äù Wiegand said. ‚ÄúWe wanted a way to really hone in and double down on the startups we saw great potential in. As Katie and I grappled with how to do this, it became clearer and clearer that a pop-up accelerator was the right path forward.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The model is designed to eventually allow DSH to reach even more startups all over the world. While the accelerator will continue to have at least one cohort located in Austin, DSH Accelerator plans on moving the second cohort to a new destination each year. Future plans consist of programs emerging in multiple cities simultaneously.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wiegand and Russel intentionally advocated to locate the accelerator somewhere other than in Silicon Valley.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWe‚Äô</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ve been working for four or five years in Silicon Valley. We&#8217;ve seen all the great opportunities and tools and resources that are here, but it&#8217;s just not accessible to everyone,‚Äù Wiegand explained. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very expensive in Silicon Valley, especially for a startup that is bootstrapping. So what we pitched to him [Draper] was ‚Äòhey, let us take this ecosystem and this brand that you&#8217;ve built over the last 20-30 years, and let us bundle up everything you have in San Mateo and spread it across the globe.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For his part,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Draper said in a statement: ‚Äú</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are very excited about how the Draper Startup Houses around the world</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">are becoming beacons for entrepreneurs everywhere. The DSH Accelerator, based in Austin,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">will take advantage of the amazing startup environment in Austin and bring more activity to the</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Draper Ecosystem.‚Äù</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">DSH will be conducting a month-long pilot in January.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Fora is one of the latest startups seeing venture capital attraction to push more of the travel industry into the digital age and tapping into the creator economy.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Travel is back, at least according to experts who say <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/14/1054878036/thanksgiving-travel-airlines-what-to-expect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">travel bookings for over the Thanksgiving holiday</a> are showing to be even higher than pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>Anyone who loves travel or is that friend who always plans the best vacations, <a href="https://www.foratravel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fora</a> has a tool for you. The company was co-founded by onefinestay‚Äôs Evan Frank, Virtuoso agency owner Henley Vazquez and entrepreneur Jake Peters, to redefine what we think of the travel agency and enable people who want to sell travel as a career, or in their spare time, a way to do it.</p>
<p>Frank and Vazquez had known each other for five years when the idea for Fora came up.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236066" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>‚ÄúWe always talked about doing something together, but this past March, we connected again,‚Äù Vazquez said. ‚ÄúI was in Costa Rica and talking about opportunities for women sitting on sidelines due to the pandemic and looking for interesting work. Content creators are circulating around the travel world, and we saw a big opportunity for technology to modernize the industry.‚Äù</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bplans.com/travel-agency-upscale-business-plan/market-analysis-summary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Travel agencies are a $100 billion market in the U.S.</a>, but it is still largely one that works with fax machines and phone calls. Fora is one of the latest startups seeing venture capital attraction to push more of the travel industry into the digital age and <a href="https://skift.com/2021/06/28/travels-creator-economy-is-poised-for-next-boom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tapping into the creator economy</a>. Another is Thatch, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/thatch-using-3m-round-to-put-travel-creators-on-the-map/">took in $3 million</a> in August to enable travel creators to monetize their recommendations.</p>
<p>However, Fora has a unique approach compared to some of its competitors: It is actually teaching people to sell travel through training sessions, content authoring tools and negotiated rates at the world‚Äôs top hotels.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA lot of companies sell content or expertise, but we saw a bigger opportunity to empower more people to sell travel,‚Äù Frank said. ‚ÄúThe booking of travel without a system or knowledge is janky and hard. We are focused on tooling to help our advisors be successful themselves.‚Äù</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since its soft launch in August, Fora has already booked $2 million in travel, and today, the company announced $5 million in a seed round. It was led by Forerunner Ventures with participation from Heartcore Capital, Uncommon Capital and individual investors, including Katrina Lake, Gokul Rajaram, Ran Makavy and Ben Rubin.</p>
<p>The company decided to go after venture capital to help build out its technology more quickly. Fora plans to use the new investment to onboard new advisors, product development and go-to-market. Its advisor waitlist has grown to more than 2,000 people, and the company will also spend the time onboarding and training them over the next few months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Brian O‚ÄôMalley, general partner at Forerunner Ventures, said that his firm was looking at the creator space and found that what will make Fora successful is having the advisor with a circle of friends and a passion for travel.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn our eyes, that fits the entrepreneur next store versus the person on Instagram getting free stuff,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThe cost of customer acquisition is skyrocketing, and Fora is coming in as a ‚ÄòTrojan horse‚Äô by getting networks that already existed. It‚Äôs also a next-generation platform that is getting people back into the workforce.‚Äù</p>

The new location ‚Äî at 59th Street between Park &amp; Lexington Avenues ‚Äî will combine the Starbucks app&#8217;s order ahead feature with Amazon&#8217;s Just Walk Out technology. In fact, the store sounds a like a cross between the cafe and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-25-amazon-big-go-grocery-store-seattle-cashless.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">Amazon Go</a> store, which served as the launching pad for the e-commerce giant&#8217;s cashierless tech experience.</p>
<p>It has a lounge area customers can enter by using the &#8220;In-Store Code&#8221; in the Amazon Shopping app, by scanning their credit cards or by scanning their palm registered with Amazon One on the terminals onsite. Once they&#8217;re in, they&#8217;ll find a small Amazon Go market containing a curated selection of customer favorites from both companies. Anything they take from the shelf will be added to their virtual carts, and they will be charged after they leave like in any other location that uses Amazon&#8217;s Just Walk Out tech.</p>
<p>Over the past year-and-a-half, Amazon has expanded the availability of its cashierless technology. It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-11-amazon-just-walk-out-cashier-less-newark.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">teamed up</a> with airport stores to implement the check-out free experience and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fresh-just-walk-out-technology-washington-114044465.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1">opened</a> the first full-size Fresh grocery store with the technology in June. Amazon also added the technology to a few <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-just-walk-out-tech-comes-to-two-whole-foods-stores-101036042.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1">Whole Foods</a> locations and, more recently, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sainsburys-amazon-just-walk-out-shopping-store-151027993.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">licensed</a> it for use to UK supermarket chain Sainsbury&#8217;s. This partnership with Starbucks is yet another step towards making Just Walk Out more ubiquitous than before.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236475" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Starbucks and Amazon are planning to open three joint stores in the coming year, including this one. The second location is planned for The New York Times Building located at 40th Street &amp; 8th Avenue. For now, New Yorkers can head to the first location at 59th Street to check out the concept.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Getting a nearly 9x revenue multiple for running a food business is wildly good. That's what, 2015 software prices for salads? How can we call it anything but a win?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">U.S. fast-casual salad chain Sweetgreen <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211117006392/en/Sweetgreen-Announces-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering">priced</a> its IPO at $28 per share yesterday. Selling 13 million shares in its IPO, the company&#8217;s early gross proceeds from the transaction total $364 million, before taking shares reserved for its underwriting banks into account.</p>

<hr />
<p>For Sweetgreen, the pricing is a win. The company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/sweetgreens-ipo-pricing-guidance-illuminates-valuation-range-for-tech-enabled-companies/">¬†initially expected to price</a> between $23 and $25 per share, meaning that it sold shares at a higher price than it had anticipated. And Sweetgreen <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001477815/000119312521332761/d263540ds1mef.htm">sold 500,000 more shares</a> in its IPO than its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001477815/000119312521331589/d104360ds1a.htm">final S-1/A filing indicated</a>.</p>
<p>Given that investors made a larger, more expensive bet on Sweetgreen than we might have anticipated, there&#8217;s work to do.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-2220368" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-gry-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Let&#8217;s calculate the company&#8217;s IPO valuation, using both simple and fully diluted share counts. Then we&#8217;ll dig into Sweetgreen&#8217;s final IPO revenue multiple to understand how investors are truly valuing the company. From there, we&#8217;ll see if the company&#8217;s valuation squares up with what we&#8217;ve seen from <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/sweetgreens-ipo-pricing-guidance-illuminates-valuation-range-for-tech-enabled-companies/">other recent technology-enabled IPOs</a>.</p>
<p>Why are we paying attention to Sweetgreen? Because it started raising external capital in the mid-aughts and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/sweetgreen-series-i--77f42f82">kept at it through a Series I in 2019</a>. More simply, a host of private investors, including venture capitalists, bet on Sweetgreen. So, we care.</p>
<h2>Sweetgreen&#8217;s IPO valuation</h2>
<p>Before it added 500,000 shares to its IPO &#8212; 575,000 if we include 75,000 shares placed into its underwriters&#8217; option pool &#8212; Sweetgreen expected that it would have 106,311,529 shares outstanding after its IPO. That figure rises to 108,761,529 shares if we count the additional equity sold and the full total of shares reserved for underwriters.</p>
<p>At that new share count at $28 per share, Sweetgreen is worth $3.05 billion.</p>

More and more startups like <a href="https://fourthwall.com/">Fourthwall</a> are emerging to help creators consolidate their various income streams within one all-in-one creator platform, aiming to take away some of the backend administrative stress of running your own business. The goal is to give creators more time to focus on creating.</p>
<p>Fourthwall announced today that it raised $17 million from investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners, Initialized Capital, and Alexis Ohanian‚Äôs¬†<a href="https://sevensevensix.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://sevensevensix.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1637187227892000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ITwtgeqW5bLC-wJv_hh0F">Seven Seven Six</a>. Like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/08/patronage-empire/">Memberful</a>, a subsidiary of Patreon, Fourthwall offers a white-label website with built-in tools for setting up merch stores, membership programs, tipping and more. When fans buy something, there&#8217;s an integrated Cameo-like feature that lets creators send personalized video and audio messages as a thank you. Fourthwall partners with manufacturers to offer over 200 different types of products that creators can develop to sell through their website, which creators can control down to the code itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;We genuinely think Fourthwall is ready to really materially help creators succeed in this area, so they&#8217;re able to focus more thoroughly on the content and community side,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Will Baumann told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235751" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Still, creators are often skeptical of all-in-one solutions. Especially when the future of any given startup can look so uncertain, creators are encouraged to diversify their income streams. We saw this most recently with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/onlyfans-suspends-decision-to-ban-explicit-content/">almost-ban</a> of adult content on Only Fans &#8212; if the ban was enacted, creators would have had to start from zero, since they wouldn&#8217;t have had any way to contact their existing subscriber list (some platforms like Substack and Patreon give creators access at the get-go to their subscribers&#8217; emails). Even among safe-for-work creators, what happens if a microinfluencer gets locked out of their Instagram account? Even <a href="https://medium.com/@shessomickey/3-lessons-for-podcasters-from-someone-who-lived-through-youtubes-buyout-1beacbcfbcb">acquisitions</a> like Google&#8217;s purchase of YouTube or Spotify&#8217;s absorption of Anchor and Gimlet can drastically change a creator&#8217;s payouts from those platforms.</p>
<p>Fourthwall told TechCrunch that it has three months of emergency operating expenses set aside to ensure that if they were to fail, they could help transition creators to other platforms. The company said it would also make its platform open source if this were to happen. Fourthwall expects to be in business for a long time, but these contingency plans are necessary for creators who are gambling their livelihoods with emerging startups.</p>

<p>To onboard onto Fourthwall, creators have to <a href="https://fourthwall.com/request-an-invite/">request an invite</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Nobody gets rejected. This is just sort of our gating function to make sure we&#8217;re actually getting creators in the platform, as opposed to spam entries,&#8221; Baumann said. &#8220;Fourthwall is designed for anybody that has a community and wants to connect with that community and grow that community, and hopefully, make money off of the platform as things scale up.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no fee to join Fourthwall, but the platform takes 5% of creator earnings, plus a standard credit card processing fee of 2.9% plus $0.30 on all transactions. For creators producing merchandise through Fourthwall&#8217;s manufacturers, there are additional costs involved.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the funding announcement, Fourthwall is also revealing its new Chief Creative Officer, Phil DeFranco, a YouTuber with over six million subscribers who has been making videos for over fifteen years. DeFranco started out using Fourthwall about a year and a half ago and said that his merchandise revenue increased tenfold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Phil&#8217;s number one focus is just making sure that the types of work that we&#8217;re building and shipping to other creators like him are meeting the bar and basically are able to solve their problems,&#8221; Baumann said. &#8220;It&#8217;s really to make sure that we&#8217;re always putting our creators first. That&#8217;s our focus: creator ownership, creator brand and greater control.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Platforms that bring more automation to the working environment, and platforms that are empowering more people to get involved in building tools to help themselves work, have equally seen a huge rise in usage in the last year and a half. Today, a company that ties both of those trends together &#8212; with a no-code platform designed to help build automated workflows for different tasks &#8212; is announcing a big round of funding to capture some of that growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.formstack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Formstack</a>, which provides a wide range of templates and integrations to let people create their own workflow automations, has raised $425 million, equity funding that it will be using to continue picking up more customers and to expand into more international territories.</p>
<p>The company today has some 238,000 users from 25,000 organizations, with some of the big names among its customers including Twitter, Netflix, the NHL and the Cleveland Clinic.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236426" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;We are helping non-tech users get things done, saving time and money,&#8221; said Chris Byers, Formstack&#8217;s CEO, in an interview. He said the company raised this round not because it needed the funds to operate &#8212; it is profitable &#8212; but because it sees helping non-tech users in this way as a very big opportunity, worth some $100 billion globally.</p>
<p>&#8220;About 25% of our customers are already international, so there is huge potential there.&#8221;</p>
<p>It will also use the funding to continue investing in its product, including adding in more integrations alongside the 250 it already has with a variety of big-name and lesser known email, payments, CRM, CMS and document storage services.</p>
<p>Silversmith Capital Partners and returning investor PSG are leading the round: PSG, along with Greater Sum Ventures, led a leveraged buyout of the company in 2018. This appears to be the company&#8217;s first big financing event since then, although the company is not disclosing many details about its management, nor its financial position, except to note that alongside being profitable, revenues have more than tripled since the LBO. We have asked, but valuation is also not being disclosed with this round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Formstack is playing in the very heart of what is trendy in enterprise IT today &#8212; RPA and other kinds of automation to speed up mundane processes and reduce costs are huge, and the growing sophistication of no-code tools has helped to democratize how IT can be built and used in businesses &#8212; but the age of the company itself underscores just how long the concepts of low-code, no-code tools, and automation have actually been around.</p>
<p>Founded in 2006 &#8212; not in the Valley but Fishers, Indiana (near Indianapolis) &#8212; the initial aim of Formstack, Byers said, was to build a tool to make it easier to create online forms to gather customer information and more automatically channel that into relevant applications in the back office.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our original product was a drag-and-drop form builder, which could be used to put a form on site for lead capture,&#8221; said Byers. &#8220;Now we are not only focused on data collection, but document generation.&#8221; It has built out its reach very much with integrations, but it has also built a number of native features to complement that, such as e-signature.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a little more backstory: Byers himself is an integration of sorts. That is to say, he joined the company about five years after it was founded. When founder Ade Olonoh, who still sits on the board, moved on from Formstack, he built another startup: Formspring &#8212; similarly named but very different, initially focused on Q&amp;A and then social networking. Unlike Formstack, which has found a very well-timed groove in the market, Formspring ultimately found it a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/05/13/formspring-saved-new-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struggle</a> to grow amid the rapid rise of Facebook and others. Today, it no longer exists.</p>
<p>Formstack&#8217;s pitch, indeed, has resonated with its customers and seen it move into a number of newer areas, such as healthcare, where automatic flows built using Formstack have been used to take in patient data and help speed up the intake and triage process in clinical settings &#8212; a critical piece of the care process at a time when workers are stretched, and generally everyone concerned wants to minimize physical contact as much as possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Digital transformation has been accelerated, and we&#8217;re seeing usage of our platform to improve customer and worker experience, as well as the move to remote work,&#8221; Byers said. There will be more applications emerging that Formstack is now building for, he said, to help organizations comply with vaccine mandates, by creating forms for users to fill out more easily to verify their status.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe number of businesses looking to streamline and digitize business processes today is accelerating, yet a key pain point for companies is not having the technical resources to implement and maintain a solution,‚Äù said Jim Quagliaroli, managing partner at Silversmith, in a statement. ‚ÄúFormstack‚Äôs no-code workflow automation solution was built to address this problem by enabling non-technical employees who understand a business use case, but don&#8217;t have the technical skills to implement a solution, to become ‚Äòcitizen-developers.‚Äô We are thrilled to partner with Chris, his team, and our friends at PSG as the company continues to rapidly scale.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe believe Formstack is at the forefront of innovation in the workplace productivity space. Their talented team continues to deliver solutions to help organizations across industries operate more effectively and efficiently,‚Äù added Tom Reardon, managing director at PSG. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a pleasure to witness the significant growth they‚Äôve achieved in the past several years, and we‚Äôre excited to continue to serve as a partner and work alongside Silversmith to support their expansion.‚Äù</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/stytch-auth">Stytch</a>, an API-first passwordless authentication startup, has secured $90 million in Series B funding, pushing the company over the $1 billion valuation line.</p>
<p>The investment, led by Coatue Management LLC with participation from existing investors Benchmark Capital, Thrive Capital and Index Ventures, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/ex-plaid-employees-raise-30m-for-stytch-an-api-first-passwordless-authentication-platform/">comes just four months after Stytch raised $30M Series A</a> at a valuation somewhere around $200 million. Since then, the startup has seen an almost 1,000% increase in developers using its passwordless authentication platform, rising from 350 developers in July to about 4,000 in November.</p>
<p>This, the company&#8217;s CEO tells us, is because of its API-first approach. ‚ÄúIf you think about other passwordless startups, they&#8217;re very widget focused,‚Äù Reed McGinley-Stempel, CEO of Stytch and former <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/plaid/">Plaid</a> employee tells TechCrunch. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had enough experience with non-API-first products that we knew there were a lot of limitations to what you can do.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235549" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;For example, one of the common use cases we‚Äôve seen that we would never have anticipated is checkout flows &#8211; adding the ability to create a new account at checkout with an SMS password or email verification, rather than guest checkout,&#8221; said McGinley-Stempel.</p>
<p>The company has also launched a number of new products since its Series A raise in July, including support for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/07/answers-to-your-burning-questions-about-how-sign-in-with-apple-works/">Sign In with Apple,</a> Google and Microsoft, embeddable magic links, and one-time passcodes by email. This week it‚Äôs also adding support for WebAuthn, allowing Stytch to support hardware-based authentication keys like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/yubico/">Yubico</a>, as well as biometric-based Face ID and fingerprint logins.</p>
<p>Stytch said it plans to further expand its platform over the coming months, too. As part of its Series B raise, it acquired <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cotter-app">Cotter</a>, a no-code passwordless authentication platform backed by Y Combinator that allows users to add one-tap login to websites and apps. Stytch said it will make it easier for developers to adopt passwordless technologies.</p>
<p>The company will also use the funding to expand its 30-person team and to build out its infrastructure.</p>
<p>Stytch isn‚Äôt the only startup that‚Äôs on a mission to kill off the password. In June, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/transmit-security-raises-543m-series-a-to-kill-off-the-password/">Transmit Security raised $543 million, </a>in what was believed to be the largest Series A investment in cybersecurity history, for its natively passwordless identity and risk management solution. The following month¬†Magic, a San Francisco-based startup that builds ‚Äúplug and play‚Äù passwordless authentication technology, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/magic-27m-series-a-for-its-plug-and-play-passwordless-tech/">announced it had raised $27 million in Series A funding</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://doorvest.com/">Doorvest</a> this morning announced a $39 million funding event, including $14 million worth of equity financing and a $25 million credit facility. The latter makes sense given the startup&#8217;s business model, namely helping consumers buy and manage rental properties.</p>
<p><a href="https://m13.co/">M13</a> led the round (not to be confused with <a href="https://m12.vc/">M12</a>, Microsoft&#8217;s venture arm, or <a href="https://m25vc.com/">M25</a>, the Midwest-focused firm), with participation from <a href="https://www.mucker.com/">Mucker Capital</a> and others, including a number of angels.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">funding round blizzard</a> that we find ourselves in, it takes a little to stand out from the flow of inbound. But Doorvest caught our eye due to the fact that it sounded like it was building a too-consumer-friendly model for a for-profit business. So we got <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewluong_">Andrew Luong</a>, the company&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, on the phone to discuss the funding event and how Doorvest&#8217;s business shakes out economically.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236404" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Doorvest&#8217;s model</h2>
<p>Doorvest wants to help individual consumers buy a rental property and manage it. Folks bring their own financial information to Doorvest, which helps them select a home to purchase &#8212; the startup has a number of listings already on its platform, including <a href="https://doorvest.com/homes/11023-gatlinburg-dr-houston-tx-77031">houses like this</a>. Once a house is selected and a small deposit paid, Doorvest buys the house in question and fixes it up.</p>
<p>The eventual owner then takes out a mortgage and buys the home from Doorvest, with the company handling its management for a cut of its rental income. The idea is that the consumer gets help selecting, buying and running a rental property without having to pick up a hammer. But what about Doorvest &#8212; why not just buy the houses it thinks make attractive rental candidates and run them itself?</p>

Andrew Luong, left, and Justin Kasad, right. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Doorvest</p></div></p>
<p>Per Luong, individuals can leverage government subsidies and tax advantages that companies often do not get. So, it makes more sense, in his view, to help individuals buy and manage rental units than to keep them intra-company after they are remodeled.</p>
<p>Doorvest makes money in a few ways during the process. It looks to snag a roughly 5% slice of a property&#8217;s final selling price, and the company indicated that the 10% cut of rental incomes it takes for managing properties has margin in it as well.</p>
<p>As a consumer, it all sounds rather excellent. I, an impractical human, would love to add more real estate to my personal portfolio. But I know effectively zilch about how to go about picking, updating and running properties. This limits my options to REITs, or, terrifyingly, trying to learn how to run a small property business myself.</p>
<p>Or, Doorvest. It&#8217;s a good pitch.</p>
<p>The startup has been operating for consumers since April 2020 and has purchased 170 homes to date. Doorvest&#8217;s growing capital base &#8212; it had raised around $3.5 million in equity funding before its latest $14 million infusion &#8212; and its expanding geographic footprint should help it get more homes through its process, collecting not only more data for the company but regular revenue streams.</p>
<p>If the math all shakes out, I dig what Doorvest is doing. Let&#8217;s see how it scales.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EasyHealth, a startup focused on navigating the Medicare experience, announced a $135 million Series A round on Thursday. EasyHealth has a simple purpose: to help enroll, and follow-up with (more on this later), people eligible for Medicare. But the bigger picture is that the company is aiming to fill a major ‚Äúinformation gap‚Äù facing insurance companies along the way.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EasyHealth was founded in 2020 (initially under the name Medicare Advisors 365, but has since rebranded to EasyHealth), and this most recent round represents the company&#8217;s total financing. The $135 million Series A consists of a $100 million credit facility, and $35 million in equity financing. The round was led by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anthemis Group and QED Investors and included Victory Park Capital, Nationwide Ventures, Healthy Ventures, Brewer Lane, and Operator Partners.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some sense, EasyHealth is reminiscent of insurance brokerages ‚Äì third parties that help people pick between Medicare-eligible insurance plans. EasyHealth can connect users with Medicare Advantage plans (Medicare-approved plans offered by private insurers) or other Medicare supplements or prescription drug plans that partner with medicare.¬†</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236057" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Picking these plans can be a fraught process. In New York alone, there are 280 Medicare Advantage Plans and 19 stand-alone Medicare prescription drug plans to pick from according to the </span><a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/92921-state-state-fact-sheets-2022-medicare-advantage-and-part-d-landscape-final.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That‚Äôs a lot of insurance jargon to weed through. In response, about 96 percent of Medicare Advantage and Part D (the drug add-on) plans contract with agents to help sell plans. (Though some studies have suggested that these agents </span><a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2021/apr/how-agents-influence-medicare-beneficiaries-plan-choices"><span style="font-weight: 400;">don‚Äôt represent all the available options</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EasyHealth represents about 30-40 percent of Medicare Advantage plans, said CEO David Duel.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the company has managed to enroll about 40,000 people in Medicare-based plans, per Duel. However, its aiming to be more than a broker. EasyHealth is particularly interested in follow-up up with enrollees.¬†</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is what Duel sees as a ‚Äúcore differentiation‚Äù between EasyHealth and an insurance broker.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThere&#8217;s a lot of brokers and a lot of great companies that support enrollment and support the brokerage function. We&#8217;re going beyond just enrollment and having these clinical functions in house by employing a network of nurse practitioners, doctors and medical assistants to do in-home assessments, and meet the members in their home.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once a broker helps someone enroll in a healthcare plan, insurers will occasionally send a healthcare professional (usually not someone‚Äôs PCP) in-person to do a home visit. These visits are designed to detect chronic conditions or other conditions that might indicate underlying health problems that an insurance company can‚Äôt know about before enrollment.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That ‚Äúinformation gap‚Äù between a patient‚Äôs true health status and what an insurer actually knows¬† is the pain point Duel is trying to address.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúIf a health insurance plan or a PCP doesn&#8217;t know what conditions a member has, they&#8217;ll only find out if once the issue becomes chronic, or the guy ends up in the hospital. So having that first party collect preventative data is super, super critical,‚Äù he said.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duel says that the company has conducted ‚Äúa few thousand‚Äù home visits so far.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Home visits can also be a money-maker for insurance companies that partner with Medicare. These home visits allow insurers to detect conditions they may otherwise miss. That allows them to adjust ‚Äúrisk scores‚Äù assigned to each patient. Higher scores allow companies to bill Medicare for the higher anticipated cost.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In general, there‚Äôs some evidence that home visits can r</span><a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2016.1305"><span style="font-weight: 400;">educe hospitalizations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Center for Medicare Services also encourages Medicare Advantage companies to conduct health risk assessments, including home visits, because they offer an opportunity to develop a plan of care, deliver an intervention, or adjust a care plan.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But these home visit health assessments have also</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/08/12/431400145/whistleblower-says-medicare-advantage-plans-padded-charges-in-home-visits"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> been controversial.</span></a> <a href="https://publicintegrity.org/health/home-is-where-the-money-is-for-medicare-advantage-plans/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2014 report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the Center for Public Integrity found that home visits had skyrocketed, and had likely led to more payments for insurance companies, while government regulators </span><a href="https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Health-Plans/MedicareAdvtgSpecRateStats/Downloads/Advance2015.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cast doubt</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on their effectiveness for patients.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services issued a </span><a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/OEI-03-17-00474.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in September 2021, showing that 20 Medicare Advantage companies (a small proportion overall), had driven a disproportionately large share of Medicare spending through diagnosis made, in large part, through health risk assessments. The benefits patients were receiving as a result of this increased spending was not clear, per the report.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚Äú</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is possible that beneficiaries are receiving care, but plans are not submitting this data as required,‚Äù acknowledged Christi Grimm, Principal Deputy Inspector General of the. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in </span><a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/medicare-advantage-should-not-game-the-system-but-prioritize-patient-care/585613/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an op-ed summarizing the report.¬†¬†¬†</span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúRegardless, plans that use risk assessments to gather diagnoses, but then take no further action, are clearly missing an opportunity for meaningful care coordination.‚Äù¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the home visit can be a useful tool and an opportunity to improve care. But the concept has also faced criticism when it comes to spending and patient outcomes.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Duel, for his part, argues these home-visits do drive better care in the long-term.¬†¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúWe are facilitating the shift from a reactive care to a proactive care model,‚Äù he said.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThe member gets a detailed education on their benefits and how to utilize them. The members get comprehensive clinical and social determinant screening which uncovers potential conditions and allows the providers to build the right care plan. If providers and payers are not aware of conditions due to poor engagement which is very common, they are unable to proactively manage care.‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far EasyHealth has been able to get more people to complete home assessments.¬†</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, with Bright Health, an insurance company partner, Duel says EasyHealth has led to an 80 percent visit completion rate, compared to industry averages ‚Äúbetween five and 20 percent‚Äù he estimates.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EasyHealth plans to use the $135 million raised to drive this ‚Äúindependent broker space.‚Äù The $100 million credit facility portion of this raise will be used to provide technology tools and capital to independent brokers to help them enroll members in Medicare. EasyHealth can then ‚Äúleverage that membership‚Äù to provide the clinical followup portion of its business (the visits).¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going forward, the membership enrollment will take a back seat to the clinical visit side of things ‚Äì that‚Äôs EasyHealth‚Äôs internal core competency. Though the company will keep a hand in enrollment too.¬†</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Software for hardware design is all the rage in the VC funding world these days. Following recent rounds from Flux and Bild, nTopology just announced a sizable series D of $65 million. The funding round led by Tiger Global (who else) brings the New York-based firm‚Äôs total funding to $135 million. Existing investors Root Ventures, Canaan Partners, Haystack and Insight Partners also participated in the round.</p>
<p>The company effectively offers CAD software, designed to be used by engineers in a wide range of fields, including industrial design, aerospace, automotive and medical. The company promises a more elegant solution than more traditional systems, specifically focused on the world of 3D printing/additive manufacturing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235177" style="width: 969px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235177" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2235177" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ALL_MR.gif" alt="" width="959" height="566" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235177" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> nTopology</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235119" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>‚ÄúEarlier in my career, I found that most of the engineering software, like CAD, was a bottleneck in driving innovative design,‚Äù co-founder and CEO Bradley Rothenberg said in a release tied to the news. ‚ÄúOur company was built specifically to solve engineers‚Äô problems, allowing them to fully utilize the power of additive manufacturing processes and fill the gaps left by these old legacy design tools.‚Äù</p>
<p>The company, which recently released v3.0 of its titular software offering, currently has around 300 clients, including names like Ford, Lockheed Martin and Honeywell. It also recently partnered with 3D printing giant Stratasys to create FDM Assembly Fixture Generator, a software platform designed for additive manufacturing workflows.</p>
<p>NTopology says the funding will go toward expanding its international reach, as well as developing additional features for its software.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company was co-founded by a group that includes doctors and a lawyer, all who know what it takes to build a healthcare brand because they did it with their own brand in 2016.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">London-based <a href="https://www.gravitiq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gravitiq</a> is the latest e-commerce roll-up company, or aggregator, that has attracted a large amount of initial funding. It is buying and scaling Amazon marketplace brands in the digitally-native, consumer e-commerce healthcare sector.</p>
<p>The company announced today $55 million of seed investment in a mix of equity and debt (the company declined to disclose the breakdown), from a group of investors that includes CoVenture and Crossbeam Venture Partners.</p>
<p>What you‚Äôll find a bit different about Gravitiq than its e-commerce aggregator peers is that the company was co-founded by a group that includes doctors and a lawyer, all who know what it takes to build a healthcare brand because they did it with their own brand in 2016.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236156" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Doctors Saurabh Srivastava and Adam Gunasekara, and Srivastava‚Äôs brother, Sachin, who began his career at Latham &amp; Watkins and has an M&amp;A background, made their first acquisition in October 2020.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile stuck in a hotel for 14 days during the pandemic, we had the idea of building an online healthcare portfolio that would combine Adam‚Äôs and my skills building healthcare companies with Sachin‚Äôs M&amp;A background,‚Äù CEO Saurabh Srivastava told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Gunasekara noted that by acquiring brands in one niche, it would be easier to scale due to similarities with customers, while Sachin Srivastava added that having the group‚Äôs expertise resonated with sellers who felt comfortable handing their company over to medical specialists.</p>
<p>Gravitiq is looking for companies in all areas of healthcare, like supplements, wellness, baby and first aid. The company has now made half a dozen acquisitions that include orthotics and ADHD and anxiety tools.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new investment provides a path for the company to acquire additional companies, consider expanding its portfolio of e-commerce healthcare brands and add to its team of 20 employees in the U.S., Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>The company plans to move quickly, but cautiously in the number of companies it buys, and is looking for annual recurring revenue of $1 million to $10 million per brand.</p>
<p>With the new funding, Gravitiq joins a long list of startups that have also attracted venture-backed funding to purchase Amazon marketplace companies. Just this week, San Francisco-based Heyday brought in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/heyday-raises-555m-to-buy-up-and-scale-more-d2c-brands-on-the-amazon-marketplace-universe/">$555 million in a Series C round</a>. The big name in aggregators, Thrasio, announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/thrasio-the-amazon-aggregator-raises-1b-in-fresh-funding-at-a-valuation-of-up-to-10-billion/">$1 billion in October</a>, while Perch grabbed a large investment of <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/softbanks-vision-fund-2-leads-775m-investment-in-perch-sets-new-record-for-fastest-company-to-achieve-profitable-unicorn-status-in-the-us-301299324.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$775 million</a> in May.</p>
<p>Sakib Jamal, investor at Crossbeam, says it&#8217;s still too early to say how the e-commerce aggregator market will shake out, but that there are a lot of brands that need help. As more and more new sellers join Amazon, there will be a large pool of companies that will seek help from aggregators like Gravitiq, he added.</p>
<p>What stood out to him with Gravitiq was the specialization in healthcare and being able to help companies with their regulatory pathways and making sure they don‚Äôt make outlandish claims on packaging, something Amazon won‚Äôt necessarily assist with, Jamal said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe like that they have both the medical and Amazon operating experience, and that combination is rare,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúOther things that stood out was that they had already successfully run a brand and the materials and the processes they created on how they would do this ‚Äî even before acquiring their first companies. There was also a trust factor, we trusted them and knew sellers would too.‚Äù</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors‚Äô BrightDrop has scored a second customer for its EV410 electric delivery vans: fleet management company Merchants Fleet, which said Thursday that it had placed an order for 5,400 of the mid-sized electric vans.</p>
<p>The new order is in addition to Merchants‚Äô previous commitment to purchase 12,600 of BrightDrop‚Äôs flagship EV600 van. The total order, which now stands at 18,000 vehicles, is BrightDrop‚Äôs largest client order to date.</p>
<p>BrightDrop is GM‚Äôs first-to-last-mile business arm that the automaker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/12/gm-targets-delivery-companies-with-new-ev-business-unit-brightdrop/">launched at the beginning of 2021</a>. It was spun out of the automaker‚Äôs in-house organization Global Innovation, which also ‚Äúincubated‚Äù OnStar Guardian, OnStar Insurance and GM Defense. So far, the unit has debuted three products: the EV600, the EV410 and a pod-like electric pallet it calls EP1.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236082" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>EV600 has an estimated range of 250 miles and 600 cubic feet of cargo space, while EV410, which GM unveiled in September, comes in at around 400 cubic feet of cargo space. The automaker has already lined up two customers for the vans: FedEx, which inked a deal for EV600 vans &#8212; and will reportedly start receiving the first vehicles in time for the holiday season &#8212; and telecom giant Verizon, which placed an order for an undisclosed number of EV410s.</p>
<p>Both vans will use GM&#8217;s Ultium battery architecture, and both will be manufactured at the automaker&#8217;s CAMI Assembly facility in Ingersoll, Ontario. GM said it would pour $1 billion CAD ($788 million) into converting the CAMI plant into Canada&#8217;s first large-scale facility dedicated to commercial electric vehicle manufacturing.</p>
<p>The launch of BrightDrop is a strong sign that GM sees delivery as one way to make a tidy return on its multibillion-dollar investment in electrification and connected vehicles. The automaker has estimated that the market for parcel and food logistics will top <a href="https://plants.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/jan/ces/0112-brightdrop.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$850 billion by 2025</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Merchants Fleet has over 150,000 units under its management in North America, with many EVs already in its roster. A spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch that many of the company‚Äôs customers have reservations for future vehicles, such as the BrightDrop EV600, EV410, Ford F-150 Lightning and the Chevrolet electric Silverado.</p>
