					<description><![CDATA[Pet item sales topped $100 billion in 2020, driven by the 48 million dogs and cats that were adopted over the past three years.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pet&#8217;s are big business. Sales in this area <a href="https://www.bioguardlabs.com/pandemic-era-pet-industry-surpasses-record-breaking-100-billion-in-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">topped $100 billion in 2020</a>, driven by the 48 million dogs and cats that were adopted over the past three years. However, in that same period, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/jul/27/veterinarians-face-high-demand-treat-pets-amid-ado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only 5,000 new veterinarians were added</a>, causing delays in getting appointments and added <a href="https://www.wisfarmer.com/story/news/2021/05/26/alarming-suicide-rates-reflective-stresses-felt-veterinarians/7361193002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stress upon veterinarians</a> to manage their practices.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://yourfuzzy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fuzzy</a> announced $43 million in growth funding to expand its digital pet care network of veterinary professionals to alleviate some of the strain on the industry and make care accessible and affordable to all. The San Francisco-based company previously raised <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/fuzzy-lands-18m-series-b-for-pet-telemedicine-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$18 million in a Series B round</a> in March.</p>
<p>The company, founded in 2016, provides 24/7 live chat and telehealth, ship-to-home prescriptions, vet-curated items in its e-commerce marketplace and educational content and programs. Its digitally-native approach can save pet parents up to $750 a year on healthcare expenses, Zubin Bhettay, co-founder and CEO of Fuzzy, told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237381" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The big story in 2020 was that everyone needed telehealth services for themselves, and we saw that transfer to pets and then exacerbated by the industry,” he added. “The surge in people getting pets caused emergency room waits to grow to up to 10 hours, while it started taking four to six weeks to get a vet appointment.”</p>
<p>By leading the shift to more telehealth services, Fuzzy hopes to encourage pet parents to consider the health of their pet on a more regular basis to aid in their longevity. The company has facilitated more than 1 million consultations to date and with it, amassed data and operation expertise to be able to expand delivery care at scale.</p>
<p>Bhettay wasn’t planning to raise additional funds so soon after the Series B, but said accelerated growth in the business enabled the company to hire more, check off more of the to-do list items over the past eight months and provided a unique opportunity to lean in on partnerships and expand financial plans.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He expects 2021 revenue growth to be five times over 2020, while Fuzzy memberships, which start for free and then a monthly subscription of $24.99 or annual subscription for $99.99, have increased through partnerships with retailers and vet groups. Bhettay did not reveal the company’s valuation, but did say it was more than a three-time uptick from the Series B round.</p>
<p>The round was led by Icon Ventures, with existing investors Greycroft, Matrix and Crosscut participating, with additional backing from veterinary clinic groups and individuals, including former Chewy chairman Mark Vadon and Clearlake Group founder Jose Feliciano. In addition, 25% of the capital was raised from underrepresented communities, Bhettay said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2237386" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237386" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2237386 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fuzzy-Live-Chat.png?w=314" alt="Fuzzy app" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fuzzy-Live-Chat.png 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fuzzy-Live-Chat.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fuzzy-Live-Chat.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fuzzy-Live-Chat.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Fuzzy-Live-Chat.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2237386" class="wp-caption-text">Fuzzy live chat via its app. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fuzzy</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to expanding the vet network — Fuzzy is operational in 25 locations — his plans for the new funding include the development and launch of new product offerings, additional educational content and new member growth.</p>
<p>“We want to see pet care go from once a year to anytime, anywhere,” Bhettay added. “As we think about our vision of becoming the first place where everyone comes to, there are some features and products that we can bring into the business to accelerate that path, as well as acquisitions in the next six to 12 months.”</p>
<p>There are a number of startups tapping into this major trend of pets to capture that household spend in the areas of healthcare, insurance and food. Bhettay is also seeing the larger incumbents focus here, as well as marketing dollars, which he considers validation that the market is shifting to the digitalization of pet care.</p>
<p>Tom Mawhinney, general partner at Icon Ventures, has four dogs himself and felt the pains of having to wait weeks to get them in to see a veterinarian, including having to take one dog to the emergency vet.</p>
<p>He called Bhettay “an energetic and smart entrepreneur” who is building a strong team to go after a space that is ripe for disruption.</p>
<p>“The problems are more exacerbated the more pets that are added to the system, which has not grown in a way to support that,” Mawhinney added. “There needs to be new means for providing care to pets, and Fuzzy is putting in place a bespoke wellness plan that is encouraging interaction to become more frequent and make the overall lives of pets better.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The company formerly known as Facebook is delaying a rollout of end-to-end encryption across all its services until &#8220;sometime in 2023&#8221;, according to Meta&#8217;s global head of safety, Antigone Davis, penning an op-ed in the British newspaper, the<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/11/20/people-shouldnt-have-choose-privacy-safety-says-facebook-safety/"> Telegraph</a> this weekend.</p>
<p>While Facebook-owned WhatsApp has had E2EE everywhere <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/05/whatsapp-completes-end-to-end-encryption-rollout/">since 2016</a>, most of the tech giant&#8217;s services do not ensure only the user holds keys for decrypting messaging data. Meaning those services can be subpoenaed or hit with a warrant to provide messaging data to public authorities.</p>
<p>But back in 2019 &#8212; in the wake of global attention to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/how-facebook-has-reacted-since-the-data-misuse-scandal-broke/">Cambridge Analytica data misuse scandal</a> &#8212; founder Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/2420600258234172/">announced</a> the company would work towards universally implementing end-to-end encryption across all its services as part of a claimed &#8216;pivot to privacy&#8217;.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237762" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Zuckerberg did not give a firm timeline for completing the rollout but, earlier this year, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2021/04/03/facebook-message-encryption-wont-happen-2022/">Facebook suggested</a> it would complete the rollout during 2022.</p>
<p>Now the tech giant is saying it won&#8217;t get this done until &#8220;sometime&#8221; the following year. Which sounds distinctly like a can being kicked down the road.</p>
<p>Davis said the delay is the result of the social media giant wanting to take it time to ensure it can implement the technology safely &#8212; in the sense of being able to retain the ability to be able to pass information to law enforcement to assist in child safety investigations.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we do so, there’s an ongoing debate about how tech companies can continue to combat abuse and support the vital work of law enforcement if we can’t access your messages. We believe people shouldn’t have to choose between privacy and safety, which is why we are building strong safety measures into our plans and engaging with privacy and safety experts, civil society and governments to make sure we get this right,&#8221; she writes, saying it will use &#8220;proactive detection technology&#8221; to ID suspicious patterns of activity, along with enhanced controls for users and the ability for users to report problems.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Western governments, including the UK&#8217;s, have been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/facebook-is-being-leant-on-by-us-uk-australia-to-ditch-its-end-to-end-encryption-expansion-plan/">leaning hard on Facebook to delay or abandon its plan</a> to blanket services in the strongest level of encryption altogether &#8212; ever since it made the public announcement of its intention to &#8216;e2ee all the things&#8217; over two years ago.</p>
<p>The UK has been an especially vocal critic of Facebook on this front, with Home Secretary Priti Patel very publicly (and repeatedly) <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56795852">warning Facebook</a> that its plan to expand e2ee would hamper efforts to combat online child abuse &#8212; casting the tech giant as an irresponsible villain in the fight against the production and distribution of child sexual abuse material (CSAM).</p>
<p>So Meta&#8217;s op-ed appearing in the favored newspaper of the British government looks no accident.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we roll out end-to-end encryption we will use a combination of non-encrypted data across our apps, account information and reports from users to keep them safe in a privacy-protected way while assisting public safety efforts,&#8221; Davis also writes in the Telegraph, adding: &#8220;This kind of work already enables us to make vital reports to child safety authorities from WhatsApp.&#8221;</p>
<p>She goes on to suggest that Meta/Facebook has reviewed a number of historic cases &#8212; and concluded that it &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">would still have been able to provide critical information to the authorities, even if those services had been end-to-end encrypted&#8221; &#8212; adding: &#8220;While no systems are perfect, this shows that we can continue to stop criminals and support law enforcement.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>How exactly might Facebook be able to pass data on users even if all comms on its services were end-to-end encrypted?</p>
<p>Users are not privy to the exact detail on how Facebook/Meta joins the dots of their activity across its social empire &#8212; but while Facebook&#8217;s application of e2ee on WhatsApp covers messaging/comms content, for example, it does not extend to metadata (which can provide plenty of intel on its own).</p>
<p>The tech giant also routinely links accounts and account activity across its social media empire &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/25/whatsapp-to-share-user-data-with-facebook-for-ad-targeting-heres-how-to-opt-out/">passing data like a WhatsApp user&#8217;s mobile phone number to its eponymous service</a>, following a controversial privacy U-turn back in 2016. This links a user&#8217;s (public) social media activity on Facebook (if they have or have had an account there) with the more bounded form of socializing that typifies activity on WhatsApp (i.e. one-to-one comms, or group chats in a private e2ee channel).</p>
<p>Facebook can thus leverage its vast scale (and historical profiling of users) to flesh out a WhatsApp user&#8217;s social graph and interests &#8212; based on things like who they are speaking to; who they&#8217;re connected to; what they&#8217;ve liked and done across all its services (most of which aren&#8217;t yet e2ee) &#8212; despite WhatsApp messaging/comms content itself being end-to-end encrypted.</p>
<p>(Or as Davis&#8217; op-ed puts it: &#8220;As we roll out end-to-end encryption we will use a combination of non-encrypted data across our apps, account information and reports from users to keep them safe in a privacy-protected way while assisting public safety efforts. This kind of work already enables us to make vital reports to child safety authorities from WhatsApp.&#8221;)</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/whatsapp-faces-267m-fine-for-breaching-europes-gdpr/">Earlier this fall</a>, Facebook was stung with a major fine in the European Union related to WhatsApp transparency obligations &#8212; with DPAs finding it had failed to properly inform users what it was doing with their data, including in relation to how it passes information between WhatsApp and Facebook.</p>
<p>Facebook is appealing against the GDPR sanction but today it <a href="https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/whatsapp-changes-privacy-policy-after-225m-watchdog-fine-41075354.html">announced a tweak to the wording of the privacy policy</a> shown to WhatsApp users in Europe in response to the regulatory enforcement &#8212; although it claimed it has not made any changes to how it processes user data.</p>
<p>Returning to e2ee specifically, last month Facebook whistleblower <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-raises-trust-and-security-questions-over-its-e2e-encryption/">Frances Haugen raised concerns over the tech giant&#8217;s application of the technology</a> &#8212; arguing that since it&#8217;s a proprietary (i.e. rather than open source) implementation users must take Facebook/Meta&#8217;s security claims on trust, as independent third parties are unable to verify the code does what it claims.</p>
<p>She also suggested there is no way for outsiders to know how Facebook interprets e2ee &#8212; adding that for this reason she&#8217;s concerned about its plan to expand the use of e2ee &#8212; &#8220;because we have no idea what they’re going to do&#8221;, as she put it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don’t know what it means, we don’t know if people’s privacy is actually protected,&#8221; Haugen told lawmakers in the UK parliament, further warning: &#8220;It’s super nuanced and it’s also a different context. On the open source end-to-end encryption product that I like to use there is no directory where you can find 14 year olds, there is no directory where you can go and find the Uighur community in Bangkok. On Facebook it is <em>trivially easy</em> to access vulnerable populations and there are national state actors that are doing this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Haugen was careful to speak up in support of e2ee &#8212; saying she&#8217;s a supporter of open source implementations of the security technology, i.e. where external experts can robustly interrogate code and claims.</p>
<p>But in the case of Facebook, where its e2ee implementation is not open to anyone to verify, she suggested regulatory oversight is needed to avoid the risk of the tech giant making misleading claims about how much privacy (and therefore safety from potentially harmful surveillance, such as by an authoritarian state) users actually have.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Davis&#8217; op-ed &#8212; which is headlined &#8220;we&#8217;ll protect privacy and prevent harm&#8221; &#8212; sounds intended to soothe UK policymakers that they can &#8216;have their cake and eat it&#8217;; concluding with a promise that Meta will &#8220;continue engaging with outside experts and developing effective solutions to combat abuse&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re taking our time to get this right and we don’t plan to finish the global rollout of end-to-end encryption by default across all our messaging services until sometime in 2023,&#8221; Davis adds, finishing with another detail-light soundbite that it is &#8220;determined to protect people’s private communications and keep people safe online&#8221;.</p>
<p>While the UK government will surely be delighted with the line-toeing quality of Facebook&#8217;s latest public missives on a very thorny topic, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">its announcement that it&#8217;s delaying e2ee in order to &#8220;get this right&#8221; &#8212; following sustained pressure from ministers like Patel &#8212; is only likely to increase concerns about what &#8220;right&#8221; means in such a privacy sensitive context. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Certainly the wider community of digital rights advocates and security experts will be closely watching what Meta does here.  </span></p>
<p>The UK government recently splashed almost half a million of taxpayer&#8217;s money on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/uk-names-five-projects-its-funding-for-csam-detection/">five projects to develop scanning/filtering technologies that could be applied to e2ee services</a> &#8212; to detect, report or block the creation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) &#8212; after ministers said they wanted to encourage innovation around &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/uk-offers-cash-for-csam-detection-tech-targeted-at-e2e-encryption/">tech safety</a>&#8221; through the development of &#8220;alternative solutions&#8221; (i.e. which would not require platforms <em>not</em> to use e2ee but instead to embed some form of scanning/filtering technology into the encrypted systems to detect/combat CSAM).</p>
<p>So the UK&#8217;s preferred approach appears to be to use the political cudgel of concern for child safety &#8212; which it&#8217;s also legislating for in the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/"> Online Safety Bill</a> &#8212; to push platforms to implement spyware that allows for encrypted content to be scanned on users&#8217; devices regardless of any claim of e2ee.</p>
<p>Whether such baked in scanner systems essentially sum to a backdoor in the security of robust encryption (despite ministers claims otherwise) will surely be the topic of close scrutiny and debate in the months/years ahead.</p>
<p>Here it&#8217;s instructive to look at Apple&#8217;s recent proposal to add a CSAM detection system to its mobile OS &#8212; where the technology was slated to scan content on a user&#8217;s device prior to it being uploaded to its iCloud storage service.</p>
<p>Apple initially took a bullish stance on the proactive move &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/interview-apples-head-of-privacy-details-child-abuse-detection-and-messages-safety-features/">claiming</a> it had developed &#8220;the technology that can balance strong child safety and user privacy&#8221;.</p>
<p>However after a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apples-csam-detection-tech-is-under-fire-again/">storm of concern</a> from privacy and security experts &#8212; as well as those warning that such systems, once established, would inexorably face &#8216;feature creep&#8217; (whether from commercial interests to scan for copyrighted content; or from hostile states to target political dissidents living under authoritarian regimes) &#8212; Apple backtracked, saying after less than a month that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/apple-csam-detection-delayed/"> it would delay</a> implementing the system.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear when/whether Apple might revive the on-device scanner.</p>
<p>While the iPhone maker has built a reputation (and very lucrative business) as a privacy-centric company, Facebook&#8217;s ad empire is the opposite beast: Synonymous with surveillance for profit. So expecting the social media behemoth &#8212; whose founder (and all-powerful potentate) has presided over a string of scandals attached to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/10/a-brief-history-of-facebooks-privacy-hostility-ahead-of-zuckerbergs-testimony/">systematically privacy-hostile decisions</a> &#8212; to hold the line in the face of sustained political pressure to bake spyware into its products would be for Facebook to deny its own DNA.</p>
<p>Its recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/facebook-changes-its-corporate-branding-to-meta/">corporate rebranding to Meta</a> looks a whole lot more superficial than that.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cubbo touts itself as the only company that can take an order up to 5 p.m and get it out in Mexico City the same day.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Colombian e-commerce fulfillment startup <a href="https://www.cubbo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cubbo</a> landed $4 million in seed funding as it launches operations in its home country this month after first going into Mexico earlier this year.</p>
<p>The company came together in January under the leadership of Brian York and Josu Gurtubay. York’s backstory is quite interesting. He was born on the streets in Bogota, and was adopted and grew up in Boston.</p>
<p>In 2017, he started searching for his biological family in Colombia and reconnected with them. Prior to Cubbo, he founded three other startups in San Francisco. York previously worked with Gurtubay, too, in third-party logistics before transferring over the direct-to-consumer e-commerce businesses into Cubbo.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237366" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2237370" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237370" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2237370" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cubbo-warehouse-in-Mexico-City.jpg" alt="Cubbo" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cubbo-warehouse-in-Mexico-City.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cubbo-warehouse-in-Mexico-City.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cubbo-warehouse-in-Mexico-City.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cubbo-warehouse-in-Mexico-City.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cubbo-warehouse-in-Mexico-City.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cubbo-warehouse-in-Mexico-City.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cubbo-warehouse-in-Mexico-City.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cubbo-warehouse-in-Mexico-City.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2237370" class="wp-caption-text">Cubbo warehouse in Mexico City. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cubbo</p></div></p>
<p>Their vision is to transform city spaces throughout Latin America. For example, the company took over an abandoned space in Mexico City and turned it into an urban fulfilment center for its brands, York explained.</p>
<p>“Most of our customers sell through Amazon and Mercado Libre, so we manage their inventory and also some of the largest customers from outside of Mexico,” he added. “In Mexico, we are the only company that can take an order up to 5 p.m. and get it out in Mexico City the same day. Amazon and Mercado can do this, but have to get orders in earlier because their warehouses are outside the city.”</p>
<p>To keep costs down and the ability to get an order out the same day, Cubbo only handles non-perishable goods that are the size of a shoebox or smaller. This means items like cosmetics, consumer electronics and apparel. It also does not transport items itself, but partners with third parties to tackle the last-mile delivery after the company has picked, packed and bundled packages strategically.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The latest funding round was led by SV Latam Capital and included Bragiel Brothers, BluStone and a group of individual angel investors including Wonder Brands founders Federico Malek and Nicolas Gonzalez Luna, Merama co-founder Olivier Scialom, RioGrande co-founder Tony Mandly, 99 Minutos CEO Alexis Patjane, Justo CEO Ricardo Weder and Loft CEO Florian Hagenbuch.</p>
<p>York intends to use the proceeds to continue building out the Mexican and Colombian operations and gearing up to launch in Brazil. In November, the company reached its largest amount of orders per day, some 50% higher than previous months. Cubbo is also expected to double its revenue by the end of the year.</p>
<p>In the short period of time the company has been in business, it has grown to a team of 16 in Mexico and three in Colombia. York will also use the funding to round out the leadership team. He also plans to raise a Series A early next year as the company moves toward becoming cash flow positive by the second quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>“As we look into the ecosystem, we feel fortunate to have good supporters in our niche,” York said. Brands in Latin America have 20% of sales coming from direct-to-consumer, and  everyone wants to grow in the next five years, so it is important for brands to own their data and customer experience, and that is our general overarching theme.”</p>

<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been in Los Angeles this past week to meet up with startups, investors and of course, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/21/the-highs-and-lows-of-the-2021-los-angeles-auto-show/">check out the LA Auto Show</a>.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start the day off with a chortle. Last week’s Saturday Night Live featured an e-bike shout-out during the show’s “Weekend Update” news anchor skit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A new report shows that the fastest growing form of electric vehicle is the e-bike, which is particularly popular in cities,” </span><a href="https://twitter.com/DavidZipper/status/1460040672791126019?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said comedian Michael Che</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “At this point, experts believe the only thing that can slow these bikes down are car doors.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In only a few words, Che sums up the irony behind the growing popularity of e-bikes. Despite increased usage and modal shifts, cars unfortunately remain the kings of the concrete jungle &#8212; at least until cities step up and prioritize more egalitarian, greener forms of transport.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a deal to end car emissions by 2040 </span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8c4a1809-902f-4582-a29e-1c83a97b9dff" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">didn’t quite make it to light</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at COP26, </span><a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2021/11/12/report-climate-goals-impossible-unless-sustainable-transport-claims-40-percent-of-mode-share/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a new report </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">revealed that urban residents need to start making 40% of trips by foot, bike, micromobility or transit within the next 10 years or we won’t be able to reach our climate goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some cities are making strides. A few cities in the U.S., like Oakland, Bakersfield and Pittsburgh, have started experimenting with</span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-11/u-s-cities-test-effects-of-universal-basic-mobility" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “universal basic mobility” pilots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that subsidize buses, e-scooters and e-bikes so people can more freely move about. The end goal is to usher in more economic activity to cities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At CoMotion LA, an urban mobility conference, </span><b>Spin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced it would be one of the micromobility companies to work with local community nonprofits in Bakersfield, like the Dream Center, to identify 100 eligible participants to receive access to free public transit, Spin e-scooters and e-bikes for a year. Bakersfield will be the third UBM pilot Spin is participating in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the event, Spin also announced a partnership with Blue Systems to provide a data dashboard to select U.S. cities aimed at boosting pedestrian safety and eliminating sidewalk riding and improper parking. </span></p>
<p><b>Fetch.ai</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an AI lab with an open-access decentralized ML network for smart infrastructure, has partnered with </span><b>Datarella</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a blockchain company, to launch the MOBIX Micromobility Marketplace, a platform that will hopefully incentivize users through rewards to use micromobility services. MOBIX users can earn miles by recording micromobility trips, which can then be converted into tokens to be used on future trips or traded at crypto exchanges. Users anywhere can download the app on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. </span></p>
<p><b>Lime </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">partnered with </span><b>SafeUP</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a community safety network offering guardians for women if they feel unsafe, to provide free rides on Lime scooters and bikes to SafeUP guardians in NYC, LA, San Francisco, Seattle, Miami, Washington, DC, Austin and Tel Aviv. </span></p>
<p><b>Bird </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">had its</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/birds-first-public-earnings-show-missed-q3-revenue-but-potential-for-full-year-growth/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> first public earnings call </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">since becoming a public company via SPAC. The company’s revenues only slightly missed expectations, but the company boosted its guidance for the full-year 2021 period. It’s relying on an uptick in commuting and tourism, as well as an easing of supply chain constraints. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Australian startup </span><b>Zoomo</b> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/e-bike-subscription-service-zoomo-raises-60m-series-b-to-disrupt-last-mile-delivery/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised a $60 million Series B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to expand its e-bike subscription service. The company offers e-bikes for gig workers or enterprise fleets, and wants to disrupt the last-mile delivery industry. </span></p>
<p><b>Zembo</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a French startup with operations in Uganda selling e-motorcycles through a lease-to-own program, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/12/zembo-nabs-3-4-million-from-toyota-dob-equity-and-infraco-africa-to-grow-its-motorcycle-startup-in-uganda/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">raised $3.4 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to begin scaling operations across Africa. It’s backed by Mobility 54, a corporate VC subsidiary of Toyota Tsusho Corp, which will leverage Toyota’s automotive footprint to help Zembo expand.</span></p>
<p><b>Superpedestrian</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is the latest micromobility operator to be featured on the </span><b>Moovit</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> app, following behind Lime, Spin and Bird. Now, Moovit users planning trips with the app will be able to find LINK scooters where available. </span></p>
<p><b>Lyft </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expanding its partnership with </span><b>Mastercard</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Bay Area to include bikeshare. Mastercard will help </span><b>Bay Wheels</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is available on the Lyft app, build an additional 35 bikeshare stations next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also in San Francisco, </span><b>Scoot/Bird</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have teamed up with </span><b>Scootaround</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to pilot an accessible mobility program in the city. Initially piloted in the Bronx, the program allows riders with disabilities to find, reserve and pay for one of three accessible vehicle types. </span></p>
<p><b>Tier </b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/e-scooter-startup-tier-buys-nextbike-to-double-down-on-commitment-to-e-bikes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bought</span></a> <b>Nextbike, </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">a German bike-sharing platform, signaling both the company’s commitment to a multimodal approach and, perhaps, more micromobility consolidations in the future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric scooter maker </span><b>Niu</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has hinted it would be expanding its urban mobility portfolio at EICMA, or the Milan Motorcycle show, next week. This sounds like it could be a new type of vehicle, and </span><a href="https://electrek.co/2021/11/17/electric-scooter-maker-niu-teases-new-electric-vehicle-announcement-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electrek is guessing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it might be the company’s three-wheeled canopied scooter concept, which was revealed at CES 2020. Fingers crossed! The micromobility world really needs a solution for rainy days.</span></p>

<p>Last week was all about <strong>Rivian&#8217;s</strong> much-hyped IPO. This week I want to talk about <strong>Lucid Group</strong>, which completed its first quarter as a publicly traded company this week. It looks like its market cap now exceeds both <strong>Ford</strong> and <strong>General</strong> <strong>Motors</strong>, after a stock boost that added $17 billion to its valuation.</p>
<p>What comes next for the new EV entrant? Deliveries, according to investors during the earnings call, starting with its Lucid Air Dream Edition, followed by the Grand Touring, Touring and Air Pure. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/lucid-groups-customer-reservations-top-17000-since-end-of-third-quarter/">CEO Peter Rawlinson said he&#8217;s confident</a> the company will be able to manufacture 20,000 vehicles next year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, reservations have reportedly increased to 17,000 &#8212; up from around 13,000 at the end of the third quarter.</p>
<p>One other big deal — or more accurately, dead deal — to note this week: Ford CEO Jim Farley said Friday that the automaker has ended its planned vehicle collaboration with Rivian. The company still is a major shareholder of Rivian.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello everyone! Welcome back to Policy Corner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $1.2 trillion bipartisan </span><b>infrastructure</b> <b>bill</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contains a whole slew of new provisions and funds that target vehicles. Big budgets for things like EV charging and electric school buses have been the most headline-grabbing, but they’re far from the only significant provisions included in the legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The infrastructure bill is also taking aim at driver safety. Besides </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/the-station-the-biggest-deal-of-2021-and-executive-shuffling-in-transportation-land/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">introducing provisions to include anti-drunk driving tech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in new vehicles, the legislation also opened the door for adaptive headlights to come to the U.S. Within 24 months, the </span><b>Secretary of Transportation</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be required to revise the regulations around headlights &#8220;to allow for the use on vehicles of adaptive driving beam headlamp systems.&#8221; That means that soon, headlights in America won’t have just two modes &#8212; bright and super-bright &#8212; but instead will be able to dynamically respond to the environment and adjust brightness and beam lighting accordingly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bill also authorizes the transportation secretary to determine when to mandate tech like automated emergency braking, lane-assist and forward-collision warnings. Read: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">when</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">if. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">That means these features will soon be available in all new cars. Cars may also need to be equipped with rear seat occupancy warnings that would go off to prevent a pet or child being left in the backseat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other news that caught my attention this week&#8230;</span></p>
<p><b>The New York City Council </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is </span><a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5190166&amp;GUID=B236F0C1-4256-4377-BFB4-2FD58FFDA68B&amp;Options=ID%7cText%7c&amp;Search=" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">considering a bill </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">that would require the Taxi and Limousine Commission to create a set of rules relating to the licensing and use of autonomous vehicles as taxis. Looks like the state is trying to be proactive about this tech. </span></p>
<p><b>Self-Driving Coalition</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is drawing a line in the sand: it wants policymakers, journalists (hello!) and other stakeholders to clearly distinguish between autonomous driving systems and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The group has long insisted &#8212; rightly, in our opinion &#8212; that conflation of the two technologies could lead to drivers misusing ADAS and not fully understanding its capabilities and limitations. </span></p>
<p><b>The California Energy Commission </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">approved a staggering $1.4 billion plan to boost the adoption of electric vehicles, with nearly 80% of the money earmarked for EV charging and hydrogen refueling stations. Notably, the majority of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">is dedicated to medium- and heavy-duty infrastructure &#8212; chargers for things like buses, school buses and trucks. </span></p>

<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
<p><b>Apple</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/apple-reportedly-aims-to-debut-a-fully-self-driving-car-in-2025/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reportedly making moves to develop its electric car</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and it’s planning to make it autonomous, as well. The &#8220;fluid&#8221; plan is to have the car ready to go by 2025, but Apple’s already had a range of setbacks with this car and it declined to comment on the news. </span></p>
<p><b>Baidu</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reckons it has the largest robotaxi service in the world, based on its 115,000 rides. The service, Apollo Go, aims to be in 65 cities by 2025 and 100 cities by 2030, the firm’s CEO Robin Li </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/baidu-robotaxi-2030/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said during an earnings call</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/baraja-unveils-spectrum-hd-a-world-first-lidar-built-to-enable-level-4-autonomy-at-automotive-scale-and-integration-301425796.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baraja</a> </strong>has released a lidar system that it says is ready for &#8220;Level 4 autonomy at scale.&#8221; Spectrum HD will cost under $1,000 and will be available for sampling next year.</p>
<p><b>Honda </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is moving forward with an </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/honda-shows-off-the-latest-version-of-its-autonomous-work-vehicle/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">off-road autonomous work vehicle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which it’s testing at a solar panel construction site. The vehicles can tow trailers of up to 1,653 pounds and carry construction materials of up to 880 pounds across the 1,000 acre worksite.</span></p>
<p><b>Pony.ai</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> restructured its passenger car and autonomous trucking R&amp;D units in September, and TechCrunch has since learned a few key executives left after, at least one of whom think the different use cases of urban driving and highway driving should have separate product teams. Two of the employees left to start their own L4 trucking business. Sources have confirmed to TechCrunch that Pony’s autonomous trucking operations in the States have been suspended, but the company is still testing in China.</span></p>
<p><strong>Qualcomm </strong>is collaborating with <strong>BMW Group </strong>to design and develop <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/11/16/qualcomm-and-bmw-group-extend-their-long-lasting-technology-collaboration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BMW&#8217;s next-gen ADAS and autonomous systems</a> stack.</p>
<p><b>REE Automotive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has come up with a fully autonomous concept vehicle based on a brand new </span><a href="https://ree.auto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ultra-modular EV platform design</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The concept is geared for last-mile autonomous and electric delivery companies, fleet operators, e-retailers and tech companies looking to build fully autonomous solutions. </span></p>
<h3>Electric vehicles</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>Los Angeles Auto Show </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">was this week, so let’s start with some of the top automaker reveals:</span></p>
<p><b>Biliti Electric </b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/biliti-bets-us-market-is-primed-for-electric-tuk-tuk-deliveries/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced at the event that it wanted to bring its electric tuk tuks to the U.S. </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">market. The three-wheeled, open-cabin, electric delivery vehicles are already being used in Asia and Europe, and might be an answer to last- or middle-mile delivery in the U.S. </span></p>
<p><b>Fisker’s</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> all-electric </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/the-all-electric-fisker-ocean-suv-debuts-with-a-rotating-screen-from-foxconn/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ocean SUV debuts with a rotating screen</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one of manufacturer </span><b>Foxconn</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s obvious touches. Fisker’s first EV will have a 17.1 inch central screen that can rotate from portrait to landscape mode depending on whether the driver is using GPS or just chilling and watching movies in the car. </span></p>
<p><b>Hyundai </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">launched its </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/hyundais-new-electric-suv-concept-showcases-a-hygienic-lounge-like-interior/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyundai SEVEN Concept vehicle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, featuring a “hygienic” interior, because ew, COVID. The concept is built on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyundai’s Electric Global Modular Platform, which is the same platform as the Ioniq 5, and features lounge-like interiors with swiveling seats and a whole bunch of hygienic bits and bobs. For example, a hygiene air flow system for tailored airflow and a UVC sterilization cycle. </span></p>
<p><b>Porsche</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unveiled the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/porsche-takes-the-gts-electric-with-the-taycan-sedan-and-sporty-wagon/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taycan GTS sedan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a third body style called Taycan GTS Sport Turismo, rounding out the Taycan vehicle portfolio, which the company has invested more than $1 billion in developing.</span></p>
<p><b>Subaru</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed its first all-electric crossover, the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/subarus-first-all-electric-vehicle-makes-its-american-debut/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 Subaru Solterra</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The crossover is a sign Subaru is catering to the American audience and trying to get a foothold into the EV market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new Subaru’s doppelgänger, the </span><b>Toyota</b> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/toyota-all-electric-bz4x-250-mile-range/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bZ4X, was also revealed at the LA Auto Show</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It’s the first EV under Toyota’s bZ brand, and it should come to the U.S. in mid-2022 with an estimated range of up to 250 miles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other EV news…</span></p>
<p><b>Canoo</b><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/canoo-is-setting-up-headquarters-in-walmarts-hometown-picks-panasonic-as-battery-supplier/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced plans to establish its HQ </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and an advanced manufacturing industrialized facility in Bentonville, Arkansas. (Do we detect a future deal with Walmart?). During the company’s Q3 earnings call, Canoo said it’s getting close to producing vehicles on its gamma platform. The company also announced Panasonic as its battery supplier and plans to establish tech hubs in Tulsa and Fayetteville.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luxury EV startup </span><b>Lucid Group</b> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/lucid-groups-customer-reservations-top-17000-since-end-of-third-quarter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">completed its first quarter as a public company </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">after merging with Churchill Capital IV Corp in July.

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Electric vehicle (EV) charging stations will be required for all new homes and businesses in the UK starting in 2022, the government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-to-announce-electric-vehicle-revolution" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">announced</a> today. The new measure aims to boost EV adoption in the nation by adding up to 145,000 extra charging points each year.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will mean people can buy new properties already ready for an electric vehicle future, while ensuring charge points are readily available at new shops and workplaces across the UK — making it as easy as refueling a petrol or diesel car today,&#8221; the press release states.</p>
<p>The UK government has already backed the installation of over 250,000 charging points, so the new rules would increase that by over 50 percent in the first year alone. Buildings like supermarkets and workplaces are included in the law, along with large scale renovations that will have over 10 parking spaces. However, details of the rules, like specifications and power outputs of the installations, have yet to be released.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237769" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Britain&#8217;s opposition Labour party noted that London and the southeast part of the country have more charging points &#8220;than the rest of England and Wales combined,&#8221; and the new law doesn&#8217;t help in that regard.

					<description><![CDATA[E-commerce fulfillment is certainly having a moment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Though <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/supply-chain-problems-show-signs-of-easing-11637496002" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports of global supply chain bottlenecks show some easing</a>, they likely still won’t be back to normal until some time next year. <a href="https://deliverr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deliverr</a>’s technology was developed to enable next-day, affordable e-commerce fulfillment for its merchants despite these disruptions. And investors are lining up to keep its machine going.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based company announced Monday $250 million in Series E funding, boosting its valuation to $2 billion. This new valuation is more than double its previous valuation when the company raised just seven months ago, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/deliverr-scores-170m-to-bring-fast-delivery-to-every-e-commerce-vendor/">$170 million round</a> led by Coatue.</p>
<p>Deliverr, which provides fulfillment services to e-commerce merchants on marketplace platforms, like Shopify, Walmart, Amazon, eBay and Target, uses predictive analytics to anticipate demand for products based on variables, including demographics and geography, and then preposition items close to demand.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237686" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company is seeing supply chain constraints become “much more acute,” so its approach is to have a network of over 80 warehouses, cross-docks and sort centers near places of demand to reduce the number of miles a product travels and makes it more affordable to get products faster, Harish Abbott, co-founder and CEO, said via email. That approach has resulted in Deliverr&#8217;s merchants growing 90% year-over-year.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Deliverr scores $170M to bring fast delivery to every e-commerce vendor&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/deliverr-scores-170m-to-bring-fast-delivery-to-every-e-commerce-vendor/embed/#?secret=owiuhrGj0q" data-secret="owiuhrGj0q" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Demand remains at elevated levels from the pandemic,” he said. “Labor pool constraints made us more creative in our partnerships and expansion strategies as we watched e-commerce emerge as the primary sales channel while brick and mortar stores saw unimpressive growth.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Deliverr grew its gross merchandise value “significantly” year over year and is poised to power over $2.5 billion by the end of the year. It also grew its warehouse and carrier network to provide one-day fulfillment services to the largest metropolitan areas — and the company touts that half of the U.S. population lives within 100 miles of a Deliverr network.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company also saw growth in the number and diversity of its merchant base while also doubling the size of its team and opening offices around the world.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/ecommerce-fulfillment-service-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global e-commerce fulfillment services market</a> is expected to be valued at $86.4 billion by the end of the year and is poised to nearly double to $168.7 billion by 2028. With consumers expecting faster and more reliable shipping methods, Deliverr is well-positioned to capitalize on those expectations and global supply chain constraints, Abbott said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">E-commerce fulfillment is certainly having a moment, with capital pouring into companies all over the world. For example, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/e-commerce-logistics-startup-hive-buzzes-following-34m-investment/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hive</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/fabric-200-million-robotics-fulfillment-e-commerce/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fabric</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/18/nigerias-sendbox-raises-1-8m-to-provide-e-commerce-fulfilment-for-small-merchants/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sendbox</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/31/shipblu-bags-2-4m-for-its-e-commerce-and-fulfilment-service-in-egypt/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ShipBlu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were some of the latest to announce funding within the past few months. </span>For Deliverr’s latest investment, new investor Tiger Global is taking the lead, joined by existing investors 8VC, Activant, GLP, Brookfield Technology Partners and Coatue.</p>
<p>Having raised funds earlier in the year, Abbott said the company was already “well funded,” but saw increased interest from investors and thought Tiger was “an exceptional investor and partner” and “has an incredible track record on identifying promising companies, partnering with them and ultimately building exceptional iconic enterprises,” Abbott said.</p>
<p>The new capital will enable the company to continue improving on its technology and product development, invest in adding more employees and expand its next-day capabilities.</p>
<p>“That’s ultimately what drives conversion and great customer experiences,” Abbott added. “We will also invest in building new capabilities, like returns, prep, LOT tracking, and temperature control so that Deliverr is the easiest-to-use fulfillment service out there for brands.”</p>
<p>John Curtius, partner at Tiger Global, said in a written statement that “Deliverr is well-positioned to lead the ecommerce fulfillment space as several market forces converge.”</p>
<p>&#8220;No other company, at the cutting-edge of fulfillment infrastructure and technology, will be able to solve for logistics chain disruptions, offer merchants next-day delivery, and save merchant money — all at the same time,” he added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nigeria-based Mobility-as-a-Service platform Treepz (formerly Plentywaka) has acquired Ugabus, a Ugandan bus company that aggregates inter-city bus operators. While the terms of the deal were not disclosed, Onyeka Akumah, CEO and co-founder of Treepz, told TechCrunch that the acquisition was funded with a recent $1.5 million raise that acted as an extension to a previous seed round.</p>
<p>The seed extension, which came from new investors including Japan-based Uncovered Fund, Dubai-based Blanford Capital and Jonomi Capital and Egypt-based Jedar Capital, adds onto an August <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/mobility-startup-plentywaka-picks-up-1-5m-seed-acquires-ghanas-stabus/">raise of $1.3 million</a>, funding Treepz used to purchase Stabus, a Ghanian bus company, to fund its expansion plans across the continent. Treepz is closing the seed round at $2.8 million.</p>
<p>The acquisition, which will see Treepz fully acquire all of Ugabus&#8217;s operations and staff, marks Treepz&#8217;s first entry into the East African market. Ugabus, which will be renamed Treepz Uganda on December 1, currently has 70% of all the country&#8217;s bus operators on its platform, which includes around 50,000 customers that use the service to travel between cities in Uganda, according to Treepz.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237734" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ll be able to service most of the major cities in Uganda, but the good thing about East Africa is they have very seamless borders between the countries, so it&#8217;s easy to move from Uganda to Rwanda, Uganda to Tanzania, Tanzania to Burundi, and so forth,&#8221; Akumah told TechCrunch. &#8220;The plan is to extend into Tanzania and Burundi first. Those are places we will pay attention to next year. We are also really interested in Ethiopia. So the same thing we were doing with Ghana, across Ghana to Togo and Benin from Nigeria for the West African region. So next year, we will consolidate on our positions on East Africa and West Africa and start collapsing into on in Sub Saharan Africa.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>In Lagos, Treepz&#8217;s hometown, the startup&#8217;s business model consists of three verticals. The main service, &#8220;Daily Treepz,&#8221; is like Uber for minivans and buses. It offers riders in a city fixed daily routes from bus stop to bus stop, allowing them to reserve seats using the app and pay via a digital wallet system. &#8220;Travel Treepz&#8221; is the startup&#8217;s intercity bus service, which allows Treepz to act as an aggregator for other bus companies, similar to what Ugabus&#8217;s model is. Finally, Treepz has recently introduced corporate bookings, providing transportation services for businesses.</p>
<p>When Treepz Uganda launches this week, it&#8217;ll start with intercity and corporate services.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We will look at the opportunity of doing Daily Treepz there in the future, but for now it&#8217;s easier for us to launch there with what we already have and what the team is already used to,&#8221; said Akumah. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Intracity trips account for the majority of Treepz customers, said Akumah, because it&#8217;s a daily service that people use twice a day, five days per week, spending an average of $2 to $3 everyday commuting.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Bus operators are starting to see us as a technology partner against competition,&#8221; said Akumah. &#8220;The Treepz technology as an inventory management system can now be used by the bus operators to power their different systems. And that in turn, turns out to be a tremendous opportunity for growth for us. So we see a future where as we aggregate bus operators for city to city, and we also work with bus operators within cities. It just grows the numbers over time around the transactions that happen on our platform.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>In addition to the seed funding, Treepz also recently received funds from Google&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/google-sets-up-50m-fund-to-invest-in-african-startups/">African Investment Fund</a>, which the startup will use to aggressively expand its on-demand ride-sharing and intercity bus ticketing services in Africa. The company had previously outlined plans to expand as far as Toronto, where Treepz has backing after being <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/nigerias-plentywaka-gets-backing-from-techstars-plans-expansion-to-canada/">accepted into Techstars Toronto</a>, but is focusing instead on helping digitize and modernize the African transportation ecosystem.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Treepz is building the most important mobility infrastructure in Africa&#8217;s megacities,&#8221; said Takuma Terakubo, CEO and general partner of Uncovered Fund, in a statement. &#8220;The development of public transportation is essential in African countries where urbanization is advancing.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based <a href="https://jina.ai/">Jina.ai</a>, an open-source startup that uses <a href="https://docs.jina.ai/get-started/neural-search/">neural search</a> to help its users find information in their unstructured data (including videos and images), today announced that it has raised a $30 million Series A funding round led by Canaan Partners. New investor Mango Capital, as well as existing investors GGV Capital, SAP.iO and Yunqi Partners also participated in this round, which brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $39 million to date.</p>
<p>Jina.ai CEO and co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hxiao87/?originalSubdomain=de">Han Xiao</a>, who co-founded the company together with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nanwang28/">Nan Wang</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/binghexuanbin/">Bing He</a>, explained that the idea behind neural search is to use deep learning neural networks to go beyond traditional keyword-based search tools. Making use of relatively new machine learning technologies like <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/transfer-learning-for-deep-learning/">transfer learning</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_learning">representation learning</a>, the company&#8217;s core Jina framework can help developers quickly build search tools for their specific use cases.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given an image, audio, video or whatever &#8212; we first use deep neural networks to translate this data format into a universal representation,&#8221; Xiao explained. &#8220;In this case, it&#8217;s mostly a mathematic vector &#8212; 100-dimensional vectors. And then, the matching [algorithm] does not count how many letters match but counts the mathematical distance, the vector distance between these two vectors. In this way, you can basically use this kind of methodology to solve all kinds of data search problems or relevance problems.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237709" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Xiao described Jina as akin to TensorFlow for search (with <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> being Google&#8217;s open-source machine learning framework). Just like TensorFlow or PyTorch defined the design pattern of how people design AI systems, Jina wants to define how people build neural search systems &#8212; and become the de-facto standard for doing so in the process.</p>
<p>But Jina is only one of the company&#8217;s current set of products. It also offers the <a href="https://hub.jina.ai/">Jina Hub</a>, a marketplace that allows developers to share and discover the building blocks for Jina-based neural search applications, as well as the <a href="https://jina.ai/blog/introducing-finetuner/">recently</a> launched <a href="https://github.com/jina-ai/finetuner">Finetuner</a>, a tool for fine-tuning any deep neural network.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last 18 months, we spent a lot of effort on building the core infrastructure, on building the foundation of this big neural search tower &#8212; and that part is already done,&#8221; Xiao said. &#8220;And now we are slowly building the first floor, the second floor of this big building &#8212; and we try to provide an end-to-end development experience.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2237716" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-21-165941.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237716" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2237716" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-21-165941.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="352" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-21-165941.jpg 1094w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-21-165941.jpg?resize=150,52 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-21-165941.jpg?resize=300,103 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-21-165941.jpg?resize=768,264 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-21-165941.jpg?resize=680,234 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-2021-11-21-165941.jpg?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2237716" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jina.ai</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company says the Jina AI developer community currently counts about 1,000 users, with applications that range from a video game developer who use it to auto-fill relevant game assets in the right-click many of its game editor to a legal-tech startup that uses it to enable its chatbot to provide a Q&amp;A experience that draws on data from PDF documents.</p>
<p>The open-source Jina framework already has almost 200 external contributors since its launch in May 2020 and the company also hosts an active Slack community around the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reasons we are doing open source is mostly because of the velocity of open source &#8212; and I believe the velocity of the development is a key factor for the success of a software project. A lot of software just dies because this velocity goes to zero,&#8221; Xiao said. &#8220;We are building the community and we are leveraging the community to gather feedback to iterate fast. And this is super important for infrastructure software like us. we are building the community. And we are leveraging the community to gather feedback to fast iterate. And this is super important for infrastructure software like us. You need all these top-tier developers to give your feedback about the usability, accessibility and so on in order to improve it quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jina.ai plans to use the new funding to double its team and especially to expand its operations in North America. With this expanded team, the company plans to invest in R&amp;D to expand the overall Jina ecosystem and launch new tools and services around it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Traditional search systems built for textual data don’t work in a world brimming with images, video, and other multimedia. Jina AI is moving companies from black and white into color, unlocking unstructured data in a way that’s fast, scalable, and data-agnostic,&#8221; said Canaan Partners&#8217; Joydeep Bhattacharyya. &#8220;The early applications of its open-source framework already show glimmers of the future, with neural search underpinning opportunities to improve decision-making, refine operations and even create new revenue streams.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On October 3, <span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><a href="https://twitter.com/bbnaija?lang=ca"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Big Brother Naija</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” a reality show sponsored by Nigerian social payments company Abeg, came to a rapturous close after 72 days on air</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The show, which commenced on July 24, is the most popular and most-watched reality show in Africa, raking in impressive numbers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> money and viewership</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The “Big Brother” franchise, started in the Netherlands, has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been duplicated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worldwide, including Nigeria, where pay-TV company MultiChoice Nigeria organizes it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237469" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It features a group of people who live together in a huge house, detached from the outside world but watched via television cameras</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent season of “Big Brother Naija” was the sixth since launching in 2006. In its fifth season, the show’s organizers claimed that viewers cast a whopping 900 million votes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With millions of eyeballs tuned in to watch the show daily, it is only fitting that companies looking to appear before viewers have to pay a premium</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to some sources, it costs $2 million to become a headline sponsor of the drama show, and Abeg, the latest one, is the newest beneficiary of the kind of blitzscaling growth “BBN” provides</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><b>A new generation fintech app with some drama</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abeg </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020 by</span><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/dare-adekoya-0457b2105"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Dare Adekoya</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/muheez-akanni-70106a182"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Muheez Akanni</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/patriciaadoga"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Patricia Adoga</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/eniola-ajayi-bembe-6443011b1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Eniola Ajayi-Bembe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Its name is a wordplay on popular Nigerian slang </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">abeg</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which means to ask or beg for something.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform</span><a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/09/30/abeg-africa-cash-app/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> launched in September</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of that year with a Cash App-esque play: By leveraging a wallet-based system, Abeg allows users to request and send money to each other with tags</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what started as a couple of Gen Zs trying out cool stuff outside Nigeria’s traditional payments space </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> turned into a company looking to scale after gaining 5,000 users in its first few weeks with zero marketing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And for the next few weeks, Abeg won more users. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, coming into 2021, the hype around the app &#8212; especially on Twitter, where it gained fame &#8212; died down. To many, it seemed like the app was marching toward a slow death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, it came as a surprise when in April, MultiChoice announced the startup as the show’s headline sponsor before the sixth season began months later</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How did the six-month-old startup, which at the time had not disclosed any fundraising and seemed to be struggling, manage to sponsor a show that cost $2 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? That was the question on the lips of many observers. And they came up with some theories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, TechCrunch got some answers in a call with the startup’s founders. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Before the Big Brother show, we had already raised a pre-seed round from local investors,” CEO Adekoya said on the call</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He said the team used a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the undisclosed pre-seed round to sponsor the show.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this revelation, the answer appeared to be in the fine print of</span><a href="https://africamagic.dstv.com/show/big-brother-naija/news/multichoice-unveils-abeg-as-s6-headline-sponsor-bbnaija/news"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> MultiChoice’s announcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> back in April, which identified Abeg as “a product of leading financial technological company Piggytech Global Limited</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/1624392D:NL"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Piggytech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the parent company of</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/31/nigerias-piggybank-ng-raises-1-1m-announces-group-investment-product/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> PiggyVest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Nigeria’s most popular savings app and one of the country’s most valued fintech startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multichoice&#8217;s announcement suggests that Abeg </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was acquired by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Piggytech even before the show started (according to people familiar with the matter, this happened in late 2020), and some sources say Piggytech paid the “BBN” sponsorship money for Abeg</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Abeg CEO dismissed this report, it seems like a more logical assertion because rarely would you see a pre-seed stage startup with a few thousand users raise money and earmark a marketing budget of $2 million only to spend it at one go</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2237753" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237753" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2237753" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/9DB94B85-95E4-4158-9DA6-E3337F48B2C4.jpeg?w=680" alt="Abeg" width="680" height="506" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/9DB94B85-95E4-4158-9DA6-E3337F48B2C4.jpeg 1170w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/9DB94B85-95E4-4158-9DA6-E3337F48B2C4.jpeg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/9DB94B85-95E4-4158-9DA6-E3337F48B2C4.jpeg?resize=300,223 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/9DB94B85-95E4-4158-9DA6-E3337F48B2C4.jpeg?resize=768,571 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/9DB94B85-95E4-4158-9DA6-E3337F48B2C4.jpeg?resize=680,506 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/9DB94B85-95E4-4158-9DA6-E3337F48B2C4.jpeg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2237753" class="wp-caption-text">Abeg founders.</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abeg’s acquisition by its parent company has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been shrouded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in secrecy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it has also been glaring for months to many people &#8212; particularly Nigerian tech Twitter where the handles of Abeg and PiggyVest </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regularly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> exchange banter on the social media app</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this, Piggytech and its subsidiaries have neither </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">publicly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> refuted nor confirmed their relationship until now</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We [Abeg and PiggyVest] are more or less under the same parent company; so, like sister companies and subsidiaries of Piggytech,” CTO Akanni said in the call</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The relationship has also produced some drama. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, Nigerian tech Twitter was abuzz about a young startup that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regrettably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> relinquished most of its ownership to a big company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It didn’t take long to know the companies involved. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was more speculation on how this contributed to the ousting of</span><a href="https://www.benjamindada.com/tag/under-the-hoodie/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Michael “Trojan” Okoh</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the ex-CTO Abeg brought on to build out the app’s first version late last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some sources told me that Okoh left because of ownership dynamics in which Piggytech allegedly bullied its way into acquiring Abeg</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. TechCrunch reached out to Piggytech and Okoh, but they declined to comment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the call with Abeg founders, though, Akanni denied the reports saying, “You can see it as how someone would leave the company usually and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unusually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It wasn’t because of a ‘PiggyTech takeover’ &#8212; it was because of other reasons we won’t like to disclose.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since both camps moved past this drama, Okoh has launched Thepeer, a Nigeria fintech company where he is chief technology officer, while Abeg numbers have boomed courtesy of “BBN</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<h2><b>The Big Brother impact and what next?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abeg isn’t the first tech startup to sponsor the reality TV show;</span><a href="https://technext.ng/2021/07/06/bbn-sponsorship-is-nigerian-tech-companies-new-path-to-massive-market-adoption/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> other tech companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have done so in the past. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They include now-defunct e-commerce company PayPorte; betting companies Betway and Bet9ja; and fintechs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/kuda-the-african-challenger-bank-raises-55m-at-a-500m-valuation/">Kuda</a>, Patricia and unicorn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Flutterwave</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each of them reported astronomical growth following the season finale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the perfect blueprint for Abeg to copy. And it did, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">masterfully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entering into the show with a new design, a relaunched app and over 20,000 users, Abeg claims it now has almost 2 million users</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“‘Big Brother’ is like a large billboard in Africa where brands can &#8230; advertise and promote their products. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as Abeg, we are trying to infuse culture, lifestyle into the app, because payments is part of people’s lives,” COO Adoga said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So it’s pretty much worked for us because we’re trying to &#8230; promote and introduce the brand to the market and [tell] people what we’re about and what Abeg </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is supposed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Abeg launched last year, its best use case for social payments was to let users run giveaway campaigns</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giveaways on the app became more prominent during the Big Brother show as celebrities and influencers (sponsored by Abeg) used the app to send money to their fans</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relying on such a model is unsustainable. Users enjoyed using the app for giveaways on version 1.0, but it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">surely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> wasn’t enough for user retention. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that Abeg has acquired more users and grown 100x, retention will become more critical than ever in version 2.0</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Abeg team knows this and is exploring more specific use cases with Piggytech’s backing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We went the giveaway route </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to attract a lot of signups, which worked, and for people to reserve their usernames and get around with the app,” Adekoya said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Moving forward, Abeg will be your go-to payment app for anything you want to pay for.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why Patronize, also known as “Abeg for businesses” was launched. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform, another Piggytech subsidiary as confirmed by the company to TechCrunch, is a Square-esque product for Nigerian small and medium businesses to accept payments from customers using the Abeg app</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Square, Patronize provides tools to help businesses grow, manage and reward their customers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Unlike Square, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">however</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Patronize is void of cards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its own smart point-of-sale devices, Abeg is trying to disrupt POS machines in retail shops and stores and bank transfers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Granted, these are two tough propositions, but Abeg is right to think there’s opportunity. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While fund transfers in Nigeria are instant with the help of the Nigeria Interbank Settlement System (NIBSS) as the infrastructure behind it,</span><a href="https://www.thecable.ng/failed-transactions-banks-have-refunded-n89bn-to-customers-in-nine-years-says-cbn"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> failed transactions and downtimes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are still common occurrences</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abeg, with its wallet system, provides a unique channel to make payments which, according to the company, has a 99.9% uptime</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abeg is banking that customers will see it as an alternative when they feel dissatisfied with traditional payments and become the go-to platform to pay for a movie, food, event or drugs from pharmacies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will all these be enough to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">retain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> users? It’s not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">entirely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> certain because one would still need to use the bank transfers to fund an Abeg wallet. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And some users I have spoken with about the product don’t see why they should make transfers into their Abeg wallets every time to make payments when they could also transfer money to the recipient’s bank</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are issues Abeg needs to address to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">retain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its millions of users. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way it plans to do this is via direct integration with PiggyVest so users from the savings app can fund their Abeg wallets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s the play here? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So PiggyVest reportedly paid out ₦250 billion (~$500 million) into its users’ bank accounts so far at their last email to them this month</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. That’s a lot of money. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And since an Abeg wallet can perform some functions of a traditional bank account like transfers, bill payments or buying tickets, PiggyVest is telling its users, “why don’t we use your Abeg wallets as your default withdrawal vault instead of your bank accounts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some users will likely find this inconvenient. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And sources tell me that Abeg might begin to allow users to earn interest on money sitting in their wallets in a bid to appease them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these features, Abeg’s strategy is to leverage the pull and success of its “sister company” to achieve stickiness and, at the same time, bring into fruition the financial ecosystem Piggytech is building to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">retain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> float</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Outside that, Abeg is going big on social gatherings, sponsoring entertainment events and musical shows of Grammy-award winning artists such as Wizkid and Burna Boy to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more users this upcoming holiday season</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the influx of</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/african-startups-join-global-funding-boom-as-fintech-shines/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> venture capital into the Nigerian fintech space</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the market </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is crowded</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with platforms housing comparable features such as buying airtime, paying utility bills, making transfers and savings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abeg claims to be different because its users won’t experience slow payments and high transaction costs which exist on other platforms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though this pitch remains lost on some people, Piggytech believes Patronize will do the trick in changing their opinions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The business-focused platform is also on a user acquisition spree, onboarding tens and hundreds of merchants with smart POS devices to cater to the millions of users acquired by Abeg</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The dollar is mostly green, but in the hands of <a href="https://kompas.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kompas</a>, so are kroner, euros and shekels. The firm has an Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Tel Aviv presence, and now has a $160 million sack of funds to deploy across its focus areas: sustainability and technological innovation in the construction, real estate and manufacturing industries. The new fund in particular wants to take early-stage companies under its waxy golden wings, with check sizes ranging from $1 million-$5 million.</p>
<p>The fund will be managed by partners Sebastian Peck and Talia Rafaeli, and has aspirations to back breakthrough innovations that accelerate the adoption of digital technology and industrial automation in the real estate, construction and manufacturing sectors. It especially wants to reduce waste and CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>The fund strategy is driven by increasing regulatory pressure to reduce CO2 emissions, and the emerging desire for a greener built environment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237158" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Kompas&#8217; managers have a recent past in corporate VC on the automotive side; an industry that has also seen huge shifts in its desire for pastures greener. Sebastian Peck previously headed up the corporate VC arm for Jaguar Land Rover, while Talia Rafaeli led investments on behalf of Porsche’s VC arm in Europe and Israel.</p>
<p>The fund wants to explore startups that fall in one of three buckets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smart, sustainable and healthy homes</strong> &#8212; advanced materials, smart home technology, IoT and climate technology.</li>
<li>Business model and service innovation in <strong>real estate and construction</strong> &#8212; solutions for lifecycle asset optimisation, architecture and building design, construction methods and improving customer experience</li>
<li><strong>The digital enterprise</strong> &#8212; industrial automation, digital supply chain management, cybersecurity, enterprise software and the circular economy.</li>
</ul>

<p>&#8220;Tackling the existential threat of climate change requires us to think differently how we design and build our future cities, commercial buildings and residential homes,&#8221; says Sebastian Peck. &#8220;Today, 39% of the global CO2 is emitted by the building sector and 30% of the waste generated in Europe stems from construction and demolition. To meet its environmental obligations, the sector needs to change radically, which represents tremendous opportunity for technological innovation and new business models,” he adds. “Our goal is to deliver top quartile financial returns by backing founders who will have a real impact on our industry.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Venture capital plays a critical role in funding the development of breakthrough solutions to mitigate the climate impact of modern industry and underpin more sustainable business practices,&#8221; says Talia Rafaeli. &#8220;We are incredibly excited to embark on this journey, and back the ambitious founders that will bring about this change.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://lydia-app.com">Lydia</a> is entering a whole new category by adding trading to its financial super app later this year. The company is partnering with <a href="https://www.bitpanda.com/en">Bitpanda</a> for this feature. Lydia users will be able to buy, hold and sell American and European shares, precious metals, cryptocurrencies and ETFs.</p>
<p>Lydia started as a peer-to-peer payment app that lets you send and receive money instantly from a mobile app. It has added more features over time, such as debit cards, IBANs, money pools, cashback, donations, personal loans, etc.</p>
<p>Like Venmo or Cash App in the U.S., the company attracts new users with peer-to-peer payments and then exposes them to more features and financial products that they can access directly from the app. And it’s been working well as Lydia now has 5.5 million users.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237161" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A few months ago, Lydia introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/lydia-partners-with-cashbee-to-add-savings-accounts/">savings accounts</a> powered by Cashbee. It’s a good old fixed-rate savings account that offers 0.6% in interests. It’s not much, but it’s better than leaving it on your main Lydia account.</p>
<p>And yet, the feature has been working well. On average, users who open a savings account in Lydia put thousands of euros on that account. The next logical step is trading, which introduces more risks but better potential returns.</p>
<p>“If you want to buy assets right now, it’s too complicated,” Lydia co-founder and CEO Cyril Chiche told me. “Even just accessing those markets is complicated. It takes you several days to register and verify your account. After that, you have to send money. And then, there are minimum amounts.”</p>
<p>With Lydia’s trading feature, creating a trading account takes just a few taps in the app. You don’t have to send a photo of your passport again, you don’t have to create a new account with a separate password. You can trade 24/7, which means that you can convert shares to cash and spend it with a Lydia card in just a few taps — there&#8217;s no need to plan ahead because money arrives on your Lydia account instantly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After that, you can buy your first share — or fraction of a share — for as little as €1. Lydia and Bitpanda offer fractional shares in French, European and American companies. You can buy precious metals, such as gold, platinum, silver and palladium. You can invest in bitcoin, Ethereum and <a href="https://www.bitpanda.com/en/prices/cryptocurrencies">dozens of other crypto assets</a> — it&#8217;s worth noting that Bitpanda started as a crypto trading company. Finally, you can also access trackers (ETFs).</p>
<p>Essentially, if there’s an asset that is accessible through a Bitpanda account, you can also access it through your Lydia account. Fees are the same on Lydia and Bitpanda. There are no fees involved with fractional shares but there are <a href="https://support.bitpanda.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000902525-What-fees-and-premiums-can-I-expect-to-pay-on-Bitpanda-">some fees</a> for cryptocurrencies and precious metals.</p>
<p>“We met with a lot of potential partners and we realized that we had a lot of things in common [with Bitpanda],” Chiche said. It&#8217;s a win-win partnership as Bitpanda can also use Lydia as a way to promote <a href="https://www.bitpanda.com/en/whitelabel">its white-label service</a> and integrate trading in other apps. Both companies have agreed to share revenue that comes from Lydia users taking advantage of the trading feature.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ByteDance is shutting down its edtech business in India, the company informed the local team on Monday, according to two sources directly familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>The decision follows weeks-long discussion in which the company also explored migrating India team to work with the European edtech team, sources said, requesting anonymity as they are not authorized to speak with the press. Most of the employees, if not all, are being let go, one of the sources said. The edtech division employed over three dozen people in India.</p>
<p>Even as ByteDance&#8217;s marquee offering, TikTok, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">banned in India last year</a>, at least two of its businesses &#8212; Snapsolve, the education learning app, and music streaming service Resso &#8212; have remained operational in the country. ByteDance, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/bytedance-to-cut-jobs-in-india-amid-tiktok-ban/">cut down much of its India workforce last year</a>, continues to employ people for the music and edtech businesses in the country.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237743" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But both the verticals have stayed low-key in the country and employees have been advised to not talk about the businesses publicly, according to many familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>SnapSolve, which competes with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/james-murdoch-lupa-systems-leads-31-million-funding-in-india-doubtnut/">Doubtnut,</a> helps students in grade six through 12 find solutions of math problems by taking and uploading pictures of them. Doubtnut counts Sequoia Capital India and James Murdoch&#8217;s Lupa Systems among its backers.</p>
<p>ByteDance, which posted several new roles for its India edtech business as recently as last month, didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/drDlDg-5jMA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>Nowhere is the mess we’re in more volatile than the media war on its rationale for economic survival. As broadcast television gives way to cable and now subscription television, the news networks are caught in a market crash. Trump’s loss in the election and social excommunication has made it super hard for the 3 main cable news channels to make a living. In turn that has rippled through the news economy and put pressure on the difference between the old nightly news hosts and the new landscape.</p>
<p>Mobile phones have made it easier to wait for notifications of breaking news than climb on the hourly analysis model that endlessly recycles the same talking heads we’ve already abandoned. Many of those experts have morphed into the Trump bookstakes, where old breaking news about January 6th and the 2020 election is carved up into soundbites and graphics, and then debated by the roundtables. Fox remains the ratings leader as MSNBC passes CNN, but overall viewership is down massively. MSNBC’s star Rachel Maddow made news recently by negotiating with the network to cut her daily show back to a weekly show and focus more on long-form programming with podcasts and books or even events. While her new deal seems to continue her daily shows for at least the next year, the handwriting is on the wall for the entire structure of hosts and anchors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237726" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It was therefore not coincidental when Brian Williams announced he’s leaving NBC for greener or perhaps techier pastures. We’ve talked about the news restructuring on the Gillmor Gang, so Frank Radice and I took the opportunity to record a Clubhouse conversation about Williams and his move. Frank has known and worked with Brian for some thirty years, first at WCBS and then at NBC, where Williams was the anchor of the NBC Nightly News half hour broadcast. After a scandal involving his description of being under fire in a helicopter that turned out to be at best an exaggeration, he was removed from the show for a six month unpaid leave.</p>
<p>Eventually, he resuscitated his career as a breaking news anchor on MSNBC and started a nightly 11th hour show just outside prime time that drew good ratings and a highly paid grandfathering of his multimillion network salary.“At 11:00 East Coast and and obviously 8:00 right in the middle of dinner on the West Coast,” observes Radice, “there was a huge financial problem for MSNBC, especially under a new sort of tight fisted leader.” Something had to give. The Maddow negotiations took some considerable money off the table, and Williams’ ratings seemed to be less of a huge priority for the network. My guess is that Williams was not given much of a choice; he thought he might be able to do better in the news climate of streaming and tech replatforming Maddow is exploring.</p>
<p>“What I would do if I were Brian,” says Radice, “because he’s not old, but he is in terms of what people are buying online and on television and on the air these days. It seems like they’re not buying experience, they’re buying some kind of cultural thing. He has to remain culturally relevant. I would go to CNN Plus and go back to work with Jeff Zucker and and actually own news online.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact is that when you lose in the news business, certainly in the sort of old boy’s club, which Brian may be the last vestige of, is gone. And you’re in that sort of atmosphere. The idea that somebody would be your godfather is what would be a strong mentor today. And both of the people that were there for him are gone—the chairman of the company, Andy Lack and the president of MSNBC, Phil Griffin,” Frank continues. “And his contract is up at the end of the year. And he’s got a high salary. And there’s a move afoot to change the on air, if not the appearance and look and vibe of, but the structure and content of primetime through late night. So all of those factors added up at the same time. From my perspective, if you’re going to go out, you’ve gone from being on top to being on the bottom to being back sort of on top again, go out sort of on top instead of not the other. The other argument, by the way, against going to CNN is why would he go from the No. two network to the No. three network? I don’t believe that. That’s just looking at the numbers and not really looking at the viable importance of CNN globally.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We ponder Williams’ ability to add a wry sense of humor to the mix, the blend of news and late night talk show storytelling he got in trouble with. Frank pushes back and runs the CBS job up the flagpole one more time: “I can see that he makes a deal with a CBS to replace Norah O&#8217;Donnell and get 4 1-hour specials a year to do that. And that could be valuable to CBS. He comes with a built in audience, it’s over a million people, so you know that that’s valuable. Tom Snyder? He can do that, but I don’t think that anything like that will work in today. Look, it could be… it’s kind of like what we’re doing right now, except one of us is famous and maybe smarter.”</p>
<p>I suggest the only thing I’ve seen in the press about a CBS move is that he’s not interested in that. Frank: When you hear from someone that they’re not inclined to want to do something, that’s probably exactly what they’re inclined to do.</p>

<p>At the major press conferences, which were few and all before noon on Wednesday, the theme of the day centered on sustainability and climate change. It was a mix of greenwashing and actual action.</p>
<p><strong>Hyundai</strong> and <strong>Kia</strong> showed video intros that highlighted how important it is to become environmentally aware, before unveiling their all-electric concept cars and plug-in hybrids. Fisker talked about saving the ocean. Subaru, which has had a longtime commitment to green initiatives and invested quite a bit of money into supporting everything from national parks to animal rescue, also highlighted their continuing support of environmental-friendliness.</p>
<p>While this hasn&#8217;t been uncommon in the past, it&#8217;s important to note that the entire auto industry has dragged its feet in the path to lower emissions, innovating around sustainable manufacturing and sourcing and finding ways to recycle and reuse parts and vehicles that have come to the end of their usable lives. The dire warning that we have just 10 years to reduce the impact that humans have on climate change came up at multiple press conferences at the show.</p>

<p>One of the more interesting reveals this year was the near-production version of the Fisker Ocean, an all-electric SUV with a massive 17.1-inch screen that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/the-all-electric-fisker-ocean-suv-debuts-with-a-rotating-screen-from-foxconn/">can rotate 90 degrees</a> to go from landscape or &#8220;Hollywood Mode&#8221; to vertical.</p>
<p>When in landscape, users can play games and watch videos when the Ocean is parked and charging. Fisker says that it&#8217;s patenting the swiveling screen tech.</p>

<p>The overall theme of this year&#8217;s LA Auto Show was (not surprisingly) the electrification of everything. While there were plenty of ICE-powered vehicles all over the floor, the big news came in the form of battery power.</p>
<p>Everything from the all-electric Nissan Ariya SUV and Toyota bz4x and its twin the Subaru Solterra to one of our favorites, the final variants of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/porsche-takes-the-gts-electric-with-the-taycan-sedan-and-sporty-wagon/">all-electric Porsche Sport Turismo sedan</a> and wagon with their magic roof.</p>

<p>As we enter into the third year of the ongoing pandemic, carmakers are increasingly considering how to keep us from getting sick. Hyundai unveiled the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/hyundais-new-electric-suv-concept-showcases-a-hygienic-lounge-like-interior/">SEVEN SUV concept</a> at the LA Auto Show that offers features like vertical airflow, antibacterial copper and even a UVC sterilizer.</p>

<p>One of the trends that stood out at the LA Auto Show this year was a number of older car bodies on new electric powertrains. While they might not offer the same visceral experience as an internal combustion engine does, they offer a new way to enjoy classic vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Cobera,</strong> an automotive startup, brought a C300, which looked a lot like an old-school Shelby Cobra, to the show this year. But instead of a V8 engine under the hood, the C300 has an all-electric powertrain that the company says can take the C300 from 0-62 mph in 2.7 seconds. The Cobera C300 was designed and built by Composite-Projects, a Hungarian company that specializes in building vehicles and campers. When the car is switched on, a synthetic sound emits from the vehicle, which makes it sound only a little like an old V8.</p>

<p><strong>Electra Meccanica</strong>, an electric carmaker that also brought it&#8217;s three-wheeled Solo cars to the LA Auto Show (more on that below), showed off its eRoadster, looking like a Porsche 356 Speedster electric vehicle, with updated features like air conditioning, power windows and locks, and a modern infotainment system.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t just the small and relatively unknown automakers who brought out the restomods with new powertrains, either. Ford brought it&#8217;s electrified F-100 that appeared at SEMA in early November. The <strong>1978 F-100 Ford Eluminato</strong>r electric restomod features Ford&#8217;s E-crate motor that customers can buy and put into their own vehicles.</p>
<p>The F-100 gets a pair of electric motors at the front and rear and Ford says that the vehicle gets 480 horsepower and 635 ft-lbs of torque. Inside is a new and updated infotainment system with a screen and digital dash too.</p>

<p>There are usually at least a few three-wheeled vehicles at the show, but this year there were more than usual. <strong>Biliti Electric</strong> brought their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/biliti-bets-us-market-is-primed-for-electric-tuk-tuk-deliveries/">electric and solar powered electric tuk tuks</a> that the company says could be used for last-mile delivery by companies like Amazon and Walmart in densely populated cities around the world.</p>
<p>Their GMW Taskman is already in use in places like Europe and Asia and the founder says that they&#8217;ve delivered more than 12 million packages and logged more than 20 million miles.</p>

<p><strong>Electra Meccanica</strong> also brought its Solo vehicles, which the company unveiled back in 2016 to the show as well, and was offering test drives during press days. The company says the small electric cars can do up to 100 miles on a charge and make 82 horsepower and 140 lb-ft of torque with a top speed of 80 mph. It&#8217;s a single seater with cargo space and is designed for short trips or commutes around town. The Solo costs $18,500 and is built in Mesa, Arizona.</p>
<p><strong>Sondors</strong> also brought it&#8217;s three-wheeled electric vehicle, which seats three people and the company says it gets around 100 miles of range. The EV was built after a successful round of crowdfunding of more than $1 million, and it comes with a 33 kWh battery pack, makes 170 horsepower and 323 lb-ft of torque.</p>
<p><strong>Imperium</strong> also brought it&#8217;s three-wheeled electric car called the Sagitta. The vehicle is the largest of the three-wheeled passenger vehicles that made an appearance at the show, with enough space for up to four people. Sagitta didn&#8217;t have any specs on the vehicle yet, though they did say they were taking reservations starting in mid-2022.</p>

<p>Even Barbie had a moment at the LA Auto show where Mattel unveiled a life-size version of the Barbie Extra car. Built on the chassis of a 2021 Fiat 500, the fiberglass body got wild sparkly white paint, a pair of wings for doors and a pet pool in the back.</p>

<p>There were a few vehicles that featured some interesting solar charging options at the show this year. Chinese energy company SPI and Phoenix Motor Inc. launched the EF1-T pickup truck at the LA Auto Show that showed off a retractable solar pick up bed cover that the company said can add as much as 25 to 35 miles of range to the vehicle. Both the EF1-T and the van version, the EF1-V are huge vehicles and clearly still prototypes as the company said that its still taking &#8220;customer input,&#8221; on features and uses.</p>
<p>The company said that the massive bug-like looking EF1-T should get anywhere from 380 to 450 miles of range on a charge and the company is preselling the vehicles now for delivery in 2025. That&#8217;s a long way off in our book.</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">The $1 trillion U.S. infrastructure bill, signed into law by President Joe Biden last week, contains provisions that would tax cryptocurrency trades and yield the U.S. government some <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/how-taxing-crypto-got-changed-by-infrastructure-law-quicktake?sref=gni836kR">$2.8 billion a year</a>.</p>
<p>That is, frankly, not a lot of money.</p>
<p>The issue is that the crypto tax element of the law is not clearly written, and the government risks squashing a burgeoning part of the economy.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237212" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The infrastructure bill says “a brokerage” needs to keep track of these things. But you can enter into a smart contract without a brokerage, so who is responsible for reporting in that case? Would a miner be considered a brokerage?</p>
<p>There’s no question that, on some level, the government is due taxes earned from cryptocurrency trading like any other investment gain &#8212; typically at the time a person liquidates, or like a transfer of property. But the vagueness of the law risks either trading platforms eliminating access for U.S. citizens or simply preventing smaller cryptocurrency investors from joining or remaining in the market.</p>
<p>We’ve seen this before. FATCA, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, caused some financial institutions to block U.S. citizens from using their services because the compliance rules were too burdensome relative to the risk and potential benefit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here are a few scenarios &#8212; some simple and some complex &#8212; that need to be thought through:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you buy a car using bitcoin, the time you use the bitcoin to buy a car would be when you’re taxed. That’s easy enough.</li>
<li>If you go to a crypto exchange and use dollars to buy Ether, it should be easy to figure out how to tax. That’s also a straightforward transaction.</li>
<li>If you transfer your crypto into a smart contract you’re using to hold an NFT that other people buy, things get messy quickly, running the risk of individuals dealing with taxes that have the complexity of a corporate transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>The minimum is $10,000 &#8212; a carryover from the Bank Secrecy Act. Transactions below that amount are not taxed, but $10,000 is a fairly low amount of money to have to deal with a complex tax situation.</p>
<p>The tax reporting for trading platforms and investors may be onerous enough to discourage further investment, which ultimately may make the tax worthless, or at least generate far less revenue than estimated.</p>
<p>And for the IRS, this could be a complex tax to audit. They will need a way to tie identities to these transactions. This is already done on trading platforms like Coinbase, but individual miners typically do not.</p>
<p>What’s somewhat noteworthy about this particular bill is that while tax laws will almost always be problematic initially, they usually get clarified over time. This infrastructure bill seemed to go the opposite direction. Congress started with the impact number ($1.1 trillion) &#8212; and then tried to find ways to generate enough taxes to match the number.</p>
<p>This is unusual in a few ways, but perhaps indicative of our current political climate. Politicians used to start with the specific programs they wanted to fund, then tried to make the cost as small as possible. This time, both parties were fighting to promise a larger number when their party was in power. (Trump, after all, worked on a $2 trillion infrastructure bill, though it was never signed into law.)</p>
<p>It’s a bit of a strange time in the U.S. politically, with mayors from Miami to New York and across the political spectrum offering to take their paychecks in cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, on the national level, there’s no clear guidance on the federal government’s long-term plans.</p>
<p>Ultimately, cryptocurrency is here to stay in one form or another, and the federal government needs to get serious about an approach by talking to experts like economists, academics and cryptocurrency platform developers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the past few weeks a virtual flash mob called the ConstitutionDAO, with thousands of cryptocurrency fans, crowdfunded almost $45 million to buy a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/17/business/crypto-constitution-sothebys.html">copy of the U.S. Constitution</a>. Although they <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/constitutiondaos-bold-crypto-bid-for-us-constitution-falls-short/">lost</a> the auction, they had already spun up a line of sweatshirts, emblazoned with emojis, distributed by the newsletter company <a href="https://twitter.com/ConstitutionDAO/status/1461022725124804615">MorningBrew</a>.</p>

<p>&mdash; Andrew Reed (@andrew__reed) <a href="https://twitter.com/andrew__reed/status/1460416806540111875?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2021</a></p></blockquote><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237278" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>This experiment, which flooded social media with countless memes and calls to join the crowdfund, is just one example of the type of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that are now all the rage in venture capital circles. Much like open source projects like Bitcoin Core, DAO projects involve both volunteer participants and passive followers, often shepherded by paid core contributors. How the project collects money to pay those contributors varies drastically, depending on the project.</p>
<p>Several other DAO projects, including the Andreessen Horowitz-backed <a href="https://a16z.com/2021/10/27/investing-in-friends-with-benefits-a-dao/">Friends with Benefits</a> (FWB) DAO, manage more than $600 million in assets. FWB lead organizer Alex Zhang, a former DJ and events coordinator, took the reins of the lucrative DAO in May 2021 and says the club now has a fellowship program that admits up to 40 scholarship members a quarter. The program is funded for up to three years. (It otherwise costs roughly $8,000 to become a full member.)</p>
<p>People often start DAOs spontaneously, to see if the idea quickly attracts fundraising or fizzles out, and join DAOs for a variety of networking opportunities, including more social ways to experiment with cryptocurrency. Stepping back: Many of these DAOs are essentially crypto-fueled media companies. There’s a ton of overlap between DAOs and (fiat) subscription-funded organizations like <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=9937014477_103073134000&amp;utm_content=514943671439&amp;utm_term=kwd-1126246682084&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwzOqKBhAWEiwArQGwaC4qFGLl2tXX_uAa7s_x-cXhJfaL2T8bs4g9mdhNQTuDrpgsgDvcyBoCTdkQAvD_BwE">The Information</a>, with the main difference being FWB throws parties instead of journalistic events.</p>
<p>In short, FWB is a group of investor friends who pooled funds in September 2020 and invited any Ethereum fan who wanted into their club to buy some tokens. Then they threw exclusive parties for token holders in Miami, Paris, New York and Los Angeles. FWB now includes 2,000 full members, according to Zhang, in addition to a small fleet of fans with cheaper read-only or local-city-only memberships.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We have a whole editorial and content team that creates multimedia assets like zines and are definitely moving into other forms of content. We’re launching a radio station soon where we’ll book different DJs,” Zhang said. “We’re shifting away from the subscription-fee model and moving into asset holding.”</p>
<p>The most famous DAOs include the newsletter DAO project <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/10/think-of-it-as-a-kickstarter-tote-bag-but-much-much-better-dirt-an-entertainment-newsletter-is-funding-itself-with-nfts-not-subscriptions/">Dirt</a>, founded by journalists Daisy Alioto and Kyle Chayka, <a href="https://openorgs.info/">crypto exchange DAOs for the users</a> of tools like Uniswap, plus crypto social clubs like FWB and <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/pleasrdao">PleasrDAO</a>. Art-focused DAOs like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/arts/music/wu-tang-clan-once-upon-a-time-in-shaolin.html">PleasrDAO</a> collect and allocate millions of dollars for amassing art collections that include everything from JPEGs to rare albums.</p>
<p>“We’re writing the playbook as we go,” said PleasrDAO co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/_jamiis">Jamis Johnson</a>, who participated in the original <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/11/sale-of-the-century-the-inside-story-of-ethereums-2014-premine/">Ethereum token sale in 2014</a>. “Total membership is 74 people; as with any DAO, there’s perpetual ebb and flow. We have full-time employees now, dedicated operators. I’d say around five full time. Our primary form of communication is Telegram.”</p>
<p>So far most DAO participants, across different DAOs, rely on companies from Ethereum co-founder <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2019/01/09/insiders-say-consensys-faces-a-hurdle-to-2019-rebound-joe-lubins-grip/">Joe Lubin’s portfolio</a>, including MetaMask, Gitcoin, Gnosis and Infura. MetaMask, in particular, now claims to serve <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/metamask-surpasses-10-million-maus-making-it-the-worlds-leading-non-custodial-crypto-wallet/">10 million monthly active users</a>. And the <a href="https://openorgs.info/">Gitcoin DAO</a> is estimated to have a treasury worth more than $643 million.</p>
<p>As of 2021, a <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fLJvPOvibcCUpJ9ES44_cdoX5Hb7LpDaloGWz5FbUEM/mobilepresent?slide=id.gec41538503_0_399">Gitcoin-sponsored study</a> showed 33% of 422 surveyed DAO participants are earning $1,000-$3,000 a month from DAOs like FWB. Respondents were predominantly young men who were already heavily involved in Ethereum projects before 2020. Even if most DAO participants today appear to be wealthy cryptocurrency fans, that isn’t the movement’s broader goal.</p>
<p>According to FWB investor Li Jin, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/technology/li-jin-youtube-creators.html">The New York Times</a> called the “It Girl” <a href="https://www.atelierventures.co/portfolio">investor</a> behind creator economy companies like Substack, Patreon and crypto blogging platform Mirror, the goal is for DAOs to become “the front door for many new folks coming into crypto.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some institutions are already embracing DAOs by doing business with them. The ConstitutionDAO is placing a bid with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/15/crypto-investors-raising-millions-to-buy-a-copy-of-the-constitution.html">Sotheby&#8217;s</a>, while <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/20/martin-shkrelis-wu-tang-clan-album-now-belongs-to-a-dao/">PleasrDAO</a> purchased its rare <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/united-states-sells-unique-wu-tang-clan-album-forfeited-convicted-hedge-fund-manager">Wu-Tang Clan album</a> directly from the United States Department of Justice. <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/daos-taking-over-wyoming-law-194516224.html#:~:text=In%20light%20of%20this%2C%20the,by%20a%20set%20of%20rules.">Wyoming</a> became the first state to recognize DAOs as a unique legal structure earlier this year, although the application process is still difficult and potentially limiting.</p>
<p>So far, DAO Masters and FWB member David Phelps, founder of the environmentally focused <a href="https://eco.mirror.xyz/zhtmSvJzPvBcWut0IKHQFgP6P3bEuvte3UKZDWZenNU">EcoDAO</a>, said that at least the DAO movement is getting people to donate to charitable causes. The space is indeed full of scholarship programs and <a href="https://twitter.com/PleasrDAO/status/1433482939287756800?s=20">multimillion-dollar donations</a> to various charitable causes.</p>
<p>“If we release an $ECO token, then I’m sure we’ll all be paid out just fine,” Phelps said, referencing his own DAO experiment, which raised <a href="https://twitter.com/divine_economy/status/1454567616123740168">more than $37,000</a> for Indigenous land reform and rainforest reforestation charities so far. “But for the moment, the goal is to create a sustainable economy for artists to support each other and potentially earn lifelong income.”</p>
<p>He added that the DAO movement, as expensive and difficult as it may be to join, has already promoted uplifting values by “tying status to giving, getting people to pay for parties, then redistributing money to causes that are meaningful.”</p>
<p>But the elephant in this gilded room is that nobody, not even Ethereum veterans, knows how members of these multimillion-dollar crypto clubs will pay taxes. Many middle-class participants involved in the DAO movement don&#8217;t realize they are amassing thousands of dollars in tax liabilities.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen a lot of contractors or developers, people who work for DAOs, that are unaware of the tax reporting requirements,” said tax attorney <a href="https://gordonlawltd.com/lawyers/">Andrew Gordon</a> of Gordon Law. “Typically, the business needs to issue a 1099. How do you do that without their Social Security number? There are penalties for not issuing 1099s.”</p>
<p>Plus, Gordon added, dozens of these DAOs pay freelance contributors and operators in their own membership tokens rather than in dollars or ether. Gordon said this means the “onus is on the taxpayer to determine the fair market value” of the tokens. In cases where DAOs automatically gift non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to their members, this may also raise questions about tax liabilities. When tax season rolls around in 2022, if the price of these digital assets plummets, some DAO contributors may be liable for more taxes than they can afford to pay.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2237433,2237435,2237432"]</p>
<p>“We get calls all the time from people who didn’t know the crypto they’ve received is taxable based on the fair market value at the time they received it,” Gordon said. “Where it becomes more complex with NFTs is again, the question of valuation … is the value the floor price or the average market price?”</p>
<p>There are already many young people who can’t afford to join the above-mentioned DAOs mimicking these experiments and launching their own. Such is the case with <a href="https://twitter.com/shannonlitweets">Shannon Li</a>.</p>
<p>She graduated from college in 2018, left a job she hated early on in the pandemic and has been taking coding bootcamps online ever since. She’s now creating her own DAO because she couldn’t afford the membership fees for more popular DAOs, and the free opportunities she applied to never responded. So she is cleverly reducing legal risks by starting without tokens.</p>
<p>“The biggest concern for DAOs is actually legality and lawyer fees,” Li said, saying some DAO <a href="https://tearsheet.co/blockchain-crypto/back-to-the-basics-what-the-secs-new-rules-on-dao-tokens-mean-for-the-industry/#:~:text=In%20a%20ruling%20issued%20Tuesday,of%20the%20federal%20securities%20law.%E2%80%9D">tokens may be regulated as securities</a>. “That&#8217;s a big reason why I want to create a DAO that is service-for-service, instead of service for token-you-can-sell-on-secondary-market.”</p>
<p>Li created <a href="https://twitter.com/w3_crypto">WECrypto DAO</a>, an 80-person Discord server focused on crypto educational content for women. Eventually, her plan is for the DAO to include token-gated group chats and NFT event tickets. For now, in the bootstrapping phase, she’s focused on “learning more about crypto, publishing it for others to find use in, too, and hopefully building relationships over a shared learning journey.”</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what the DAO ecosystem will look like as the movement grows beyond the companies nurtured and supported by Ethereum founders like <a href="https://blog.gnosis.pm/gnosis-portraits-martin-k%C3%B6ppelmann-ceo-co-founder-7953211e079a">Lubin</a> and <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/gnosisSafe/status/1392940211319951362">Vitalik Buterin</a>. (Some people are already starting to implement the same DAO concepts while using blockchains like Bitcoin and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/14/solana-a-blockchain-platform-followed-by-top-crypto-investors-says-its-a-lot-faster-than-ethereum/">Solana</a>.) On the bright side, there are already many efforts to improve the movement’s diversity by DAOs like FWB and the <a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1409890691564544001?lang=en">Index Coop</a>.</p>
<p>“Our community launched a fellowship program with 18,000 tokens to reward artists and creatives and other people that couldn’t afford to join but can apply based on merit,” Zhang said of FWB. “We’re offering universal basic asset ownership. If you’re creating something in this world, you should be able to hold some of that value.”</p>
<p>Even today, the tools these DAOs use are still widely considered experimental. <a href="https://www.awesomepeople.ventures/">Awesome People Ventures</a> founder Julia Lipton, a member of multiple DAOs including <a href="https://party.mirror.xyz/">PartyDAO</a>, said holding millions of dollars worth of digital assets in the widely used Gnosis Safe wallets still “feels risky” and it often takes a “stupid amount of time” to complete the technical side of DAO experiments. In addition to technical difficulties, she said transaction fees can sometimes be prohibitively expensive for middle-class users.</p>
<p>“We have really far to go. The bucket of unknowns is huge, not only for taxes and regulations but in terms of DAOs in general. Everything about that concept of community ownership is still being figured out. We’ve got all these projects A/B testing, experimenting in public,” Lipton said.</p>
<p>That’s why <a href="https://twitter.com/JuliaLipton/status/1440381074354282503">Lipton</a> helped found <a href="https://www.daomasters.xyz/">DAO Masters</a>, crowdfunding hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of ether to help newcomers learn about the opportunities, skills and risks involved with DAOs.</p>
<p>“One of the things I’m most passionate about is value creation being attached to value attribution and distribution.” Lipton said. “How do we create a more fair and equitable system?”</p>
<p>In the end, the alpha insight of this DAO movement may be how much people are willing to pay for a feeling of belonging in the otherwise esoteric metaverse. DAO members are a tribe not a passive audience. And as such, they are willing to pay (in either money or labor) for media and experiences where they feel represented.</p>
<p>As with any crypto trend, this feeling of belonging gets amplified by the hope of getting rich. Several DAO participants, who would only comment on background, emphasized that they were participating in DAOs hoping to network with investors who may someday invest in the participants’ own startup or DAO.</p>
<p>That’s part of the appeal of belonging to a DAO full of the Andreessen Horowitz investor network. Jin is herself an alum of the colossal firm and said she’s been “friends with [FWB founder] <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/codefi/friends-with-benefits-a-new-model-for-social-tokens-on-ethereum/">Trevor McFedries</a> for years.” Zhang also said he was a personal friend of McFedries’ long before being invited to join FWB. DAO members routinely invite their friends to join lucrative employment and investment opportunities. Joining these crypto clubs is, in some ways, comparable to Ivy League fraternities.</p>
<p>On the other hand, FWB investor Jin has been outspoken on <a href="https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1453107707423170568">Twitter</a> and her podcast about aspirations to see universal basic income (UBI) opportunities with more direct ownership by creators. Other DAO experiments like the newsletter <a href="https://air.mirror.xyz/lmV9Dxeos9HvKSu0BKY9pqARK2vAlPXhrNMt68E4GkI">Dirt</a> and the <a href="https://forefront.news/blog/ff-community-incentives">Forefront writers’ program</a> offer a glittering peek at the future potential of DAOs, which reaches beyond rich friends investing in each other’s venture-backed group chats.</p>
<p>Forefront’s ability to <a href="https://forefront.gitbook.io/forefront/incentives/content">pay writers almost $400 per piece</a>, thanks to a growing community with hundreds of paying token holders, is nothing to shake a stick at. Even with tax concerns and Ethereum transaction fees taken into account, that price is still comparable to what some mainstream, traditional outlets pay writers these days. It’s clear that DAO advocates believe they are working toward a more equitable and decentralized media ecosystem. Only time will tell, as compliance models emerge, how risk and responsibility will be distributed across those networks.</p>
<p>“DAOs potentially unlock new ways that the labor market can work and new economic incentives,” Lipton said. “The jury is out on what will happen to community tokens long term, but the concept of community ownership is here to stay.”</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">It may have taken congressional hearings, but America is starting to wake up to the negative effects the unexamined use of technology has on our society &#8212; particularly our young people.</p>
<p>From the Facebook Papers to the ongoing Elizabeth Holmes trial, we’re facing a clear reminder that in the tech industry, there is a pervasive preference for slick marketing over real results. But then why, when it comes to solving big issues, from healthcare to education, are we still so willing to trust Big Tech?</p>
<p>Having moved from corporate America to the tech industry to my current role leading advocacy efforts supporting racial justice in the education space, I’ve seen firsthand the harm in prioritizing flashy promises over real, measured impact and neglecting to engage existing expertise.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236752" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I also know all too well that we need to reimagine our education system &#8212; particularly in the STEM fields &#8212; to effectively prepare our next generation for the world they will inherit. But I’m not sold on the seemingly given fact that the tech industry should be the ones leading this effort. Supporting it? Yes.</p>
<p>With the seemingly exponential demand for individuals who can fill skilled tech jobs, major tech companies have a natural talent-building agenda to increase tech education. This has resulted in high-profile efforts to get coding and computer science education to K-12 students &#8212; from Tim Cook<a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/6/19/15833288/trump-tech-ceos-white-house-apple-amazon"> pressuring</a> the White House to make coding mandatory for school curricula to early investors in Facebook and Dropbox founding <a href="https://code.org/">Code.org</a> to get computer science into public schools. In the past 10 years, <a href="https://hourofcode.com/us/promote/stats">over</a> 100 million students around the world have participated in the <a href="https://hourofcode.com/ca#">Hour of Code</a> and about <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/320354/parents-think-computer-science-education-important.aspx">70%</a> of parents now say it’s important for their children to study computer science.</p>
<p>But we need to be careful not to treat a powerful vision as an accomplishment in itself, such as rewarding Elizabeth Holmes with significant investment dollars as she donned a Steve Jobs turtleneck and accepted accolades for promises yet to be kept.</p>
<p>Right now we have some of the world’s most brilliant tech minds backing “innovative” efforts to boost access to tech education. And yet the populations that stand the most to benefit from new pathways to opportunity are still being left behind. Since 2009, the percentage of women computer science (CS) undergraduates in the U.S. <a href="https://thejournal.com/articles/2020/01/29/has-coding-education-failed-the-kids-it-was-supposed-to-help-most.aspx">declined</a> from 20.7% to 18.7% and African-American CS undergraduates dropped by 3%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Short-term educational interventions &#8212; the orgs creating free online coding modules, mentorship event series or global hackathons &#8212; have been very successful in accumulating private-sector attention and donor investments with eye-catching branding.</p>
<p>But when I was a young student passionate about STEM, while I’m sure I would have enjoyed these engagements immensely, momentary resources did not sustain my journey from initial interest to a master’s degree in mechanical engineering at one of the top institutions in the country.</p>
<p>To accomplish that feat, I needed relatable and accessible educators and professionals who radiated a belief in my potential. It was having a community of peers who could reassure me during challenging periods and validate my frustration when facing constant othering in predominantly white spaces. And then, at minimum, I needed access to a continued and rigorous STEM education and the technical resources to complete assignments.</p>
<p>For communities of color, breaks in the tech pipeline aren’t restricted to access to laptops or the availability of AP computer science courses. With gaps appearing from secondary education to college admissions to hiring practices in tech’s top companies, disjointed interventions are just Band-Aids, even when applied at scale.</p>
<p>If the current scrutiny facing social media giants tells us anything, it&#8217;s that tech doesn’t erase cultural differences or societal problems: It amplifies them. For the tech industry to make a meaningful investment in improving our education system, it needs to heed this lesson and seek to understand not just what’s missing, but how to meaningfully support the existing work underway.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.smash.org/">SMASH</a>, a STEM justice education nonprofit founded in Oakland to close the opportunity gap in tech, 79% of our scholars graduate the program to complete a bachelor’s degree in STEM. Our national average for the same demographic is 39%.</p>
<p>Scholars start with SMASH Academy as they begin their high school academic career. This is our flagship program that provides a multiyear, immersive and culturally relevant STEM education year-round and hires predominantly instructors of color who are trained to offer both technical and career mentorship &#8212; with a focused lens on student voice and choice. These scholars move in cohorts through the pipeline of programs. High school seniors are paired with a college admissions coach and attend essay and financial aid workshops. Once their college admission is locked, students are then placed into paid internships and start building workplace experience with company partners like <a href="https://www.smash.org/corporate-partnerships/raytheon/">Raytheon</a>.</p>
<p>Long-term educational interventions like this are more costly, time-consuming, complex to implement and, ultimately, most effective at actually changing student outcomes.</p>
<p>The good news is that countless community-based organizations across the country have already laid the groundwork to complement the long-term investment and holistic approach that our organization takes.</p>
<p>As long-standing racial and socioeconomic divides in STEM education widen, donors now have a critical role to play. The necessary knowledge and talent are in place to effectuate the change we all know our nation’s future depends on, but we need to redirect available resources to ensure they’re able to deliver the full weight of the results they’re capable of. When determining investments, define and stress test the impact metrics of potential recipients.</p>
<p>What does success look like? How will this program’s benefits be relevant in the next six months versus the next four years? Does this initiative substantively address obstacles inhibiting students of color?</p>
<p>The Tim Cooks and Mark Zuckerbergs of the world have a role to play in all this &#8212; but their biggest impact might actually happen outside of a high school computer lab. If these companies are serious about closing achievement gaps in public education, we need to prioritize tech equity policies and educational programming that offer tangible results and do more than simply create a good narrative.</p>
<p>This not only means sectorwide advocacy but funding education policies and partnering with existing community-based interventions that ensure the over 20 million Black and Latinx students in K-12 public schools are taught culturally relevant computing education and are prepared to materially contribute to a strong, diverse and socially conscious tech workforce.</p>
<p>The future of STEM education won’t become more equitable by placing the newest technologies in every student’s hand or creating a free coding course but by seeing the solutions already before us and acting accordingly. Tech companies driven to help in the education space shouldn’t fall back on bad Silicon Valley habits.</p>
<p>For our youth, we can’t afford to spend time on solutions that sound good on paper but don’t drive real impact. Big Tech leaders, this is not a call out, but a calling in. Let’s talk.</p>

<p><em>This is the second in a pair of articles comparing the impact of the U.S. and Chinese tech crackdowns. Yesterday, Special Series Editor Scott Bade wrote about the geopolitical consequences of each country’s respective approaches. In this piece, Nathan Picarsic and Emily de La Bruyère examine how China’s “techlash” is driven by domestic politics.</em></p>
<p>In November 2020, Chinese regulators abruptly suspended Ant Group’s IPO in Hong Kong and Shanghai. In July 2021, immediately after ride-hailing service Didi went public on the New York Stock Exchange, Chinese authorities announced sweeping investigations into the company, removing 25 of its apps from China’s app stores — and sending share prices plummeting. The next month, Chinese state media attacks <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/asia/news/76978/tencent-stock-falls-60-billion-following-criticism-from-state-media/">slashed</a> Tencent’s valuation by $60 billion.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235439" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>These companies effectively represent China’s PayPal, Uber and Facebook. They constitute the highest-profile targets of the Chinese Communist Party’s crackdown on its domestic Big Tech companies. That crackdown stands to transform the Chinese commercial landscape, and thus has huge implications for the wider world, including the U.S. tech sector.</p>
<p>Yet right now, the CCP’s tech crackdown is being misunderstood. Framed as an effort to cripple the Chinese commercial sector, it is being seen as an anti-monopoly effort <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/01b7c7ca-71ad-4baa-bddf-a4d5e65c5d79">similar</a> to that underway in Washington. Beijing has deliberately encouraged this interpretation, couching its effort in antitrust language that resembles U.S. rhetoric as well as privacy language that echoes that of Europe.<br />

<p>But Beijing’s crackdown is <em>not </em>akin to U.S. antitrust efforts. Beijing is focused not on creating a competitive marketplace, but rather on quashing any challenge to its authoritarian power — in order to strengthen both its domestic control and its standing in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/is-washington-prepared-for-a-geopolitical-tech-race/">geopolitical competition</a>. Beijing is also focused on asserting a new definition of privacy, decidedly unlike that of European regulators; one in which the CCP has private governance over all data. These are the objectives driving China’s techlash.</p>
<p>The goal is to subjugate the domestic Chinese technology landscape to the CCP — and to ensure that the former serves as a vehicle of power projection for the latter. This makes Beijing’s actions the opposite of an anti-monopoly effort. China is reining in its leading tech players in order to support a bigger, more controlling monopoly: the CCP.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Perversely, Washington’s ongoing antitrust push risks playing directly into Beijing’s ambition. Any U.S. break up of Big Tech would exacerbate the asymmetries of scale and centralization that skew today’s tech competition in China’s favor.</p>
<p>The gulf between China’s crackdown and that underway in the United States is evident in the regulatory foundation underpinning Beijing’s latest moves. The CCP’s actions draw on an emerging legal and regulatory architecture for the governance of data — including, most recently, the <a href="https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-protection/chinese-data-laws-and-ambitions-pose-strategic-risks/">Data Security Law</a> (DSL) formally implemented in September. U.S. analyses tend to describe it as a “data privacy law.” However, the DSL does not foster “privacy” the way U.S. conceptions — or the European Union’s GDPR — might interpret the term.</p>
<p>The DSL neither restricts companies’ ability to collect data nor ensures the anonymization of information. Rather, the law restricts their ability to export data outside of China or share it with entities that are not the Chinese government (including, notably, foreign governments). At the same time, the DSL locks in Beijing’s access to companies’ information. In doing so, it provides the CCP domestic control over data.</p>
<p>Under the DSL, private data cannot be bought, sold or shipped at will. It is not private — unless, of course, you consider the CCP to be a member of your inner circle of trust.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.hinrichfoundation.com/research/wp/digital/china-dual-cycle-development-model-and-digital-revolution/">Didi</a> case is instructive. Did’s crime was not collecting user information, but allegedly storing that data outside of China and sharing it with overseas regulators as a part of its IPO process. This is worlds apart from proposals in Washington to introduce sweeping data portability and interoperability requirements aimed at increasing consumer privacy and competition.</p>
<p>As the CCP sees it, information technology is catalyzing a <a href="https://www.nbr.org/publication/the-network-great-power-strategy-a-blueprint-for-chinas-digital-ambitions/">new industrial revolution</a>: the digital revolution. This revolution, which is characterized by data as a <a href="https://www.nbr.org/publication/the-network-great-power-strategy-a-blueprint-for-chinas-digital-ambitions/">new factor of production</a>, will reshape the global system. The player, whether government or industry, that can control the production, distribution and consumption of data will be able to lead that reshaping, in effect claiming global hegemony. The CCP believes this is the path to unmatched Chinese military and economic power — and an unrivaled international surveillance state.</p>
<p>To get there, Beijing has committed to building and internationalizing digital <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/feature/new-metrics-building-geopolitical-power-new-world-143147?page=0%2C1">architectures</a>, including networks like <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/china-as-a-cyber-great-power-beijings-two-voices-in-telecommunications/">5G</a> and the industrial Internet of Things (IoT), as well as platforms like ride-share apps and e-commerce hubs. These systems demand <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/521762-how-big-tech-factors-into-the-us-china-geopolitical-competition">scale</a>: Their integration and growth are to be encouraged. But to deliver competitive returns to China as geopolitical assets, these systems must exist under government control.</p>
<p>So, while China will continue to promote the growth of digital platforms and networks, the CCP will make sure that they do so at Beijing’s behest. Beijing doesn’t want an Apple, Facebook or Google. It wants a super integrated Apple-Facebook-Google that is part and parcel of the CCP.</p>
<p>This approach might manifest in tactical moves that look like antitrust efforts, such as investigations into <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-payment-cenbank/china-plans-tougher-antitrust-rules-for-non-bank-payments-industry-idUSKBN29P15T">AliPay and WeChat</a>. But the operative objective is not increased competition. Rather, Beijing seeks to wrap these players into the larger monopoly that is the CCP. Should, as Didi founder reportedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-didi-co-founder-liu-told-associates-she-plans-leave-sources-2021-09-20/">suggested will happen</a>, the Chinese government take over the company, Didi will become part of a far larger and more pernicious platform than Apple, Facebook or Google.</p>
<p>The U.S. will fail to prevent the relative rise and unrivaled influence of Beijing’s tech champions as long as it assumes Beijing is mirror-imaging the American approach. In fact, the U.S. will facilitate Beijing’s ambitions: The only real, credible alternatives to the CCP’s tech ambitions are firms like Apple, Facebook and Google. But instead of turning to them as critical national assets in waging a determinative economic and geopolitical contest, the United States is focused on kneecapping them. Instead of paying attention to China’s global tech offensive and the domestic agenda that propels it, the United States is fixated on overly broad regulation of its own tech sector.</p>
<p>The CCP’s crackdown on Big Tech is about competition, but not fair competition. It’s about strengthening Beijing’s hand as it competes to shape tomorrow’s world — and make it, for any player that is not the Chinese Communist Party, perfectly unfair. Washington and Silicon Valley have the tools to prevent this: It’s time for U.S. political leaders to engage the U.S. tech ecosystem in a new kind of conversation about regulation. What we need now is competitive strategy informed by geopolitical realities and the importance of the private technology sector to national security.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>subscribe here.</em></a></p>
<p>During the garage-stage and Zoom-room days of a company’s life, fluidity is key to idea creation. The lack of contractual obligations is baked into how we understand the origin stories of the most famous startups. We celebrate rapid pivots, love scrappy MVPs over perfectly polished platforms and pay attention to repeat entrepreneurs who raise money for their next idea, before they even know what it is. You can DM a techie you admire on Twitter for advice that could unlock an entirely different way of building. You can get a press mention that makes you realize you’re onto something. The ability to quickly spin up a team and launch something is clearly the core of what makes startupland so special (and, candidly, fun to write about).</p>
<p>Even though the amorphous beginning of a startup can feel energizing beyond belief, here’s an unpopular opinion: Formality, even when thousands and thousands of people are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/constitutiondaos-bold-crypto-bid-for-us-constitution-falls-short/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">pouring into a Discord server to buy the Constitution</a>, matters. Startups and movements need to establish clear governance because it’s important to set expectations upfront. There’s a difference, both in ownership and weight, between a founder, a founding team member, an adviser, an investor, an angel investor and an early employee.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237462" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As shown by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/12/technology/12facebook.html">Winklevoss twins versus Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/02/snapchat-reggie-brown/">Reggie Brown versus Snapchat</a>, and most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/avi-dorfmans-legal-battle-to-be-named-founding-member-of-compass-has-ended-in-a-settlement/">Avi Dorfman versus Compass</a>, acknowledging people’s roles within companies isn’t semantics, it’s clarifying ambiguity before it turns into anger. In our most recent episode of Equity, I chatted with my co-hosts about the string of lawsuits between ousted founders and the companies they felt a part of, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/co-founder-titles-arent-a-formality-theyre-a-morality/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">why it’s important to have titles</a> before you tout your vision on Clubhouse.</p>
<p>So, what makes a founder, a founder? When does it make sense to escalate a founder dispute into a legal case? What do the Winklevoss twins and Avi Dorfman have in common? And can an entrepreneur claim a co-founder title because their idea seeded a successful business, or do they have to stay at a company long enough to prove that they can take it from thought to execution?</p>
<p>These are the questions that I answer in my TechCrunch+ column: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/20/name-your-job-title-before-you-name-your-startup/"><strong>Name your job title before you name your startup.</strong></a> I interviewed a lawyer who represented the Winklevoss twins and Dorfman. I also interviewed Rent the Runway co-founder Jennifer Fleiss on how to build co-founder relationships, as well as current founders and investors who are drawing these lines in real time.</p>
<p>This is a meta start to the start of the holiday season but what else do you expect? In the rest of this newsletter, we’ll talk about ConstitutionDAO, the Macro and Zillow. As always, you can follow me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">@nmasc_</a> or direct message me on Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/natashathereporter/">@natashathereporter. </a></p>
<h2>A DAO tried to buy the U.S. Constitution this week</h2>

<p>There are 13 surviving copies of the original print of the U.S. Constitution. This past week, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) announced it lost its bid to buy one from art dealer Sotheby’s after a high-stakes bidding war that captured the internet’s attention.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>Despite failure to win the bid, ConstitutionDAO has clearly provided an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/constitutiondaos-bold-crypto-bid-for-us-constitution-falls-short/">on-ramp for swaths of people to understand the impact of a DAO</a>. About 13% of contributors to ConstitutionDAO used ETH for the first time and 44% of people who have contributed had less than 40 transactions to their name.</p>

<p>Sudowrite! And heck, Haje’s story may even win<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/sudowrite-fundraising/"> lede of the year too</a>. As a writer, I always have a bias toward tools and startups that want to bring tech to my artsy profession (for better and, often, for worse). With Sudowrite, though, I enjoyed the feel of a different mission. The tool isn’t meant to replace writers or offer clean sales copy, but instead it’s meant to summarize, expand or “spark the creative juices that are sometimes lacking in the writing process.”</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know, per founder and CEO Amit Gupta:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>We wanted to give you someone who’s almost as good as a human reading partner to bounce ideas off of. Beyond that, I think as we talked to users, especially people in the entertainment industry such as screenwriters, we discovered there was a specific need. They have a lot of rote tasks that they don’t like doing: they might have a screenplay they’ve written and they might need to generate a one-page treatment, a three-page treatment, etc. It’s all very specific industry stuff, but it’s pretty easy for an AI to do. It’s not very creative work, and a tool like Sudowrite saves them hours and hours of the worst kind of work that they have to do. I think there’s a lot of opportunities like that, but the core product is really about inspiration, provocation, helping you stay in flow.</p></blockquote>

<p>On Equity this week, I joined Alex Wilhelm and Ryan Lawler to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/did-zillow-get-high-on-its-own-supply/">unpack Zillow’s exit from the iBuying market.</a> I know that may not sound like the most thrilling news to chat about, but there’s a ton of drama to consider: housing pricing is hard, the accuracy of Zestimates and Opendoor’s fortuitously-timed earnings.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> Having data is never enough of a moat to win in the housing world, especially considering how unpredictable and uncontrollable prices can be. Lawler argues that the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/zillow-ibuying-exit-opendoor-offerpad/">iBuying market is still healthy</a>. That said, the Zillow news is being watched by real estate and proptech startups more broadly, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/caspers-return-to-private-life-isnt-a-canary-for-dtc-companies-going-public/">unlike Casper’s news,</a> could have a notable impact on the sector.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spending in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus.

<h3>Apple responds to story accusing it of buying ads on Google to promote App Store apps</h3>
<p>A story on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2021/11/12/apple-quietly-buying-ads-via-google-for-high-value-subscription-apps-to-capture-app-publisher-revenue/?sh=1861c7701b52" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes</a> this week alleged Apple was being sneaky by purchasing Google ads for high-profile subscription apps on the App Store in order to direct web searchers away from the developers&#8217; websites, where users could purchase commission-free subscriptions, which would reduce Apple&#8217;s cut of App Store revenue. Some companies accused Apple of placing the ads without their consent and said Google wouldn&#8217;t allow them to be deleted.</p>
<p>Apple, which doesn&#8217;t typically respond to reports of this nature, this time <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/15/apple-ads-for-third-party-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came out swinging</a> against these complaints.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company said it does not buy these ads in secret, but rather has been placing ads for over five years and communicates with developers about those ads. In addition, Apple said there&#8217;s nothing nefarious about its doing so. The company explained that retailers generally do buy ads for products they sell. That is, when you search for something like a winter jacket on Google, you&#8217;ll find ads from a variety of retailers selling the coat, in addition to (or instead of) ads placed by the jacket&#8217;s manufacturer. This is how online retail works, and Apple doesn&#8217;t think its ads are any different. Apple said it currently runs ads to promote more than 100 top third-party apps across ad platforms on Google, YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat and Twitter.</p>
<p>Forbes&#8217; report said impacted applications included Babbel, Bumble, HBO, MasterClass, Plenty of Fish and Tinder.</p>
<p>The report may have <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/15/apple-defends-its-ads-for-third-party-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mischaracterized</a> the situation, but it&#8217;s an incredible example of how bad the relationship has become between Apple and its developer community. In previous years, developers would have welcomed free advertising that drove new customers to their apps &#8212; now even that is considered a threat by some. Apple, however, contended the situation represented by the Forbes piece is not how most developers feel.</p>
<h3>Spotify finally gets lyrics</h3>

<p id="speakable-summary">After <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/15/spotify-is-falling-behind-on-lyrics-and-voice/">years</a> of <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/forums/searchpage/tab/message?advanced=false&amp;allow_punctuation=false&amp;q=lyrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ignoring</a> consumer demand for in-app lyrics, particularly in the U.S., Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/spotify-finally-rolls-out-real-time-lyrics-to-global-users/">announced this week</a> it will make a new Lyrics feature available to all global users, both Free and Premium, across platforms. The feature is powered by lyrics provider Musixmatch, and expands on a prior deal Spotify had with the company to offer lyrics to users in India, Latin America and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Last year, Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/in-a-significant-expansion-spotify-to-launch-real-time-lyrics-in-26-markets/">introduced</a> real-time lyrics that sync to the music to users in 26 worldwide markets, after initially testing the feature in 2019. This was the first time 22 of the 26 markets had ever gained any form of lyrics support, the company said at the time. That deal later expanded to 28 markets. Spotify users in Japan have also had access to lyrics through a standalone deal with <a href="https://syncpower.jp/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SyncPower</a>.</p>
<p>But users in other markets have only had access to “Behind the Lyrics,” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/12/spotify-teams-with-genius-to-annotate-music-tracks/">a feature launched in 2016</a> in partnership with Genius which offered lyrics interspersed with trivia about the song, its meaning and the artist, as well as other commentary. Meanwhile, through<a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/forums/searchpage/tab/message?advanced=false&amp;allow_punctuation=false&amp;q=lyrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Spotify’s community feedback forum</a>, thousands of users over the years expressed to the company they would prefer a feature that provided real-time lyrics, instead of lyrics that are interrupted with facts and other background information. Finally, Spotify will sunset Behind the Lyrics and introduce just plain ol&#8217; lyrics, it says.</p>
<p>The feature began rolling out this week to global users and will be available on mobile, desktop and TV. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/spotify-finally-rolls-out-real-time-lyrics-to-global-users/"><strong>More here</strong></a> on TechCrunch.)</p>
<h3><strong>Instagram is killing Threads</strong></h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2075837" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2075837" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2075837" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Status-Tab-Purple.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Status-Tab-Purple.png 6016w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Status-Tab-Purple.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Status-Tab-Purple.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Status-Tab-Purple.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Status-Tab-Purple.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Status-Tab-Purple.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Status-Tab-Purple.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Status-Tab-Purple.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2075837" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram’s standalone messaging app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threads-from-instagram/id1473867767" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Threads</a> is shutting down. The app will no longer be supported by the end of December 2021, TechCrunch confirmed with the company after reports of its impending closure began circulating via social media. Instagram is planning to alert its existing Threads users with an in-app notice beginning on November 23, which will direct them to return to Instagram to message their friends going forward.</p>
<p>Threads was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/instagram-launches-threads-a-close-friends-chat-app-with-auto-status/">introduced</a> in 2019 as a companion app to Instagram shortly after the company shut down its other standalone messaging app, Direct. Instead of focusing solely on the inbox experience, Threads was built as a “camera-first” mobile messager designed to be used for posting status updates and staying in touch with those you designated as your “Close Friends” on Instagram. It later expanded to all users to message everyone, but failed to gain traction.</p>
<p>To date, Threads has seen approximately 13.7 million global installs from across the App Store and Google Play, according to estimates from app intelligence firm Sensor Tower. However, users didn&#8217;t respond well to the app once installed in many cases. The app sports a 3.1-star rating on the App Store where reviews complain about bugs, usability issues, the layout and missing features.</p>
<p>Instagram says shutting the app makes sense as it won&#8217;t have to split its focus between two messaging services and Threads&#8217; features are now being delivered by Instagram&#8217;s main app.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/tiktok-updates-safety-center-resources-following-internal-research-on-harmful-challenges/">updated</a> its Safety Center resources after commissioning research on teens&#8217; interest in harmful viral challenges.</strong> The research offered a lot of data and insights into how teens&#8217; minds work and what can be done, but TikTok&#8217;s response is fairly minimal &#8212; it added resources and changed some language on prompts that appear.</li>
<li><strong>Pinterest </strong><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/pinterest-launches-twotwenty-its-own-in-house-incubator-for-new-projects/">launched</a> its own in-house incubator for new projects, TwoTwenty, to fuel more rapid experimentation at the company</strong> as it attempts to shift to support video and creators. The team already introduced live shopping via Pinterest TV and a virtual creator studio.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook will begin <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/facebook-neighborhoods-to-begin-testing-in-132-cities-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testing</a> its Nextdoor competitor, Facebook Neighborhoods, in 132 U.S. cities.</strong> The feature had been tested in parts of Canada since last year.</li>
<li><strong>Twitter is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791002/twitter-amp-ios-android" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phasing out support for AMP</a> on iOS and Android.</strong> The company quietly dropped support for Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP), saying the feature, which offers fast-loading pages, will be retired by year-end. AMP has proven controversial as a movement headed by Google, as some saw it as an attempt to take over the open web.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Photos</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Waldo brings its ad-free, private photo-sharing service direct to consumers.</strong> The company had been focused for several years on B2B deals with schools, camps, events and other organizations, <a href="https://feedly.com/i/board/content/user/f1a436e4-ebf3-4eb8-8fd3-7b952f75f1dc/tag/applist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but is now expanding</a> to include B2C features on a subscription basis. Its storage plans are pricier than Google Photos or Apple&#8217;s iCloud but include closed-loop commenting and reactions that allow people to have private interactions that are only seen between the photo owner and commenter, and not others in the shared album.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Messaging</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>WhatsApp <a href="https://www.imore.com/whatsapp-rolls-new-profile-privacy-controls-out-iphone-beta-testers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rolled out</a> new profile privacy controls to some of its iOS beta testers via TestFlight.</strong> The controls give users more granular control over different aspects of their profile, including when they were &#8220;last seen,&#8221; their photo, and the &#8220;about&#8221; section. It&#8217;s unclear when the feature will arrive to the public.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Streaming &amp; Entertainment</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clubhouse finally adds live captions on iOS.</strong> The streaming app is catching up with competitors, like Twitter Spaces, by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/18/clubhouse-live-captions-on-ios/">adding support for live captions</a> &#8212; an accessibility feature that allows those who are deaf or hard of hearing to participate in audio apps. The company currently supports 13 languages and says more are on the way. The update follows the app&#8217;s recently added support for asynchronous listening and recorded rooms.</li>
<li><strong>Some of Facebook&#8217;s $1 billion creator fund is being put toward its audio efforts,</strong> reports <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-hands-out-cash-to-creators-to-boost-clubhouse-rival?rc=ajsw4d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Information</a>. The social network is paying creators up to $50,000 to use its Clubhouse rival, Live Audio Rooms, the report claimed.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Gaming</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>U.S. mobile strategy game spending increased 24% year-over-year to reach $4.2 billion,</strong> <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/us-mobile-strategy-4-point-2-billion-revenue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said Sensor Tower.</a> The top Strategy genre game by player spending in the U.S. between November 1, 2020 and October 31, 2021 was Lords Mobile from IGG, which generated $330.3 million. The No. 2 grossing Strategy title was Clash of Clans from Supercell, followed by State of Survival from FunPlus.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Utilities </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Google Maps app was <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/keep-it-chill-holiday-new-tools-google-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated</a> with an &#8220;area busyness&#8221; feature that shows users in real time which parts of town are crowded and busy.</strong> The feature could help people better plan their holiday activities to either avoid the crowds or join the party, depending on their preference. The feature will roll out to iOS and Android. The app also added more data for malls, airports and transit stations, including stores inside airports, car rentals, parking lots and more.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Health &amp; Fitness</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Assistant will soon <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-assistant-will-soon-help-you-book-a-vaccine-slot-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help users in India</a> book vaccination appointments.</strong> The option will roll out in 2022 and will support English, Hindi and other local languages such as Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Bengali, Marathi, Tamil and Telugu.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Travel &amp; Transportation</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Southeast Asian ride-hailing and delivery app Grab <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/grab-app-disruptions-persist-for-second-day-for-some-users?sref=gni836kR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experienced</a> a multi-day outage</strong> impacting users in Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines. The company said an issue with a planned system upgrade had caused the disruptions. While core services were restored after a day, the app continued to have intermittent problems the following day.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Government &amp; Policy</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple and Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/apple-google-get-ico-questions-on-app-age-ratings/">were questioned by the U.K.&#8217;s data protection watchdog</a> over app age ratings</strong> after the digital safety charity 5Rights Foundation raised concerns about non-compliance with the U.K.&#8217;s Age Appropriate Design Code. The group says it found 12 breaches of the Code, including insufficient age checks, mis-advertised minimum ages for games, the use of dark patterns and nudges, data-driven recommendations that create risks for children, a routine failure to enforce community standards, low default privacy settings and more.</li>

<p>Newly launched audio app <a href="https://racket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Racket</a> allows users to tell audio stories, similar, to some extent, with Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/">Soundbites</a> or the friends-focused audio app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/cappuccino-lets-you-share-short-intimate-audio-stories-with-your-friends/">Cappuccino</a>.

Each page features a cover image, tags, a like button (a heart) and a comments section, which will be familiar to the TikTok crowd. Users can also search by tags or just go to the main feed to hear a broader variety of clips.

<p>iOS audio app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/audyo/id1538284473#?platform=iphone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Audyo</a> exited private beta this week to offer users a way to convert web pages into high-quality audio. The idea is to give users an easy tool for saving content from around the web, like news articles, and combine that with other audio content you may already be listening to &#8212; like Audible audiobooks and podcasts (neither of which is yet available, however). But the app isn&#8217;t only meant to serve as a utility &#8212; there&#8217;s a social component as well. Users will be able to share their listens with friends, discover community playlists and, highlight favorite content (including by double tapping the screen or triple-tapping your AirPods).</p>

<p>A new app from the makers of Camera+, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/macro-by-camera/id1577383127" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Macro+</a>, is designed to capitalize consumer interest in up-close photos following the new iPhone&#8217;s support for Macro photography. However, this app is designed to work on any iPhone capable of running iOS 15, the developer says &#8212; which means it&#8217;s not just for those with the latest hardware. Instead, the app helps by outlining the parts of the photo that are in focus, providing a grid for positioning the subject, and it offers a histogram to visualize the brightness of your shot. After snapping the photo, Macro+ will intelligently edit the photos to make subjects look crisp, even if you&#8217;re not a skilled photographer. The Camera+ app includes a similar Macro tool, but the new app is meant for those who want more of a single-purpose tool for their up-close photos or who feel overwhelmed by more professional camera apps and their many options.</p>
