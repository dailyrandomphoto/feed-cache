										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok is expanding its in-app parental controls feature, Family Pairing, with educational <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/guardians-guide/">resources</a> designed to help parents better support their teenage users, the company announced morning. The pairing feature, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/tiktok-to-launch-parental-controls-globally-disable-direct-messaging-for-users-under-16/">launched</a> to global users last year, allows parents of teens aged 13 and older to connect their accounts with the child&#8217;s so the parent can set controls related to screen time use, who the teen can direct message, and more. But the company heard from teens that they also want their voices to be heard when it comes to parents&#8217; involvement in their digital life.</p>
<p>To create the new educational content, TikTok partnered with the online safety nonprofit, <a href="https://www.internetmatters.org/">Internet Matters</a>. The organization developed a set of resources in collaboration with teens that aim to offer parents tips about navigating the TikTok landscape and teenage social media usage in general.</p>
<p>Teens said they want parents to understand the rules they&#8217;re setting when they use features like Family Pairing and they want them to be open to having discussions about the time teens spend online. And while teens don&#8217;t mind when parents set boundaries, they also want to feel they&#8217;ve earned some level of trust from the adults in their life.</p>
<p>The older teens get, the more autonomy they want to have on their own device and social networks, as well. They may even tell mom or dad that they don&#8217;t want them to follow them on a given platform.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the teen is up to no good, the new resources explain to parents. The teens just want to feel like they can hang out with their friends online without being so closely monitored. This has become an important part of the online experience today, in the pandemic era, where many younger people are spending more time at home instead of socializing with friends in real-life or participating in other in-person group activities.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196866" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196866" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2196866" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_trust-me.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="355" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_trust-me.jpg 5001w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_trust-me.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_trust-me.jpg?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_trust-me.jpg?resize=768,401 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_trust-me.jpg?resize=680,355 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_trust-me.jpg?resize=1536,803 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_trust-me.jpg?resize=2048,1070 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_trust-me.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196866" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>Teens said they also want to be able to come to parents when something goes wrong, without fearing that they&#8217;ll be harshly punished or that the parent will panic about the situation. The teens know they&#8217;ll be consequences if they break the rules, but they want parents to work through other tough situations with them and devise solutions together, not just react in anger.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All this sounds like straightforward, common sense advice, but parents on TikTok often have varying degrees of comfort with their teens&#8217; digital life and use of social networks. Some basic guidelines that explain what teens want and feel makes sense to include. That said, the parents who are technically savvy enough to enable a parental control feature like Family Pairing may already be clued into best practices.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196865" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196865" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2196865" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_5-tips-screengrab.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_5-tips-screengrab.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_5-tips-screengrab.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_5-tips-screengrab.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_5-tips-screengrab.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_5-tips-screengrab.png?resize=709,1536 709w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Family-Pairing_5-tips-screengrab.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196865" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TikTok</p></div></p>
<p>In addition, this sort of teen-focused privacy and safety content is also designed to help TikTok better establish itself as a platform working to protect its younger users &#8212; an increasingly necessary stance in light of the potential regulation which big tech has been trying to ahead of, as of late. TikTok, for instance, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/tiktok-to-add-more-privacy-protections-for-teenaged-users-limit-push-notifications/">announced</a> in August it would roll out more privacy protections for younger teens aimed to make the app safer. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/google-to-introduce-increased-protections-for-minors-on-its-platform-including-search-youtube-and-more/">Google</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/google-to-introduce-increased-protections-for-minors-on-its-platform-including-search-youtube-and-more/">YouTube</a> also did the same.</p>
<p>TikTok says parents or guardians who have currently linked their account to a teen&#8217;s account via the Family Pairing feature will receive a notification that prompts them to find out more about the teens&#8217; suggestions and how to approach those conversations about digital literacy and online safety. Parents who sign up and enable Family Pairing for the first time, will also be guided to the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/en-us/guardians-guide/">resources</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Direct to consumer online sales have helped a number of female-focused startups get products to market in recent years &#8212; often pitching better designed and generally more thoughtful feminine hygiene products than mainstream staples.</p>
<p>The lack of innovation in the mainstream market for feminine hygiene has certainly created a gap for startups to address. Examples in recent years include companies like <a href="https://www.shethinx.com">Thinx</a> (absorbent panties for menstruation) and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/06/flex-raises-another-3-million-to-replace-tampons/">Flex</a> (a disc-shaped tampon alternative for wearing during sex). Or Daye &#8212; which makes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/10/daye/">CBD tampons</a> for simultaneously treating period cramps.</p>
<p>Even so, there still hasn&#8217;t been a critical mass of product innovation in the category &#8212; to the point where alternatives can trickle down (no pun intended) and influence the trajectory of the mainstream market. The core products on shelves are, all too often, depressingly familiar &#8212; disposable pads and tampons &#8212; even if they may (sometimes) now be made of organic cotton or have some other mild design tweaks.</p>
<p>The most notable change to the available product mix is probably period pants &#8212; which have recently started to appear on mainstream shop shelves and seem to be selling well in markets like the UK, as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/sep/01/the-rise-of-period-pants-are-they-the-answer-to-menstrual-landfill-and-womens-prayers">Guardian</a> reported recently.</p>
<p>In the average drug store, the other non-disposable alternative you&#8217;ll most likely see is the menstrual cup. Which is not at all new &#8212; but has finally got traction beyond its original (very) niche community of users, which is another signal that consumers are more open to trying different solutions to deal with their monthly bleeding vs the same old throwaway wadding.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_bleeding">free bleeding</a> &#8212; an old movement which has also seen a bit of wider pick up in recent years &#8212; can also be seen, at least in part, as a protest against the poor quality of mainstream products for periods.</p>
<p>All of which makes this forthcoming product launch rather interesting: Meet <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/193289139/lastpad-not-just-another-reusable-menstrual-pad?ref=1ryn31&amp;token=d9479eb7">LastPad</a>, a reusable (rather than disposable) sanitary towel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2196397" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196397" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2196397" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pad_10.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pad_10.jpg 4411w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pad_10.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pad_10.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pad_10.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pad_10.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pad_10.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pad_10.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pad_10.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196397" class="wp-caption-text">Image credits: LastPad</p></div></p>
<p>The first thing you&#8217;ll likely notice is that the pad is black in color &#8212; which certainly rings the changes vs the usual white stick-on fodder. The company behind LastPad says it worked with an unnamed &#8220;luxury lingerie manufacture&#8221; on look and feel &#8212; and, well, judging by the product shots alone it shows.</p>
<p>The bigger behind-the-scenes change is that it&#8217;s been designed for sustained, repeat usage. So each LastPad comes with its own fabric pouch (in a range of colors) for folding up and storing after use (and until you get a chance to pop it in the wash). The pad can also stay in its pouch for washing so there&#8217;s no need for additional handling until you&#8217;re getting it out of the washing machine to dry.</p>
<p>LastPad is the brainchild of Danish designer and entrepreneur Isabel Aagaard whose company, <a href="https://lastobject.com">LastObject</a>, has &#8212; for the past three years &#8212; been taking aim at the wastefulness of single use hygiene and beauty products, designing reusable alternatives for what are unlovely but practical items &#8212; like Q-Tips and tissues*.</p>
<p>In total, LastObject has sold around 1.5M products so far &#8212; across its existing range of beauty, hygiene and travel-focused items. But LastPad marks its first push into a really female-focused product category.</p>
<p>A reusable (washable) sanitary pad is clearly a big step up on the design challenge front vs making reusable (silicone) Q-Tips or (cotton) tissues or makeup rounds &#8212; because of the complexity involved with designing a wearable, intimate hygiene product that can handle the variable and often messy nature of periods, and keep doing so, use after use.</p>
<p>It needs to be both comfortable and reliable &#8212; as so many disposable pads actually aren&#8217;t.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s not too surprising that, per Aagaard, the company has been working on designing and prototyping LastPad for two years. Now they&#8217;re finally ready to bring it to market &#8212; launching the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/193289139/lastpad-not-just-another-reusable-menstrual-pad?ref=1ryn31&amp;token=d9479eb7">LastPad on Kickstarter</a> today &#8212; with a goal of shipping to early backers next February.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing amazing conversions [for the LastPad pre-campaign],&#8221; she says, discussing how much demand they&#8217;re expecting. &#8220;This is our sixth [crowdfunder] campaign &#8212; and it&#8217;s looking really good. So I think the demand is bigger than I actually imagined. Because this is also the first product that is only women. And we were very much in doubt that we should put it on Kickstarter because it&#8217;s a very male-dominated platform but it&#8217;s looking really positive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We already started working on this two years ago so it&#8217;s really been a process. And also because we wanted it to be really innovative. Because right now you can see on the market there&#8217;ll be pads that are more like home sewn or do it yourself &#8212; and we wanted to really make an exclusive, very, very innovative version of that &#8212; that has a lot of the benefits that the single use version has.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196399" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196399" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2196399" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mixed_Posters-10449.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mixed_Posters-10449.jpg 4186w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mixed_Posters-10449.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mixed_Posters-10449.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mixed_Posters-10449.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mixed_Posters-10449.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mixed_Posters-10449.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mixed_Posters-10449.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Mixed_Posters-10449.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196399" class="wp-caption-text">Image credits: LastPad</p></div></p>
<p>Each LastPad is made up of three layers: A woven top to help keep the pad feeling dry against the skin by quickly funnelling menstrual fluids down into &#8212; layer two &#8212; a central absorbent section (made of bamboo) &#8212; which sits above a TPU base to ensure no risk of leaks.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first layer is a woven material that is really, really fine &#8212; it has a little bit of silver in it so that the odours will disappear. It&#8217;s also woven with small funnels so that the blood disappears very quickly into the middle layer &#8212; because it&#8217;s so important that you&#8217;re not like wet. Because that&#8217;s awful. So it dries quite quickly when you&#8217;re wearing it,&#8221; explains Aagaard. &#8220;And then the middle layer is 100% bamboo &#8212; it&#8217;s absorbent like crazy; 40% more absorbent than, for example, cotton. And it also has anti-bacterial properties. And then the bottom layer is a TPU [Thermoplastic Polyurethane] &#8212; which is just a leak proof cover; it&#8217;s comfortable, it&#8217;s not like a plastic bag but it does make sure that you cannot bleed through it.&#8221;</p>
<p>While disposable sanitary towels rely on an adhesive layer to enable the consumer fix the pad to their panties, LastPad has to do that a bit differently too given it&#8217;ll be going through the wash. So the pads have wings &#8212; which wrap around the gusset of the panties and fix together underneath with a (soft) velcro fastening.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not all: There&#8217;s a (sticky) silicone strip running around the back side of the pad which helps prevent it from moving around &#8212; and, per Aagaard, will happily survive repeat washing (in fact if it&#8217;s not used for a time, she says dust may temporarily reduce the stickiness &#8212; but says that immediately resolves just by wetting it again).</p>
<p>&#8220;Where I felt that we really made a huge difference is that on the back side of the pad &#8212; it has wings [with] a velcro [fastener] that&#8217;s completely soft and you don&#8217;t feel it; even if you&#8217;re biking &#8212; that was like the big test &#8212; and then it has a silicone strip in the back and at the bottom, like a sticky silicone&#8230; so it doesn&#8217;t move around in your pants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Practically speaking, it won&#8217;t be possible for a LastPad user to use just one LastPad to see them through their period &#8212; given the need to wash and dry them between uses. So a pack of several reusable pads will be necessary to entirely replace disposable pads and ensure there&#8217;s always a clean towel available to swap out the used pad.</p>
<p>But LastObject&#8217;s idea is, much like you own several pairs of socks and briefs, you&#8217;ll have a set of LastPads to see you through until after laundry day.</p>
<p>The product comes in three different sizes and thicknesses to cater to different flow levels, too. So the consumer may end up owning a range of reusable LastPads &#8212; from a panty liner option to a day flow and heavier duty night pads.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t as simple as I thought it was going to be &#8212; but that&#8217;s also because you have to understand the viscoses of blood, for example, compared to water,&#8221; Aagaard tells TechCrunch. &#8220;And also a flow &#8212; it&#8217;s not just blood. There&#8217;s a lot of other stuff that come out. So it&#8217;s taking all of these things into consideration.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been testing it for so long,&#8221; she goes on. &#8220;That was our main thing with this product. A lot of the other [LastObject products] were very much about printing it, looking at it. Using it of course &#8212; but it took us long before we had it in actually a silicone form. Because that is also expensive. Whereas [LastPad] we could sew quite quickly just here at the office and [test it]&#8230; So we&#8217;ve just been testing it constantly &#8212; how&#8217;s the feeling? Getting it out to a lot of different women that wear different panties that have different cycles. So it&#8217;s really been about testing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pricing for LastPad will be around $60 for three pads &#8212; so around $20 per pad. Which is obviously a lot more expensive than the per unit cost of disposable towels. But LastObject says it will offer packs so if a consumer buys more pads it should shrink the per pad cost a little.</p>
<p>Aagaard says the product has been tested to withstand at least 240 washes &#8212; which she suggests will mean it&#8217;s able to last at least a couple of years, saving likely hundreds of disposable pads from being consumed in its stead.</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s maybe less likely to save consumers money &#8212; depending on which disposable pads you&#8217;d buy and how many you&#8217;d used per cycle (basic disposable pads can cost as little as ~20c each) &#8212; as LastObject recommends owning nine of its LastPads which could cost around $80 or more). But the target user is evidently someone with enough disposable income to be able to pay a premium for an eco alternative.</p>
<p>Given the price-point, it does also look more expensive than the menstrual cup &#8212; an existing and highly practical alternative to disposable menstrual products &#8212; which can cost around $30 (for one reusable cup; and you can get away with owning just one) and, typically, a cup will also last for years as it&#8217;s made of silicone.</p>
<p>However the menstrual cup won&#8217;t suit every woman &#8212; and does require access to clean water to rinse and sanitize &#8212; so having more non-disposable alternatives for periods is great.</p>
<p>Aagaard says she&#8217;s a fan of the menstrual cup but suggests LastPad can still be useful for its users as a back-up to catch any leaks and/or provide an added layer of reassurance.</p>
<p>While, with period pants, she says the issue she finds unpleasant is the feeling of wetness when wearing them.</p>
<p>On LastPad&#8217;s environmental credentials, the washing process required to keep reusing the pad does obviously require some resources (water, soap etc) but &#8212; as is the case with other LastObject products &#8212; the company&#8217;s claim is that it&#8217;s still substantially greener to wash and reuse its non-disposable products vs consuming and binning single use items that have to be continually produced and shipped out (generating ongoing CO2). Such products can also pollute the environment after they&#8217;ve been thrown away &#8212; and plastic waste is of course a huge global problem (including from thrown away sanitary products).</p>
<p>LastObject will be publishing a third party LCA (lifecycle assessment) for LastPad to back up its eco claims for the reusable product &#8212; comparing it to using disposable sanitary pads. But Aagaard is confident it will be substantially better when compared against most disposable alternatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be putting a wash on anyway; [LastPads] don&#8217;t take up that much space; you&#8217;re not going to wash them just them; it is with your other laundry; and if you wash them at a cold wash I think that the LCA report will look really good,&#8221; she suggests when we ask about the eco credentials.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re doing this with all our products where we&#8217;re taking them through a third party who&#8217;s testing everything and putting them up against [alternatives] and having these considerations with CO2, with water, with chemicals &#8212; with the whole pack&#8230; So we&#8217;ll be doing that more specifically; right now&#8230; the alternative of a [disposable] pad &#8212; they are so differently produced. It&#8217;s crazy. So I could say the worst [for comparative purposes] or I could say the best &#8212; and ours is about 12x better than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When we got the LCA report for the LastTissue and LastSwab they were so much better than I have imagined,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p>From this year the European Union has started banning the sale of some single use plastic items (such as Q-tips and disposable cutlery) as reducing plastic waste is one of the goals for regional lawmakers. And &#8212; globally &#8212; regulators are increasingly looking for quick wins to shrink the environmental impact of the fast moving consumer goods market&#8217;s long standing love affair with plastic.</p>
<p>But some disposable product categories are simply more essential than others &#8212; which makes it hard for lawmakers to just ban plenty of wasteful, polluting products. So developing innovative, reusable alternatives is one way to help lighten the usage load.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most sustainable pad that you can ever have is actually the one that you don&#8217;t produce but that would just be free bleeding &#8212; and I think that 99% of women are not ready for that,&#8221; adds Aagaard. &#8220;So can we make some solutions on some of the things that we actually have to take care of?&#8221;</p>
<p>While LastObject is sticking with Kickstarter to get LastPad to market, Aagaard confirms that once they see how much early adopter demand it&#8217;s getting they plan to produce enough to also sell via some of the other outlets where they currently sell their products &#8212; such as ecommerce sites like Amazon and of course their own web shop.</p>
<p>So far, the US has been the main market for LastObject&#8217;s reusable wares, per Aagaard &#8212; which she attributes to mostly using Kickstarter to build a community of users. But she adds that the company is starting to see more traction in Europe as it&#8217;s increased the number of regional distributors it works with.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s next for the company after LastPad? The product direction they&#8217;ll take is an active discussion, she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can keep going the beauty way, we can go more personal care but we have to also [not] go in too many directions. I personally have a lot of fun things I want to do in the bathroom still, because I feel like it&#8217;s a space where not a lot of designers have actually really been investigating some of the products that we&#8217;re using. Both in beauty but also in personal care. Like in the floss and toothbrush but also in diapers and wipes and all of that. So I think that there&#8217;s some innovation that could be really fun. But&#8230; this one took two years and I&#8217;m so happy about the result and I couldn&#8217;t have spent two months less on it. Then we wouldn&#8217;t have had the solutions that we&#8217;ve gotten to. So that feels very important.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>*Washable tissues are also of course not new. Indeed, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handkerchief">Wikipedia</a> credits the invention of pocket squares to wipe the nose to King Richard II of England who reigned in the 14th century. But the traditional (fabric) handkerchief &#8212; which was used, laundered and reused &#8212; became yet another casualty of the switch to single-use, disposable, cheap consumer goods that&#8217;s since been shown to have such high environmental costs. So perhaps reversing this damaging default will bring more &#8216;historical product innovation&#8217; back into fashion as societies look to apply a modern &#8216;circular economy&#8217; lens </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If the world is to reach NetZero, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/uns-ipcc-report-on-climate-change-sounds-code-red-for-planet/">avoid climate disaster</a> it needs to make every product sustainable and that means every purchase. But to do that you need a lot more transparency, so that means more data on suppliers to improve sourcing and benchmarking companies. While companies are often doing their best, the problem with issues like CO2 emissions lies in the supply chain.</p>
<p>Danish startup <a href="https://www.responsibly.tech/">Responsibly</a>, reckons it has the answers in providing retailers, builders, and others with a supply network a scorecard against this supply chain of providers. Thus, a company can check if any level of its supply chain is involved in deforestation, water pollution, as well as human rights violations or gender pay gap issues.</p>
<p>It’s now raised a $2 million pre-seed investment round led by Flash Ventures. Also participating is Pirate Impact (the family-office of Fabian &amp; Ferry Heilemann) and Michael Wax, Founder and CEO of Planetly Benedikt Franke.</p>
<p>The startup will now soft-launch the first version of its platform which will look at the supplier data of more than 10,000 suppliers for pilot customers.</p>
<p>Responsibly’s co-Founder and CEO Thomas Buch Andersson said: &#8220;If we can make it as easy for purchasers to evaluate how their suppliers compare on a planetary agenda, as it is to compare them on price, then we think we can unlock the huge force for change that&#8217;s sitting in the world&#8217;s procurement departments.”</p>
<p>Being developed with Google’s Startup Advisor: Sustainable Development Goals Program, Responsibly</p>
<p>Johann Nordhus Westarp, Founding Partner at Flash Ventures said: “The timing is perfect, and companies will fundamentally change the way they procure in the next couple of years. Price- or value-driven procurement will give way to impact-driven procurement. Companies are acting somewhat blindly today, treading-water to solve the ‘problem of the day’. Responsibly helps them finally get visibility into their procurement footprints and make forward-thinking decisions for all the right reasons.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>According to CDP, some 40% of global GHG emissions are <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en/articles/companies/how-can-companies-address-their-scope-3-greenhouse-gas-emissions">driven</a> or influenced companies through their purchases and the products they sell. Meanwhile, Gartner <a href="https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/globalassets/en/supply-chain/documents/trends/future-of-supply-chain-ebook.pdf">found</a> that 23% of supply chain leaders expect to have a digital ecosystem by 2025, up from only 1% today.</p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call Buch Andersson said: &#8220;The space for responsible sourcing has really evolved quite a lot over the past 20 years. We are building a layer on top of all of the different data providers to essentially allow the procurement team to flexibly read any information, interpret it and then use it for sourcing decision making.”</p>
<p>Responsibly competes with EcoVadis and Integrity Next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Itamar Jobani was a software developer working for a medical company and “hated that time of the month” when he had to use the company’s chosen reimbursement tool.</p>
<p>“It was full of friction and as part of the company’s wellness team, I felt an urge to take care of the employee experience and find a better tool,” Jobani told TechCrunch. “I looked for something, but didn’t find it, so I tried to build it myself.”</p>
<p>What resulted was <a href="https://www.payem.co/">PayEm</a>, an Israeli company he founded with Omer Rimoch in 2019 to be a spend and procurement platform for high-growth and multinational organizations. Today, it announced $27 million in funding that includes $7 million in seed funding, led by Pitango First and NFX, with participation by LocalGlobe and Fresh Fund, as well as $20 million in Series A funding led by Glilot+.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How a band of P2P hackers planted the seeds of a unique expense management giant&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/expensify-ec1-origin/embed/#?secret=742218iY4X" data-secret="742218iY4X" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company’s technology automates the reimbursement, procurement, accounts payable and credit card workflows to manage all of the requests and invoices, while also creating bills and sending payments to over 200 territories in 130 currencies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It gives company finance teams a real-time look at what items employees are asking for funds to buy, and what is actually being spent. For example, teams can submit a request and go through an approval flow that can be customized with purchasing codes tied to a description of the transaction. At the same time, all transactions are continuously reconciled versus having to spend hours at the end of the month going through paperwork.</p>
<p>“Organizations are running in a more democratized way with teams buying things on behalf of the organization,” Jobani said. “We built a platform to cater to those needs, so it’s like a disbursement platform instead of a finance team always being in charge.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/earnings/2019/mastercard-contactless-b2b-cross-border-growth/">global B2B payments market is valued at $120 trillion annually</a> and is expected to reach $200 trillion by 2028, according to payment industry newsletter Nilson Report. PayEm is among many B2B payments startups attracting venture capital — for example, last month, Nium announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/nium-crosses-1b-valuation-with-200m-riverwood-capital-led-round/">$200 million in Series D</a> funding at a $1 billion valuation. Paystand raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/paystand-banks-50m-to-make-b2b-payments-cashless-and-with-no-fees/">$50 million in Series C</a> funding to make B2B payments cashless, while Dwolla <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/dwolla-raises-21m-to-bring-more-customizable-payment-and-money-transfer-options-to-fintechs-and-brands/">raised $21 million</a> for its API that allows companies to build and facilitate fast payments.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, PayEm itself saw accelerated growth in the second quarter of 2021, including increasing its transaction volume by four times over the previous quarter and generating millions of dollars in revenue. It now boasts a list of hundreds of customers like Fiverr, JFrog and Next Insurance. It also launched new features like the ability to create corporate cards.</p>
<p>The company, which also has an office in New York, has 40 employees currently, and the new funds will enable the company to triple its headcount, focusing on hiring in the United States, and to bring additional features and payment capabilities to market.</p>
<p>“Each person can have a budget and a time frame for making the purchase, while accounting still feels in control,” Jobani added. “Everyone now has the full context and the right budget line item.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://Vic.ai">Vic.ai</a>, a startup that has built an AI-based platform it claims can ‘automate&#8217; enterprise accounting, has raised a $50M Series B round led by ICONIQ Growth, with participation from existing investors GGV Capital, Cowboy Ventures and Costanoa Ventures, bringing total capital raised to $63 million.</p>
<p>The company’s customers include HSB (Sweden’s largest real-estate management company), Intercom Inc. and HireQuest Inc., as well as accounting firms KPMG, PwC, BDO, and Armanino LLP. Vic.ai says its platform has processed more than 535 million invoices with 95 percent accuracy.</p>
<p>Vic.ai says it can do this by learning from historical data and existing processes to deliver more automation in accounting processes thus saving time, reducing errors and duplicates.</p>
<p>Alexander Hagerup, CEO of Vic.ai (launched in 2017) said: “It’s 2021, and it’s high time for finance and accounting teams to embrace AI technology. Accounting work is tedious and repetitive, but it no longer needs to be. Our AI platform delivers both autonomy and intelligence for finance and accounting teams.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s an age-old tech industry story: company comes up with a tool to solve its own problem, then realizes the tool is actually worth more than the existing company. Something similar happened to Linearity. Its 17-year-old founder, Vladimir Danila, came up with the Vectornator tool to make vector design easier in 2017. It’s now used by Apple, Disney, Wacom and Microsoft. Disney uses Vectornator to create artwork for hotels in Disneyland, in fact.</p>
<p>The vector-focused platform has now raised a $20 million funding round led by EQT Ventures together with 468 Capital. It’s been joined by Angels including Bradley Horowitz (VP Product, Google), Jonathan Rochelle (Co-Founder Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets, Google Slides, Google Drive), Charles Songhurst (Ex. Corporate Strategy, Microsoft) and Lutz Finger (Group Product Manager, Google). <br />
 <br />
The company says the funding will be used to double down on its mobile-first product, Vectornator, adding AI-powered automation and collaboration features, and new products and expand in the USA and Europe as well as Asia. <br />
 <br />
Vladimir Danila, CEO and founder at Linearity said: “When I first got into design aged 10 over a decade ago, I found the tools hard to use and intimidating. I immediately wanted to create my own suite of tools to solve that issue as vectors become more relevant than pixels and are also superior in every aspect except for photography. Vectornator is all about customer experience, simplicity and not overcomplicating the software. I’m thrilled to be working alongside Ted and the team to glean knowledge and market understanding and help to grow our platform.”</p>
<p>Ted Persson, Partner at EQT Ventures commented: “For me, there were two clear sides to joining forces with the Linearity team. Vladimir is a very clear-cut founder who has built an outstanding product. Design tools are some of the hardest tools to build, but Vladimir and his team have shown that anything is possible.”</p>
<p>Investor interest in design tools has exploded since the success of Canva, which is now valued at $15 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world of professional coaching has grown over the years as coaches realised they could easily counsel people remotely and clients realized digital coaching was far more efficient. But, equally, a problem arose in how to sift the wheat from the chaff. At the same time corporates realised that their own staff could benefit &#8211; but faced the same sifting problem. In a classic Internet play, CoachHub came along three years ago and applied AI to a marketplace to do the sifting. All well and good, but with training and personal development going almost completely digital due to the pandemic, the market has exploded.</p>
<p>Berlin-based <a href="https://coachhub.io/en/">CoachHub</a> has now raised $80m in a Series &#8220;B2&#8221; funding, increasing its total Series B capital to $110m. Investors Draper Esprit, RTP Global, HV Capital, Signals Venture Capital, Partech, and Speedinvest all participated bringing the total funds raised to $130m, since 2019.</p>
<p>Last year it raised a $30 million Series B round, also led by Draper Esprit, alongside existing investors HV Capital, Partech, Speedinvest, signals Venture Capital, and RTP Global.</p>
<p>The startup competes with other aggregators such as AceUp out of Boston, which has raised $2.3M.<br />
 <br />
The three year old startup says it has tripled its employees, and added new clients including Fujitsu, Electrolux, Babbel, ViacomCBS and KPMG.<br />
 <br />
Co-founder and Chief Sales Director Yannis Niebelschütz said in a statement: “This latest round of funding will allow us to meet the ever-growing demand for digital solutions for training and personal development, which has been triggered by the pandemic.”<br />
 <br />
Christoph Hornung, investment director at Draper Esprit said: “It’s no longer just about the pandemic. What we are increasingly seeing with digital-first, highly enriched platforms such as CoachHub are more dynamic and – crucially – more accessible tools to transform companies through training and education.”<br />
 <br />
CoachHub says it uses AI to match individuals with 2,500 business and well-being coaches in 70 countries across six continents. Coaching sessions are available in 60+ languages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://trustshare.co">Trustshare</a>, a London-based startup that is working on escrow infrastructure for online classified, B2B marketplaces, trade directories and more. It’s a white-label platform that can be integrated with online marketplaces in just a few lines of code.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever tried to sell something expensive on the web, you know that it’s hard to know for sure that you’re not getting scammed. For instance, that person that is trying to buy your old phone from you — should you send the phone first or ask the buyer to send the money first?</p>
<p>If a marketplace relies on Trustshare for payments, buyers first have to checkout and leave money into a dedicated transaction-based account. Trustshare can also handle identity verification steps, such as KYC and AML checks (Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering). The seller can check the status of the funds. Once the buyer has received the product, they can release funds to the seller.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, Trustshare generates a dedicated IBAN per transaction. Customers can deposit money using bank transfers or cards. In the U.K. and Europe, Trustshare takes advantage of open banking regulation so that users can connect to their bank account from the checkout flow.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to tweak your site’s code, you can also use Trustshare for offline sales and transactions that happen over email or messaging apps. The company lets you generate QR codes or payment links to initiate a payment.</p>
<p>The startup has raised an angel round from several business angels, such as Cazoo and Zoopla founder Alex Chesterman and Carwow founder James Hind. After that, Trustshare raised a $3.2 million seed round (£2.3 million) led by <a href="https://nautacapital.com">Nauta Capital</a>.</p>
<p>Many companies could leverage Trustshare to launch their own marketplace as escrow payment is one of the biggest pain points. For instance, you can imagine luxury brands launching their own marketplaces of handbags and watches, new car marketplaces focused on one type of cars in particular, etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Our 5 lines of code branded escrow checkout is taking many marketplaces, brands that consumers know and trust, transactional. Really, this is just the start. Our borderless escrow infrastructure is incredibly powerful, and we plan to launch new products including instant pay-throughs, baskets and projects to make payments as quick and easy as sending an email,” co-founder and CEO Nick Fulton said in a statement.</p>
<p>Trustshare is built on top of existing payment infrastructure. That’s why it supports 180 countries and 30 currencies already. The company’s initial clients include Watchcollecting, Bookabuilder and U.K. trade body FENSA’s Deposit Protection service.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[UK startup Oviva, which sells a digital support offering, including for Type 2 diabetes treatment, dispensing personalized diet and lifestyle advice via apps to allow more people to be able to access support, has closed $80 million in Series C funding &#8212; bringing its total raised to date to $115M.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UK startup <a href="https://oviva.com/uk/en/">Oviva</a>, which sells a digital support offering, including for Type 2 diabetes treatment, dispensing personalized diet and lifestyle advice via apps to allow more people to be able to access support, has closed $80 million in Series C funding &#8212; bringing its total raised to date to $115M.</p>
<p>The raise, which Oviva says will be used to scale up after a &#8220;fantastic year&#8221; of growth for the health tech business, is co-led by Sofina and Temasek, alongside existing investors AlbionVC, Earlybird, Eight Roads Ventures, F-Prime Capital, MTIP, plus several angels.</p>
<p>Underpinning that growth is the fact wealthy Western nations continue to see rising rates of obesity and other health conditions like Type 2 diabetes (which can be linked to poor diet and lack of exercise). While more attention is generally being paid to the notion of preventative &#8212; rather than reactive &#8212; healthcare, to manage the rising costs of service delivery.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Lifestyle management to help control weight and linked health conditions (like diabetes) is where Oviva comes in: It&#8217;s built a blended support offering that combines personalized care (provided by healthcare professionals) with digital tools for patients that help them do things like track what they&#8217;re eating, access support and chart their progress towards individual health goals.</span></p>
<p>It can point to 23 peer-reviewed publications to back up its approach &#8212; saying key results show an average of 6.8% weight loss at 6 months for those living with obesity; while, in its specialist programs, it says 53% of patients achieve remission of their type 2 diabetes at 12 months.</p>
<p>Oviva typically sells its digitally delivered support programs direct to health insurance companies (or publicly funded health services) &#8212; who then provide (or refer) the service to their customers/patients. Its programs are currently available in the UK, Germany, Switzerland and France &#8212; but expanding access is one of the goals for the Series C.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will expand to European markets where the health system reimburses the diet and lifestyle change we offer, especially those with specific pathways for digital reimbursement,&#8221; Oviva tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Encouragingly, more healthcare systems have been opening up specific routes for such digital reimbursement, e.g., Germany for DiGAs or Belgium just in the last months.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So far, the startup has treated 200,000 people but the addressable market is clearly huge &#8212; not least as European populations age &#8212; with Oviva suggesting more than <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">300 million people live with &#8220;health challenges&#8221; that are either triggered by poor diet or can be optimised through personalised dietary changes. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Moreover, it suggests, only &#8220;a small fraction&#8221; is currently being offered digital care.</span></p>
<p>To date, Oviva has built up 5,000+ partnerships with health systems, insurers and doctors as it looks to push for further scale by making its technology more accessible to a wider range of people. In the past year it says it&#8217;s &#8220;more than doubled&#8221; both people treated and revenue earned.</p>
<p>Its goal is for the Series C funding is to reach &#8220;millions&#8221; of people across Europe who need support because they&#8217;re suffering from poor health linked to diet and lifestyle.</p>
<p>As part of the scale up plan it will also be growing its team to 800 by the end of 2022, it adds.</p>
<p>On digital vs face-to-face care &#8212; setting aside the potential cost savings associated with digital delivery &#8212; it says studies show the &#8220;most striking outcome benefits&#8221; are around uptake and completion rates, noting: &#8220;We have consistently shown uptake rates above 70% and high completion rates of around 80%, even in groups considered harder to reach such as working age populations or minority ethnic groups. This compares to uptake and completion rates of less than 50% for most face-to-face services.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asked about competition, Oviva names Liva Healthcare and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/18/noom-competitor-ourpath-rebrands-as-second-nature-raises-10m-series-a/">Second Nature</a> as its closest competitors in the region.</p>
<p>&#8220;WW (formally Weight Watchers) also competes with a digital solution in some markets where they can access reimbursement,&#8221; it adds. &#8220;There are many others that try to access this group with new methods, but are not reimbursed or are wellness solutions. Noom competes as a solution for self-paying consumers in Europe, as many other apps. But, in our view, that is a separate market from the reimbursed medical one.&#8221;</p>

<p>As well as using the Series C funding to bolster its presence in existing markets and target and scale into new ones, Oviva says it may look to further grow the business via M&amp;A opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;In expanding to new countries, we are open to both building new organisations from the ground up or acquiring existing businesses with a strong medical network where we see that our technology can be leveraged for better patient care and value creation,&#8221; it told us on that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amsterdam-based startup <a href="https://www.vanmoof.com">VanMoof</a> has raised a $128 million Series C funding round. The company designs and sells electric bikes that are quite popular in some markets. It now wants to become the world’s leading e-bike brand by iterating at a faster pace.</p>
<p>Asia-based private equity firm Hillhouse Investment is leading the round, with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilliantans">Gillian Tans</a>, the former CEO of Booking.com, also participating. Some existing investors also put some more money on the table, such as Norwest Venture Partners, Felix Capital, Balderton Capital and TriplePoint Capital.</p>
<p>Today’s Series C represents a big jump compared to the company’s Series B. Last year, VanMoof <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/after-lockdowns-lead-to-an-e-bike-boom-vanmoof-raises-40m-series-b-to-expand-globally/">raised</a> a $40 million Series B. Overall, if you add it all up, the startup has raised $182 million in total.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with VanMoof’s e-bikes, TechCrunch reviewed both the most recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/review-handsome-and-nippy-new-vanmoof-e-bikes-could-be-the-shape-of-cities-to-come/">S3</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/vanmoof-x3-review-e-bike/">X3</a> models. On paper, they are identical. The VanMoof X3 features a smaller frame and smaller wheels.</p>

<p>What makes VanMoof different from your average e-bike manufacturer is that the company tries to control everything from the supply chain to the customer experience. VanMoof e-bikes are premium e-bikes that are primarily designed for city rides. The most recent models currently cost $2,298 or €2,198.</p>
<p>They feature an electric motor paired with an electronic gear shifting system. It has four gears and you don’t have to change gears yourself. All you have to do is jump on the bike and start pedaling.</p>
<p>Recognizable by their iconic triangular-shaped futuristic-looking frames, the S3 and X3 also come with hydraulic brakes, integrated lights and some smart features. There’s an integrated motion detector combined with an alarm, a GPS chip and cellular connectivity.</p>
<p>If you declare your bike as stolen, the GPS and cellular chips go live and you can track your bike in the VanMoof app. The company’s bikes are now also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/e-bikes-and-earbuds-among-the-first-third-party-hardware-to-support-apples-find-my-tracking/">compatible with Apple’s Find My app</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of relying exclusively on off-the-shelf parts, the company works with a small set of suppliers to manufacture custom components. This way, it can cut out as many middleperson as possible to bring costs down. It’s also a good competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Growing a company like VanMoof is a capital-intensive business. The company has opened retail stores and service hubs in 50 different cities around the world. While the company started in Europe, the U.S. is now the fastest growth market for VanMoof.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, the startup plans to double-down on its current strategy. You can expect updated bikes with refined designs and more custom parts. You can expect more stores and service hubs around the world. And you can probably expect more online sales as well.</p>
<p>“It will help us get 10 million people on our bikes in the next five years,” co-founder and CEO Taco Carlier said in a statement. So far, there are 150,000 people using VanMoof bikes.</p>
<p>Today’s investment shouldn’t come as a surprise. The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated plans to transform European cities — and prioritize bikes over cars. Last year, TechCrunch’s Natasha Lomas and I wrote a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/how-four-european-cities-are-embracing-micromobility-to-drive-out-cars/">comprehensive overview</a> of key policy developments in four major cities — Paris, Barcelona, London and Milan. VanMoof is now benefiting from these policy shifts.</p>

<p>After a 17-hour marathon through nearly 200 startup pitches, the Equity team was fired up to get back on Twitter and chat through some early trends and favorites from the first day of Y Combinator&#8217;s demo party. We&#8217;ll be back on the air tomorrow, <a href="https://twitter.com/EquityPod">so make sure you&#8217;re following the show</a> on Twitter so you don&#8217;t miss out.</p>
<p>What did <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> chat about? The following:</p>
<ul>
<li>First impressions: We started by going through top-line numbers, geographic breakdown, and how the accelerator is doing when it comes to the representation of diverse founders. The last bit had a tiny bit of progress, but diversity continues to be an issue in YC&#8217;s batches — even as cohort size grows. We also chatted about what startups pitching can work on: like better mics, which are cheap and good.</li>
<li>Our early favorites: Metaphor, Lumify, Alex&#8217;s favorite duo Indian real estate plays, Akudo, Reframe and Playhouse.</li>
<li>And some <em>hmmm</em> moments, including our thoughts on Writesonic, which Natasha has a potentially paranoid theory on.</li>
</ul>
<p>TechCrunch has extensive coverage of the day on the site, so there&#8217;s lots to dig into if you are in the mood. More tomorrow!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the customer service industry, your accent dictates many aspects of your job. It shouldn&#8217;t be the case that there&#8217;s a &#8220;better&#8221; or &#8220;worse&#8221; accent, but in today&#8217;s global economy (though who knows about tomorrow&#8217;s) it&#8217;s valuable to sound American or British. While many undergo accent neutralization training, <a href="https://sanas.ai/">Sanas</a> is a startup with another approach (and a $5.5 million seed round): using speech recognition and synthesis to change the speaker&#8217;s accent in near real time.</p>
<p>The company has trained a machine learning algorithm to quickly and locally (that is, without using the cloud) recognize a person&#8217;s speech on one end and, on the other, output the same words with an accent chosen from a list or automatically detected from the other person&#8217;s speech.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196688" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sanas-desktop.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196688" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2196688" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sanas-desktop.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Sanas desktop application." width="400" height="413" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sanas-desktop.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sanas-desktop.jpg?resize=145,150 145w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sanas-desktop.jpg?resize=291,300 291w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sanas-desktop.jpg?resize=768,793 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sanas-desktop.jpg?resize=659,680 659w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sanas-desktop.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/sanas-desktop.jpg?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2196688" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sanas.ai</p></div></p>
<p>It slots right into the OS&#8217;s sound stack so it works out of the box with pretty much any audio or video calling tool. Right now the company is operating a pilot program with thousands of people in locations from the U.S. and U.K. to the Philippines, India, Latin America and others. Accents supported will include American, Spanish, British, Indian, Filipino and Australian by the end of the year.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, the idea of Sanas kind of bothered me at first. It felt like a concession to bigoted people who consider their accent superior and think others below them. Tech will fix it … by accommodating the bigots. Great!</p>
<p>But while I still have a little bit of that feeling, I can see there&#8217;s more to it than this. Fundamentally speaking, it is easier to understand someone when they speak in an accent similar to your own. But customer service and tech support is a huge industry and one primarily performed by people outside the countries where the customers are. This basic disconnect can be remedied in a way that puts the onus of responsibility on the entry-level worker, or one that puts it on technology. Either way the difficulty of making oneself understood remains and must be addressed — an automated system just lets it be done more easily and allows more people to do their job.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not magic — as you can tell in this clip, the character and cadence of the person&#8217;s voice is only partly retained and the result is considerably more artificial sounding:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZTZ1T9VBa-Y?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>But the technology is improving and like any speech engine, the more it&#8217;s used, the better it gets. And for someone not used to the original speaker&#8217;s accent, the American-accented version may very well be more easily understood. For the person in the support role, this likely means better outcomes for their calls — everyone wins. Sanas told me that the pilots are just starting so there are no numbers available from this deployment yet, but testing has suggested a considerable reduction of error rates and increase in call efficiency.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good enough at any rate to attract a $5.5 million seed round, with participation from Human Capital, General Catalyst, Quiet Capital and DN Capital.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sanas is striving to make communication easy and free from friction, so people can speak confidently and understand each other, wherever they are and whoever they are trying to communicate with,&#8221; CEO Maxim Serebryakov said in the press release announcing the funding. It&#8217;s hard to disagree with that mission.</p>
<p>While the cultural and ethical questions of accents and power differentials are unlikely to ever go away, Sanas is trying something new that may be a powerful tool for the many people who must communicate professionally and find their speech patterns are an obstacle to that. It&#8217;s an approach worth exploring and discussing even if in a perfect world we would simply understand one another better.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[These startups made us do a double take, be it due to the size of the market opportunity, the ambition exhibited by the founding team or an idea that was just too clever to pass up.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Y Combinator kicked off its fourth-ever virtual Demo Day today, revealing the first half of its nearly 400-company batch. The presentation, YC’s biggest yet, offers a snapshot into where innovation is heading, from not-so-simple seaweed to a Clearco for creators.</p>
<p>The TechCrunch team stuck to its tradition of covering every single company live (but, you know, from home) so you’ll find all of the Day One companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/here-are-all-the-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day-part-1/">here</a>. For those who want a sampling of standouts, however, we’re also bringing you a host of our favorites from today’s one-minute pitch-off extravaganza.</p>
<p>As reporters, we’re constantly inundated with hundreds of pitches on a daily basis. The startups below caught our picky attention for a whole host of reasons, but that doesn’t mean other startups weren’t compelling or potential unicorns as well. Instead, consider the below to be a data point on which startups made us do a double take, be it due to the size of the market opportunity, the ambition exhibited by the founding team or an idea that was just too clever to pass up.</p>
<h2>Genei</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.genei.io/">Genei</a> is, dare I say, a refreshing mashup between robots and writers. The startup has a simple goal: Automatically summarize background reading so content creators can grab the top facts, attribute and move onto the next graf. Writing is innately an art, so I find Genei&#8217;s positioning as a tool for writers instead of a replacement out to take their jobs as smart. Better yet, it&#8217;s launching by targeting some of the hardest workers in our industry: freelance writers. These folks often have to balance consistent pitches, diverse assignments and tight deadlines for their livelihood, so I&#8217;d presume a sidekick can&#8217;t hurt. Down the road, I could totally see this startup playing the same role as a Grammarly: a helpful extension of workflows that optimizes the way people who write for a living, write. —<a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_"> Natasha</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">On the heels of Heroes <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/uk-based-heroes-raises-200m-to-buy-up-more-amazon-merchants-for-its-roll-up-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcing</a> a $200 million raise earlier today, to double down on buying and scaling third-party Amazon Marketplace sellers, <em>another</em> startup out of London aiming to do the same is announcing some significant funding of its own. <a href="https://olsamgroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olsam</a>, a roll-up play that is buying up both consumer and B2B merchants selling on Amazon by way of Amazon&#8217;s <a href="https://sell.amazon.com/fulfillment-by-amazon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBA fulfillment program</a>, has closed $165 million &#8212; a combination of equity and debt that it will be using to fuel its M&amp;A strategy, as well as continue building out its tech platform and to hire more talent.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://apeiron-investments.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://apeiron-investments.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630527431147000&amp;usg=AFQjCNENFrB7mbhWgAfHKg-eIEG9HwhLgA">Apeiron Investment Group</a> &#8212; an investment firm started by German entrepreneur Christian Angermayer (<a href="https://everipedia.org/wiki/lang_en/christian-angermayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">known first</a> for biopharmaceuticals, then investing and crypto, including playing a role in SoftBank investing in Wirecard) &#8212; led the Series A equity round, with <a href="https://elevat3.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://elevat3.vc/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630527431147000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEciwAL09pa7gxw99Co7vg6NZxgpg">Elevat3 Capital</a> (another Angermayer firm that has a strategic partnership with Founders Fund and Peter Thiel) also participating. <a href="https://northwallcap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://northwallcap.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1630527431147000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHv74PQk-C1pUtFl44LSO9fUFtrMQ">North Wall Capital</a> was behind the debt portion of the deal. This appears to be the first significant funding of any kind announced by the company since it launched in October 2020. We have asked for more details about how the $165 million breaks down between equity and debt, and Olsam said it is only disclosing the full amount raised. Valuation is also not being disclosed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Being an Amazon roll-up startup from London that happens to be announcing a fundraise today are not the only two things that Olsam has in common with Heroes. Like Heroes, Olsam is also founded by brothers with track records that lend themselves to diving into becoming Marketplace consolidators.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Sam Horbye previously spent years working at Amazon, including building and managing the company&#8217;s <a href="http://business.amazon.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Business Marketplace</a> in the UK (the B2B version of the consumer Marketplace). Co-founder Ollie Horbye had years of experience in strategic consulting and financial services.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Between them, they had also quietly built and sold previous marketplace businesses, and they believe that this collective experience gives Olsam &#8212; a portmanteau of their names, &#8220;Ollie&#8221; and &#8220;Sam&#8221; &#8212; a leg up in areas like building relationships with merchants; identifying quality products amid the vast sea of search results that often feel like they are selling the same inexpensive junk as each other; understanding merchants&#8217; challenges and opportunities; and critically building relationships with Amazon and understanding how the merchant ecosystem fits into the e-commerce giant&#8217;s wider strategy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Olsam is also taking a slightly different approach when it comes to target companies. Yes, it is focusing on the usual consumer play you hear about from consolidators &#8212; home &amp; garden, sporting, baby and children products, and beauty are typical categories. But alongside that, it is also building out a strategy to sell those products, and others, on Amazon&#8217;s B2B portal &#8212; the one Sam helped build when he worked at Amazon.</p>
<p dir="ltr">B2B selling includes items like office furniture and office supplies, but also electronics, automotive parts and accessories, kitchenware, and, actually, anything that is potentially sold on the consumer marketplace.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">The exception is that with business customers &#8212; as you get with members&#8217; only stores in the physical retail world &#8212; they may get discounts for bulk purchases, tax breaks, and perhaps a slightly different mix of products more tailored to running their enterprises.</p>
<p dir="ltr">B2B is currently one of the fastest-growing segments in Amazon&#8217;s Marketplace, and it is also one of the most overlooked.&#8221;It&#8217;s flying under the radar,&#8221; Ollie said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The B2B opportunity is very exciting,&#8221; Sam added. &#8220;A growing number of merchants are selling office supplies or more random products to the B2B customer.&#8221;</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Estimates vary pretty wildly when it comes to how many merchants there are selling on Amazon&#8217;s Marketplace globally. I&#8217;ve seen estimates of 6 million and nearly 10 million. But altogether, those merchants generated $300 million in sales (gross merchandise value) last year, and that figure is growing by 50% each year at the moment. <a href="https://sell.amazon.co.uk/programmes/amazon-business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon itself notes</a> that online B2B sales as a category &#8212; beyond, but also including, on Amazon itself &#8212; is about 2.3 times bigger than its B2C counterpart.</p>
<p>Combined with that opportunity, consolidating sellers &#8212; in order to achieve better economies of scale around supply chains, marketing tools and analytics, and more &#8212; is also big business. Olsam estimates that some $7 billion has been spent cumulatively on acquiring these businesses, and there are more out there: Olsam estimates that there are some 3,000 businesses in the UK alone making more than $1 million each in sales on Amazon&#8217;s platform.</p>
<p>And to be clear, there are a number of other roll-up startups beyond Heroes also eyeing up that opportunity. Raising hundreds of millions of dollars in aggregate,  others have made moves this year include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/suma-brands-raises-150m-to-acquire-more-third-party-brands-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suma Brands</a> ($150 million); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/elevate-brands-banks-250m-to-roll-up-third-party-merchants-selling-on-amazons-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elevate Brands</a> ($250 million); <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/softbanks-vision-fund-2-leads-775m-investment-in-perch-sets-new-record-for-fastest-company-to-achieve-profitable-unicorn-status-in-the-us-301299324.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perch</a> ($775 million); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/factory14-raises-200m-to-jump-into-the-amazon-marketplace-roll-up-race/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">factory14</a> ($200 million); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/thrasio-raises-100m-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play-appoints-retail-cfo-heavyweight-for-its-next-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thrasio</a> (currently probably the biggest of them all in terms of reach and money raised and ambitions), <a href="https://heyday.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heyday</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/berlins-razor-group-raises-400m-to-buy-and-scale-amazon-marketplace-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Razor Group</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Branded</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SellerX</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berlin Brands Group</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/berlin-brands-group-raises-240m-to-buy-and-scale-up-third-party-amazon-marketplace-brands/">X2</a>), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/benitago-group-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benitago</a>, Latin America’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/valoreo-raises-50m-to-roll-up-latam-e-commerce-brands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valoreo</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/founded-by-former-carousell-ovo-and-fave-execs-rainforest-raises-36m-to-aggregate-asia-pacific-amazon-marketplace-sellers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rainforest</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/una-brands-launches-with-40m-to-acquire-brands-on-multiple-asia-pacific-e-commerce-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Una Brands</a> out of Asia.</p>
<p>Sure, there may be room for all of these, and many more, to move into the roll-up opportunity, but it&#8217;s a more complicated equation in the longer run. That is one reason why so many of these companies also emphasize their organizational, M&amp;A, and marketplace expertise: at the end of the day, the technology these well-capitalized startups build will only be as good as the merchants they manage to buy, and the business plans they subsequently execute around their conglomerations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The senior team behind <span class="il">Olsam</span> is what makes this business truly unique,&#8221; said Angermayer in a statement. “Having all been successful in building and selling their own brands within the market and having worked for Amazon in their marketplace team &#8211; their understanding of this space is exceptional.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even as hundreds of millions of people in India have a bank account, only a tiny fraction of this population invests in any financial instrument.</p>
<p>Fewer than 30 million people invest in mutual funds or stocks, for instance. In recent years, a handful of startups have made it easier for users &#8212; especially the millennials &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/investment-app-for-millennials-groww-raises-83-million-at-over-1-billion-valuation/">to invest</a>, but the figure has largely remained stagnant.</p>
<p>Now, an Indian startup believes that it has found the solution to tackle this challenge &#8212; and is already seeing good early traction.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/agNishchay">Nishchay AG</a>, former director of mobility startup Bounce, and <a href="https://twitter.com/misbahspeaks">Misbah Ashraf</a>, co-founder of Marsplay (sold to Foxy), founded Jar earlier this year.</p>
<p>The startup’s eponymous three-month-old Android app enables users to start their savings journey for as little as 1 Indian rupee.</p>
<p>Users on <a href="https://www.myjar.app">Jar</a> can invest in multiple ways and get started within seconds. The app works with Paytm (PhonePe support is in the works) to set up a recurring payment. (The startup is the first to use UPI 2.0’s recurring payment support.) They can set up any amount between 1 Indian rupee to 500 for daily investments.</p>
<p>The Jar app can also glean users’ text messages and save a tiny amount based on each monetary transaction they do. So, for instance, if a user has spent 31 rupees in a transaction, the Jar app rounds that up to the nearest tenth figure (40, in this case) and saves nine rupees. Users can also manually open the app and spend any amount they wish to invest.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Once users have saved some money in Jar, the app then invests that into digital gold.</p>
<p>The startup is using gold investment because people in the South Asian market already have an immense trust in this asset class.</p>
<p>India has a unique fascination for gold. From rural farmers to urban working class, nearly everyone stashes the yellow metal and flaunts jewelry at weddings.</p>
<p>Indian households are estimated to have a stash of over 25,000 tons of the precious metal whose value today is about half of the country’s nominal GDP. Such is the demand for gold in India that the South Asian nation is also one of the world’s largest importers of this precious metal.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196630" style="width: 327px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196630" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2196630 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jar-app-india.jpg?w=317" alt="" width="317" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jar-app-india.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jar-app-india.jpg?resize=70,150 70w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jar-app-india.jpg?resize=140,300 140w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jar-app-india.jpg?resize=768,1649 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jar-app-india.jpg?resize=317,680 317w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jar-app-india.jpg?resize=716,1536 716w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/jar-app-india.jpg?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196630" class="wp-caption-text">Jar&#8217;s Android app (<strong>Image Credits:</strong> Jar)</p></div></p>
<p>“When you’re thinking about bringing the next 500 million people to institutional savings and investments, the onus is on us to educate them on the efficacies of the other instruments that are in the market,” said Nishchay.</p>
<p>“We want to give them the instrument they trust the most, which is gold,” he said. The startup plans to eventually offer several more investment opportunities, he said.</p>
<p>The founders met several years ago when they were exploring if MarsPlay and Bounce could have any synergies. They stayed in touch and, last year during one of their many conversations, realized that neither of them knew much about investments.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s when the dots started to connect,&#8221; said Misbah, drawing stories from his childhood. &#8220;I come from a small town in Bihar called Bihar Sharif. During my childhood days, I saw my family deeply troubled with debt because of poor financial decisions and no savings,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We both understand what a typical middle class family goes through. Someone who comes from this background never had any means in the past but their aspirations are never-ending. So when you start earning, you immediately start to spend it all,&#8221; said Nishchay.</p>
<p>&#8220;The market needs products that will help them get started,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>That idea, which is similar to Acorn and Stash&#8217;s play in the U.S. market, is beginning to make inroads. The app has already amassed about half a million downloads, the founders said. Investors have taken notice, too.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Jar announced it has raised $4.5 million from a clutch of high-profile investors, including Arkam Ventures, Tribe Capital, WEH Ventures, and angels including Kunal Shah (founder of CRED), Shaan Puri (formerly with Twitch), Ali Moiz (founder of <a href="https://stonks.com">Stonks</a>), Howard Lindzon (founder of Social Leverage), Vivekananda Hallekere (co-founder of Bounce), Alvin Tse (of Xiaomi) and Kunal Khattar (managing partner at AdvantEdge).</p>
<p>&#8220;Over 400 million Indians are about to embrace digital financial services for the first time in their lives. Jar has built an app that is poised to help them &#8212; with several intuitive ways including gamification &#8212; start their investment journey. We love the speed at which the team has been executing and how fast they are growing each week,&#8221; said Arjun Sethi, co-founder of Tribe Capital, in a statement.</p>
<p>Transactions and AUM on the Jar app are surging 350% each month, said Nishchay. The startup plans to broaden its product offerings in the coming days, he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today Y Combinator kicked off the Demo Day cycle for its Summer 2021 cohort. The collection of early-stage startups on day one-of-two alone numbered in the hundreds, meaning that we had to assemble a team here at TechCrunch just to cover it all.</p>
<p>But before we get into notes on each company that presented, a few notes on the cohort itself. Per Y Combinator leadership, the 377 (!) startups in this cohort have founders from 47 different countries, and 37% of the founders in this cohort were from underrepresented groups (which YC&#8217;s Michael Seibel says the accelerator defines as Black, Latinx or female.)</p>
<p>The international breakdown of the batch parallels that of this past winter. Nearly 50% of YC startups are based outside of the United States, with India, U.K. and Mexico making up the largest part of that percentage.</p>
<p>What follows is a list of the 180+ companies in the order that they pitched, and our notes on each pitch. TechCrunch will follow up this post with a list of our favorites. So, enjoy the below and happy hunting to all the founders and investors!</p>
<p>(Oh, and if you&#8217;re somehow hungry for more, don&#8217;t worry: another equally huge batch is scheduled to present tomorrow.)</p>
<h2>Day One companies</h2>
<p><a href="https://endla.com/">Endla</a>: Software meant to increase production and reduce costs associated with oil/gas wells. The company says it can save about $40,000 per well per year.</p>
<p><a href="https://phykos.co/">Phykos</a>: Autonomously grows seaweed to capture carbon, selling offsets to companies to uphold their climate commitments. Built by GoogleX mechanical and software engineers.</p>
<p><a href="http://madeats.co/">MadEats</a>: MadEats is an online ghost kitchen food delivery service in the Philippines. It has built several major local restaurant concepts and is building affordable, high-margin brands to serve direct to consumers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.financialchoice.com/">Financial Choice</a>: Financial Choice wants to boost the yields that consumers can earn from their checking accounts. In today’s market, cash earns incredibly low yields at rest. So, Financial Choice wants to invest checking account funds, while preserving access for users for when they need their money. The startup claims to have reached $4.4 million AUM thus far. We’re curious about the tax implications of the model, but the concept of earning more yield from liquid holdings is attractive.</p>
<p><a href="https://atlas.kitchen/">Atlas</a>: This startup is building software to let restaurants in Southeast Asia move more operations online, aiming to help restaurants create a closer bond with consumers that food delivery platforms have pulled away.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.withapollo.com/">Apollo</a>: A debit card that rewards users with stocks. Making purchases with the card earns the user a fractional share of a stock, plus &#8220;a chance to win&#8221; full shares.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.strivemath.com/">Strive Education</a>: With 3.7 million students in Asia, Strive Education uses 1:1 live classes to teach high school math through coding games. The company has $20,000 monthly recurring revenue and is growing 30% monthly.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196605" style="width: 768px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196605" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2196605 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/plusidentity.jpg" alt="" width="758" height="418" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/plusidentity.jpg 758w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/plusidentity.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/plusidentity.jpg?resize=300,165 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/plusidentity.jpg?resize=680,375 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/plusidentity.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 758px) 100vw, 758px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196605" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brex</p></div></p>
<p><a href="https://www.plusidentity.com/">PlusIdentity</a>: A password manager for startups, focused first on a Slack app that hits the high points of enterprise-level options (Okta) and consumer apps (LastPass). Only one month old, they already have 10 startups signed up and aim to be the next identity management platform for the startup world.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hitpayapp.com/">HitPay</a>: HitPay brings together two startup trends that have captured investor interest in recent quarters, namely no-code tooling and payments. The company wants to help SMBs in the South East Asian market accept payments from what it describes as a market that is fragmented. So far the company has reached $5.4 million in total payment volume (TPV) per month, a figure that yields $35,000 in monthly revenue.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aoadx.com/">AOA Dx Inc.</a>: AOA is building blood tests that help detect ovarian cancer early when survival rates are much higher. The founding team has two successful exits in the health startup space behind them and their product has already shown early success in a 600-person patient study.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cococart.co/">Cococart</a>: An online store builder that claims to have a setup process 10x faster than Shopify. The team says they&#8217;re currently working with over 2,000 active merchants.</p>
<p><a href="https://metaphor.so/">Metaphor</a>: What’s the metaphor for taking on Google? Metaphor is a language-model-based search engine. With this technology, users can search by ideas; think queries like “one of the most promising startups in the health tech space is” or “a smart essay about love is” instead of relying solely on keywords.</p>
<p><a href="http://tinai.com/">Tinai</a>: Ninety percent of small businesses in Vietnam still keep at least some of their financial records using pen and paper. Tinai aims to help modernize this with a digital bookkeeping service — and after only six weeks they have 1,200 active merchants and are handling USD$1.8 million worth of transactions.</p>

<p><a href="https://turionspace.com/">Turion Space</a>: Space trash removal! It’s a well-known issue that the orbit around Earth is littered with crap of all sorts, junk that is circling the planet at high speeds. Turion Space wants to build spacecraft that can get that shit out of orbit, and it also wants to service satellites and mine asteroids. You have to start somewhere, we suppose. Space companies are hard to judge at this stage, but we can say that the TAM Turion is pursuing is, well, as big as the planet.</p>
<p><a href="https://cero.ai/">Cero</a>: The team at Cero is building software to help hospitals automate communications with patients over WhatsApp. The team has banked $95,000 in monthly revenue helping their customers communicate with more than 600,000 patients.</p>

<p><a href="https://warpfy.com/">Warpfy</a>: Built by the founders of Wayfair Asia, Warpfy is on a mission to acquire and grow e-commerce stores into global brands. It will help brands bring distribution multichannel, breaking out of a tradition of Amazon roll-ups as a key way to grow.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.momomedical.com/">Momo Medical</a>: With a growing elderly population worldwide, nurses in hospitals and long-term care facilities are stretched thin. Momo Medical has made an IoT-equipped bed sensor that tells nurses who is sleeping, who is rising, and who may be having trouble, all in one interface. The increase in productivity could help offset the worldwide nursing shortage. They&#8217;re already signing contracts and have $250,000 ARR.</p>

<p><a href="https://milkyway.ai/">Milky Way AI</a>: No, Milky Way AI is not building computer intelligence to scan the stars. Instead, it’s building computer intelligence to scan the <i>shelves</i>. Perhaps Milky Way refers to the candy bar, instead of the interstellar body. The startup has built a mobile app that allows CPG companies to scan shelves and check what goods are in stock. Per the startup, it has four brands working with it today wirth $11,000 in monthly revenue. And two new contracts that could push its revenues into the seven figures.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.slip.so/">Slip</a>: Slip is building a marketplace for top developers to create and monetize courses helping young coders hone their skills. The team is looking to get their product into the corporate learning space and get major tech companies providing their courses to employees.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mindfi.co/">MindFi</a>: A corporate wellness/mental health platform for companies in Asia, offering employees &#8220;microclasses,&#8221; guided exercises and assessments meant to help with mental well-being.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.joindeed.com/">Deed</a>: A modern, super pretty take on the backend powering your employee&#8217;s charity/donation/volunteering system. Handles donation matching, volunteer hours, etc. Already working with companies like Airbnb, Stripe, Doordash and Adidas. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/19/deed-pulls-your-employers-charity-and-volunteer-program-into-slack-to-keep-it-front-of-mind/">We wrote about Deed here.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://genei.io/">Genei</a>: Too long, didn’t read? Good, meet Genei. This startup has created a way for content writers to get cliff notes on background reading to boost productivity, and speed up the time it takes to comprehend a complicated topic. Automatic summarization may be the use case that robots and writing can actually pull off, versus the controversial world of article generation. It’s starting by selling to freelance writers and has $9,000 in monthly recurring revenue.</p>
<p><a href="https://orderli.com/en">Orderli</a>: It’s Square, but for Europe! Easy to explain, probably super hard to build. Orderli works as a point-of-sale system and is already in 57 bars and pubs and pulling in over $600,000 in receipts.</p>
<p><a href="https://portao3.com.br/">Portão 3</a>: The market for products to make corporate travel and expenses is never-ending, as most existing products are awful. Portão 3 (Gate 3) wants to make better travel and expense software for the Latin American market. The company is notable in that <i>expense</i> management and <i>travel</i> management are sometimes distinct products. Brex is not Travelocity, for example. But by bringing both together the company could offer a more cohesive solution than other products.</p>
<p><a href="https://pactima.com/">Pactima</a>: Pactima is building an e-signature platform that reaches the use cases that DocuSign can&#8217;t, letting users tap real-time video-signing when a witness is required as well as in-person digital signing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.shopscribe.com/">Shopscribe</a>: Subscriptions for local shops! Think coffee shops pre-selling a weekly coffee at a discount, or nail salons selling regular manicures. Shopscribe takes a 10% cut of each subscription.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.preki.com/">Preki</a>: A way to help LatAm businesses create cheap, easy-to-use websites. In July, Preki hit $4,000 in GMV, and its Shopify-competitive software currently services 208 merchants.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alephcrm.com/">Aleph Solutions</a>: A tool for offline businesses to bring their services online. Aleph Solutions is building an online marketplace for resellers, which it monetizes through a SaaS and transaction fee whenever a sale occurs. It revealed 18% month-over-month growth, with $115,000 monthly recurring revenue.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.datlo.com/">Datlo</a>: Datlo is building a data analysis service for Latin American companies. It wants to help customers’ sales and marketing teams import large datasets, sort them and visualize the results. So far it has landed two large Brazilian banks as customers and reached $20,000 MRR. Our question is how the product is tuned for the Latin American market as opposed to the larger world. Regardless, it sounds cool.</p>
<p><a href="https://trackchain.io/">TrackChain</a>: TrackChain is an online freight marketplace for Latin America that&#8217;s looking to streamline logistics for shippers and carriers moving freight through the region. The company currently has 600 carrier companies onboard.</p>
<p><a href="https://chari.co/">Chari</a>: Next-day item procurement for small retailers in North Africa. The company says it&#8217;s seeing a monthly GMV of $1.4 million after launching 18 months ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.palenca.com/">Palenca</a>: Palenca lets employers in LatAm share and check employment records, do background checks and identity verification, then offer financial services based on that data. You know they&#8217;re going to be a success because, as the founder noted, they&#8217;re literally the only option for this! Hopefully this kind of accountability benefits the workers as well as the employers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flow.club/">Flow Club</a>: A virtual coworking space modeled on group fitness classes and social clubs intended to motivate people to work in sprints. Join for a few hours when you need that push to stop procrastinating — and who doesn&#8217;t every once in a while in this day and age?</p>
<p><a href="http://onfolk.com/">Onfolk</a>: The success of Gusto in the United States in terms of both securing capital and customers is drawing startups into creating similar companies targeted for their home markets. Onfolk is building a Gusto-like service for Europe. Given the number of companies in the larger EU, it won’t lack for TAM. And since it intends to monetize through B2B SaaS, investors shouldn’t struggle to understand how it intends to scale.</p>
<p><a href="http://pidedirecto.mx/">Pide Directo</a>: The startup is building a white-labeled solution for local businesses in Latin America to sell and deliver to their customers, teaming an online storefront, marketing service and delivery network.</p>
<p><a href="https://usecodex.com/">Codex</a>: Deeper collaboration for programmers, built especially for remote/async teams. Lets you, for example, highlight code in your editor, determine who wrote it and request information without switching screens.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196638" style="width: 734px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196638" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2196638 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tablevibe.jpg" alt="" width="724" height="614" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tablevibe.jpg 724w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tablevibe.jpg?resize=150,127 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tablevibe.jpg?resize=300,254 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tablevibe.jpg?resize=680,577 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tablevibe.jpg?resize=50,42 50w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196638" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tablevibe</p></div></p>
<p><a href="https://www.tablevibe.co/">Tablevibe</a>: Customer loyalty is an important objective for restaurants, so Tablevibe wants to find ways to better track and engage folks while they’re chowing down. The startup helps capture feedback through QR-code-based surveys, exchanging loyalty incentives for insights. So far, the early-stage startup has landed 100 paying customers, tracked 25,000 experiences and positioned itself ahead of the industry’s digitization beyond Toast.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lernit.mx/">Lernit</a>: Lernit is a corporate learning platform aimed at the LatAm market. Companies can train their employees and track their performance gains, simply and with plenty of built-in features.</p>
<p><a href="https://at.cafe/">Café</a>: The remote work boom is now so entrenched that startups are being built to make remote work better. Cafe is one of them. The company wants to help remote and hybrid workers figure out where to work from each day. Apparently the answer is not, well, in your home office. The company has $8,000 in MRR and sees a future where offices are optional and not mandatory.</p>
<p><a href="https://buhocontable.com/">Búho Contable</a>: The startup is building a TurboTax for Mexico, building out a tech-enabled tax filing and accounting firm geared toward helping small businesses in the country navigate the process.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.payflow.es/">Payflow</a>: A mobile app that allows employees in Spain and Latin America to &#8220;get paid whenever they want,&#8221; rather than waiting for their paycheck to come in monthly bursts. Free for employees, it&#8217;s sold to companies as a perk. The company says there are currently 40,000 employees on the platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://tryargus.com/">Argus</a>: A compliance tool for employees with investment restrictions. Personal trading can be complicated for employees at banks, law firms and crypto exchanges due to potential conflicts of interests and various other restrictions. Eventually, Argus wants to become an investment adviser for these employees — right now, it’s just starting by helping them not screw up.</p>
<p><a href="http://getcabal.com/">Cabal</a>: Cabal is a private workspace for founders, investors and advisers to update one another and organize things like equity distributions. Sure, you could do it in Slack or something, but this one is built with the startup and stakeholder crew in mind. Plus it&#8217;s cool to be able to say &#8220;join our Cabal.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://hedgehog.app/">Hedgehog</a>: Back to the robo-adviser theme, Hedgehog is an SEC-approved service that helps consumers buy crypto products. It claims to offer trades at the best possible price, and $70 million in AUM. Personalized crypto advice is a neat idea, given that mostly what we’re told on Twitter is either “hodl” or “go fuck yourself.” If Hedgehog can scale its AUM, Coinbase might swoop in with its checkbook.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.examedi.com/">Examedi</a>: Examedi is a home healthcare marketplace for Latin America helping consumers match with healthcare providers and take at-home medical exams on their own schedule. The company grew 160% in August.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.potion.ai/">Potion</a>: AI to help R&amp;D teams (starting with beauty companies) formulate their products, replacing processes that generally require lengthy trial-and-error with simulation.</p>
<p><a href="https://trii.co/">Trii</a>: Launched six months ago, Trii is a U.S. and local stock investment platform for retail investors in LatAm. Across its 30,000 users, the startup has processed more than $60,000 in transactions and has $10 million in assets under management. Trii looks to circumvent local brokers, who have high fees and required minimums, with $2 per trade fee and no required minimum.</p>
<p><a href="https://synder.com/">Synder</a>: E-commerce companies need to do accounting too, but as we&#8217;ve seen suggested by other companies, it&#8217;s not particularly easy or simple. Synder aims to automate as much as possible, looping in all the major sales platforms and doing the bean-counting magic every company needs to do to make sure they&#8217;re actually making money. With 3,900 customers already, it seems plenty of folks were waiting for something like this.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oneschema.co/">OneSchema</a>: CSV imports can be a bit of a mess, and cleaning up data is a huge pain in the backside. OneSchema wants to hammer on both issues at the same time with a spreadsheet UI that can correct CSV data, in theory allowing customers to upload data with fewer errors. Excel holds up much of the modern world, and lots of folks stuck making Microsoft’s spreadsheet tool work for their needs could use some help. Let’s see if OneSchema can help.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2196639" style="width: 636px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2196639" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2196639 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/onebrief.jpg" alt="" width="626" height="500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/onebrief.jpg 626w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/onebrief.jpg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/onebrief.jpg?resize=300,240 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/onebrief.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2196639" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Onebrief</p></div></p>
<p><a href="https://onebrief.com/">Onebrief:</a> Talk about purpose built. Onebrief is a tool built to help military headquarters with their joint planning needs, while keeping things presentation-ready in order to boot out PowerPoint. The company says it recently signed a $350,000 deal with a four-star military HQ.</p>
<p><a href="https://costcertified.com/">CostCertified</a>: CostCertified is building a marketplace for players in the residential construction world, allowing suppliers, contractors and consumers to connect inside a single platform, ensuring that estimates stay accurate and minimizing surprises.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.legion.health/">Legion Health</a>: A B2B marketplace that helps psychiatrists and therapists sell their time by the hour — which, as the company points out, lets these professionals take on extra hours while allowing hospitals and telehealth companies to scale considerably without more full-time headcount. Co-founder Yash Patel says that five weeks post-launch the company has already signed contracts (with groups like Sesame and Billings Clinic) worth $3 million in annual value.</p>
<p><a href="https://ahazou.com/">Ahazou</a>: A SaaS-platform for local businesses in LatAm bring businesses online through services such as payment processing, digital marketing and reviews. It is the latest startup aimed at helping local shops, from nail salons to painters, prepare for a post-COVID landscape. Over 16,000 companies pay for Ahazou’s software, resulting in $1.2 million in annual recurring revenue. Still, it’s just a drop in the bucket for what the team estimates will be a $4 billion market of local business in LatAm.</p>
<p><a href="https://senddots.com/">Dots</a>: If you&#8217;re a seller or service provider, the platform you sell on may very well not want to pay you in the way you want to be paid, whether that&#8217;s old-school ACH or instant transfer via Venmo or CashApp. Dots provides a single API to marketplaces that lets them pay out via any of those methods and more, simplifying the finances of everyone involved.</p>
<p><a href="https://palettehq.com/en">PaletteHQ</a>: If you haven’t worked in a sales team, you might not be aware of how the commission process works. It varies company to company, and can change based on evolving corporate goals and product releases. So managing a commission setup that sales folks can understand &#8212; and therefore find motivating &#8212; is complex. Palette wants to shake up the issue with software and has reached $10,000 in MRR thus far. Twist: Sales people selling sales-focused software to sales team leaders? Surely that’s an advantageous market perch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.inai.io/">Inai</a>: A no-code platform for handling payments globally. It hooks into your payment providers (like Stripe, Paypal), fraud tools (like Sift) and tax tools and wraps them all up in a easy to configure dashboard.</p>
<p><a href="https://artillery.io/">Artillery</a>: Pitched as a &#8220;modern load testing&#8221; platform, Artillery hammers your product with traffic (millions of requests per second originating across 13+ different regions) so there are no surprises later.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.breadcrumbs.io/">Breadcrumbs.io</a>: Analyzes customer and prospect data to help companies identify hidden revenue opportunities. The no-code scoring engine has attracted $185,000 in annual recurring revenue to help startups make sure they don’t leave any lucrative breadcrumbs behind. Non-obvious revenue may just pique investor interest, especially when it comes to serving their portfolio companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.protex.ai/">Protex AI</a>: Protex AI is a computer vision company that identifies dangers in industrial workplaces before they become a problem. Maybe that&#8217;s workers too close to dangerous processes, or a machine starting to fail or something catastrophic — catching them even a second or two earlier might avoid disaster. Their first install caught 60% more safety violations than human monitoring, an increase that might alone justify the company&#8217;s $25,000 per site fee.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.containiq.com/">ContainIQ</a>: An easy to install platform for monitoring Kubernetes events and metrics over time, with hooks like Slack support for alerting your team when things break.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.epsilon3.io/">Epsilon3, Inc.</a>: Built by a team with hundreds of rocket launches under their belt, Epsilon3 is an &#8220;operating system&#8221; for spacecraft launches (and other complex operations) — effectively taking the ridiculously complicated but too often still paper-based procedures/workflows and making them digital.</p>
<p><a href="https://hotglue.xyz/">Hotglue</a>: A developer tool designed to help create native SaaS integrations with data sources in minutes, aiming to help users sidestep jumping through development and maintenance hoops.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for August 31, 2021. Today the TechCrunch machine was busy covering the first day of Y Combinator’s Demo Day event, so expect to see all sorts of coverage on the site after this hits your inbox. We’ll bring you a recap in tomorrow’s edition, though we do have a first taste down below.</p>
<p>In Disrupt news, TechCrunch is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/kai-fu-lee-and-chen-qiufan-will-share-their-vision-of-our-ai-powered-future-at-disrupt/">bringing an AI investor and a science-fiction author together</a> and will have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/fundraising-for-your-startup-weve-got-you-covered-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2021/">lots on deck for startups currently raising external capital</a>. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/databricks-raises-1-6b-at-38b-valuation-as-it-blasts-past-600m-arr/">Databricks is now worth $38B:</a> </strong>Data and AI unicorn Databricks confirmed its previously reported financing event today, raising $1.6 billion at a $38 billion valuation. TechCrunch spoke with the company’s CEO about what the money&#8217;s for, and we dug a bit more deeply into its revenue results. The <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/the-hyperactive-late-stage-market-should-keep-the-startup-investing-game-afoot/">late-stage market has been busy</a></strong>, but this Databricks round is big even by today’s venture standards.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/this-yc-summer-batch-features-the-largest-group-of-african-startups-yet/">More African startups than ever in YC batch:</a></strong> As we write, Demo Day is ongoing, so most of our first-day coverage will be finished too late to include. But we got a look at the African startups in the summer batch, and there are more than ever. Given <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/african-startups-join-global-funding-boom-as-fintech-shines/">how active the African startup market is proving this year</a></strong>, we’re not surprised.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/tiger-global-in-talks-to-make-apna-indias-fastest-unicorn/">Apna could be India’s next unicorn:</a> </strong>Focusing on upskilling Indian consumers, Apna could become a unicorn if a Tiger Global-led round comes to fruition. TechCrunch reports that the round could be worth $100 million at a valuation of more than $1 billion. Edtech in India remains one of the key startup narratives in recent years.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Because this is the last day of August, we presume that the summer lull in funding events has come and gone. Not that we really noticed a downtick in volume, frankly, but all the same, expect things to get even crazier in the coming weeks. Here’s a sampling of the rounds that we covered today:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/uk-based-heroes-raises-200m-to-buy-up-more-amazon-merchants-for-its-roll-up-play/"><strong>$200M more to roll-up Amazon merchants:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Beyond Indian edtech companies, another trend that has raised nigh-infinite funds this year is startups raising capital to buy up smaller e-commerce merchants, often with a focus on those selling on Amazon. Heroes is the latest to raise capital for the concept, with the U.K.-based startup adding a few hundred million to its accounts in a single go.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/whoop-raises-another-200m-for-its-athlete-focused-fitness-wearable/"><strong>Whoop, the Peloton of Apple Watches, raises $200M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If you are a fitness-wearable user, you may be familiar with Whoop. The company’s athlete-focused wristband has helped Whoop raise more than $400 million, now valuing the company at $3.6 billion. That’s many duckets for a fitness wearable. But as Whoop has a software fee bundled into its hardware &#8212; hence our Peloton analogy &#8212; it is not simply another hardware company.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/compounds-foods-brews-up-4-5m-to-make-coffee-without-beans/"><strong>Synthetic coffee is coming:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Maricel Saenz, the founder and CEO of Compound Foods, wants to create and sell coffee sans beans. Why? Well, climate change is making growing coffee beans harder, and the process is hard on the environment to boot. So why not just synthesize your morning java? I am willing to try this out, with the caveat that coffee is delicious so it’s going to take a little convincing for me to change my routines.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/borzo-a-delivery-startup-which-focuses-on-emerging-economies-raises-35m/"><strong>Borzo wants to bring on-demand to more markets:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Delivery service Dostavista is rebranding to Borzo, bringing its multicountry business under a single brand. The startup, per TechCrunch, was founded in 2012 and has a customer base of 2 million.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/quips-new-100m-round-will-usher-in-more-than-just-clean-teeth/"><strong>Former TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Alley company Quip raises $100M:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Quip is best known as a toothbrush company, but it hit profitability last year, expanded its product line and landed nine figures in new capital. The company today offers a host of oral cleaning products as well as invisible teeth aligners.</li>
<li>To close out our startup coverage today, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/peak-raises-75m-for-a-platform-that-helps-non-tech-companies-build-ai-applications/"><strong>Peak has raised $75 million to help non-tech companies build AI apps</strong></a>. The Manchester, England-based Peak wants to help companies that lack in-house AI talent apply the software technique to their own businesses. SoftBank Vision Fund 2 led the latest investment, which the company intends to use to scale its staff and hit up new markets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>6 tips for establishing your startup’s global supply chain</h2>
<p>The barrier to entry for launching hardware startups has fallen; if you can pull off a successful crowdfunding campaign, you&#8217;re likely savvy enough to find a factory overseas that can build your widgets to spec.</p>
<p>But global supply chains are fragile: No one expected an off-course container ship to block the Suez Canal for six days. Due to the pandemic, importers are paying almost $18,000 for shipping containers from China today that cost $3,300 a year ago.</p>
<p>After spending a career spinning up supply chains on three continents, Liteboxer CEO Jeff Morin authored a guide for Extra Crunch for hardware founders.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you’re clear-eyed about the challenges and apply some rigor and forethought to the process, the end result can be hard to match,&#8221; Morin says.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The total cost of the deal came to $1 billion, giving the Russian company 100% ownership over all four businesses.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Russian internet and ride-hail giant Yandex has acquired Uber&#8217;s stake in its Self-Driving Group (SDG), as well as Uber&#8217;s indirect interest in Yandex.Eats, Yandex.Lavka and Yandex.Delivery. The total cost of the deal came to $1 billion, giving the Russian company 100% ownership over all four businesses.</p>
<p>Yandex SDG is an autonomous technology spinout from MLU B.V., the ride-hailing and food delivery joint venture Yandex formed with Uber in 2018 by merging Yandex.Taxi and Uber&#8217;s Russian operations. At the time, Uber had a 36.6% stake in the new company. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/04/yandex-spins-out-self-driving-car-unit-from-its-uber-jv-invests-150m-into-newco/">when SDG was spun out into a separate business</a>, Uber was left with an 18.2% stake in the company, which has just been bought out by Yandex. Yandex also purchased Uber&#8217;s 33.5% collective interest in Yandex&#8217;s food delivery service, last-mile logistics service and 15-minute convenience store delivery service.</p>
<p>Back in 2019, Yandex and Uber were reportedly considering an<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-28/yandex-uber-jv-in-talks-with-morgan-stanley-goldman-for-ipo"> IPO for their JV</a>, which Morgan Stanley estimated to be valued at around $7.7 billion. <span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue;">Yandex says autonomous driving technology is &#8220;highly synergistic to the Yandex ecosystem, which includes ride-hailing, e-commerce and food-tech businesses.&#8221; It makes sense that the company would want to control all of that potential growth. Uber, which reported a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/how-uber-plans-to-rebound-from-massive-q2-losses-stemming-from-driver-incentives/">Q2 loss of $509 million before EBITDA this year</a>, might be looking to make a lucrative exit and refocus its priorities closer to home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue;">&#8220;This acquisition will enable Yandex to further increase its capacity for strategic management and flexibility when it comes to self-driving technology,&#8221; a Yandex spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;It will unlock further growth potential for both Yandex and Yandex SDG, creating new sources of value for shareholders.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The acquisitions are part of a larger restructuring of the MLU B.V. and Yandex SDG joint ventures, according to <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001552781-21-000695/">Uber&#8217;s SEC filing on Monday</a>. They will happen in two stages. Stage 1, which is expected to close by the end of Q3 this year, will give Yandex a 4.5% interest in the newly restructured MLU, which will focus on mobility businesses like ride-hailing and car-sharing. This gives Yandex a total of 71% ownership in the JV, 2.8% of which is reserved for an employee equity incentive program. Uber&#8217;s total 18.2% stake in SDG is also expected to be sold during the first stage.</p>
<p>Stage 2, which is expected to close by the end of this year, includes the demerger of Yandex.Eats, Yandex.Lavka and Yandex.Delivery from MLU and subsequent acquisition of Uber’s interest in these businesses.</p>
<p>Yandex will also receive a two-year American call option to acquire the rest of Uber&#8217;s interest in MLU at a more or less fixed price of $1.8 billion, depending on agreed increases over the option period. This number will increase to $2 billion if exercised in 2023. The Russian company will also continue to use the Uber brand exclusively in Russia and other countries until August 2030.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Yandex will also get an extension of the current license for the exclusive right to use the Uber brand in Russia and certain other countries until August 2030, assuming the exercise of the option. Yandex&#8217;s stock was up 5.16% on Tuesday at market close.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of Hollywood&#8217;s biggest talent agencies is getting into the NFT game.</p>
<p>Larva Labs, the creator of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/the-cult-of-cryptopunks/">CryptoPunks</a>, just signed with United Talent Agency (UTA) in a representation deal that will bring one of the earliest and most iconic NFT projects into the entertainment and branding worlds.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say that it is one of the first opportunities for an IP that fully originated in crypto-world to enter a broader entertainment space, and they earned it,&#8221; head of UTA Digital Assets Lesley Silverman<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/uta-cryptopunks-nft-film-tv-vieo-games-1235005392/"> told The Hollywood Reporter</a>. &#8220;They really have hit the zeitgeist in a tremendous way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deal could see CryptoPunks popping up across film, TV, video games and other licensing areas. Larva Labs&#8217; other art projects, Meebits and Autoglyphs, will also be represented by UTA moving forward. The terms of the deal weren&#8217;t disclosed.</p>
<p>As speculative investment in NFTs explodes, CryptoPunks remain one of the most recognizable — and valuable — pioneers in the space. Larva Labs launched 10,000 of the individual algorithmically generated pixelated figures on the Ethereum blockchain back in 2017.</p>
<p>To the untrained eye, and arguably to the trained eye too, CryptoPunks are just little pixelated portraits of different characters, some wearing pirate hats, others in aviator glasses smoking pipes. But to the crypto world, punks are a social signifier, communicating early investment into NFTs, personal style and, importantly, wealth.</p>
<p>The value of CryptoPunks skyrocketed from zero (they were initially given away for free) and now even the least expensive collectible punks run for hundreds of thousands of dollars, with the most valuable selling for millions. In May, a bundle of nine CryptoPunks sold for just under $17 million in an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/11/cryptopunks-nft-bundle-goes-for-17-million-in-christies-auction/">auction run by Christie&#8217;s</a>. And last week, even Visa got in the game, spending $150,000 on CryptoPunk #7610, a digital illustration sporting a mohawk and green face makeup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>It&#8217;s noteworthy that a traditional talent agency best known for representing A-list celebrities is getting into the NFT game, but it&#8217;s not the group&#8217;s first time getting its feet wet in the wild world of crypto. Earlier this month, UTA <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/uta-cryptopunks-nft-film-tv-vieo-games-1235005392/">signed a company called Rally</a> that runs a platform that helps creators issue branded social tokens that fans can spend on merch and exclusive content.</p>

They both introduced ephemeral story features that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/">were pretty fleeting</a>. LinkedIn <a href="https://adage.com/article/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news/linkedin-tells-advertisers-it-shutting-down-stories-videos/2361766">announced today</a> that it will suspend its Stories feature on September 30 and begin working on a different way to add short-form videos to the platform.</p>
<p>LinkedIn announced <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/update-marketing-linkedin-stories-whats-next-/?trk=public_post-content_share-article">the upcoming change</a> to warn advertisers who might have already purchased ads that would run in between Stories. Those will instead be shared on the LinkedIn feed, but users who promoted or sponsored Stores directly from their page will need to remake them.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>LinkedIn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/linkedin-launches-stories-plus-zoom-bluejeans-and-teams-video-integrations-as-part-of-wider-redesign/">introduced Stories</a> in September, around the same time that Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">rolled out</a> Fleets to all users before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/">doing away</a> with the feature. This was part of a larger web and mobile redesign, which also added integrations with Zoom, BlueJeans and Teams to help professionals stay connected while working from home. But according to LinkedIn, these temporary posts didn&#8217;t quite work on the platform.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="eyoUAVh3pz"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/">Fleet your last Fleet — the Twitter feature vanishes today</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Fleet your last Fleet — the Twitter feature vanishes today&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/embed/#?secret=eyoUAVh3pz" data-secret="eyoUAVh3pz" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;In developing Stories, we assumed people wouldn’t want informal videos attached to their profile, and that ephemerality would reduce barriers that people feel about posting,&#8221; wrote LinkedIn&#8217;s Senior Director of Product Liz Li in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/whats-next-linkedin-stories-video-liz-li/">a blog post today</a>. &#8220;Turns out, you want to create lasting videos that tell your professional story in a more personal way and that showcase both your personality and expertise.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Li also noted that users want &#8220;more creative tools to make engaging videos.&#8221; While Stories included stickers and prompts, users wanted more creative functionality.</p>
<p>If LinkedIn is successful in its plans to create a short-form video feature, it would join platforms like Snapchat and Instagram that have built their own TikTok-like feeds. Sure, most users probably don&#8217;t post the same content on LinkedIn and their personal social media accounts, but there actually are some <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@erinmcgoff?lang=en">prominent TikTokers</a> sharing career advice, interview tips and resume guidance, so LinkedIn&#8217;s pivot to video might not be as weird as it seems.</p>
