										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla has started taking orders for a cheaper standard range version of the Model Y in an apparent reversal by CEO Elon Musk who earlier this year seemed to put plans to release the vehicle on hold. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electrek was the <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/01/07/tesla-model-y-standard-range-rwd-third-row-option/">first to report</a> that Tesla had updated its website to include the Model Y standard range, which will start at $41,990. That’s nearly $9,000 cheaper than the long range version that is currently sold by Tesla. The model Y standard range is a rear-wheel drive while the long range and even more expensive performance versions comes in all-wheel drive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cheaper price comes with a lower estimated EPA range of 244 miles compared to the 326 miles in the long range version. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/tesla-motors" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="tesla-motors">Tesla <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> said nearly two years ago that it planned to begin producing the standard range version of the Model Y in spring 2021. But in July, Musk tweeted that the variant had been removed from the website because the lower range &#8220;would be unacceptably low (&lt; 250 mile EPA).&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">No, as range would be unacceptably low (&lt; 250 mile EPA)</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1282496094908243968?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Tesla is now offering a 7-seat option for the Model Y as well, according to updates on its website.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/bitcoin-llc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="bitcoin-llc">Bitcoin <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> fans across the country are rallying against a common enemy, the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/">FinCEN</a>).</p>
<p>US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, one of President Donald Trump’s closest associates, has been working overtime since Thanksgiving to push several crypto regulations through before the Biden administration takes over on January 20, 2021.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fincen" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fincen">FinCEN <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-28437.pdf">statements</a> list the usual reasons for financial regulations, an effort to curtail terror financing, sanctions evasion and black market activity related to drugs and weapons, without any mention of new evidence justifying the <a href="https://www.coincenter.org/comments-to-the-financial-crimes-enforcement-network-on-requirements-for-certain-transactions-involving-convertible-virtualcurrency-or-digital-assets/">unusual urgency</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>These include a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195834/cryptocurrency-fincen-regulations-private-wallets">FinCEN proposal</a> that would require exchanges to store records involving transactions over $3,000 sent to any personal wallets, plus report users to FinCEN for cumulative transactions worth more than $10,000 in a single day. For comparison, <a href="https://finance.zacks.com/federal-banking-rules-withdrawing-large-sums-cash-1696.html">banks are required</a> to flag cash withdrawals over $10,000, not transactions within the banking system itself, and banks are not required to keep tabs on where the customer spends the cash taken out of the system.</p>
<p>Plus, a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/fincen-foreign-crypto-exchange-disclosure-rule">complementary FinCEN statement</a> proposed requiring Americans to report crypto holdings worth more than $10,000 at any foreign service provider. Although the details of this second initiative are still vague, it’s clear the Treasury wants to make special note of the know-your-customer information for anyone dealing with thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/01/eff-fincen-stop-pushing-more-financial-surveillance">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> called this a “push for more financial surveillance” without any need for warrants or suspicion. (Bitcoin users already need to report their holdings in their taxes, just like any other asset.) As such, over 65,615 crypto advocates submitted <a href="https://beta.regulations.gov/document/FINCEN-2020-0020-0001">critical statements</a> to FinCEN, including companies like <a href="https://twitter.com/DigitalAssets/status/1346822040368644102">Fidelity</a> and Square. Square’s <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/fincen-letter">statement</a> said the company “would be required to collect unreliable data about people [recipients] who have not opted into our service or signed up as our customers.”</p>
<p>The Washington D.C. nonprofit <a href="https://www.coincenter.org/a-midnight-rule-for-cryptocurrency-transaction-reports/">Coin Center</a> issued a statement saying this proposal would also limit American access to decentralized services, where users may not know their counterparty or network operators. Peter Van Valkenburgh, Coin Center’s research director, told TechCrunch the proposal is highly unusual because it only allowed for 15 days of comments, instead of the standard 60-day period, for a rule that would impose more data collection requirements on crypto companies than other financial institutions.</p>

<p>“It requires the exchange to collect, retain and report extra information that they don’t have to for a cash transaction, like the name and physical address of a counterparty,” he said. “It’s on a timeline to complete this process, as far as we know right now, before the new administration. That means the rule would be final. The new administration could issue a new rule, and overturn that past rule, but that’s a much more difficult process.”</p>
<p>Incoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, sworn in the first week of January, <a href="https://twitter.com/CynthiaMLummis/status/1346200913359286272">tweeted</a> it was “ridiculous” for the Treasury to have this unusually short comment period. Likewise, <a href="https://www.coincenter.org/app/uploads/2020/12/Congressional-Letter-to-Treasury-123120-1.pdf">nine members of Congress</a> issued a letter warning this hasty rulemaking over the winter holidays undermined the legitimacy of the process.</p>
<p>These proposals aren’t just sudden, they’re also so vague that they appear poorly researched. Both Square <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/crypto-30f5" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="crypto-30f5">Crypto <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> developer <a href="https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt/status/1341084526123102208">Matt Corallo</a> and MIT Media Lab director <a href="https://twitter.com/neha/status/1346273664006823936?s=20">Neha Narula</a> issued public statements saying the FinCEN proposals confused basic technical concepts about how bitcoin addresses work. This would make such regulations difficult to implement, burdening American companies with prohibitively high compliance precautions.</p>
<p>“Political motivations are always hard to discern, but public rumors have consistently indicated this is a personal push by Mnuchin, not further up or down,” Corallo said. “We’ll learn a lot about what the next few years look like based on what [incoming Secretary Janet] Yellen says and what new leadership at FinCEN looks like. There are a lot of things Yellen could decide, but it would be hard for her to do a worse job of building useful and practical regulations than Mnuchin’s last-minute attempts here.”</p>
<p>Van Valkenburgh said his nonprofit, and other crypto industry organizations like it, are prepared to challenge the ruling in court if the Trump administration fails to follow the legislative process. Namely, the Treasury is required to read and consider all of the public comments submitted by January 7, 2021, the arbitrary date set by the rulemakers themselves.</p>
<p>“They technically then have the power to issue the final rule, saying they considered all the comments,” he said. “But if it’s obvious that they didn’t consider all the comments, which I feel like it would be if the final rule came out any time before the new administration comes in, it would be very easy to argue in court that the requirement to read and consider all the comments has not been met.”</p>
<p>As it stands, Van Valkenburgh said it appears the outgoing administration intends to “saddle” the incoming administration with “chaos.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Roblox direct listing wwill lay down some groundwork for new conventional wisdom when it comes to pricing public listings and which methods are good to use.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">So it turns out that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/roblox" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="roblox">Roblox <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is worth $29.5 billion.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the lesson the market learned this week when the gaming platform company announced that it had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/robloxs-raises-at-29-5-billion-valuation-as-it-readies-for-direct-listing/">raised $520 million in an epic Series H</a>.</p>
<p>For a company valued at just $4 billion last February when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/roblox-raises-150m-series-g-led-by-andreessen-horowitz-now-valued-at-4b/">it raised $150 million in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz</a>, that new valuation could be considered a victory. But is it?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>For all the griping amongst private-market capitalists that public-market capitalists are ripping off their investments as they look to cross the private-public divide through an IPO, it&#8217;s hard to square a company&#8217;s valuation going from $4 billion to nearly $30 billion in just 11 months.</p>
<p>Sure, you could argue that Roblox enjoyed an epic 2020, thanks in part to COVID-19. That helped its valuation. But there&#8217;s a lot of space between $4 billion and $29.5 billion, and recall that its February Series B <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/what-is-roblox-worth/">valued Roblox at around 7.3x its Q4 2019 revenue run rate</a>.</p>
<p>The same company at its new $29.5 billion valuation is now priced at just over 30x its Q3 2020 run rate (the most recent quarter for which we <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm">have data today</a>).</p>

But it&#8217;s hard to fret heavily about private-market complaints concerning startup value when the IPO facilitators are hardly the only folks making trips to the bank with a wheelbarrow.</p>
<p>All that is preamble. This morning, let&#8217;s talk about Roblox&#8217;s flotation strategy. <em>Why </em>is the company raising private market money and then floating instead of raising public market money on its path to trading as a public company? And does its strategy solve the major flaws that the IPO process appears to have? Let&#8217;s get into it.</p>
<h2>The ol&#8217; raise-and-float</h2>
<p>One way to go public is to file an S-1, prepare a presentation, go on a roadshow, drive interest in your shares and work with bankers to price the shares you want to sell at a dollar amount all parties can agree to. The next morning, your shares begin to trade, and you count the money you raised.</p>
<p>That is a traditional IPO, admittedly simplified.</p>
<p>There are issues in there, namely that the price discovery mechanism has proved to be uncertain, especially when it comes to the public offerings of companies considered attractive investments by the active retail trading market. Why? The hotter the company, the fewer shares that are available for trade at the start of its life as a public firm — the very opposite of that which is happening on the demand side.</p>
<p>Lots of demand, few shares, and up goes the price. And then up go the complaints that Wall Street is a bunch of thieves. Hearing this from other capital players is always whimsical to some degree, but let&#8217;s stick to our theme.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The coronavirus pandemic challenged the status quo and completely changed normal life as we knew it. However, with these challenges have come new opportunities to adapt and participate differently in the world. One of the first trends was that cash is no longer accepted.</p>
<p>The transition to cashless transactions, which at first seemed minor, made my customer experience seamless. Going wallet-free made me wonder why I ever carried cash at all!</p>
<p>Cashless life has been widely adopted in Asian countries for quite some time, but it wasn’t universally adopted across the United States until the coronavirus pandemic. The convenience of cashless transactions just makes sense, but my hope is that this convenience doesn’t come at the cost of other aspects of commerce.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The transition to cashless transactions made my customer experience seamless.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Inaccessibility, fees and thoughtless spending are some of the potential problems that come to mind with cashless spending. For a truly cashless society, here are five key points for consideration:</p>
<h2>1. Payment processors currently have the upper hand, forcing fees onto customers</h2>
<p>For the sake of a cashless transaction, we have given up our last direct authentic connection with our favorite baristas, small businesses and independent brands. When I take out my credit card or phone to pay, I am not thinking about the fees that both myself and the merchant are paying to facilitate what was once a fee-less transaction. Losing this direct connection with my merchant has given payment processors the upper hand, allowing them to demand an unjustifiable fee of up to 3%.</p>
<p>With virtual payments, my cash is essentially in my phone and the barista is directly in front of me, but the transaction does not work like cash. The merchant will need to pay the fee on my transaction. If the cash revenue for that coffee shop used to be 20% of their revenue pre-COVID, they will now need to pay the fees on 20% of their revenue. Sadly, the merchant response over time is to raise prices. Historically, the adoption of a cashless exchange results in fees being passed through to the customer.</p>
<p>Through price increases across the board, the customer is always bailing the merchant out for the cost of the electronic, seamless, safer-than-ever money exchange. Furthermore, the customers are even &#8220;forced&#8221; to tip digitally from predefined settings, removing all meaning of tips as an emotional social contract. This new normal means that customers will end up paying $4 in a digital transaction for a coffee that used to cost $3 in cash.</p>
<h2>2. Platforms must adapt new models to forgo transaction fees</h2>
<p>Given that software and intelligent platforms have always lowered the cost of services when they are used at scale, why has this reduction of cost not yet applied to digital financial transactions? Customers need to demand that cashless transactions operate in the same way as cash transactions.</p>
<p>Even if we continue with a fee model, why would regular, loyal and verified customers always pay (directly or indirectly) the hefty cost of the exchange on top of the cost of credit? There should be a differentiation between these different types of transactions, regular or new, and appropriate fees that make sense.</p>
<h2>3. Product experiences must promote conscious spending</h2>
<p>Paying with digital or credit cards almost feels like paying with someone else’s money, which can be a dangerous feeling when considering that the user does not see this money spent instantly. Say your regular coffee costs $3. Paying for that coffee with cash is a very different experience than paying with a card or a digital wallet.</p>
<p>When you have a finite amount of cash in your pocket, the physical act (and sometimes mental pain) of spending makes the money feel different and more valuable than the invisible money that you spend via your credit or debit card. In many ways, the silent pain we endure while paying in cash has been subconsciously raising our awareness about our spending.</p>
<h2>4. Accessibility and use must extend to all</h2>
<p>The idea of a cashless society has thus far not been very inclusive to the unbanked and underbanked population. To support a new model, this underserviced sector needs to be able to utilize this software. A user needs to be able to walk into a grocery store and give the cashier $100 for them to upload the money to their virtual wallet.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a friend needs to be able to send $100 to their virtual wallet. For a cashless society to work, virtual payments need to work with ease and certainty that they will be accepted at any and all locations, just like cash.</p>
<h2>5. The path to an open wallet</h2>
<p>Have you ever ordered a $15 meal on a food delivery app, only for the total to end up over $25? Beyond the delivery fee, tips and taxes, delivery apps are pricing in extra fees to offset the fees charged by credit card and payment companies. In an effort to avoid these extra fees, apps like Lyft and Uber have begun deploying their own digital wallets supported by ACH transfers.</p>
<p>Sadly, consumers are unlikely to see the benefit until these wallets reach wide adoption, which is clearly not happening because no one wants yet another app-specific wallet.</p>
<h2>The way forward</h2>
<p>To truly empower the consumer, both Google and Apple should keep developing their digital wallets with an open API payment system to allow all apps to securely interact with it for free. This will transform the Google and Apple wallet and will better service the unbanked and underbanked populations instead of just being a gateway for credit cards.</p>
<p>This would further support the unbanked or underbanked population as they too would be able to utilize an open wallet that can be refilled with cash in person. I should be able to use the cash I have in my virtual wallet with any app, website or physical merchant without paying a fee. I should also be able refill the wallet from my bank account or directly deposit some of my paycheck into my phone wallet. Merchants would also benefit from wallet-to-pay by paying no fees to Google and Apple.</p>
<p>Instead, the mobile wallet creator could introduce a new business model focused on discovery and connecting users and merchants, charging merchants for the connections that they facilitate.</p>
<p>In a not-so-distant future, when I get my new Apple or Google phone, it will have a wallet that can be used without fees for payment across all apps, in physical retail locations, and for peer-to-peer money transfers. The credit cards, or rather lines of credit, on my digital wallet will use an Affirm-like loan service that allows me to buy anything from a pack of gum to a luxury watch or even a car, just using my phone’s wallet.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and Mastercard should not be the only players in the credit space. Innovation is necessary in the digital wallet space to pioneer the movement to change the outdated fee models for the simple act of money exchange.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/quibi" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="quibi">Quibi <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is dead, but its shows will live on.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/roku-nears-deal-to-buy-rights-to-quibis-content-11609725389?st=bvyom2tf9xf6ia0&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share">The Wall Street Journal reported</a> last week that Roku was in talks to acquire the short-form video service&#8217;s content. And this morning, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/roku" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="roku">Roku <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> announced that it has indeed reached a deal for the exclusive distribution rights to all of Quibi&#8217;s programs.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Roku said it will make this content available for free with ads on The Roku Channel. That doesn&#8217;t just include the shows that were previously available on Quibi, but also &#8220;more than a dozen&#8221; programs making &#8220;their exclusive debut on The Roku Channel&#8221; — in other words, they were created for the service but unreleased due to the app&#8217;s shutdown.</p>
<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s announcement marks a rare opportunity to acquire compelling original content that features some of the biggest names in entertainment,&#8221; said Roku&#8217;s vice president of programming Rob Holmes in a statement. &#8220;We&#8217;re excited to make this content available to our users in The Roku Channel through an ad-supported model. We are also thrilled to welcome the incredible studios and talented individuals who brought these stories to life and showcase them to our tens of millions of users.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Roku is best known for its streaming TV devices and software, advertising is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/22/roku-buys-ad-tech-platform-dataxu-for-150-million/">a growing part of its business</a>. And it says The Roku Channel (which offers both free content and subscription channels) reached 61.8 million U.S. viewers in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>

<p>Quibi, meanwhile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/quibi-is-dead/">announced its shutdown in October</a>, just six months after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/05/quibi-launches-its-mobile-streaming-service-in-the-middle-of-the-quarantine-era/">its splashy launch</a>. The service was focused on creating video episodes that lasted 10 minutes or less and were designed for viewing on-the-go — a poor fit for a period of pandemic and lockdowns.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://quibi-hq.medium.com/an-open-letter-from-quibi-8af6b415377f">their farewell note</a>, executives Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman suggested that the service failed due to a combination of bad timing and the fact that &#8220;the idea itself wasn&#8217;t strong enough to justify a standalone streaming service.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The most creative and imaginative minds in Hollywood created groundbreaking content for Quibi that exceeded our expectations,&#8221; Katzenberg said in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;We are thrilled that these stories, from the surreal to the sublime, have found a new home on The Roku Channel.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that the service was initially focused entirely on mobile viewing, with no way to watch the shows on smart TVs. That eventually changed, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/quibi-inches-towards-usability-by-adding-airplay-streaming-support/">starting with the addition AirPlay support</a>. Now, with the Roku acquisition, it seems that shows designed to be watched on your smartphone will instead be viewed primarily on your TV.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zack Parisa and Max Nova, the co-founders of the carbon offset company SilviaTerra, have spent the last decade working on a way to democratize access to revenue generating carbon offsets.</p>
<p>As forestry credits become a big, booming business on the back of multi-billion dollar commitments from some of the world&#8217;s biggest companies to decarbonize their businesses, the kinds of technologies that the two founders have dedicated ten years of their lives to building are only going to become more valuable.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why their company, already a profitable business, has raised $4.4 million in outside funding led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/union-square-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="union-square-ventures">Union Square Ventures <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/version-one-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="version-one-ventures">Version One Ventures, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> along with Salesforce founder and the driving force between the 1 trillion trees initiative, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/marc-benioff" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="marc-benioff">Marc Benioff <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Key to addressing the climate crisis is changing the balance in the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_cycle">carbon cycle</a>. At present, every year we are adding roughly 5 gigatons of carbon to the atmosphere. Since atmospheric carbon acts as a greenhouse gas this increases the energy that’s retained rather than radiated back into space which causes the earth to heat up,&#8221; <a href="https://www.usv.com/writing/2021/01/silviaterra/">writes Union Square Ventures managing partner Albert Wenger in a blog post</a>. &#8220;There will be many ways such drawdown occurs and we will write about different approaches in the coming weeks (such as direct air capture and growing kelp in the oceans). One way that we understand well today and can act upon immediately are forests. The world’s forests today absorb a bit more than one gigatons of CO2 per year out of the atmosphere and turn it into biomass. We need to stop cutting and burning down existing forests (including preventing large scale forest fires) and we have to start planting more new trees. If we do that, the total potential for forests is around 4 to 5 gigatons per year (with <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/what-we-do/our-insights/perspectives/climate-potential-natural-regrowth-forests/">some estimates</a> as high as 9 gigatons).&#8221;</p>
<p>For the two founders, the new funding is the latest step in a long journey that began in the woods of Northern <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/alabama" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="alabama">Alabama, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> where Parisa grew up.</p>
<p>After attending Mississippi State for forestry, Parisa went to graduate school at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/yale-security-inc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="yale-security-inc">Yale, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> where he met Louisville, Kentucky native Max Nova, a computer science student who joined with Parisa to set up the company that would become SiliviaTerra.</p>

Image Credit: SilviaTerra</p></div></p>
<p>The two men developed a way to combine satellite imagery with field measurements to determine the size and species of trees in every acre of forest.</p>
<p>While the first step was to create a map of every forest in the U.S. the ultimate goal for both men was to find a way to put a carbon market on equal footing with the timber industry. Instead of cutting trees for cash, potentially landowners could find out how much it would be worth to maintain their forestland. As the company notes, forest management had previously been driven by the economics of timber harvesting, with over $10 billion spent in the US each year.</p>
<p>The founders at SilviaTerra thought that the carbon market could be equally as large, but it&#8217;s hard for moset landowners to access. Carbon offset projects can cost as much as $200,000 to put together, which is more than the value of the smaller offset projects for landowners like Parisa&#8217;s own family and the 40 acres they own in the Alabama forests.</p>
<p>There had to be a better way for smaller landowners to benefit from carbon markets too, Parisa and Nova thought.</p>
<p>To create this carbon economy, there needed to be a single source of record for every tree in the U.S. and while SilviaTerra had the technology to make that map, they lacked the compute power, machine learning capabilities and resources to build the map.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> AI for Earth program came in.</p>
<p>Working with AI for Earth, SilviaTierra created their first product, Basemap, to process terabytes ofsatellite imagery to determine the sizes and species of trees on every acre of America&#8217;s forestland. The company also worked with the US Forestry Service to access their data, which was used in creating this holistic view of the forest assets in the U.S.</p>
<p>With the data from Basemap in hand, the company has created what it calls the Natural Capital Exchange. This program uses SilviaTerra&#8217;s unparalleled access to information about local forests, and the knowledge of how those forests are currently used to supply projects that actually represent land that would have been forested were it not for the offset money coming in.</p>
<p>Currently, many forestry projects are being passed off to offset buyers as legitimate offsets on land that would never have been forested in the first place &#8212; rendering the project meaningless and useless in any real way as an offset for carbon dioxide emissions. <i></i></p>
<p>&#8220;I<span style="font-weight: 400;">t’s a bloodbath out there,&#8221; said Nova of the scale of the problem with fraudulent offsets in the industry. &#8220;We’re not repackaging existing forest carbon projects and try to connect the demand side with projects that already exist. Use technology to unlock a new supply of forest carbon offset.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>The first Natural Capital Exchange project was actually launched and funded by Microsoft back in 2019. In it, 20 Western Pennsylvania land owners originated forest carbon credits through the program, showing that the offsets could work for landowners with 40 acres, or, as the company said, 40,000.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2093749" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2093749" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2093749" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Landowners_Penn-Pilot-2020_2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Landowners_Penn-Pilot-2020_2.jpg 5362w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Landowners_Penn-Pilot-2020_2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Landowners_Penn-Pilot-2020_2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Landowners_Penn-Pilot-2020_2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Landowners_Penn-Pilot-2020_2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Landowners_Penn-Pilot-2020_2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Landowners_Penn-Pilot-2020_2.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Landowners_Penn-Pilot-2020_2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2093749" class="wp-caption-text">Landowners involved in SilviaTerra&#8217;s pilot carbon offset program paid for by Microsoft. Image Credit: SilviaTerra</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We’re just trying to get inside every landowners annual economic planning cycle,&#8221; said Nova. &#8220;There’s a whole field of timber economics… and we&#8217;re helping answer the question of given the price of timber, given the price of carbon does it make sense to reduce your planned timber harvests?&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Ultimately, the two founders believe that they&#8217;ve found a way to pay for the total land value through the creation of data around the potential carbon offset value of these forests.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s more than just carbon markets, as well. The tools that SilviaTerra have created can be used for wildfire mitigation as well. &#8220;We&#8217;re at the right place at the right time with the right data and the right tools,&#8221; said Nova. &#8220;It&#8217;s about connecting that data to the decision and the economics of all this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The launch of the SilviaTerra exchange gives large buyers a vetted source to offset carbon. In some ways its an enterprise corollary to the work being done by startups like Wren, another Union Square Ventures investment, that focuses on offsetting the carbon footprint of everyday consumers. It&#8217;s also a competitor to companies like Pachama, which are trying to provide similar forest offsets at scale, or <a href="https://3degreesinc.com/services/carbon-offset-projects/">3Degrees Inc</a>. or<a href="https://www.southpole.com/carbon-offsets-explained"> South Pole</a>.</p>
<p>Under a Biden administration there&#8217;s even more of an opportunity for these offset companies, the founders said, given <a href="https://climate21.org/documents/C21_USDA.pdf">discussions underway to establish a Carbon Bank</a>. Established through the existing Commodity Credit Corp. run by the Department of Agriculture, the Carbon Bank would pay farmers and landowners across the U.S. for forestry and agricultural carbon offset projects.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;Everybody knows that there’s more value in these systems than just the product that we harvest off of it,&#8221; said Parisa. &#8220;Until we put those benefits in the same footing as the things we cut off and send to market…. As the value of these things goes up… absolutely it is going to influence these decisions and it is a cash crop&#8230; It&#8217;s a money pump from coastal America into middle America to create these things that they need.&#8221; </span></p>

<p>The antitrust regulator said today that it&#8217;s<a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/investigation-into-googles-privacy-sandbox-browser-changes?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=govuk-notifications&amp;utm_source=4e17cb10-a818-46ca-a4c9-e959ec65e945&amp;utm_content=immediate"> launched</a> a probe under Chapter II of the UK&#8217;s Competition Act 1998 into &#8220;suspected breaches of competition law by Google&#8221;.</p>
<p>The move follows a complaint lodged in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/digital-marketing-firms-file-uk-competition-complaint-against-googles-privacy-sandbox/">November</a> by a coalition of digital marketing companies which urged the CMA to block Google&#8217;s implementation of the self-styled &#8216;Privacy Sandbox&#8217;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cma-2067" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cma-2067">CMA <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> also received complaints from newspapers and technology companies alleging the tech giant is abusing a dominance position, it added.</p>
<p>A Google spokesperson sent this statement in response to a request for comment on the CMA investigation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Creating a more private web, while also enabling the publishers and advertisers who support the free and open internet, requires the industry to make major changes to the way digital advertising works. The Privacy Sandbox has been an open initiative since the beginning and we welcome the CMA&#8217;s involvement as we work to develop new proposals to underpin a healthy, ad-supported web without third-party cookies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Google had previously said it would implement the Sandbox in 2021 &#8212; accelerating an earlier timeline for the phasing out of third party cookies and sending ripples of fear (and loathing) through an adtech industry that bet the farm on mass surveillance of Internet users.</p>
<p>No changes have been made so far, according to Google.</p>
<p>It also said today that any changes will not be made before 2022 &#8212; as it continues a process of public collaboration (now coupled with close regulatory engagement, via the CMA) on how to replace tracking cookies.</p>
<p>With the looming demise of third party cookies, digital marketers are concerned about their ability to target ads at web users as browsers decommission support for key tracking technologies.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s worth noting that Google&#8217;s Chrome is actually the laggard in proposing to pull the plug on tracking cookies; WebKit, which underpins Safari, announced a tracking prevention policy back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/15/webkits-new-anti-tracking-policy-puts-privacy-on-a-par-with-security/">2019</a> &#8212; taking inspiration from Mozilla&#8217;s earlier anti-tracking stance. (The latter made third party cookie blocking in Firefox the default in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/mozilla-flips-the-default-switch-on-firefox-tracking-cookie-blocking/">September</a> of the same year.)</p>
<p>These anti-tracking plays by browser-makers are, on one level, a response to consumer distaste over creepy ads and concern for their online privacy.</p>
<p>And in the European Union at least, many core elements of adtech infrastructure are subject to complaints and remain under regulatory scrutiny. (Albeit, the UK&#8217;s data protection regulator, the ICO, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/uks-ico-faces-legal-action-after-closing-adtech-complaint-with-nothing-to-show-for-it/">currently being sued</a> for failing to act on complaints about the lawfulness of real-time bidding which date back to September 2018.)</p>
<p>But the contention by the marketing, publishing and adtech businesses which are crying foul over the end of cookies is that tech giants &#8212; Google in this case &#8212; are using privacy as a convenient excuse to increase their market power (and control over user data) at smaller entities&#8217; expense.</p>
<p>&#8220;The investigation will assess whether the proposals could cause advertising spend to become even more concentrated on Google’s ecosystem at the expense of its competitors,&#8221; the CMA writes in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-to-investigate-google-s-privacy-sandbox-browser-changes">press release</a> announcing its investigation. &#8220;It follows complaints of anticompetitive behaviour and requests for the CMA to ensure that Google develops its proposals in a way that does not distort competition.&#8221;</p>
<p>The announcement also makes clear that the regulator is alive to the genuine issue of privacy concern &#8212; with the CMA <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">writing that it&#8217;s been &#8220;considering how best to address legitimate privacy concerns without distorting competition&#8221;. </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This has included holding discussions with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), and </span>talking to Google to &#8220;better understand its proposals&#8221;, it says.</p>
<p>&#8220;The current investigation will provide a framework for the continuation of this work, and, potentially, a legal basis for any solution that emerges,&#8221; the CMA adds.</p>
<p>Exactly what will replace tracking cookies is still very much up in the air.</p>
<p>Google has made a number of proposals, via the W3C standards forum, including one called &#8216;Dovekey&#8217; which suggests using a key value server and which Google says builds on the feedback and proposal from adtech firm Criteo&#8217;s Sparrow proposal.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also shared the algorithms for its Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC) proposal &#8212; referring to a suggestion to use a specific machine learning technique to allow behavioral ad targeting to continue (but without needing to collect individuals&#8217; data).</p>
<p>The wider adtech industry, meanwhile, has also been coming up with various ideas and offers for replacing tracking cookies. Such as the <a href="https://www.thetradedesk.com/blog/identity-2020-the-future-of-addressable-digital-advertising">UnifiedOpen ID 2.0</a> proposal (that&#8217;s being built by The Trade Desk) and proposes a centralized system for tracking Internet users based on personal data such as an email address or phone number; or the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/01/2137657/0/en/Verizon-Media-Launches-Unified-ID-Solution-Verizon-Media-ConnectID.html">Unified ID</a> service launched by TechCrunch&#8217;s parent Verizon Media (leveraging its access to first party data), to name just two.</p>
<p>So whatever replaces tracking cookies looks unlikely to be simple or singular. Not least given the formal regulatory dimension that&#8217;s now been added to Google&#8217;s mix.</p>
<p>With its Sandbox project underway but no replacement for tracking cookies yet selected the CMA&#8217;s intervention certainly looks very strategic &#8212; giving the UK regulator a (potentially major) role in influencing the future shape of adtech.</p>
<p>Although it could also lead to regulatory divergence for adtech in the UK vs the European Union, where the Commission&#8217;s antitrust regulators have also been<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-alphabet-antitrust-exclusive-idUSKBN1Y40NX"> eyeing Google&#8217;s adtech practices</a> but have not yet launched a formal investigation &#8212; depending on the outcome of any probe/intervention there.</p>
<p>Back in the UK, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/uks-competition-regulator-asks-for-views-on-breaking-up-google/">recent</a> CMA <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/03/uks-cma-launches-investigation-into-digital-advertising-and-its-potential-harm-to-consumers/">market study of the digital advertising sector</a> led it to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/uks-competition-regulator-asks-for-views-on-breaking-up-google/">report</a> substantial concerns over the power of the Google-Facebook adtech duopoly &#8212; and it sought views on breaking up the tech giants &#8212; although in its final report it deferred any competitive intervention in favor of waiting for the government to legislate.</p>
<p>Since then UK ministers have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/27/uk-to-set-up-pro-competition-regulator-to-put-limits-on-big-tech/">unveiled a plan</a> to establish a pro-competition regulatory regime that will include a new statutory code of conduct, overseen by a Digital Market Unit (to be set up this year), with the aim of putting some hard limits on big (ad)tech &#8212; including potentially requiring them to offer users an opt out from behavioral advertising (something Facebook, for example, currently does not).</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>The UK-based marketing coalition which complained to the CMA about Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox has welcome the investigation, dubbing it &#8220;vital for the future of all online businesses, including publishers, technology companies and advertisers&#8221;.</p>
<p>In a statement, James Rosewell, director of the &#8216;Marketers for an Open Web&#8217; (MOW) coalition, added: “This is about the future of the Open Web and the threat that Google poses to its development. By launching this investigation, the CMA has recognised the seriousness of this issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Privacy Sandbox would effectively create a Google-owned walled garden that would close down the competitive, vibrant Open Web. Providing more directly identifiable, personal information to Google does not protect anyone’s privacy. We believe that the CMA’s investigation will confirm this and save the web for future generations,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Rosewell&#8217;s statement also invites concerned businesses to join MOW in campaigning for an injunction to prevent Google&#8217;s Sandbox being implemented &#8220;until after legislation is implemented&#8221;, although it&#8217;s still not clear who exactly is behind its push for a &#8220;vibrant Open Web&#8221; except for Rosewell himself, who&#8217;s CEO and co-founder of UK mobile marketing company, <a href="https://51degrees.com/about-us">51 Degrees</a>.</p>
<p>A membership section of MOW&#8217;s website still does not name any of its supporters &#8212; making only a generic reference to &#8220;top companies across the globe&#8221;. (We&#8217;ve asked MOW for more info on its membership and will update if we get any names. <strong>Update:</strong> A spokesman told us the members of MOW &#8220;have had to remain confidential as they&#8217;re concerned about repercussions from Google&#8221;.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We estimate that our supporters work with more than 21,000 advertisers and nearly 6 million individual websites in more than 50 countries, jointly serving over 320 billion advertising impressions each year.  The companies have a combined workforce of over 10,000 employees and combined revenues in excess of $4BN,&#8221; MOW adds on the site, again without listing the names of any of the adtech players involved in the complaint that Google&#8217;s Privacy Sandbox is threatening the open web.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Former U.S. cybersecurity official Chris Krebs and former Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos have founded a new cybersecurity consultancy firm, which already has its first client: <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/solarwinds" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="solarwinds">SolarWinds <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>The two have been hired as consultants to help the Texas-based software maker recover <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/">from a devastating breach</a> by suspected Russian hackers, which used the company&#8217;s software to set backdoors in thousands of organizations and to infiltrate at least 10 U.S. federal agencies and several Fortune 500 businesses.</p>
<p>At least the Treasury, State and the Department of Energy have been confirmed breached, in what has been described as likely the most significant espionage campaign against the U.S. government in years. And while the U.S. government has already <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/fbi-nsa-says-hacks-on-us-federal-agencies-likely-russian-in-origin/">pinned the blame</a> on Russia, the scale of the intrusions are not likely to be known for some time.</p>
<p>Krebs was one of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/trump-fires-us-cybersecurity-official-chris-krebs-for-debunking-false-election-claims/">the most senior cybersecurity officials</a> in the U.S. government, most recently serving as the director of Homeland Security&#8217;s CISA cybersecurity advisory agency from 2018, until he was fired by President Trump for his efforts to debunk false election claims — many of which came from the president himself. Stamos, meanwhile, joined <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/cybersecurity-expert-alex-stamos-on-what-scares-him-most-about-the-upcoming-u-s-presidential-election/">the Stanford Internet Observatory</a> after holding senior cybersecurity positions at Facebook and Yahoo. He also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/zoom-consultant-alex-stamos-weighs-in-on-keybase-acquisition/">consulted for Zoom</a> amid a spate of security problems.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/df641e33-9150-4846-b4f7-db4e3175d290">the Financial Times</a>, which broke the story, Krebs said it could take years before the hackers are ejected from infiltrated systems.</p>
<p>SolarWinds chief executive Sudhakar Ramakrishna acknowledged in <a href="https://orangematter.solarwinds.com/2021/01/07/our-plan-for-a-safer-solarwinds-and-customer-community/">a blog post</a> that it had brought on the consultants to help the embattled company to be &#8220;transparent with our customers, our government partners, and the general public in both the near-term and long-term about our security enhancements.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Madrid-based <a href="https://www.jobandtalent.com">Jobandtalent</a>, a digital temp staffing agency which operates a dual-sided platform that connects temp workers with employers needing regular casual labor in sectors like transport and logistics, has added €88 million (~$108M) to its Series C &#8212; bringing the total raised following an earlier (2019) closing of the round to €166M.</p>
<p>The 2009-founded startup has raised more than $290M to date over its decade+ run but describes itself as just at the beginning of a journey to make a dent in the massive and growing market for temporary work, expecting demand to keep stepping up as more sectors and processes go digital in the coming years.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/jobandtalent" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="jobandtalent">Jobandtalent <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> says more than 80,000 workers have used its platform to secure temp gigs in the last year across the seven markets where it operates in Europe and LatAm (namely: Spain, UK, Germany, France, Sweden, Mexico and Colombia); while 750+ employers are signed up to &#8220;recurrently manage a large part of their workforce&#8221;, as it puts it, including XPO, Ocado, Saint Gobain, Santander, Bayer, eBay, Huawei, Ceva Logistics and Carrefour.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s focused on competing with traditional staffing agencies such as Adecco and Randstad, though other similar startups are cropping up to cater to an ever more precarious temporary employment market. (And Uber, for example, launched a shift-finder app experiment called Works, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/uber-launches-a-shift-work-finder-app-uber-works-starting-in-chicago/">back in 2019</a>, also targeting demand for on-demand labor &#8212; but doing so in partnership with staffing agencies in its case).</p>
<p>Jobandtalent reports the number of workers looking for temp jobs on its platform doubling every year, while it&#8217;s grown revenue to €500M and says it&#8217;s hit positive EBITDA.</p>
<p>The beefed up Series C funding will be put towards expanding into more markets and doubling down on growing its existing footprint, it said today.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will keep expanding through Europe and will consider some additional opportunities (the US and some LatAm countries),&#8221; co-founder Juan <span class="gD">Urdiales</span> told us, noting that its main markets remain Spain and the UK, while its main sectors are logistics, last mile, warehousing and transport.</p>
<p>The lead investor in the expansion tranche of its C round is new investor InfraVia, a French private equity firm, which is putting in €30M &#8212; investing via a Growth Tech Fund it launched last year that&#8217;s focused on European b2b high-growth tech companies.</p>
<p>Existing Jobandtalent investors, including Atomico, Seek, DN Capital and Kibo Ventures, also participated in the Series C top-up.</p>
<p><span class="gD">Urdiales</span> said the reason it&#8217;s taken in another chunk of funding now is because of increased opportunity for growth as the coronavirus pandemic continues to accelerate demand for temping. &#8220;The reason why we are raising more is because we are seeing a high potential now to grow even faster than expected,&#8221; he told us. &#8220;The pandemic has helped us with both workers and employers in terms of adoption of our platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Covid has accelerated the transformation of many industries. We have seen more adoption of new technologies in the last nine months than in the last five years. The staffing market is experiencing a huge transformation that will be accelerated in the upcoming years, moving from brick and mortar traditional structures to data driven platforms that will improve the experience of both workers and employers,&#8221; <span class="gD">Urdiales</span> went on in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;This market is really big and we are just in the beginning of our journey (even though we have been a lot of years in the market now),&#8221;<span class="gD"> he added via email, discussing whether an IPO is on the business&#8217; roadmap in the next few years. </span>&#8220;We think that if we continue growing at the pace that we are growing now, and we add some private investors to help us with our growth plans, we may stay private for longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jobandtalent has been through a number of pivots since kicking off more than a decade ago with the idea of using technology to streamline the messy and consummately human business of recruitment. It started out testing a number of approaches before settling on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/22/jobandtalent-funding/?_ga=2.235855362.201458190.1609746167-1757155993.1533833482">linguistics algorithm</a> to parse job ads and create alerts to loop in passive job seekers.</p>
<p>Then in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/14/jobandtalent-gets-42m-series-b-after-pivoting-to-mobilize-hiring-for-smes/">2016</a> it pivoted away from enterprise recruitment to focus on mobilizing hiring for SMEs &#8212; zeroing in on the growing opportunity for temp job-matching offered by the rise of gig work fuelled by smartphone apps. From there, it&#8217;s been honing tools to cater to the needs of employers that are managing large temporary workforces.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Jobandtalent gets $42M Series B after pivoting to mobilize hiring for SMEs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/14/jobandtalent-gets-42m-series-b-after-pivoting-to-mobilize-hiring-for-smes/embed/#?secret=CNfalE91P1" data-secret="CNfalE91P1" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The flip side of the rapid growth of &#8216;flexible&#8217; platform-based labor &#8212; and Jobandtalent says it&#8217;s eyeing a pool of some 500M temp workers globally &#8212; is something that gig platforms don&#8217;t usually like to talk about: Worker precariousness.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s something this startup says it wants to help with too. A key part of the proposition Jobandtalent offers to workers is increased benefits vs what a temp might otherwise expect to get.</p>
<p>The average gig platform does not offer a full suite of workers rights and benefits, just as they don&#8217;t provide a contractual guarantee of future shifts, as they<span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> classify on-demand labor as &#8216;self-employed&#8217; &#8212; even as, simultaneously, they apply mobile technology to tightly manage this workforce (via data, algorithms and their own devices). </span></p>
<p>This disconnect, between the level of gig worker rights and platform control, has led to a number of legal challenges in Europe &#8212; including in several of the markets where Jobandtalent operates (such as Spain, where Glovo continues to face <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/spains-top-court-rejects-glovos-classification-of-couriers-as-self-employed/">legal challenges over its classification of delivery couriers</a>, for example; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/uber-driver-reclassified-as-employee-in-france/">France</a> and the UK, where Uber has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/19/uber-loses-another-appeal-against-drivers-rights-in-uk/">lost a number of employment tribunals over driver status</a>).</p>
<p>EU lawmakers are also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/europe-asks-for-views-on-platform-governance-and-competition-tools/">eyeing conditions for gig workers</a> &#8212; considering whether legislation is needed to protect platform workers&#8217; rights. While some platform giants, like Uber, have already felt politically pressured to offer <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/23/uber-expands-its-accident-insurance-across-europe/">a level of insurance in the region</a>.</p>
<p>Jobandtalent&#8217;s promise is it&#8217;s pushing for more perks for temps &#8212; leveraging the scale of its platform to get workers a better deal, including by making precarious work more steady (by lining up the next gig) and therefore less uncertain.</p>
<p>&#8220;All of the workers have access to the same benefits,&#8221; said <span class="gD">Urdiales via email when we ask about how Jobandtalent&#8217;s perks are structured</span>. &#8220;There are benefits such as advance payroll, health insurance, training courses, etc (not all the benefits are available in all countries, it depends on the level of maturity of each country).&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to give any worker that starts working through Jobandtalent access to those benefits and offer a high standard employment treatment, so they have a similar status to what a perm employee has,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>In a press release trumpeting its investment in Jobandtalent, new investor, InfraVia, also suggests the platform makes &#8220;temporary work a fulfilling professional step&#8221; &#8212; by defining &#8220;career plans&#8221; for temporary workers so they can &#8220;progress towards permanent and rewarding positions&#8221;.</p>
<p>However when we asked <span class="gD">Urdiales what data it has on temp-to-permanent switches that have been enabled by its platform he said this is &#8220;not a common thing&#8221;. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Employers are not looking to add workers to their perm workforces, and Jobandtalent is precisely trying to solve that for the workers, trying to give constant employment in different work assignments at different companies so they can find more stability,&#8221; he told us, adding: &#8220;The market is moving even more into a more precarious temporary employment market, and we believe that in this context a platform like the one that we are offering makes even more sense.&#8221;.</p>
<p>The other big carrot for workers to plug into Jobandtalent&#8217;s temp work marketplace is convenience: It takes a mobile app-based approach &#8212; offering a one-stop-shop for giggers to find their next shift, apply for the temp job (via in-app video interview), sign the contract and get paid, as well as access the touted benefits.</p>
<p>Its streamlining of admin around recruitment and payroll is also of course a key carrot for employers to get on board with Jobandtalent&#8217;s &#8216;workforce as a service&#8217; proposition &#8212; which claims an upgraded offer (such as a CRM that bakes in analytics for tracking workforce performance in real time) vs traditional temping agency processes, as well as lower costs and increased numbers of job offers.</p>
<p>Its worker-to-temp job matching tech is designed to take the (temp) recruitment strain for employer customers via a proprietary quality worker scoring algorithm which it calls a Worker Quality Score (WQS).</p>
<p><span class="gD">Urdiales told us the criteria that feeds this score include </span>attrition rate, absenteeism rate &#8212; and &#8220;some productivity metrics of the workers that we place&#8221; &#8212; when we asked for details, having found no information about the WQS on its website.</p>
<p>Algorithmic scoring of workers can have obvious implications for worker agency.</p>
<p>Nor is it without legal risk in Europe where EU citizens have rights attached to their personal data, such as access rights, and also (under the GDPR) a right to human review of any purely automated decisions that have a legal or similarly substantial impact on them (and decisions impacting access to work would be likely to qualify).</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/italian-court-rules-against-discriminatory-deliveroo-rider-ranking-algorithm/">recent judgement</a>, for example, a court in Italy ruled that a reputation ranking algorithm used by on-demand delivery platform Deliveroo had discriminated against workers because the code failed to distinguish between legally protected reasons for being absent from work (such as sickness or being on strike) and more trivial reasons for not turning up for a previously booked shift. (Deliveroo no longer uses the algorithm in question.)</p>
<p>Uber is also facing legal challenges in the Netherlands to its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/ubers-robo-firing-of-drivers-targeted-in-latest-european-lawsuit/">use of algorithms to automatically terminate drivers</a> and to its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/20/uk-uber-drivers-are-taking-its-algorithm-to-court/"> use of data and algorithms to profile and manage drivers</a>. While ride-hailing company Ola is facing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/10/ola-is-facing-a-drivers-legal-challenge-over-data-access-rights-and-algorithmic-management/">similar suit</a> over its algorithmic management of gig workers. So EU courts are certainly going to busy interrogating the intersection of app-driven algorithmic management and regional data and labor rights for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The European Commission has also proposed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/30/understanding-europes-big-push-to-rewrite-the-digital-rulebook/">sweeping reform of the regional rulebook for digital services</a> which includes a requirement for regulatory oversight of key decision-making algorithms with the aim of shrinking the risk of negative impacts such as bias and discrimination &#8212; although any new laws are likely still years out.</p>
<p>Asked whether Jobandtalent&#8217;s worker users are provided with their own WQS and given the chance to appeal substantial decreases in the score &#8212; including the opportunity to request a human review of any automated decisions &#8212; <span class="gD">Urdiales</span> said: &#8220;The platform gives them constant feedback based on the main metrics that they can affect (voluntary attrition, absenteeism, etc) with the aim to make them improve at work and consequently improve their ability to get more jobs in the future.&#8221;</p>

But the news of a potential tie-up (however tentative) with Apple, which is known for keeping a tight lid on deals before they are announced, was enough to send shares of Hyundai Motor Company <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/005380.KS/">up more than 20% </a>on the Korea Exchange during trading on Friday.</p>
<p>The talks were first reported by the Korea Economic Daily and confirmed by Hyundai to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-08/hyundai-shares-jump-most-since-1988-after-report-on-apple-tie-up">Bloomberg</a> in a statement that said &#8220;Apple and Hyundai are in discussion, but as it is at early stage, nothing has been decided.&#8221; The Korean auto giant also told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/hyundai-motor-says-it-is-in-early-talks-with-apple.html">CNBC</a> that &#8220;we understand Apple is in discussion with a variety of global automakers, including Hyundai Motor. As the discussion is at its early stage, nothing has been decided.&#8221;</p>
<p>A Hyundai spokesperson declined to comment to TechCrunch. Apple has also been contacted for comment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-autos-exclusive/exclusive-apple-targets-car-production-by-2024-and-eyes-next-level-battery-technology-sources-idUSKBN28V2PY">Reuters</a> reported that Apple’s car initiative, called Project Titan, is still going on, with plans to develop an autonomous electric passenger vehicle. But the car is not expected to launch until 2024.</p>

<p>Hyundai launched its own electric vehicle brand, Ioniq, in August 2020, with plans to bring three all-electric vehicles to market over the next four years, as part of its strategy to sell one million battery electric vehicles and take a 10% share of the EV market by 2025. Hyundai also has a joint venture with autonomous driving technology company Aptiv to make Level 4 and Level 5 production-ready self-driving systems available to robotaxi, fleet operators and automakers by 2022. The Aptiv partnership was announced in 2019.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s no secret that Tencent, the Chinese tech giant behind WeChat and a handful of blockbuster video games, is an aggressive investor. Even during 2020 when the pandemic slowed down economic activity in many parts of the world, Tencent was charging ahead with its investment ambitions.</p>
<p>During the year, the company participated in more than 170 funding rounds that amounted to a total of 249.5 million yuan ($38 million), according to the Chinese startup database ITJuzi. That made 2020 the most active year to date for Tencent&#8217;s investment team, which had been delivering superior results in the last decade.</p>
<p>By January 2020, over 70 of Tencent&#8217;s 800 portfolio companies had gone public and more than 160 of them surpassed $100 million in valuation, Martin Lau, Tencent&#8217;s president, <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/aB3sTjVL5ckni7VEOTJ0cg">told</a> a room of investees at the time. The achievement could well place Tencent side by side with some of the world&#8217;s top venture funds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Tencent established an investment and M&amp;A unit back in 2008 and began to seriously ramp up financing around 2012. Since 2015, it has been funding more than 100 companies per year, ITJuzi data shows. <img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2092606" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-06-at-12.59.03-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="790" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-06-at-12.59.03-PM.png 2032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-06-at-12.59.03-PM.png?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-06-at-12.59.03-PM.png?resize=300,231 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-06-at-12.59.03-PM.png?resize=768,593 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-06-at-12.59.03-PM.png?resize=680,525 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-06-at-12.59.03-PM.png?resize=1536,1185 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-06-at-12.59.03-PM.png?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The social and entertainment giant has for long kept its funding activity close to its chest and data gleaned by third-party organizations like ITJuzi is often not exhaustive. The company did not immediately respond to TechCrunch&#8217;s questions about its investment in 2020, and the story draws mainly from public disclosures and interviews with people of knowledge.</p>
<h2>B2B interest</h2>
<p>While Tencent&#8217;s overall investment strategy has remained consistent &#8212; a diversifying portfolio with a focus on digital entertainment &#8212; it has quietly stepped up efforts in areas outside its main gaming arena. For instance, the firm has paid more attention to enterprise services ever since it announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/02/tencent-reorg-enterprise/">B2B pivot in 2018</a>, putting more focus on cloud computing, fintech and the likes. The number of investments it made in enterprise software went from five in 2015 to 28 in 2020, according to ITJuzi.</p>
<p>In line with its new focus on enterprise, Tencent has also upped its game in fintech. In 2019 and 2020, it backed 18 and 15 fintech startups, respectively, ITJuzi shows, up from only four in 2015. The rise, though incremental, reflects the firm&#8217;s increased interest in an area that&#8217;s both hugely lucrative but also comes with many constraints.</p>
<p>In China, Tencent has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/tencent-vs-alibaba-ant-fintech/">long been competing with Ant Group</a>, the Alibaba fintech affiliate, to court users in payments, lending, wealth management, and even insurance. The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/27/ant-group-financial-clampdown/">regulatory troubles facing Ant</a> are not exclusive to the Jack Ma empire and will likely come to daunt its smaller contenders, including Tencent&#8217;s fintech segments.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="VU7jg12smg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/tencent-vs-alibaba-ant-fintech/">The race to be China&#8217;s top fintech platform: Ant vs Tencent</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;The race to be China&#8217;s top fintech platform: Ant vs Tencent&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/tencent-vs-alibaba-ant-fintech/embed/#?secret=VU7jg12smg" data-secret="VU7jg12smg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>That said, Tencent is &#8220;not nearly as aggressive&#8221; as Ant when it comes to strengthening its position in China&#8217;s financial market, a person who partners with Tencent&#8217;s overseas fintech business <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/27/ant-group-financial-clampdown/">told</a> TechCrunch.</p>
<h2>Fintech overseas</h2>
<p>The company is also prudent with its fintech expansion overseas in times of geopolitical tensions. So far, it&#8217;s mostly limited its ambition to providing cross-border payment services to China&#8217;s outbound tourists, rather than serving locals directly.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of scrutiny around what Tencent and Alibaba are doing within the United States and that presents challenges,&#8221; said the CEO of a Tencent-backed startup based in the U.S. who declined to be named.</p>
<p>Through investments, however, Tencent has familiarized itself with the foreign financial markets. In 2015, the company made one fintech investment outside China. In 2020, it funded eight, according to public data collected by Crunchbase.</p>
<p>A significant portion of Tencent&#8217;s outside investments doesn&#8217;t bear strategic significance, and the company tends to let its portfolio startups operate autonomously. Partly for that reason, Tencent was slammed for prioritizing investment and financial return over product development and innovation in a viral article in 2018, titled ominously <a href="http://box5253.temp.domains/~luanbook/tencent-has-no-dream/#:~:text=Tencent%20is%20losing%20its%20edge,becoming%20utilitarian%20and%20short%2Dsighted.&amp;text=In%20practice%2C%20it%20neglects%20that,should%20come%20from%20product%20innovation.">&#8220;Tencent Has No Dream.&#8221;</a> The hands-off attitude is a stark contrast to the stranglehold practice of Alibaba, which prefers buying controlling stakes in businesses and shaking up their top management, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/18/alibaba-doubles-down-on-lazada/">as it did for Lazada</a>.</p>
<p>But many Tencent investments do add value to its business, even when the press announcements leave out the potential strategic synergies. Over the years, Tencent has made a series of small investments in the U.S. and other Western countries. Few of them appear to bring collaborative opportunities in the near term, but Tencent would still invite executives from these companies to China where they would learn from each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tencent made those investments really just to kind of learn what people are doing in the U.S. and how it might be able to be applied in China,&#8221; said the executive from the Tencent-backed startup.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have any near term plans to do anything in China. But Tencent is a very reputable name, whether it&#8217;s in China or the U.S. And you know, it&#8217;s good to have the option to be able to do something more strategic in partnership with Tencent down the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tencent&#8217;s fintech investments outside China could also be conducive to the firm&#8217;s gaming expansion overseas, according to a Hong Kong-based fund manager. The goal is to have half of its gamers to be overseas users, Tencent <a href="https://www.scmp.com/abacus/news-bites/article/3039601/tencent-games-wants-half-its-users-be-overseas">pleged</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the gaming industry in Latin America and Southeast Asia, the biggest bottleneck is, surprisingly, not hardware but payments,&#8221; the fund manager told TechCrunch. &#8220;Of course, localization and compatibility are also important.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been a long couple of days for the country, but President Trump only had to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitter-will-reinstate-trumps-account-following-his-deletion-of-tweets/">wait 12 hours</a> before returning to his social network of choice.</p>
<p>In an uncharacteristically scripted three minute <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1347334804052844550">speech</a>, the president denounced the &#8220;heinous attack&#8221; on the Capitol. &#8220;The demonstrators who infiltrated the Capitol have defiled the seat of American democracy,&#8221; Trump said, warning the individuals involved that they will &#8220;pay.&#8221;</p>
<p>The previous day, Trumped directed a crowd of his supporters who had gathered for a &#8220;Stop the Steal&#8221; rally near the White House to march toward Congress. That event turned into a violent riot that disrupted lawmakers&#8217; efforts to certify election results, wrought havoc within the building and left at least four people dead. As the chaos unfolded, Trump encouraged the rioters in a video posted to <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/twitter" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="twitter">Twitter, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> telling them they were &#8220;special&#8221; and &#8220;we love you.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>After yesterday&#8217;s video, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/twitter-locks-trump-out-of-his-account-for-at-least-12-hours/">Twitter locked Trump&#8217;s account</a> and required him to delete a handful of tweets before having his access restored. Facebook later<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/"> froze the president&#8217;s account</a> for the remainder of his time in office. Trump is now on very thin ice with Twitter — the company said it may suspend his account permanently if he breaks the rules again.</p>
<p>In the new video, Trump seemed to be aware that he&#8217;d gone too far. After exploring &#8220;every legal avenue&#8221; to stay in power, he backed away from a months-long crusade to override the will of American voters. Of course it&#8217;s completely possible and even likely that he&#8217;ll reverse course, sow more election misinformation and resume his dangerous quest to undermine President-elect Joe Biden&#8217;s victory.</p>
<p>President Trump has had quite a few of these walk-back moments during his time in office, usually after <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/04/26/trump-says-both-sides-charlottesville-remark-said-perfectly/3586024002/">crossing a line</a> that makes even members of his own party <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-chris-wallace-elections-72f7d9cf6927639d1a92d4cdce995557">uncomfortable</a>. Yesterday certainly fit the bill, and even resulted in rare consequences from the social networks he relies on to communicate.</p>
<p>Trump also appeared to concede his loss for the first time, claiming that he will willingly leave office on January 20. &#8220;My focus now turns to ensuring a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power,&#8221; Trump said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If, as I suspect many of you have, you have worked your way through baking every type of cookie, bread and cake under the sun over the last year, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/google" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="google">Google <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has a surprise for you: a pair of AI-generated hybrid treats, the &#8220;breakie&#8221; and the &#8220;cakie.&#8221;</p>
<p>The origin of these new items seems to have been in a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/baking-recipes-made-ai">demonstration of the company&#8217;s AutoML Tables tool</a>, a codeless model generation system that&#8217;s more spreadsheet automation than what you&#8217;d really call &#8220;artificial intelligence.&#8221; But let&#8217;s not split hairs, or else we&#8217;ll never get to the recipe.</p>
<p>Specifically it was the work of Sara Robinson, who was playing with these tools <a href="https://sararobinson.dev/2020/04/30/baking-machine-learning.html">earlier last spring</a>, as a person interested in machine learning and baking was likely to start doing around that time as cabin fever first took hold.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>What happened was she wanted to design a system that would look at a recipe and automatically tell you whether it was bread, cookie or cake, and why — for instance, a higher butter and sugar content might bias it toward cookie, while yeast was usually a dead giveaway for bread.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2093618" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bakeml.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2093618" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2093618" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bakeml.gif" alt="" width="1024" height="790" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2093618" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sara Robinson</p></div></p>
<p>But of course, not every recipe is so straightforward, and the tool isn&#8217;t always 100% sure. Robinson began to wonder, what would a recipe look like that the system couldn&#8217;t decide on?</p>
<p>She fiddled around with the ingredients until she found a balance that caused the machine learning system to produce a perfect 50/50 split between cookie and cake. Naturally, she made some — behold the &#8220;cakie.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2093634" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cakie-breakie.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2093634" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2093634 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cakie-breakie.jpg" alt="A cakie, left, and breakies, right, with Robinson." width="1024" height="505" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cakie-breakie.jpg 1141w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cakie-breakie.jpg?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cakie-breakie.jpg?resize=300,148 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cakie-breakie.jpg?resize=768,379 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cakie-breakie.jpg?resize=680,336 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cakie-breakie.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2093634" class="wp-caption-text">A cakie, left, and breakies, right, with Robinson. Image Credits: Sara Robinson / Google</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;It is yummy. And it strangely tastes like what I’d imagine would happen if I told a machine to make a cake cookie hybrid,&#8221; she wrote.</p>
<p>The other hybrid she put together was the &#8220;breakie,&#8221; which as you surely have guessed by now is half bread, half cookie. This one ended up a little closer to &#8220;fluffy cookies, almost the consistency of a muffin.&#8221; And indeed they look like muffin tops that have lost their bottoms. But breakie sounds better than muffin tops (or &#8220;brookie,&#8221; apparently the original name).</p>
<p>These ingredients and ratios were probably invented or tried long ago, but it&#8217;s certainly an interesting way to arrive at a new recipe using only old ones.</p>
<p>The recipes below are perfectly doable, but to be transparent were not entirely generated by algorithm. It only indicates proportions of ingredients, and didn&#8217;t include any flavorings or features like vanilla or chocolate chips, both which Robinson added. The actual baking instructions had to be puzzled out as well (the AI doesn&#8217;t know what temperature is, or pans). But if you need something to try making that&#8217;s different from the usual weekend treat, you could probably do worse than one of these.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/27/trump-tiktok-decision/">obvious reasons</a>, Trump doesn&#8217;t have a TikTok account. But the president&#8217;s speeches that helped incite the mob who yesterday <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/capitol-riot/">stormed the U.S. Capitol</a> will have no home on TikTok&#8217;s platform. The company confirmed to TechCrunch its content policy around the Capitol riots will see it removing videos of Trump&#8217;s speeches to supporters. It will also redirect specific hashtags used by rioters, like #stormthecapitol and #patriotparty, to reduce their content&#8217;s visibility in the app.</p>
<p>TikTok says that Trump&#8217;s speeches, where the president again <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/did-trump-say-he-loved-rioters/">reiterated claims of a fraudulent election</a>, are being removed on the grounds that they violate the company&#8217;s misinformation policy. That <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines?lang=en#37">policy</a> defines misinformation as content that is inaccurate or false. And it explains that while TikTok encourages people to have respectful conversations on subjects that matter to them, it doesn&#8217;t permit misinformation that can cause harm to individuals, their community or the larger public.</p>
<p>A rioting mob intent on stopping democratic processes in the United States seems to fit squarely under that policy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>However, TikTok says it will allow what it calls &#8220;counter speech&#8221; against the Trump videos. This is a form of speech that&#8217;s often used to fight misinformation, where the creator presents the factual information or disputes the claims being made in another video. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/tiktok-takes-down-some-hashtags-related-to-election-misinformation-leaves-others/">TikTok in November</a> had allowed counter speech in response to claims from Trump supporters that the election was &#8220;rigged,&#8221; even while it blocked top hashtags that were used to promote these ideas.</p>
<p>In the case of Trump&#8217;s speeches, TikTok will allow a user to, for example, use the green screen effect to comment on the speech &#8212; unless those comments support the riots.</p>
<p>In addition, TikTok is allowing some videos of the violence that took place at the Capitol to remain. For example, if the video condemns the violence or originates from a news organization, it may be allowed. TikTok is also applying its recently launched opt-in viewing screens on &#8220;newsworthy&#8221; content that may depict graphic violence.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ak6lbJmwWV"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/tiktok-expands-community-guidelines-rolls-out-new-well-being-focused-features/">TikTok expands Community Guidelines, rolls out new &#8216;well-being&#8217; features</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TikTok expands Community Guidelines, rolls out new &#8216;well-being&#8217; features&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/tiktok-expands-community-guidelines-rolls-out-new-well-being-focused-features/embed/#?secret=ak6lbJmwWV" data-secret="ak6lbJmwWV" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>These screens, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/tiktok-expands-community-guidelines-rolls-out-new-well-being-focused-features/">announced in December</a>, appear on top of videos some viewers may find graphic or distressing. Videos with the screens applied are already eligible for TikTok&#8217;s main &#8220;For You&#8221; feed, but may not be prohibited. When a viewer encounters a screen, they can just tap a button to skip the video or they can choose to &#8220;watch anyway.&#8221; (It could not provide any example of the screens in use, however.)</p>
<p>Anecdotally, we saw videos that showed the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/congress-electoral-college-tally-live-updates/2021/01/07/954446008/authorities-identify-woman-killed-by-police-during-u-s-capitol-rioting">woman who was shot and killed yesterday</a> appear on TikTok and then quickly disappear. But those we came across were from individual users, not news organizations. They were also not really condemning the riot &#8212; they were just direct video footage. It&#8217;s unclear if the specific videos we saw were those that TikTok itself censored or if the user chose to remove them instead.</p>
<p>Separately from graphic content, TikTok says it will remove videos that seek to incite, glorify or promote violence, as those also violate its Community Guidelines. In these cases, the videos will be removed as TikTok identifies them &#8212; either via automation or user reporting.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;TikTok takes down some hashtags related to election misinformation, ignores others&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/tiktok-takes-down-some-hashtags-related-to-election-misinformation-leaves-others/embed/#?secret=8eUVYpWPOK" data-secret="8eUVYpWPOK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>And, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/tiktok-takes-down-some-hashtags-related-to-election-misinformation-leaves-others/">as it did in November</a>, TikTok is proactively blocking hashtags to reduce content&#8217;s visibility. It&#8217;s now blocking tags like #stormthecapitol and #patriotparty among others, and redirects those queries to its Community Guidelines. There are currently redirections across dozens of variations of those hashtags and others. The company doesn&#8217;t share its full list in order to protect its safeguards, it says.</p>
<p>TikTok had previously blocked tags like #stopthesteal and #QAnon, in a similar proactive manner.</p>
<p>We should point out that for all Twitter&#8217;s posturing about safety and moderation, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/twitter-will-reinstate-trumps-account-following-his-deletion-of-tweets/">allowed Trump to return to its app</a>, after a few key tweets were deleted. And it has yet to block hashtags associated with false claims, like <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23stopthesteal&amp;src=typeahead_click">#stopthesteal</a>, which continues to work today. Facebook, on the other hand,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/"> banned Trump from Facebook and Instagram</a> for at least two weeks. Like TikTok, it had previously blocked the #stopthesteal and #sharpiegate hashtags with a message about its Community Standards. (Today those searches are erroring out with messages that say &#8220;This Page Isn&#8217;t Available Right Now,&#8221; we noticed.)</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="K1IUnr4jp0"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/">Mark Zuckerberg announces Trump banned from Facebook and Instagram for &#8216;at least the next two weeks&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mark Zuckerberg announces Trump banned from Facebook and Instagram for &#8216;at least the next two weeks&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/mark-zuckerberg-announces-trump-banned-from-facebook-and-instagram-for-at-least-the-next-two-weeks/embed/#?secret=K1IUnr4jp0" data-secret="K1IUnr4jp0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s content moderation efforts have been fairly stringent in comparison with other social networks, as it regularly hides, downranks and removes users&#8217; posts. But it has also been accused of engaging in &#8220;censorship&#8221; by those who believe it&#8217;s being too aggressive about newsworthy content.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s led to users finding more creative ways to keep their videos from being banned &#8212; like using misspellings, coded language or clever editing to circumvent TikTok policies. At other times, creators will simply give up and direct viewers to their Instagram, where their content is backed up and less policed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hateful behavior and violence have no place on TikTok,&#8221; a TikTok spokesperson told TechCrunch, when we asked for a statement on the Capitol events. &#8220;Content or accounts that seek to incite, glorify or promote violence violate our Community Guidelines and will be removed,&#8221; they added.</p>

<p>Triest began building Ludlow as a twentysomething University of Michigan grad who worked as strategic marketing consultant for Sony-BMG in Atlanta before returning home with his wife to be closer to family. Working initially with his attorney father, he began investing in startups on a deal-by-deal basis, using his base in Detroit to his advantage by showing by investors and founders he could grow and leverage a network.</p>
<p>Triest started to gain traction, too. Early and continuing investors include prominent individuals <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/dan-gilbert" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="dan-gilbert">Dan Gilbert, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the billionaire founder of Quicken Loans and owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers (Ludlow has long shared an office with Gilbert&#8217;s <a href="https://www.detroit.vc/">venture firm</a>). Ludlow has also garnered growing institutional support over the years, including from Vintage Investment Partners, Grinnell College, and Foundry Group.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Umba, a digital bank for emerging markets, raises $2M Seed funding to expand across Africa&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/umba-a-digital-bank-for-emerging-markets-raises-2m-seed-funding-to-expand-across-africa/embed/#?secret=yx9ATVu3sr" data-secret="yx9ATVu3sr" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Part of the appeal, seemingly, is the fresh perspective that the team brings to the many places where it is now investing. Indeed, though Ludlow was initially perceived as a regional firm, it quickly expanded outside of Detroit to invest across the U.S.</p>
<p>Just last month, it joined the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/umba-a-digital-bank-for-emerging-markets-raises-2m-seed-funding-to-expand-across-africa/">$2 million seed round</a> of <a href="https://www.umba.com/">Umba</a>, a 2.5-year-old, Lagos, Nigeria-based digital bank for emerging markets. Ludlow has also written checks in recent months &#8212; both new and follow-on &#8212; to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/welcome-raises-6m-to-help-your-company-hire-and-keep-employees/">Welcome</a>, a 1.5-year-old, New York-based HR software startup; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/23/la-based-boulevard-raises-27-million-for-its-spa-management-software/">Boulevard</a>, a four-year-old, LA-based spa management and payment platform; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/lightyear-scores-3-7m-seed-to-simplify-networking-infrastructure-procurement/">Lightyear</a>, a 16-month-old, New York-based startup that wants to make it easier for large companies to procure networking infrastructure like internet and SD-WAN.</p>
<p>Ludlow has also had numerous exits. Among the most notable, it was an early investor in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/honey-science" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="honey-science">Honey, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the LA-based coupon finder that PayPal agreed to buy for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/20/paypal-to-acquire-shopping-and-rewards-platform-honey-for-4-billion/">$4 billion in late 2019. </a>The firm also nabbed stakes in Flywheel, an Omaha-based WordPress hosting and management company that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/24/wordpress-management-site-wp-engine-acquires-flywheel-as-it-moves-to-a-1b-valuation-and-ipo/">sold to WordPress in 2019</a> for $150 million; Gather, an Atlanta-based event management software startup acquired by Vista Equity Partners for a reported <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2017/09/05/event-management-software-startup-gather-gets.html">$55 million</a>; and San Francisco-based Product Hunt, which sold to AngelList for a reported $20 million in 2016.</p>
<p>Like all firms, Ludlow has had its write-downs. Navdy, for example, maker of a heads-up automotive display, went <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/27/navdy-contacts-would-be-creditors-prepares-to-liquidate/">out of business</a> in 2017.</p>
<p>Still, in addition to its newest bets, it holds stakes in a variety of fast-growing startups. Among these is the nearly six-year-old Boston-based online notary platform <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.notarize.com/">Notarize</a>, which has now raised more than $80 million from investors and <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/07/08/notarize-raises-35-million-amid-digital-legal-service-boom/">said last summer </a>it had seen dramatic growth owing to the pandemic and the shift to remote work.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an early investor in the L.A.-based e-sports and lifestyle brand <a href="https://100thieves.com/">100 Thieves</a>, which announced a $35 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/16/esports-org-100-thieves-raises-35-million-in-series-b/">Series B round in late 2019</a> at a $160 million post-money valuation. (Among its owners is Dan Gilbert, music manager and entrepreneur Scooter Braun and Drake.)</p>
<p>In 2018, Triest also appears to have worked a check into the <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/detroit-based-stockx-secures-44m-in-series-b-funding-co-led-by-gv-formerly-google-ventures-and-battery-ventures-300712092.html">Series B round </a>of Detroit-based resale marketplace StockX, a company that was last month assigned a <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/stockx-raises-275m-series-e-valuing-the-retailer-at-2-8b/">$2.8 billion </a>valuation by its newest investors.</p>

<p>Along with Triest, Ludlow is run by partner Brett deMarrais, who joined the firm in 2012, and a third investor, Blake Robbins, who joined the firm in 2016 as an associate. He was promoted to partner in 2019.</p>
<p>The firm closed its third fund, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/21/ludlow-ventures-raises-45m-for-third-fund/">$45 million vehicle</a>, in 2019. Its second fund, announced in 2017, also closed with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/27/ludlow-ventures-targets-40-million-for-second-fund/">$45 million</a>. Ludlow&#8217;s debut fund closed in 2014 with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/06/detroit-hustle-in-silicon-valley">$15.5 million</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Applications networking company <a href="https://www.f5.com/">F5</a> announced today that it is acquiring <a href="https://www.volterra.io/">Volterra</a>, a multi-cloud management startup, for $500 million. That breaks down to $440 million in cash and $60 million in deferred and unvested incentive compensation.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/volterra-inc" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="volterra-inc">Volterra <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> emerged in 2019 with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/volterra-announces-50m-investment-to-manage-apps-in-hybrid-environment/">a $50 million investment</a> from multiple sources, including Khosla Ventures and Mayfield, along with strategic investors like M12 (Microsoft’s venture arm) and Samsung Ventures. As the company described it to me at the time of the funding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Volterra has innovated a consistent, cloud-native environment that can be deployed across multiple public clouds and edge sites — a distributed cloud platform. Within this SaaS-based offering, Volterra integrates a broad range of services that have normally been siloed across many point products and network or cloud providers.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The solution is designed to provide a single way to view security, operations and management components.</p>

<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/f5" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="f5">F5 <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> president and CEO François Locoh-Donou sees Volterra&#8217;s edge solution integrating across its product line. &#8220;With Volterra, we advance our Adaptive Applications vision with an Edge 2.0 platform that solves the complex multi-cloud reality enterprise customers confront. Our platform will create a SaaS solution that solves our customers’ biggest pain points,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Volterra founder and CEO Ankur Singla, <a href="https://volterra.io/resources/blog/volterras-next-chapter-joining-f5-for-edge-2">writing in a company blog post</a> announcing the deal, says the need for this solution only accelerated during 2020 when companies were shifting rapidly to the cloud due to the pandemic. &#8220;When we started Volterra, multi-cloud and edge were still buzzwords and venture funding was still searching for tangible use cases. Fast forward three years and COVID-19 has dramatically changed the landscape — it has accelerated digitization of physical experiences and moved more of our day-to-day activities online. This is causing massive spikes in global Internet traffic while creating new attack vectors that impact the security and availability of our increasing set of daily apps,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>He sees Volterra&#8217;s capabilities fitting in well with the F5 family of products to help solve these issues. While F5 had a quiet 2020 on the M&amp;A front, today&#8217;s purchase comes on top of a couple of major acquisitions in 2019, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/f5-acquires-shape-security-for-1b/">Shape Security for $1 billion</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/f5-acquires-nginx-for-670m-to-move-into-open-source-multi-cloud-services/">NGINX for $670 million</a>.</p>
<p>The deal has been approved by both companies&#8217; boards, and is expected to close before the end of March, subject to regulatory approvals.</p>

<p>After a pro-Trump mob stormed the U.S. Capitol yesterday, a number of online platforms moved to suspend accounts connected to the outgoing president.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&#8220;Our work with Epic goes back decades, and joining forces is a natural next step given our alignment on products, mission, and culture,&#8221; Rad Game Tools founder and CEO Jeff Roberts said in the announcement. And it has seemingly only intensified recently.</p>
<p>Close integration with engines and platforms makes for good standards, and good standards get embraced by developers. That&#8217;s why Epic has been cozying up to Sony as well as snapping up components to fit into its Unreal engine, positioning it as an all-encompassing development platform for next-generation games.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Rad (styled RAD) has been in games for a long time, <a href="http://www.radgametools.com/default.htm">as its decidedly old-school website attests</a>. Bink is a video codec for games that focuses on high compression and speedy rendering, both important in the gaming world. Oodle, Telemetry, Granny 3D and Miles Sound System are all development tools beyond what the lay person would understand, but no doubt have many fans.</p>
<p>Epic may be known now as the creator of money-printing machine Fortnite, but the company has been around for decades and probably knows the Rad team well. That may help explain the friendly terms under which the acquisition will take place.</p>
<p>&#8220;RAD will continue supporting their game industry, film, and television partners, with their sales and business development team maintaining and selling licenses for their products to companies across industries &#8211; including those that do not utilize <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/unreal-engine" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="unreal-engine">Unreal Engine,&#8221; <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Epic said in its announcement.</p>
<p>So while Bink and the rest will continue to be available for anyone to use outside Epic&#8217;s domain, they will almost certainly be better integrated with the Unreal ecosystem. As game development cost and complexity rises, means of simplification are often taken advantage of. Epic is working hard to make Unreal not just the most graphically powerful engine for development, but also the most unified.</p>
<p>A request for comment and further details on the deal sent to Rad Game Tools was intercepted by Epic and declined.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like many startups, Atlanta-based <a href="https://www.voxie.com/">Voxie</a> was created to solve a problem that founder and CEO Bogdan Constantin faced himself.</p>
<p>In Constantin&#8217;s case, this was at his previous tuxedo rental startup Menguin (ultimately <a href="https://www.voxie.com/">acquired by </a>Generation Tux), where he said he had to market a product with a six-to-nine month sales cycle, as customers were usually weighing different options for their weddings.</p>
<p>Email marketing, Constantin said, would result &#8220;worse and worse&#8221; open rates over time. So one day, he decided to just try texting everyone who signed up, introducing himself as &#8220;your personal stylist here at Menguin.&#8221; Not surprisingly, he got a lot more responses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The challenge, of course, is having those kinds of text conversations across a large customer base. And that&#8217;s why <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/voxie" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="voxie">Voxie <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> — which is announcing that it has raised $6.7 million in Series A funding — offers tools to help businesses automate and manage that process.</p>
<p>Constantin claimed that compared to other text marketing tools, messages sent via Voxie feel like a real, personalized conversation — even though 80% to 90% are actually automated, with the rest of the messages written by people. Plus, Voxie will allow businesses to send their messages from a normal 10-digit phone number (rather than the more common five-digit numbers used for marketing).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2093588" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2093588" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2093588" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Voxie-Example-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Voxie" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Voxie-Example-1.jpg 1080w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Voxie-Example-1.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Voxie-Example-1.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Voxie-Example-1.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Voxie-Example-1.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Voxie-Example-1.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Voxie-Example-1.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Voxie-Example-1.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Voxie-Example-1.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Voxie-Example-1.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2093588" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Voxie</p></div></p>
<p>Voxie was initially built for large enterprise customers, but Constantin said that during the pandemic, the company built a lower-cost version that is now being used by &#8220;a lot of retail, restaurant franchise brands, main street brands that are struggling right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;We&#8217;re working with brands that have hundreds of locations all over the country that needed a better way to engage their customers — to ask their names, ask how many kids they have and store that information at the individual profile level.&#8221;</p>
<p>Current Voxie customers include LG, Danone, Massage Heights and Buff City Soap.</p>
<p>The funding, meanwhile, was led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/noro-moseley-partners" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="noro-moseley-partners">Noro-Moseley Partners, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from Circadian Ventures and Engage Ventures, as well as Atlanta entrepreneurs Wain Kellum, Andy Powell, David Cummings and Fred Castellucci.</p>
<p>&#8220;Voxie leads the market as the only platform that allows brands to have personalized conversations with customers at scale, which we believe will be key for its target customers to succeed in a post-COVID world,” said Noro-Moseley&#8217;s John Ale in a statement. “Businesses love Voxie as they see meaningful revenue uplift quickly and the personalization of the content means customers find the messages useful and highly relevant to their needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Next, Constantin said the company will launch &#8220;reply to buy&#8221; functionality, allowing customers to place orders directly from their text conversations. And while Voxie is currently focused on SMS messaging, he claimed its vision is broader: &#8220;We want to deliver the right message at the right time via the right medium.&#8221;</p>
