										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">UK-based Isotropic Systems has raised a $40 million funding in an &#8220;oversubscribed&#8221; round that the startup says will help it get its next-generation broadband terminal to the production phase by its 2022 target. The funding, a Series B that brings the company&#8217;s total raised to $60 million, was led by SES and included participation form Boeing HorizonX, Space Angels, Orbital Ventures on the venture side, and that includes UK government grant support as well.</p>
<p>Isotropic&#8217;s business is centred around a new type of broadband terminal it&#8217;s developing that can communicate across multiple frequencies, making it possible for it to connect to more than one satellite network at the same time without any loss in signal quality or network speed for any individual connection. The final product would then offer ground connectivity to customers that could potentially maintain connections with more than one of the emerging satellite broadband networks in development, including those being set up by OneWeb, SpaceX, Intelsat, SES, Amazon and more.</p>
<p>The startup will be stand-in cup a 20,000 square-foot testing and prediction facility near Reading in the UK, and expects to have the first operational version of its ground terminal in production by 2022. If its final product works as advertised, it could be a major boon both for satellite network connectivity providers and for clients, since it would mean that customers who can afford the service don&#8217;t have to either select from among the available options, and can instead use one hardware solution to connect to multiple in order to take advantage of potential speed benefits, as well as network redundancy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;OneWeb launches 36 satellites to join its global broadband constellation on orbit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/18/oneweb-launches-36-satellites-to-join-its-global-broadband-constellation-on-orbit/embed/#?secret=aoP6iifXUc" data-secret="aoP6iifXUc" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The benefits are obvious, provided the financials make sense. Imagine, for instance, using onboard wifi on an international flight. Typically, these networks have been unreliable to say the least. Coverage and quality drop-outs are common, and speeds tend to be weak in even the best of cases. Networks like Starlink aim to correct a lot of these legacy problems, but even better would be a solution that offers connection to multiple satellite networks simultaneously, switching between each connection as necessary to maintain the best possible network quality – and potentially combining available bandwidth when possible to boost speeds.</p>
<p>Isotropic&#8217;s potential customer list for such an offering spans military, government, and civilian markets, across both broadband and low-data IoT networks. This latest funding should help it prove its groundbreaking technology can attain the production scale and efficacy required to live up to its promise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm">an SEC filing</a>, Tesla disclosed that it has acquired $1.5 billion in bitcoin, the popular cryptocurrency. Moreover, the company noted that it may also accept bitcoin in the future as a form of payment for its cars, though it did allow that there is some regulatory uncertainty around that effort.</p>
<p>As the news broke, the price of bitcoin instantly rose by around 7% to more than $40,000 per coin.</p>
<p>Tesla had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-cryptocurrency-idUSKBN28U0XM">previously telegraphed</a> that it had an interest in the cryptocurrency, however to purchase such a large block of the coin is notable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="K6hFHygGcd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/is-rising-usage-driving-cryptos-recent-price-boom/">Is rising usage driving crypto&#8217;s recent price boom?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Is rising usage driving crypto&#8217;s recent price boom?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/is-rising-usage-driving-cryptos-recent-price-boom/embed/#?secret=K6hFHygGcd" data-secret="K6hFHygGcd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In its filing, Tesla writes that earlier this year it &#8220;updated [its] investment policy to provide [it] with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on [its] cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity,&#8221; adding that it has the option of putting cash into &#8220;certain alternative reserve assets&#8221; that include &#8220;digital assets, gold bullion, gold exchange-traded funds and other assets as specified in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Under that banner, the firm has &#8220;invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin,&#8221; going on to say that the well-known electric car company &#8220;may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s enough wiggle room for Tesla to do whatever it wants with its cash and the crypto markets.</p>
<p>But the company wasn&#8217;t done, completing its news-drop by adding that the company &#8220;expect[s] to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for [its] products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which [it] may or may not liquidate upon receipt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has made waves in recent days by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/06/what-are-these-rich-people-doing-pumping-crappy-assets/">pumping a silly cryptocurrency joke</a> called Dogecoin; this is something more material. Tesla is selecting bitcoin as the cryptocurrency of its choice, helping to further cement the blockchain as the world&#8217;s best known. And that it may accept bitcoin-denominated transactions in the future could help bitcoin retain both value, and exchange volume, though we probably repeat ourselves. It&#8217;s worth noting that Musk himself has also personally sent bitcoin prices higher in past using his social presence, including by changing his bio to just the single word, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-falls-retraces-elon-musk-twitter">before its price faded back</a> after he removed it earlier this month.</p>
<p>The car company then spends three paragraphs saying that its choice is risky. That&#8217;s an understatement. Then again, what is Musk if not entertaining?</p>

<p>Last week I highlighted how Lime was getting into the shared moped business. Now, shared moped startup Revel is getting into the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/rad-power-bikes-raises-150-million-as-electric-bike-sales-boom/">EV charging game</a>. I wonder if we are starting to witness the beginning of a business diversification trend in micromobility?</p>
<p>Revel said it is building a DC fast-charging station for electric vehicles in New York City, the first in a new business venture that will eventually spread to other cities. The company said this new “Superhub,” which is located at the former Pfizer building in Brooklyn, will contain 30 chargers and be open to the public 24 hours a day. This will be the first in a network of Superhubs opened by Revel across New York City, the company said.</p>
<p>Revel didn’t build the EV charging infrastructure in-house. Instead, it is using Tritium’s new RTM75 model for the first 10 chargers at its Brooklyn site, which will go live this spring. These chargers are designed to deliver 100 additional miles of charge to an electric vehicle in about 20 minutes, according to Revel.</p>

<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Uber</strong> announced plans to acquire alcohol delivery service Drizly in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/uber-is-buying-alcohol-delivery-service-drizly-for-1-1b/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">stock-and-cash deal</a> valued at $1.1 billion deal — cementing a strategy that started more than a year ago. The upshot: Uber is betting that its delivery and ride-hailing businesses will provide the fastest path to profitability.</p>
<p>Drizly&#8217;s marketplace will be eventually folded into the Uber Eats app. For now, Drizly will maintain the standalone app. <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The acquisition of Drizly is expected to close in the first half of the year.</span></p>
<p>For those who don&#8217;t follow Uber&#8217;s every move, here&#8217;s a quick recap. Since early 2020, Uber has offloaded most of its businesses, including shared scooter and bike unit Jump, self-driving subsidiary Uber Advanced Technologies Group and the air taxi moonshot Uber Elevate. It also sold a $500 million stake in its Uber Freight spinoff. Meanwhile, it acquired on-demand delivery app Postmates and now Drizly.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Rad Power Bikes</strong> is one other company that had a &#8220;deal of the week&#8221; worthy funding round. The Seattle-based electric bike seller <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/rad-power-bikes-raises-150-million-as-electric-bike-sales-boom/">raised $150 million</a> from institutional investors, including Morgan Stanley’s Counterpoint Global Fund, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company, TPG’s global impact investing platform The Rise Fund and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates. Existing investors Durable Capital Partners LP and Vulcan Capital also participated in the round.</p>
<p>While $150 million is hardly the biggest raise in transportation, it&#8217;s one of the larger ones in the world of electric bikes. The size of round — and the institutions involved — suggests investors see room from growth in the ebike industry and believe in Rad Power&#8217;s business model and its ability to expand beyond the $100 million in sales it generated in 2019. Rad Power Bikes declined to disclose its 2020 sales numbers.</p>
<p>Rad Power is a direct-to-consumer electric bike seller known for creating robust products that combine features like fat tires, big batteries and motors with touchscreens, and even cargo carrying capacity &#8212; all at prices hundreds of dollars below its competitors.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s founder and CEO Mike Radenbaugh told me that the funds will be used to double its 325-person workforce, increase the number of retail showrooms and service locations, continue to bring on more contract manufacturers to diversify its supply chain and add more accessories so consumers and customize their bikes.</p>
<p><strong>Other deals that got my attention &#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bear Flag Robotics</strong>, the Silicon Valley-based startup that is developing autonomous technology for farm tractors, announced last month a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/agtech-leader-bear-flag-robotics-raises-7-9-million-seed-extension-round-led-by-true-ventures-301211834.html">$7.9 million seed extension funding round</a> led by True Ventures. (I missed this one last week). The funding comes two years after it raised a $4.6 million seed round also led by True Ventures. Graphene Ventures, AgFunder, D20 and Green Cow VC also participated in the round.</p>
<p><strong>DealerPolicy</strong>, an insurance marketplace for automotive retail, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dealerpolicy-raises-30-million-in-series-b-funding-to-support-the-continued-development-of-automotive-retails-leading-insurance-marketplace-301219491.html#:~:text=BURLINGTON%2C%20Vt.%2C%20Feb.,as%20HSCM%20Bermuda%20Management%20Company.">raised $30 million</a> in Series B funding led by 3L Capital and Hudson Structured Capital Management Ltd.</p>
<p><strong>Hip</strong>, the mobile app startup that connects riders to buses and shuttles, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/commuting-platform-startup-hip-lands-12-million-to-help-companies-bring-employees-back-to-the-office/">raised $12 million</a>. The company was a consumer-facing business, but has changed its business model to focus on helping employers prepare for, and start to bring their workers back to the office or factory.</p>
<p><strong>Otonomo</strong>, the cloud-based software startup that helps companies capture and monetize connected car data, agreed to merge with special purpose acquisition company Software Acquisition Group Inc. II with a valuation of $1.4 billion. The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&amp;CIK=0001842498&amp;owner=include&amp;count=40&amp;hidefilings=0">prospectus</a> filed by the Otonomo shows it generated $400,000 in revenue in 2020 with a total operating expenditure of $10 million. Otonomo said it expects to have a negative gross profit through 2021. The company said it expects to be EBITDA positive by 2024.</p>
<p><strong>REE Automotive</strong> has reached merger agreement with special purpose acquisition corporation 10X Capital Venture Acquisition Corp. The combined company, which will be listed on the NASDAQ under the new ticker symbol &#8220;REE,&#8221; will have an equity valuation of $3.6 billion. The startup has developed flat and modular EV platforms with fully autonomous-ready independent drive-by-wire, brake-by-wire and steer-by-wire technology for each wheel.</p>
<p>The company said it raised $300 million in private investment in public equity, or PIPE, from investors including Koch Strategic Platforms and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra and Magna International.<br />
The transaction is expected to provide more than $500 million of gross proceeds to the company.</p>
<p><strong>Urban SDK</strong>, a connected mobility and safety analytics platform, raised $1.66 million in a funding round led by the Florida Opportunity Fund and matched by DeepWork Capital, a venture capital firm investing in early-stage companies in Florida.</p>
<p><strong>Wheels Up</strong>, the private jet subscription service, announced plans to go public through a merger with special purpose acquisition company Aspirational Consumer Lifestyle Corp. The deal, which is expected to close in the second quarter, would give Wheels Up a valuation of more than $2 billion — more than twice its 2019 value.</p>

<p><strong>Ford</strong> said this week it will spend $22 billion on electrification — double its previous commitment — and invest $7 billion on autonomous vehicles through 2025. It should be noted that $2 billion of that AV budget has already been spent, leaving $5 billion left to invest over the next four years.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are accelerating all our plans — breaking constraints, increasing battery capacity, improving costs and getting more electric vehicles into our product cycle plan,&#8221; Ford CEO Jim Farley said. &#8220;People are responding to what Ford is doing today, not someday.&#8221;</p>
<p>The announcement comes at the beginning of a critical two-year period for Ford and on the heels of a fourth quarter that delivered a $2.8 billion loss. The automaker will ramp up deliveries of its all-electric Mustang Mach-E vehicle and the Bronco Sport (which is not an EV). The first electric E-Transit commercial vans will come off the line in late 2021. Meanwhile, development continues on an all-electric F-150 pickup that is coming in mid- 2022.</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t forget that Ford is also planning to use Google&#8217;s Android Automotive operating system in new vehicles, beginning in 2023 as part of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/ford-vehicles-will-be-powered-by-googles-android-operating-system/">six-year partnership</a> announced February 1 that will bring embedded Google apps and services to drivers.</p>
<p>Ford&#8217;s announcement comes a week after GM said it aspired to produce only electric vehicles by 2035.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://automattic.com">Automattic</a>, the for-profit company tied to open source web publishing platform WordPress, is announcing that it has acquired analytics provider <a href="http://www.parse.ly">Parse.ly</a>.</p>
<p>Specifically, Parse.ly is now part of WPVIP, the organization within Automattic that offers enterprise hosting and support to publishers including TechCrunch. (We use Parse.ly, too.)</p>
<p>WPVIP CEO Nick Gernert described this as the organization&#8217;s first large enterprise software acquisition, reflecting a strategy that has expanded beyond news and media organizations — businesses like Salesforce (whose venture arm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/19/automattic-raises-300-million-at-3-billion-valuation-from-salesforce-ventures/">invested $300 million in Automattic </a>back in 2019), the NBA, Condé Nast, Facebook and Microsoft now use WPVIP for their content and marketing needs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Both companies, Gernert said, come from similar backgrounds, with &#8220;roots&#8221; in digital publishing and a &#8220;heavy focus on understanding the impact of content.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve really to shift more towards content marketing and starting to think more deeply beyond just what traditional page analytics provide,&#8221; he continued. That means doing more than measuring pageviews and time on site and &#8220;really starting to look more deeply at things like conversation, attribution, areas &#8230; that from a marketer&#8217;s perspective are impactful.&#8221;</p>
<p>WordPress and Parse.ly already work well together, but the plan is to make WPVIP features available to Parse.ly customers while also making more Parse.ly data available to WPVIP publishers. And Gernert said there also opportunities to add more commerce-related data to Parse.ly, since Automattic also owns WooCommerce.</p>

<p>The goal, he said, is to &#8220;make Parse.ly better for WordPress and best for WPVIP.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the same time, he added, &#8220;There&#8217;s no plans here to make Parse.ly the only analytics solution that runs on our platform. We want to preserve the flexibility and interoperability [of WordPress], and we want to make sure from a Parse.ly perspective that it still exists as a standalone product. That&#8217;s key to its future and we will continue to invest in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parse.ly was founded in 2009 and has raised $12.9 million in funding from investors including Grotech Ventures and Blumberg Capital, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/parsely/company_financials">according to Crunchbase</a>. Parse.ly founders Sachin Kamdar and Andrew Montalenti are joining WPVIP, with Kamdar leading go-to-market strategy for Parse.ly and Montalenti leading product.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve always had deep admiration for WPVIP&#8217;s market position as the gold standard for enterprise content teams, and we’re thrilled to be able to join together,” Kamdar said in a statement. “From the culture and people, to the product, market and vision, we’re in lockstep to create more value for our customers. This powerful combination of content and intelligence will push the industry forward at an accelerated pace.”</p>
<p>The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Thousands of Chinese users suddenly found themselves unable to access Clubhouse on early Monday evening as the country prepared to start the week-long Lunar New Year holiday. Inside WeChat groups, Clubhouse users rushed to report the situation and help each other with ways to get back onto the red hot live audio app.</p>
<p>Audio drop-in startup Clubhouse was rapidly gaining steam in China, attracting a bevy of users early on to conversations on a wide range of topics. The app seemed likely to meet the fate of other U.S.-based apps and services, however – namely, a ban – and as of Monday, that indeed what Clubhouse faces, as confirmed by TechCrunch. Clubhouse is no longer available to users in China, and is unlikely to return given how much the app&#8217;s model would have to change to comply with Chinese internet regulation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110080" style="width: 760px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110080" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2110080" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SSL-notice.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="427" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SSL-notice.jpg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SSL-notice.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SSL-notice.jpg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SSL-notice.jpg?resize=680,387 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SSL-notice.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110080" class="wp-caption-text">Notice received by users in China when trying to access Clubhouse as of Monday.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Clubhouse has faced <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-where-are-the-adults-in-the-clubhouse/">criticism at home in the U.S. for its lack of effective moderation and abuse-prevention practices</a>, so it&#8217;s hardly a surprise that it has fallen afoul of China&#8217;s rather more strict enforcement of measures designed to stifle the spread information the government deems inappropriate for discussion. The app was also not officially available via Apple&#8217;s China App Store, though access to it and its audio rooms was, before today, freely available without use of a VPN provided a user had the app installed on their device.</p>
<p>As Clubhouse was not listed on the Chinese App Store, so it’s unclear how many people from mainland China were on the platform. A room discussing the 1989 pro-democracy Tiananmen protest, a taboo topic in China, reached the maximum number of participants at 5,000 on Friday. Some users are reporting inside WeChat groups that they can no longer receive verification codes at their Chinese phone numbers, which could provide additional clues to the level of blockage. Users in China used their Chinese phone numbers to sign up for Clubhouse, and those are linked to their real ID in the country, which means there are potential risks for those who registered.</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, Clubhouse soared in popularity within a few communities in mainland China, including people in startups, investment, academic, or those with overseas background. Many of them were aware the app wouldn’t last long in China given free and often political debates frequented the platform. Clubhouse rooms titled “How long will Clubhouse last in China” and “Have you been invited to have tea for using Clubhouse?” attracted big crowds. “Having tea” is a euphemism for being taken away for interrogation by the police.</p>
<p>As TechCrunch noted on Saturday, Clubhouse&#8217;s early success prior to this shutdown has already prompted the creation of a number of homegrown alternatives designed around drop-in audio networking. Clubhouse&#8217;s popularity in China, however, may be difficult to replicate for any of these similar efforts – for the same reasons the original app itself is now inaccessible within the country.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a Great Firewall circumvention tool like a virtual private network (VPN), some users on mainland China managed to regain access to Clubhouse.</p>
<p>We will update with more information about the ban&#8230;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Phable, a three-year-old healthtech startup that is serving patients with chronic illnesses in India, has raised $12 million in a new financing round as it looks to scale in the world’s second most populated nation.</p>
<p>Manipal Hospitals, one of the largest healthcare providers in India, led the Series A round in Phable. Existing investor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/the-venture-firm-sosv-has-hired-former-techcrunch-coo-ned-desmond-to-help-grow-its-startups/">New Jersey-headquartered SOSV</a> also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of people in India suffer from chronic diseases. One of the biggest challenges they face is the volume of transactions they have to manage each day. There are appointments with doctors and labs for tests, purchasing of medicines, medical devices and insurance, and keeping a log of their test results.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Bangalore-based startup has built a full-stack solution to process all these transactions. It has also developed what it claims to be the world’s largest integration with medical IoT devices.</p>
<p>The purpose of this is to automatically collect patients’ data so that doctors can keep a better track of their progress. The app also enables patients to share what medicine they are taking, and the frequency of the intake.</p>
<p>In an interview with TechCrunch, Phable co-founder Sumit Sinha explained that patients often become less disciplined about taking full dose of their medication once they start to see improvements in their conditions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phablecare.com/">Phable</a> has created a more transparent and real-time communication channel that allows a doctor to nudge their patients to take their medicine on time, and make any necessary changes to the lifestyle or medication cycle, or request a follow-up appointment. The app itself can be used for tele-consultation, the demand for which has skyrocketed in recent quarters as coronavirus forced people to stay indoors.</p>
<p>“This creates a feedback loop between the patient and the doctor even when the patient is not at the clinic or hospital and enables active interventions to get the best outcome,” he said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2110071" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2110071" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2110071 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phable-india.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="615" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phable-india.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phable-india.jpg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phable-india.jpg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phable-india.jpg?resize=768,461 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phable-india.jpg?resize=680,408 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phable-india.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2110071" class="wp-caption-text">Image: Phable</p></div></p>
<p>The startup also sells a range of medical IoT devices through its platform that patients can buy for tracking their body performance such as blood pressure and glucose levels. Sinha said that even if a patient has bought a machine from some other place, Phable’s app is compatible with most devices. (Even if it is not &#8212; as is sometimes the case with low-cost, non-branded devices &#8212; patients can manually enter their result, or take a picture of the result and through computer vision, Phable is able to understand and make a record of it.)</p>
<p>“The growing burden of chronic diseases in India is exacerbated by issues around compliance of patients with the treatment regime – including medication, lifestyle changes and periodic follow-ups. Phable would help to fill that gap and would enhance the quality of life for many patients. Manipal Hospitals is pleased to have this opportunity to work with the team at Phable to enhance and grow their offerings,” said Dr. Ranjan Pai, Chairman of Manipal Education and Medical Group, in a statement.</p>
<p>Phable, which employs 72 people, also maintains partnership with 1mg and Medlife to make it easier for patients to place orders for their medicines and get them delivered at their doorstep.</p>
<p>In recent quarters, millions of Indians have consulted with their doctors through their phone or computer and bought medication online for the first time. According to Frost &amp; Sullivan, e-pharmacy market in India was estimated to be around $512 million in 2018. In a recent note to clients, analysts at Bank of America estimated this market to be worth $2.4 billion by 2022. (The preventive healthcare market, which caters to physical and mental well-being, is expected to grow to $102 billion by 2022.)</p>
<p>Phable today serves patients with cardiovascular and endocrinology related chronic diseases. It has already served over 220,000 patients and plans to deploy the fresh capital to scale the startup to reach 5 million patients and 35,000 doctors by the end of the year. It also plans to broaden its offering, including allowing patients to purchase insurance from within the app or website.</p>
<p>Currently Phable is used by over 5,000 doctors. These doctors are using the platform to stay better connected with their existing patients and are not being paid by Phable. The startup, however, also enables patients to discover more doctors. All in all, Sinha said doctors have seen their revenue grow by 20% by using Phable’s platform.</p>
<p>“Phable started with an uncompromising vision of connected healthcare, reimagined through leading-edge technology, and has been unrelenting in their efforts since day one. It&#8217;s been our privilege to work with the team through our accelerator MOX and to further support Phable as they go on to better millions of lives in India,” said William Bao Bean, General Partner at SOSV, in a statement.</p>

<p>The firm, which was founded in Lausanne, Switzerland and has offices outside of Boston, received funding from Permira with help from Highland Europe and Index Ventures. The company has now raised over $336 million, according to Crunchbase data.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, understanding how folks are using a company&#8217;s technology choices internally is always going to be useful, but when the pandemic hit and offices closed, having access to this type of data became even more important.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Nexthink CEO and co-founder Pedro Bados says that most monitoring tools are focused on figuring out if the systems are working correctly and finding ways to fix them. Nexthink takes a different approach, looking at how employees are adopting the tools a company is offering.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we do at Nexthink is to take the [monitoring] problem from a completely different perspective. We say that we&#8217;re going to give your IT department a real time understanding of how employees are experiencing IT [at your company],&#8221; Bados told me.</p>
<p>He says that they do this by looking at the problem from the employees&#8217; perspective. &#8220;At the end of the day we&#8217;re giving all the insights to IT departments to make sure they can improve the digital experience of their employees,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>This could involve querying the user base in the same way that HR and marketing survey tools allow companies to check the pulse of employees or customers. By gathering this type of data, it helps IT understand how employees are using the company&#8217;s technology choices.</p>
<p>This software is aimed at larger organizations with at least 5000 employees. Today, the company has over a 1000 of these customers including Best Buy, Fidelity, Liberty Mutual and 3M. What&#8217;s more, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/one-final-100m-arr-company-and-the-startups-we-want-to-meet-in-2021/">has surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue</a>, a success benchmark for SaaS companies like Nexthink.</p>

<p>Nexthink currently has 700 employees with plans to reach 900 by the end of this year, and as a maturing startup, Bados has given a lot of thought on how to build a diverse workforce. Just being spread out in two countries gives an element of geographic diversity, but he says it takes more than that, and it all starts with recruitment.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way to make sure we get more diversity is we look at recruitment and make sure that we have a balanced pipeline. That&#8217;s something we measure as a company,&#8221; he said. They also have a diversity committee, which is charged with delivering diversity training and figuring out ways to hire a more diverse and inclusive workforce.</p>
<p>While the company has a healthy valuation and a good amount of money in the bank, Bados doesn&#8217;t see an IPO for at least a couple of years. He says he wants to double or triple the business before taking that step. For now, though with $180 million in additional runway and a $100 million in ARR, the company is well positioned for whatever future moves it chooses to make.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Elon Musk notified the world that he would be donating $100 million to pursue new technologies for carbon capture, methods through which carbon dioxide can be actively extracted from the atmosphere as a means to help stave off climate change. As TechCrunch reported in January when he made the tweet, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/elon-musk-is-donating-100m-to-find-the-best-carbon-capture-technology/">Musk&#8217;s sizeable pool of monetary incentive would be going to the Xprize foundation</a>, a non-profit that has organized similar ambitious technology competitions aimed at developing world-changing tech. Now, Xprize and Musk have released new <a href="https://www.xprize.org/prizes/elonmusk">details of the competition</a>.</p>
<p>The entire $100 million prize pool is up for grabs with this competition, which will seek solutions that can &#8220;pull carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere or oceans and lock it away permanently in an environmentally benign way.&#8221; That&#8217;s an ambitious goal, and one that seeks methods for carbon extraction which have a net negative effect on the overall global balance of the element&#8217;s presence. Xprize aims to award up to 15 finalists $1 million each, along with three top winners, with $50 million to the Grand Prize victor, and $20 million and $10 million respectively for second and third place. 25 student scholarships valued at $250,000 each will also be up for grabs specifically for student team entrants.</p>
<p>To qualify for victory, solutions must be able to extract 1 ton of CO2 per day, and be viable in a scaled, validated model at time of presentation, with the ability to scale it to &#8220;gigaton levels&#8221; in commercially viable ways in future. Those are big goals for new technologies, but the competition&#8217;s stakes are high: Musk has frequently referred to climate change as an existential threat to humanity, and carbon capture is one key means to combat it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pRLKCJKFQN"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/elon-musk-is-donating-100m-to-find-the-best-carbon-capture-technology/">Elon Musk is donating $100M to find the best carbon capture technology</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Elon Musk is donating $100M to find the best carbon capture technology&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/elon-musk-is-donating-100m-to-find-the-best-carbon-capture-technology/embed/#?secret=pRLKCJKFQN" data-secret="pRLKCJKFQN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Carbon capture methods exist, and some are at the center of new startups and emerging businesses, like Canadian company Carggon Engineering which uses CO2 extracted from the atmosphere to create new types of fuel, or Air Vodka, a carbon negative vodka distilled using C02 removed from the atmosphere. Though there are a handful of companies pursuing this, the problem is that it&#8217;s typically very expensive to remove carbon in a way that is both safe and that has no subsequent impact on the environment from its resulting byproducts.</p>
<p>The new Xprize competition hopes to spur the development of a wide range of emerging companies in a way similar to how the the 2004 $10 million private spaceflight Ansari Xprize led the development of a whole new era in the space industry. The competition will officially begin on April 22, 2021, at which time full guidelines will be made available and registration will open. Applicants will have up to four years to submit their solution, with the competition closing on Earth Day 2025 and the initial $1 million awards distributed after 18 months following that. That will provide the funding necessary for teams to build out their full-scale demos to claim the top prizes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/verse-innovations">VerSe Innovation</a>, the parent firm of popular news and entertainment app Dailyhunt and short video app Josh, said on Monday it has raised over $100 million as part of a Series H financing round from Qatar Investment Authority and Glade Brook Capital Partners.</p>
<p>The announcement follows <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/google-leads-145-million-investment-in-indias-glance/">another $100 million+</a> investment the startup secured from Google, AlphaWave, and Microsoft in December last year. That tranche of investment, also part of Series H, had turned Dailyhunt into a unicorn (giving it a valuation of $1 billion or higher). The startup has to-date raised about $430 million.</p>
<p>Dailyhunt, co-run by Virendra Gupta and former Facebook India head Umang Bedi, is a popular news and entertainment app that serves more than 285 million users each day in 14 local languages in India. Its reach in India, the world&#8217;s second largest internet market, would explain why Twitter last month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/17/twitter-moments-dailyhunt-india/">partnered with the Indian firm to bring Moments to Dailyhunt</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/verse-innovations/">VerSe Innovation</a> expanded to short form videos last year, with Josh, after New Delhi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">banned TikTok</a> and created a theoretical void for snacking content in the country. Scores of large giants and startups &#8212; including MX Player and ShareChat &#8212; have attempted to try their hand at short form videos in the recent quarters.</p>
<p>Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/07/facebook-expands-instagram-reels-to-india/">launched Instagram Reels in India last year</a>, and YouTube <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/14/youtube-launches-its-tiktok-rival-youtube-shorts-initially-in-india/">launched Shorts</a>, which is already garnering over 3.5 billion daily views in India, it said last month. (With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/youtube-and-whatsapp-inch-closer-to-half-a-billion-users-in-india/">over 450 million users in India</a>, YouTube is closing in on WhatsApp&#8217;s market lead in India.)</p>
<p>Josh appears to have emerged as one of the leading players: The startup says Josh has amassed over 85 million monthly active users &#8212; 40 million of whom check the app each day &#8212; and the app sees more than 1.5 billion video plays everyday.</p>
<p>Now the startup says it is exploring expansion into more categories and like with Dailyhunt and Josh, cater users in smaller cities and towns and eventually replicate this model in international markets.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s internet economy is expected to be worth $639 billion by 2030, analysts at Citi wrote in a report to clients late last month. The coronavirus pandemic accelerated digital adoption and users&#8217; appetite to transact online, a report from analysts at UBS said last week.</p>

<p>&#8220;Josh represents a confluence of India’s top 200+ best creators, the 10 biggest music labels, 15+ million UGC creators, best in class content creation tools, the hottest entertainment formats, and formidable user demographics. Josh has been consistently rated as the leading Indian short-video app in India on the Play store,&#8221; the startup said in a statement.</p>
<p>The startup said it will deploy the fresh capital to broaden its local languages content offering, and expand its creators ecosystem and AI and ML tech stacks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ByteDance is bringing its battle with archrival Tencent to the court at a time when the Chinese government moves to curve the power of the country&#8217;s internet behemoths.</p>
<p>The Beijing Intellectual Property Court has permitted a ByteDance lawsuit brought against Tencent to proceed, a ByteDance spokesperson confirmed with TechCrunch. Upstart new media company ByteDance alleged that Tencent&#8217;s restrictions on Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, are in violation of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/china-antitrust-rules-on-internet-industry/">China&#8217;s anti-monopoly draft rules</a>. Douyin is headquartered in Beijing while Tencent&#8217;s base is in Shenzhen.</p>
<p>For three years, Tencent has blocked Douyin from its flagship networking apps WeChat and QQ, which bans users from viewing or sharing content from the short video app. Tencent&#8217;s behavior &#8220;no doubt&#8221; constitutes &#8220;monopolistic behavior achieved by abusing market domination to exclude and limit competition,&#8221; which the proposed anti-monopoly law prohibits, Douyin, <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/gP1oPRVpW6qD_dEGIKw3vQ">said</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We believe that competition is better for consumers and promotes innovation. We have filed this lawsuit to protect our rights and those of our users.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tencent said in response the accusation is false and malicious defamation. It further asserted that Douyin, which is used by 600 million users every day, uses illegal and anti-competitive methods to access WeChat&#8217;s user data, and it&#8217;s <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/0ujgHBoZmIvPqzpP40t6DA">planning to sue</a> ByteDance for harming its platform ecosystem and user rights.</p>
<p>ByteDance and Tencent each covet the other&#8217;s turf. ByteDance<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/15/tiktok-challenges-wechat/"> debuted a chat app</a> to take on Tencent&#8217;s dominance in social networking, while Tencent countered Douyin&#8217;s popularity by introducing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/06/chinas-obsession-with-short-videos-has-its-internet-giants-worried/">a slew of short video apps</a>. Neither has managed to threaten the other&#8217;s dominance in their respective field.</p>
<p>Early signs show that the Chinese government is increasingly willing to rein in monopolistic behavior on the Chinese internet following two decades of relatively lax regulations.</p>
<p>In November, the country&#8217;s top market regulator <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/china-antitrust-rules-on-internet-industry/">unveiled</a> the draft version of its first anti-monopoly law, opening a floodgate to lawsuits and investigations. In December, regulators launched <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/23/alibaba-antitrust-probe/">an antitrust probe into Alibaba</a> for forcing vendors to sell exclusively on its platform. Just this month, a court in Beijing <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vipshop-hldg-china-antitrust/china-fines-vipshop-almost-500000-for-unfair-competition-acts-idUSKBN2A803Y">imposed a 3 million yuan</a> ($464,000) fine on fashion e-commerce site Vipshop over anti-competitive behavior. It won&#8217;t be surprising to see more Chinese internet giants getting hit by anti-trust actions in the upcoming months.</p>

<p>In the same Twitter thread, Destin said he remains &#8220;fully committed to Stride and what the team is building&#8221;.</p>
<p>That team, however, has now seen a plethora of personnel changes since the VC firm was officially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/15/stride-vc-official/">unveiled</a> in late 2018, with Stebbings being the latest to move on. Paris-based partner Pia d’Iribarne <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/stride-vc-loses-partner-pia-diribarne/">departed</a> last August and has since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/new-wave/">co-founded New Wave</a>. Stride also lost operating partner Arj Soysa about a year earlier. He&#8217;s now a finance director at Mubadala Capital in Europe.</p>
<p>Alongside Destin, Stride&#8217;s current team members include investor Pietro Invernizzi, finance and operations partner Ross W., and executive assistant Georgina Gallagher, according to LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Both Stebbings and Destin declined to comment further, pointing me to Destin&#8217;s tweets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">On Friday, the National Labor Relations Board rejected Amazon’s attempt to delay a union vote set to begin on Monday, February 8. For many, the online giant’s bid was seen as a stalling tactic, including a motion to demand votes take place in-person &#8212; a clear health risk, as the COVID-19 virus still poses a major threat in the United States and globally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once again <span class="il">Amazon</span> workers have won another fight in their effort to win a union voice,&#8221; Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union President Stuart Appelbaum said in a statement regarding the NLRB&#8217;s decision. &#8220;<span class="il">Amazon</span>’s blatant disregard for the health and safety of its own workforce was demonstrated yet again by its insistence for an in-person election in the middle of the pandemic. Today’s decision proves that it’s long past time that <span class="il">Amazon</span> start respecting its own employees; and allow them to cast their votes without intimidation and interference.&#8221;</p>
<p>Amazon, however, said it was disappointed in the decision because it goes against the company&#8217;s goal of getting as many people as possible to vote in the election, Amazon spokesperson Heather Knox said in a statement to TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Even the National Labor Relations Board recognizes that the employee participation rate for its own elections conducted with mail ballots is 20-30% lower than the participation rate for in-person voting,&#8221; Knox said. &#8220;Amazon proposed a safe on-site election process validated by COVID-19 experts that would have empowered our associates to vote on their way to, during and from their already-scheduled shifts. We will continue to insist on measures for a fair election that allow for a majority of our employee voices to be heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, the mail-in voting process will continue as planned and ultimately determine whether Amazon’s Alabama warehouse &#8212; which employs around 6,000 &#8212; will join the RWDSU, an AFL-CIO affiliate in operation since 1937. The move would be a major watershed moment for Amazon’s blue-collar workforce &#8212; and could spur similar unionizing among the 110 or so fulfillment centers the company operates across the U.S.</p>
<p>The vote comes amid a sea change for both blue and white-collar workers in a tech sector that has traditionally rejected such movements. Notable recent examples include a group of Google contracts in Pittsburgh, followed by this year’s launch of an Alphabet Workers Union that includes more than 800 employees. Last February, Kickstarter voted to unionize its workforce, followed by developer platform Glitch the following month.</p>

</ul>

	</p>
<p>Unions, which act as an intermediary between workers and their employers, advocate on behalf of employees for better wages, working conditions and other benefits through collective bargaining. While it does cost money to join a union, unionized workers tend to make higher salaries than their non-unionized counterparts. Among full-time wage and salary workers, union members had median weekly earnings of $1,144, compared to $958 for non-union members in 2020,<a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm"> according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.</p>
<p>Often times these unions are the product of months or years of planning behind the scenes &#8212; likely not a surprise for anyone possessing a basic knowledge of the history of labor in the United States. The formation of an Amazon union would present a historic move for labor and tech in the U.S. &#8212; a potential outcome the company has been looking to stop dead in its tracks.</p>
<p>Besides seeking to delay the vote, Amazon has also gone all-in on trying to persuade its workers in Bessemer not to vote to unionize. Amazon&#8217;s <a href="https://www.doitwithoutdues.com/">Do It Without Dues website</a> encourages workers to keep things the way they are, instead of having to pay union dues.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re paying dues&#8230;it will be restrictive meaning it won&#8217;t be easy to be as helpful and social with each other,&#8221; the site states. &#8220;So be a doer, stay friendly and get things done versus paying dues.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, workers have complained that Amazon&#8217;s anti-union tactics are too much. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/02/amazon-union-warehouse-workers/">One worker told The Washington Post</a> they were bombarded with anti-union messaging in the bathroom stall.</p>
<p>Amazon opened the Bessemer warehouse in March 2020 and says it has created more than 5,000 full-time jobs starting with a pay of $15.30 per hour, including healthcare, vision and dental insurance, and 50% 401(K) match, Knox said. She described the work environment as &#8220;safe&#8221; and &#8220;innovative,&#8221; and added, &#8220;We work hard to support our teams and more than 90% of associates at our Bessemer site say they would recommend Amazon as a good place to work to their friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Amazon’s labor history has been a spotty one. The company has often come under fire for its treatment of workers &#8212; particularly those in logistics and shipping, like the 6,000 currently employed in its Alabama fulfillment center. Many of those issues were amplified throughout 2020, as Amazon employees were deemed “essential workers” in the earliest days of the pandemic’s arrival in the States.</p>
<p>In November, former warehouse employee Christian Smalls <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/amazon-faces-lawsuit-alleging-failure-to-provide-ppe-to-workers-during-pandemic/">filed a suit against the company</a>, citing a failure to provide workers with proper PPE amid the pandemic.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Amazon faces lawsuit alleging failure to provide PPE to workers during pandemic&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/amazon-faces-lawsuit-alleging-failure-to-provide-ppe-to-workers-during-pandemic/embed/#?secret=cjDhj5E8wI" data-secret="cjDhj5E8wI" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“I was a loyal worker and gave my all to Amazon until I was unceremoniously terminated and tossed aside like yesterday’s trash because I insisted that Amazon protect its dedicated workers from COVID-19,” Smalls said at the time. “I just wanted Amazon to provide basic protective gear to the workers and sanitize the workplace.”</p>
<p>Smalls was fired last March after organizing a walkout at a Staten Island fulfillment center. A spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch that he was fired after “putting the health and safety of others at risk and violations of his terms of employment.”</p>
<p>In April, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/13/amazon-workers-fired/">employees Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa were fired</a> for “repeatedly violating internal policies,” according to the company. The pair were vocal critics of the company’s treatment of warehouse employees &#8212; criticism that came to a head during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Then, in September, <a href="https://twitter.com/jfslowik/status/1300756214574276610">reports surfaced</a> that Amazon was looking to hire an intelligence analyst. Specifically, Amazon in a job posting said it was seeking someone who would inform higher-ups and attorneys “on sensitive topics that are highly confidential, including labor organizing threats against the company.”</p>
<p>Amazon swiftly took down that job post, saying it was “not an accurate description of the role – it was made in error and has since been corrected,” Amazon spokesperson Maria Boschetti said in a statement to TechCrunch at the time.</p>
<p>While Amazon did not give a specific revised description, the company said the role is meant to support its team of analysts that focus on external events, like weather, large community gatherings or other events that have the potential to disrupt traffic or affect the safety and security of its buildings and the people who work at those buildings.</p>
<p>However, that same day, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3azegw/amazon-is-spying-on-its-workers-in-closed-facebook-groups-internal-reports-show">Vice reported Amazon had been spying on workers for years</a> to monitor for any potential strikes or protests. Amazon has since said it will stop using its social media monitoring tool.</p>
<p>“We have a variety of ways to gather driver feedback and we have teams who work every day to ensure we’re advocating to improve the driver experience, particularly through hearing from drivers directly,” Boschetti said in a statement. “Upon being notified, we discovered one group within our delivery team that was aggregating information from closed groups. While they were trying to support drivers, that approach doesn’t meet our standards, and they are no longer doing this as we have other ways for drivers to give us their feedback.”</p>
<p>By unionizing, Amazon workers hope to gain the right to collectively bargain over their working conditions, like safety standards, pay, breaks and other issues. Unionizing would also enable workers to potentially become &#8220;just cause&#8221; employees versus at-will, depending on how the negotiations go.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amazon presents a threat to the very fabric of society and the social contract we work to uphold for all working people,&#8221; <a href="https://bamazonunion.org/whyunion">the union organizers state on their site</a>. &#8220;Corporations like Amazon have built decades of increasingly bold and aggressive attacks on workers’ rights that have dramatically eroded union density, harmed working conditions, and lowered the standard of living for many workers. And it’s not stopping. The RWDSU has always stood against anti-worker and anti-union companies. Our union will not back down until Amazon is held accountable for these and so many more dangerous labor practices.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mail-in voting ends March 29, with the NLRB set to begin counting ballots the following day on a virtual platform. Each party will be allowed to have four people attend the count.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has reached out to Amazon and will update this story if we hear back.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is embarking on a major project to <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey</a> the venture capital investors of Europe, and their cities.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey of VCs in Belfast and Northern Ireland</a> will capture how things are faring, and what changes are being wrought amongst investors by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>We’d like to know how Northern Ireland&#8217;s startup scene is evolving, how the tech sector is being impacted by COVID-19, and, generally, how your thinking will evolve from here.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Our survey will only be about investors, and <strong>only the contributions of VC investors will be included.</strong> More than one partner is welcome to fill out the survey. (Please note, if you have filled the survey out already, there is no need to do it again).</p>
<p>The shortlist of questions will require only brief responses, but the more you can add, the better.</p>
<p><a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6"><strong>You can fill out the survey here.</strong></a></p>
<p>Obviously, investors who contribute will be featured in the final surveys, with links to their companies and profiles.</p>
<p>What kinds of things do we want to know? Questions include: Which trends are you most excited by? What startup do you wish someone would create? Where are the overlooked opportunities? What are you looking for in your next investment, in general? How is your local ecosystem going? And how has COVID-19 impacted your investment strategy?</p>
<p>This survey is part of a broader <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys/">series of surveys</a> we’re doing to help founders find the right investors.</p>
<p>https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys/</p>
<p>For example, here is the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/09/14-vcs-discuss-covid-19-and-londons-future-as-a-tech-hub/">survey of London</a>.</p>
<p>You are not in Northern Ireland, but would like to take part? That&#8217;s fine! Any European VC investor can STILL fill out the survey, as we probably will be putting a call out to you next anyway! And we will use the data for future surveys on vertical topics.</p>
<p>The survey is covering almost every city and country on in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_for_the_Mediterranean">Union for the Mediterranean</a>, so just look for your country and city on the <a href="https://forms.gle/k4Ji2Ch7zdrn7o2p6">survey</a> and please participate (<em>if</em> you&#8217;re a venture capital investor).</p>
<p>Thank you for participating. If you have questions you can email mike@techcrunch.com</p>
<p>(Please note: Filling out the survey is not a guarantee of inclusion in the final published piece).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">We crawled into an abandoned school bus, trespassed through dilapidated hallways, dodged fleeting thunderstorms, and wandered the empty streets of Chinatown late into the evening. For two summery weeks, I couldn’t have been happier.</p>
<p class="p1">New York City was in lockdown. I’d been quarantined in my dinky apartment, disheartened and restless. I was anxious to do something creative. Thankfully, the Hasselblad X1D II 50C arrived for review, along with approval from the studio heads for socially-distanced, outdoor shoots.</p>
<p class="p1">Taking pictures of the mundane (flowers, buildings, and such) would’ve been a disservice to a $10,000 camera kit, so instead, my friends and I collaborated on a fun, little project: we shot portraits inspired by our favorite films.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p id="speakable-summary"><div id="attachment_2109336" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2109336" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2109336 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hasselblad_X1D_II_50C_shotlist.jpg" alt="Hasselblad X1D II shotlist" width="1024" height="768" /><p id="caption-attachment-2109336" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Veanne Cao</p></div></p>
<p>Equipped with masks and a bottle of hand sanitizer, we put the X1D II 50C and 80mm F/1.9 lens (ideal for close-ups without actually having to be close up) through its paces in some of NYC’s less familiar backdrops.</p>
<p>[gallery type="slideshow" link="none" columns="1" size="full" ids="2109350,2109351,2109349,2109360,2109341,2109346,2109345,2109347,2109339,2109489,2109348,2109381,2109362,2109361"]</p>
<p>Before I get into any trouble for the last photo &#8211; <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2153954/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alex</a> and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5707836/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason</a> are professional stuntmen and that’s a rubber prop gun. They were reenacting the penultimate scene from<em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infernal_Affairs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infernal Affairs</a></em> &#8211; a brilliant piece of Hong Kong cinema (much better than the Scorsese remake).</p>
<p>While the camera is slightly more approachable in terms of cost and ease of use with a few upgrades (larger, more responsive rear screen, a cleaned-up menu, tethering capabilities, faster startup time and shutter release), the X1D II is essentially the same as its predecessor. So I skipped the standard review. <img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone wp-image-2109372 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hasselblad_X1D_II_50C_001.jpg" alt="Hasselblad X1D II 50C Hasselblad X1D II 50C" width="3000" height="2000" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hasselblad_X1D_II_50C_001.jpg 3000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hasselblad_X1D_II_50C_001.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hasselblad_X1D_II_50C_001.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hasselblad_X1D_II_50C_001.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hasselblad_X1D_II_50C_001.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hasselblad_X1D_II_50C_001.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hasselblad_X1D_II_50C_001.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/hasselblad_X1D_II_50C_001.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px" /></p>

<h2 class="p1">What it is, what it isn’t</h2>
<p class="p1">The most common complaint about the X1D was its slow autofocus, slow shutter release and short battery life. The X1D II improved on these features, though not by much. Rather than seeing the lag as a hindrance, I was forced to slow down and re-wire my brain for a more thoughtful shooting style (a pleasant side effect).</p>
<p class="p1">As I mentioned in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/29/two-weeks-with-a-16000-hasselblad-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my X1D review</a>, Apple and other smartphone manufacturers have made shooting great pictures effortless. As such, the accessibility has created a culture of excessively capturing everyday banalities. You shoot far more than you&#8217;ll ever need. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;m guilty of. Pretty sure 90% of the images on my iPhone camera roll are throwaways. (The other 10% are of my dog and he’s spectacularly photogenic.)</p>
<p class="p1">The X1D II, however, is not an easy camera. It’s frustrating at times. If you’re a beginner, you may have to learn the fundamentals (ISO, f-stops, when to click the shutter), but the payoff is worth it. There’s an overwhelming sense of gratification when you get that <em>one</em> shot. And at 50 megapixels, it&#8217;s packed with details and worthy of hanging on your wall. Shelling out a ton of money for the X1D II won’t instantly make you a better photographer, but it ought to encourage you to become one.</p>
<p class="p1">Without the contrived studio lights and set design, our outdoor shoots became an exercise in improvisation:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  w</span>e wandered through the boroughs finding practicals (street lights, neon lights… the sun), discovering locations, and switching spots when things didn’t pan out.</p>
<p class="p1">We explored, we had purpose.</p>
<p class="p1">My takeaway from the two weeks with this camera:  pause and be meaningful in your actions.</p>
<p class="p1">Reviewed kit runs $10,595, pre-taxed:<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s broadly based on </span></i><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the daily column that appears on Extra Crunch</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but free, and made for your weekend reading. Want it in your inbox every Saturday morning? Sign up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">here</a>. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ready? Let’s talk money, startups and spicy IPO rumors.</span></i></p>
<p>It’s been a bizarre few weeks, with Robinhood <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/how-the-gamestop-stonkathon-helped-robinhood-raise-3-4b-last-week/">raising a torrent of new funds</a> to keep its zero-cost trading model afloat during turbulent market conditions, other neo-trading houses <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/trading-app-public-drops-payment-for-order-flow-in-favor-of-tips/">changing up their business model</a> and more. But amidst all the moves in startup-land, something has been itching in the back of my head: Why are several rich people pumping crappy assets?</p>
<p>It’s fine for a retail investor to share trading ideas amongst themselves; it has happened, will happen, and will always happen. But we’ve seen folks like Elon Musk and Chamath Palihapitiya use their broad market imprint to encourage regular folks &#8212; directly and indirectly &#8212; to buy into some pretty silly trades that could lose the retail crowd lots of money that they may not be able to afford.</p>
<p>Think of Elon coming back to Twitter to <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357244295091208193?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">pump Doge</a>, a joke of a cryptocurrency that is highly volatile and mostly useless. Or Chamath putting <a href="https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1356300692109975553">money into GameStop publicly</a>, a move that he is better equipped than most to get into and out of. Which he did. And made money. Most folks that played the GameStop casino have not been as lucky, and many have lost more than they can afford.</p>
<p>Caveat emptor and all that, but I do not love folks with savvy and capital leading regular people into risky trades or into assets that are not backed by long-term fundamentals, but instead a small shot at near-term returns. Yoof.</p>
<p>Finally, keeping up the theme of general annoyance, Senator Hawley is back in the news this week with an attention-focused announcement of an idea to block big tech companies from buying smaller companies. As you would expect from the insurrection-friendly Senator, it’s not an incredibly serious proposal, and it’s written so vaguely as to be nearly humorous.</p>
<p>But as I wrote here <a href="https://alexwrites.substack.com/p/whacking-startup-valuations-is-bipartisan">on my personal blog</a> about all of this, what does matter out of the generally irksome pol is that there is bipartisan interest in limiting the ability of big tech companies to buy smaller companies. For startups, that is not good news; M&amp;A exits are critical liquidity events for startups, and big companies have the most money.</p>
<p>It’s no sauté of my onions if startup valuations fall, but I think there’s been plenty of attention noting that some Democrats and some Republicans in the U.S want to undercut top-down tech M&amp;A, and not nearly enough notice concerning what the effort might do to startup valuations and funding. And if those metrics dip, there could be fewer upstarts in the market actually working to take on the giants.</p>
<p>Food for thought.</p>
<h2>Market Notes</h2>
<p>The Exchange caught up once again with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kim-jabal-190119">Unity CFO Kim Jabal</a>. We did so not merely to make jokes with her about games that we like or don’t like, but to keep tabs on how Jabal thinks as the financial head of a company that was private when she joined, and public now. A few observations:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">GAAP v. Non-GAAP: I asked about Unity’s </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://investors.unity.com/news/news-details/2021/Unity-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results/default.aspx">recent Q4 net income</a><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, measured using generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. It was impacted by some share-based comp numbers. Jabal was clear that her team and investors are more focused on non-GAAP numbers. Why? They strip out non-cash charges like share-based comp and provide a different perspective into corporate performance. This is standard startup practice, but her comment shows how if your company is growing quickly post-IPO, you can stick to adjusted metrics and have no issue. If growth slows, I bet that changes.</span></li>
<li>COVID: Will the COVID bump to gaming stick? Per Jabal, when her company has seen a bump in engagement historically, results don’t tend to fall back to prior plateaus. I wonder if this will be the case for all COVID-boosted parts of the startup and big-tech landscape. If so, it’s very good news.</li>
<li>Know your metrics: Jabal said that her key metrics are non-GAAP operating margin and free cash flow &#8212; apart from growth, I’d add. That’s super clear and easy to grok. Startup CEOs, please have a similar distillation ready when we chat about your latest round.</li>
</ul>
<p>And speaking of startups, let’s talk about a company that I’ve had my eye on that recently raised more capital: Deepgram. I covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/18/deepgram-raises-12m-for-enterprise-speech-recognition/">the company’s Series A</a>, a $12 million round in March 2020. Now it has <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/03/deepgram-raises-25-million-to-build-custom-enterprise-speech-recognition-models/">raised $25 million more</a>, led by Tiger, so this is a fun case of big money investing early-stage, I think. Regardless, Deepgram was a bet on a particular model for speech recognition, and, then, its market. its new investment implies that both wagers came out the right way up.</p>
<p>And I was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/databricks-raises-1b-at-28b-valuation-as-it-reaches-425m-arr/">chatting with the CEO of Databricks recently</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/why-one-databricks-investor-thinks-the-company-may-be-undervalued/">more here on its latest megaround</a>), who mentioned the huge gains made in AI, and more specifically around generative adversarial networks (GANs) NLP, and more. Our read is that we should expect to see more Deepgram-ish rounds in the future as AI and similar methods of approaching data make their way into workflows.</p>
<p>And fintech player Payoneer is going public. Via a SPAC. You can read the investor presentation <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1816090/000110465921011298/tm215090d1_ex99-2.htm">here</a>. Payoneer is not a pre-revenue firm going out via a blank check; it did an expected $346 million in 2020 rev. I’m bringing it to you for two reasons. One, read the deck, and then ask yourself why all SPAC decks are so ugly. I don’t get it. And then ask yourself why isn’t it pursuing a traditional IPO? Numbers are on pages 32 and 40. I can’t figure it out. Let me know if you have a take. Best response gets Elon’s dogecoin.</p>
<h2>Various and Sundry</h2>
<p>Wrapping up this week, TechCrunch has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">new newsletter coming out on apps</a> that is going to rule. <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahintampa">Sarah Perez</a> is writing it. You can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">sign up here</a>, it’s free!</p>
<p>And if you need a new tune, you could do worse than <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/78yh8asmUHrLTQlo691PG2?si=sXA5mR7wRNeZr_foJOQnrQ">this one</a>. Have a great weekend!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The public markets have been so active lately that it’s hard to drum up excitement for yet another company making its way to the bull market. But, in the case of Bumble, a dating app where women message first, next week’s public debut is worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>The market for dating startups has long had an 11-year-old elephant in the room: Match Group. The Dallas company owns popular dating brands including Tinder, Hinge, OkCupid, and more, which some saw as the singular exit point for startups that help people meet.</p>
<p>Bumble, founded by Whitney Wolfe Herd, will change that narrative with its entrance into the public markets. Bumble is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/bumble-ipo-could-raise-more-than-1b-for-dating-service/">seeking to raise more than $1 billion upon debut. </a>The company could be worth between $5.73 billion and $6.14 billion, looking at a diluted valuation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Bumble’s choice to swipe past the classic route to sell to Match Group tells us that Wolfe Herd is bullish that the exit environment is strong for dating apps, as<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/22/week-in-review-venture-backed-loneliness/"> loneliness amid the pandemic</a> continues to impact the masses.</p>
<p>Cleo Capital&#8217;s Sarah Kunst, a former senior adviser to Bumble, tells me that Bumble is making history in a few ways, and “may well unleash a tidal wave of new funding and startups in the space.”</p>
<p>“As the youngest woman to ever take a company public, Whitney has proven that dating, a category long shunned by venture investors, is a highly lucrative and fast growing sector,” Kunst said. “She also is at the vanguard of several dawning realizations in tech: companies founded outside of Silicon Valley, companies founded by women, and gender parity on boards.”</p>
<p>We’ll be all over this on TechCrunch and Extra Crunch next week, but in the meantime, let’s get through the other news of the week. Make sure to <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">follow me on Twitter</a> so I can bother you the remaining six days of the week.</p>
<h2><strong>Pandemic-era valuations </strong></h2>
<p>Valuations are simply the price that an investor thinks a startup is worth &#8212; nothing more, nothing less. When a big event happens in the world of startups, such as a massive exit or blockbuster IPO, startups within the sector-of-interest often enjoy a boom in valuations.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> This week, we explored whether edtech enjoyed that same burst of energy. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/edtech-valuations-arent-skyrocketing-but-investors-see-more-exit-opportunities/ ">According to over a dozen investors</a>, edtech isn’t seeing skyrocketing valuations. It’s a surprise to me, but venture capitalists have their theories as to why (and seemingly are energized enough by exit opportunities in the meantime).</p>
<p><strong>Etc: </strong>Beyond edtech, this survey can give us key intel on how sectors that faced a pandemic lift, such as fintech and e-commerce, are valued and ranked by investors. It might suggest that the noise is louder than the actual dollars and cents.</p>

</ul>
<h2><strong>Carta tackles the startup liquidity problem</strong></h2>
<p>Don’t let the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/techcrunchs-favorite-companies-from-500-startups-latest-demo-day-2/ ">Demo Days fool you</a>: <a href=" https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/venture-capital-is-going-to-get-even-bigger-faster-and-more-expensive-this-year/ ">Venture capital is getting bigger, faster</a>, and older. But if you’re an angel who invested in a startup that was meant to go public in 2014, you might be getting a little bit impatient and want your capital back.</p>
<p>Carta is trying to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/cartas-startup-liquidity-service-cartax-conducts-first-transactions-on-its-own-cap-table/"> create a solution to help startups trade secondary shares</a>, pre-exit events, to bring liquidity earlier on in a startup’s life.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>The tool, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/cartas-startup-liquidity-service-cartax-conducts-first-transactions-on-its-own-cap-table/">CartaX</a>, finally launched this week after being teased out for months. Upon launch, Carta sold nearly $100 million of its own shares on its own cap table, at more than double its last valuation post-Series F round.</p>
<p><strong>Etc: </strong>Carta is, of course, hoping that its cap-table management business will help it pull off the operation unlike others who have tried and failed. Here is some context from Danny Crichton:</p>
<blockquote><p>That wave of liquidity startups ran into two problems: One was regulatory, and the other was a lack of company information about cap tables and that company’s current financial picture. Stock buyers were essentially flying blind while buying into companies, which some investors were more than willing to do, but that blindness limited the market demand for secondary shares significantly.</p></blockquote>
<p><div id="attachment_1447526" style="width: 735px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1447526" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1447526" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-517409138.png" alt="" width="725" height="408" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-517409138.png 2560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-517409138.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-517409138.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-517409138.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-517409138.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-517409138.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-517409138.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/gettyimages-517409138.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1447526" class="wp-caption-text">Image: JaaakWorks/iStock/Getty Images</p></div></p>
<h2><strong>The art of a startup narrative</strong></h2>
<p>It’s normal if sculpting a story out of the hot mess that is your day-to-day doesn’t feel natural. It’s like writing a story before you know exactly what you want to accomplish with each and every word. The difficulty doesn’t diminish the necessity, though.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know:</strong> Whether it’s pitching for a story or for millions of dollars, founders need to know <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/pitch-decks-pricing-and-how-to-nail-the-narrative-with-lightspeeds-gaurav-gupta-and-grafanas-raj-dutt/">how to nail their startup’s narrative.</a> We got into the nuts in bolts in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/pitch-decks-pricing-and-how-to-nail-the-narrative-with-lightspeeds-gaurav-gupta-and-grafanas-raj-dutt/">the latest edition of Extra Crunch Live</a>, a virtual event series for early-stage founders.</p>
<blockquote><p>We were very heads down, building these open-source projects and trying to create good software, and we just hadn’t thought a lot about the narrative. Over the years, that’s gotten a lot better, but it’s also become a lot more self-evident to us and much clearer as we write and build the business,” said Raj Dutt, Grafana’s co-founder and CEO.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Etc: </strong>Speaking of advice, here’s one warning story by Silicon Valley editor Connie Loizos about how an insurtech startup got their idea swiped (and funded) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/this-insurtech-alleges-a-venture-backer-founded-and-funded-a-copycat-a-founders-nightmare/ ">by their own venture backer</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>You&#8217;ve landed on Human Capital, a weekly newsletter detailing the latest in diversity, equity, inclusion and labor. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">Sign up here</a> to receive the newsletter every Friday at 1 p.m. PT.</em></p>
<p>The events of this week perfectly encapsulate the variety of worker and workplace-related struggles happening in the tech industry. Google settled some discrimination allegations with the Department of Labor, Amazon agreed to settle a complaint with the FTC over stolen tips from Flex workers and the Alphabet Workers Union filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board. It was quite the week so let&#8217;s get to it.</p>
<h3><b>Grocery delivery startup Dumpling faces backlash</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dumpling workers said this week they have been misled by the Instacart alternative’s business model, </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93w87d/ethical-instacart-alternative-shut-down-facebook-group-where-workers-protested-pay-changes"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vice reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Additionally, workers told Vice the company shut down their Facebook post where they were protesting pay changes. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From Vice:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Dumpling is now in hot water with many of the gig workers on its platform, which it calls &#8220;business owners.&#8221; These business owners say the company has misled them about how much autonomy and control they&#8217;d have on the platform, and has shut down their Facebook group after workers on the platform spoke out against a series of changes the company made to its pay model in the latter half of 2020. When Dumpling closed the Facebook group, it said the group &#8220;ha[d]n&#8217;t lived up to its positive intent.&#8221; </span></p></blockquote>
<h3><b>Alpha Global walks back its announcement</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember when Alpha Global announced an alliance of Alphabet workers around the world, including those affiliated with the recently-formed Alphabet Workers Union in the U.S.? Well, it turns out that wasn’t entirely true. </span><a href="https://www.uniglobalunion.org/AlphaGlobal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alpha Global has since issued a revised statement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> clarifying it did not have buy-in from AWU.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our announcement of the Alpha Global alliance, UNI mistakenly included CODE-CWA and the Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) as members of the Alpha Global Alliance and a quote from AWU Executive Chair Parul Koul, without receiving proper authorization from CWA, the Alphabet Workers Union’s elected Executive Council, or Ms. Koul. We take full responsibility and have addressed this situation to prevent it from happening again.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But by the time Alpha Global made the announcement, the damage had already been done, according to The Verge. Some AWU members expressed their concerns with the way things went down, and some are now pushing to disassociate from the Communications Workers of America. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a whole thing that you can </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/30/22256577/alphabet-workers-union-turmoil-global-alliance-announcement-google-cwa"><span style="font-weight: 400;">read more about here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>Alphabet Workers Union files complaint with NLRB</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/alphabet-union-alleges-contract-workers-were-silenced-about-pay?sref=gni836kR"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a filing with the National Labor Union</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, AWU alleged Google vendor Adecco violated the law by trying to silence employees. The complaint alleges employees were punished for discussing their pay. The complaint was filed against both Adecco and Google</span></p>
<h3><b>Google CEO meets with HBCUs</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In light of recent departures of Black leaders at Google, CEO Sundar Pichai met with five HBCUs last Friday. The meeting itself was relatively uneventful &#8212; they reportedly didn’t even talk about the allegations from Dr. Timnit Gebru and April Curley &#8212; but HBCUs and Google provided the following joint-statement to </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/business/google-hbcus/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNN</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are all encouraged about the future partnership. The meeting paved the way for a more substantive partnership in a number of areas, from increased hiring to capacity building efforts that will increase the pipeline of tech talent from HBCUs.”</span></p>
<p>Speaking of Dr. Gebru, Google&#8217;s lead of the ethical AI team, Margaret Mitchell, posted an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ERi2crDToYhYjEjxRoOzO-uOUeLgdoLPfnx1JOErg2w/edit">email she sent to Google pertaining to Gebru&#8217;s exit</a>.</p>
<h3><b>Google settles discrimination allegations with DOL</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/google-dol-discrimination-settlement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google agreed to pay $2.59 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to more than 5,500 current employees and former job applicants as part of a settlement with the U.S. Department of Labor over allegations of systemic discrimination as it relates to compensation and hiring. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google also agreed to reserve $250,000 a year for the next five years to address any potential pay equity adjustments that may come up. That brings Google’s total financial commitment to $3.8 million — a drop in the bucket for the company, whose parent company Alphabet has a market cap of $1.28 trillion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The settlement comes after the DOL’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs found pay disparities affecting female software engineers at Google’s offices in Mountain View, as well as in offices in Seattle and Kirkland, Washington. The OFCCP also found differences in hiring rates that “disadvantaged female and Asian applicants” for engineers roles at Google’s locations in San Francisco, Sunnyvale and Kirkland.</span></p>
<h3><b>Two Google workers quit to show solidarity</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vinesh Kannan, a software engineer, quit Google in light of Dr. Timnit Gebru and April Curley’s negative experiences at the company. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/vineshgkannan/status/1357115873723637764"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a tweet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Kannan said what they experienced “crossed a personal red line I wrote down when I started the job. I know I gained a lot from Google, but I also gained a lot from both of their work, and they were wronged.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">David Baker, who was a director focused on user safety, left Google last month, saying Gebru’s departure “extinguished my desire to continue as a Googler,” </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-resignations/two-google-engineers-resign-over-firing-of-ai-ethics-researcher-timnit-gebru-idUSKBN2A4090"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to Reuters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>Amazon agreed to pay $61.7 million to settle FTC complaint over stolen tips from Flex workers</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon will pay $61.7 million to compensate the drivers who loss out on the tips they were owed. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/amazon-to-pay-61-7m-to-settle-ftc-complaint-over-stolen-amazon-flex-driver-tips/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">From TC’s Sarah Perez</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the complaint against Amazon and its subsidiary Amazon Logistics, the company had advertised that it paid 100% of tips to drivers. But in reality, Amazon used the customer tips to cover the difference after it lowered the hourly rate — a change it didn’t inform drivers about, the complaint says.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FTC also alleged that Amazon didn’t stop this behavior until it became aware of the FTC investigation in 2019.</span></p>
<h3><b>Amazon union vote on the horizon</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Amazon’s motion to postpone the Bessemer, Alabama union election, the National Labor Relations Board on Friday denied the company’s request. The election will go as planned via mail-in ballots beginning on Monday, February 8. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Context: Amazon has been vocally anti-union, with a </span><a href="https://www.doitwithoutdues.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dedicated to convincing workers not to unionize, as well as fliers posted inside the workplace &#8212; even in bathroom stalls, </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/02/amazon-union-warehouse-workers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">according to The Washington Post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h3><b>Workers protest future Amazon fulfillment center</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over in Oxnard, Calif., workers protested at the site of a future Amazon fulfillment center, disrupting the construction efforts, </span><a href="https://www.vice.com/amp/en/article/3anyvw/75-striking-workers-halt-construction-at-future-amazon-warehouse"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vice reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The strike aimed to challenge the fact that Amazon contractor, Building Zone Industries, hired non-union workers from out of the state for the job. There were reportedly more than 100 people who participated in the strike and refused to cross the picket line to work on the project.</span></p>
<h3><b>CA Supreme Court rejects lawsuit challenging Prop 22</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/ca-supreme-court-denies-lawsuit-challenging-prop-22s-constitutionality/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The California Supreme Court shot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> down the lawsuit filed by a group of rideshare drivers in California and the Service Employees International Union that alleged Proposition 22 violates the state’s constitution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are disappointed in the Supreme Court’s decision not to hear our case, but make no mistake: we are not deterred in our fight to win a livable wage and basic rights,” Hector Castellanos, a plaintiff in the case, said in a statement. “We will consider every option available to protect California workers from attempts by companies like Uber and Lyft to subvert our democracy and attack our rights in order to improve their bottom lines.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The suit argued Prop 22 makes it harder for the state’s legislature to create and enforce a workers’ compensation system for gig workers. It also argues Prop 22 violates the rule that limits ballot measures to a single issue, as well as unconstitutionally defines what would count as an amendment to the measure. As it stands today, Prop 22 requires a seven-eighths legislative supermajority in order to amend the measure.</span></p>
<h3>Don&#8217;t miss TC Sessions: Justice</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m spearheading an upcoming virtual event, TC Sessions: Justice, that&#8217;s going to dive into all of these topics.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the latest episode of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/original-content-podcast/">the Original Content podcast</a>, we looked back at &#8220;Soul,&#8221; which was released on Disney+ at the end of last year.</p>
<p>The new Pixar film tells the story of Joe Gardner, a high school music teacher and jazz musician voiced by Jamie Foxx. Joe seems to be on the verge of his big break when he accidentally falls down an open manhole, sending him to a distinctly Pixar-ish twist on the afterlife, and eventually on a metaphysical quest to return to his body before an important concert..</p>
<p>Anthony has been wanting to talk about &#8220;Soul&#8221; for a while — it was easily his favorite movie of 2020, but he watched it right after we recorded our discussion of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/02/original-content-podcast-wonder-woman-1984-might-be-a-beautiful-mess-or-maybe-just-a-mess/">the best streaming content of 2020</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And if you&#8217;re worried that this is nothing more than 40 minutes of praise, well &#8230; you&#8217;re not entirely wrong. Both of us liked it a lot, appreciating both its vibrant (and in retrospect, melancholy) portrayal of New York City life before pandemic lockdowns and social distancing, as well as its inventive portrayal of the worlds our souls go to before we&#8217;re born and after we die. (It was so inventive that Jordan had to wonder whether any unusual substances may have been involved in its genesis.)</p>
<p>Still, we did acknowledge some of the criticism of &#8220;Soul,&#8221; particularly <a href="https://www.tor.com/2020/12/26/pixars-soul-aims-to-spark-an-appreciation-for-life/">certain viewers&#8217; disappointment</a> that even though it&#8217;s the first Pixar film with a Black protagonist, Joe actually spends a large portion of the film as a disembodied blue spirit — entertaining from a story perspective, but not quite an unambiguous victory for representation.</p>

<p>SoftBank, the Japanese telecom conglomerate which has also been running the gigantic Vision Fund and its successor, doesn’t want to be left out. Yesterday, it filed back-to-back SPAC registration statements for two new blank-check companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001837238/000119312521030688/d16631ds1.htm">SVF Investment Corp 2</a> is $200 million and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001837240/000119312521030731/d41389ds1.htm">SVF Investment Corp 3</a> is a $350 million vehicle. Both SPACs have a standard roughly 15% over-allotment option, which means that their final sizes will likely end up at $230 million and $400 million respectively assuming that the underwriters take their option (number three has a slightly smaller over-allotment if you’re checking my math).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>One interesting component of both SPACs is that they have what is known as a <a href="https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2018/07/06/special-purpose-acquisition-companies-an-introduction/">forward purchasing agreement</a> connected to SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2. That agreement allows the second Vision Fund to purchase shares into these SPACs when they begin their business combinations with their target startups, essentially giving it the right to buy into the mergers. The Vision Fund has a $100 million agreement with SVF 2, and a $150 million agreement with SVF 3.</p>
<p>As with all SPACs, a registration statement is merely a filing of an intention to raise money, although these days, the vast majority of filings are later consummated.</p>
<p>As the numbering indicates, SoftBank <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1828478/000119312520323022/d50198ds1.htm">had an earlier SPAC</a> that it filed in December and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001828478/999999999521000074/xslEFFECTX01/primary_doc.xml">officially closed on January 7 of this year</a>. That vehicle targeted a total fundraise of $604 million including the underwriters’ over-allotment option. It also included a $250 million forward purchase agreement with the second Vision Fund similar to these latest two vehicles.</p>
<p>What are these SPACs looking for? Well, according to the filings, “We intend to identify, acquire and manage a business in a technology-enabled sector where our management team have differentiated experience and insights. Relevant sectors may include, but are not limited to, mobile communications technology, artificial intelligence, robotics, cloud technologies, software broadly, computational biology and other data-driven business models, semiconductors and other hardware, transportation technologies, consumer internet and financial technology.”</p>
<p>That seems to cover a lot, but just in case, the filings note that “However, we may consummate a transaction with a business in a different or related industry.” So basically anything.</p>
<p>There is no timeline yet for when the SPACs could potentially close, but typical timing is 4-8 weeks given market averages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Police in Minneapolis obtained a search warrant ordering Google to turn over sets of account data on vandals accused of sparking violence in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd last year, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>The death of Floyd, a Black man killed by a white police officer in May 2020, prompted thousands to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/unpacking-techs-response-to-george-floyds-death/">peacefully protest</a> across the city. But violence soon erupted, which police say began <a href="https://www.startribune.com/police-umbrella-man-was-a-white-supremacist-trying-to-incite-floyd-rioting/571932272/">with a masked man</a> seen in a viral video with an umbrella and smashing windows of an auto-parts store in south Minneapolis. The AutoZone store was the first among dozens of buildings across the city set on fire in the days following.</p>
<p>The search warrant compelled Google to provide police with the account data on anyone who was &#8220;within the geographical region&#8221; of the AutoZone store when the violence began on May 27, two days after Floyd&#8217;s death.</p>
<p>These so-called geofence warrants — or reverse-location warrants — are frequently directed at Google in large part because the search and advertising giant collects and stores vast databases of geolocation data on billions of account holders who have &#8220;location history&#8221; turned on. Geofence warrants allow police to cast a digital dragnet over a crime scene and ask tech companies for records on anyone who entered a geographic area at a particular time. But critics say these warrants are unconstitutional as they also gather the account information on innocent passers-by.</p>
<p>TechCrunch learned of <a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20473889-minneapolis-police-searchgeolocation-warrant">the search warrant</a> from Minneapolis resident Said Abdullahi, who received an email from Google stating that his account information was subject to the warrant, and would be given to the police.</p>
<p>But Abdullahi said he had no part in the violence and was only in the area to video the protests when the violence began at the AutoZone store.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1rztlI-sV4nP45bTQxAEcKua2kDfm52UU&amp;z=17" width="100%" height="600"></iframe></p>
<p>The warrant said police sought &#8220;anonymized&#8221; account data from Google on any phone or device that was close to the AutoZone store and the parking lot between 5:20pm and 5:40pm (CST) on May 27, where dozens of the people in the area had gathered.</p>
<p>When reached, Minneapolis police spokesperson John Elder, citing an ongoing investigation, would not answer specific questions about the warrant, including for what reason the warrant was issued.</p>
<p>According to a police affidavit, police said the protests had been relatively peaceful until the afternoon of May 27, when a masked umbrella-wielding man began smashing the windows of the AutoZone store, located across the street from a Minneapolis police precinct where hundreds of protesters had gathered. Several videos show protesters confronting the masked man.</p>
<p>Police said they spent significant resources on trying to identify the so-called &#8220;Umbrella Man,&#8221; who they say was the catalyst for widespread violence across the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;This was the first fire that set off a string of fires and looting throughout the precinct and the rest of the city,&#8221; the affidavit read. At least two people were killed in the unrest. (Erika Christensen, a Minneapolis police investigator who filed the affidavit, was not made available for an interview.)</p>
<p>Police accuse the Umbrella Man of creating an &#8220;atmosphere of hostility and tension&#8221; whose sole aim was to &#8220;incite violence.&#8221; (TechCrunch is not linking to the affidavit as the police would not say if the suspect had been charged with a crime.) The affidavit also links the suspect to <a href="https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/aryan-cowboy-brotherhood">a white supremacist group</a> called the Aryan Cowboys, and to an incident weeks later where a Muslim woman was harassed.</p>
<p>Multiple videos of the protests around the time listed on the warrant appear to line up with the window-smashing incident. Other videos of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Lnarikawa/videos/3867734406634782/">the scene</a> at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/emma.fiala.7/videos/786231895117478">the time</a> of the warrant show <a href="https://twitter.com/TDavisFreep/status/1265741751521861632">hundreds of other people</a> in the vicinity. Police were positioned on rooftops and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police/protests-looting-erupt-in-minneapolis-over-racially-charged-killing-by-police-idUSKBN2332G9">used tear gas and rubber bullets</a> to control the crowds.</p>
<p>Law enforcement across the U.S. are increasingly relying on geofence warrants to solve crimes where a suspect is not known. Police have defended the use of these warrants because they can help identify potential suspects who entered a certain geographic region where a crime was committed. The warrants typically ask for &#8220;anonymized information,&#8221; but allow police to go back and narrow their requests on potential suspects of interest.</p>
<p>When allowed by law, Google notifies account holders of when law enforcement demands access to the user&#8217;s data. According to <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/us-v-chatrie-google-amicus-brief-geofence-warrant">a court filing</a> in 2019, Google said the number of geofence warrants it received went up by 1,500% between 2017 and 2018, and more than 500% between 2018 and 2019, but has yet to provide a specific number of warrants</p>
<p>Google <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/13/us/google-location-tracking-police.html">reportedly received</a> over 180 geofence warrants in a single week in 2019. When asked about more recent figures, a Google spokesperson declined to comment on the record.</p>

<p>Civil liberties groups have criticized the use of dragnet search warrants. The American Civil Liberties Union <a href="https://www.nyclu.org/en/publications/letter-google-geofence-and-keyword-warrants">said</a> that geofence warrants &#8220;circumvent constitutional checks on police surveillance.&#8221; One district court in Virginia said geofence warrants <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/08/new-federal-court-rulings-find-geofence-warrants-unconstitutional-0">violated the constitution</a> because the majority of individuals whose data is collected will have &#8220;nothing whatsoever&#8221; to do with the crimes under investigation.</p>
<p>Reports in the past year have implicated people whose only connection to a crime is simply being nearby.</p>
<p>NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/google-tracked-his-bike-ride-past-burglarized-home-made-him-n1151761">reported</a> the case of one Gainesville, Fla. resident, who was told by Google that his account information would be given to police investigating a burglary. But the resident was able to prove that he had no connection to the burglary, thanks to an app on his phone that tracked his activity.</p>
<p>In 2019, Google gave federal agents investigating several arson attacks in Milwaukee, Wis. close to 1,500 user records <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/12/11/google-gives-feds-1500-leads-to-arsonist-smartphones-in-unprecedented-geofence-search/?sh=203215ed27dc">in response to geofence warrant</a>, thought to be one of the largest grabs of account data to date.</p>
<p>But lawmakers are beginning to push back. New York state lawmakers introduced a bill last year that would, if passed, ban geofence warrants across the state, citing <a href="https://www.protocol.com/new-york-lawmakers-want-to-outlaw-geofence-warrants">the risk of police targeting protesters</a><strong>. </strong>Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R-ND) grilled Google chief executive Sundar Pichai at a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/lawmaker-questions-googles-ceo-about-geofence-warrants/">last year</a>. &#8220;People would be terrified to know that law enforcement could grab general warrants and get everyone&#8217;s information everywhere,&#8221; said Armstrong.</p>
<p>Abdullahi told TechCrunch that he had several videos documenting the protests on the day and that he has retained a lawyer to try to prevent Google from giving his account information to Minneapolis police.</p>
<p>&#8220;Police assumed everybody in that area that day is guilty,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If one person did something criminal, [the police] should not go after the whole block of people,&#8221; he said.</p>
