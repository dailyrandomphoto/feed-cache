										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe src="https://player.simplecast.com/4fe404bd-f541-4337-a4f5-3e01e9aacd14?dark=true" width="100%" height="200px" frameborder="no" scrolling="no" seamless=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>First and foremost, Equity was nominated a Webby for &#8220;Best Technology Podcast&#8221;!!! Drop everything and go <a href="https://vote.webbyawards.com/PublicVoting#/2021/podcasts/general-series/technology">Vote for Equity</a>! We&#8217;d appreciate. A <em>lot</em>. And even if we lose, well, we&#8217;ll keep doing our thing and making each other laugh.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> got together to chat through the week&#8217;s biggest news. And like every other week in recent memory, it was a busy one. But we did our best to hit some M&amp;A news, some unicorn news, and some funding news from smaller startups.</p>
<p>Now, onto the show rundown, here&#8217;s what we discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/discord-ipo-microsoft-deal/">Discord-Microsoft deal is done</a>, and Danny has a hot take. Namely, in his view, the deal was mostly banker chatter more than a real possibility. More chaff than wheat, in other words. Agree or not, we&#8217;re stoked for the Discord IPO in a few years (quarters?) time.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/mastercard-is-acquiring-identity-verification-company-ekata-for-850m/">Mastercard bought Erkata</a>, and Danny was on hand to hand to explain why we care about the deal. Sure, it was $825 million in value, but some venture data from <a href="https://finledger.com/2021/04/19/mastercard-purchases-identity-verification-company-ekata-its-6th-known-acquisition-to-exceed-a-100m-purchase-price/">Finledger helped explain just how much capital is flowing into similar companies</a>. Let&#8217;s see how <em>that</em> math works out.</li>
<li>Clearbanc rebranded itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/clearbanc-unicorn-clearco/">into a fintech unicorn,</a> providing services along with sweet, sweet capital.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/a-cooling-trend-in-public-markets-makes-uipaths-down-round-ipo-a-win-for-the-company/">UiPath IPO finally priced</a> and started to trade. It had a good first day, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/as-uipath-closes-above-its-final-private-valuation-cfo-ashim-gupta-discusses-his-companys-path-to-market/">you can check out</a> what we learned talking to its CFO here.</li>
<li>Over in China, a country that we&#8217;ve not covered enough lately, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/laiye-rpa-50-million-funding/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Laiye raised $50 million more</a>. Like UiPath it competes in the RPA world.</li>
<li>Deel, for one, had a good 2020. It hit 20x growth in revenue last year, and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/remote-hiring-startup-deel-raises-156m-at-a-1-25b-valuation-after-20x-growth-in-2020/"> recently raised at a $1.25 billion valuation.</a></li>
<li>And then we closed with two seed rounds raised by recent Y Combinator grads: Here&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/queenly-raises-2-3m-for-its-dress-marketplace/">the Queenly round</a>, and here&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/satellite-imagery-startup-albedo-closes-10m-seed-round/">the Albedo deal</a>!</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;ll see you on Monday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The black curtain pulls aside and a character straight out of the movies waves hello. This is not an uncommon occurrence when I’m around Imagineers, but this time is special. The character isn’t a costume, it’s a robot. And, unlike the m​any animatronic figures you’ve seen in the parks, it’s not stuck in one place. No, this character is walking towards me, attached only by a thin cable used for programming.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">The gait is smooth, the arms swing in a lifelike manner and the feet plant realistically. The body sways exactly as you’d expect it to. There’s no other way to say it, it’s ambling. This is Project Kiwi, a small-scale, free-roaming robotic actor — the first of its kind for Disney and a real robotics milestone.</p>
<p class="p1">The holy grail of themed entertainment has been established for decades now: a fully mobile, bipedal character that matches the appearance, personality and scale of the original. Various non-mobile levels of this vision have been achieved at parks around the world, including the incredibly lifelike <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/17/disney-showed-us-the-inner-workings-of-its-avatar-robot-and-its-just-incredible/">Na’Vi Shaman</a>, The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/how-disney-built-star-wars-in-real-life/">A1000 figure</a> that powers characters like Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge’s Hondo Ohnaka and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJtNxaTwgz0">smoothly expressive Belle</a> from Beauty and the Beast at Tokyo Disneyland. There have also been some cool mobile experiments like <a href="https://twitter.com/panzer/status/918301474404175874?s=20">the self-piloting droid “Jake”</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">The pint sized character has accurately rendered textures on its face, hands and feet. It’s dressed in a distressed red flight suit that you may remember from the films. And its eyes are expressive as it looks at me and waves. This is the moment, the one that Disney Imagineers and park goers alike have been waiting decades to realize. This is a real, walk around character that is at the proper scale, kid scale.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">A couple of weeks ago at Walt Disney Imagineering in Southern California, I saw just how close they finally are to making that dream come true. A bipedal platform, developed completely in house over the past 3 years by WDI researchers and roboticists — dressed up to look like a roughly two and a half foot tall Groot.</p>
<p class="p1">Even though the version of Kiwi that I’m looking at is Groot-flavored, it’s important to stress that this is a platform first and foremost, which means that it could take this form when it gets to the parks, or another form entirely. It’s important while developing a character to have a target character that can tell you whether or not you’re hitting an established mark of believability.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Kiwi is also is still very much a work in progress. I wouldn’t expect to see this in the wild soon, there is still a lot of work to be done on the way that Kiwi works and interacts with people and WDI does not have immediate plans to put it in the parks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">But even at this stage it’s an incredible feat of engineering that genuinely radiates that elusive characteristic that Disney always searches for with its figures: presence.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/6spi7nBqrro?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p class="p1"><b>How did we get here?</b></p>
<p class="p1">I was able to speak to the lead on Project Kiwi, R&amp;D Imagineer Principal Scott LaValley as well as Advanced Development Studio Executive SVP Jon Snoddy about how the platform came together over the past few years.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“Project KIWI started about three years ago to figure out how we can bring our smaller characters to life at their actual scale in authentic ways,” LaValley says. “It’s an exciting time for bipedal robotics and with an incredible team and our combination of technology, artistry, and magic, we are bringing characters to life that could not have happened anywhere but Disney.”</p>
<p class="p1">I’ve talked a bit about the unique Imagineering process in my previous pieces on how Disney <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/08/disney-has-begun-populating-its-parks-with-autonomous-personality-driven-robots/">builds reactive robotics</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/disney-imagineering-has-created-autonomous-robot-stunt-doubles/">autonomous stuntbots</a> and even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/how-disney-built-star-wars-in-real-life/">entire lands</a>. Imagineering works a lot like a startup in the way that it comes up with a problem to solve and then goes about pulling in other departments to help it get a solution. There is a remarkably ego-free nature to much of the way that WDI actually finds those solutions, too. They are as likely to find a key component off the shelf as they are to design, develop and patent it in house.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">The interconnected nature of Imagineering departments like ride design, show systems, special effects, animatronics department, Tech Studio R&amp;D and Disney Research means that they share solutions across the stack as well.</p>
<p class="p1">The guiding thread to all of it, of course, is storytelling. This guiding force exists at all levels of the process, keeping the project moving in the right direction — towards a better way to tell stories and transport guests.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">With Kiwi, the end goal was clear, a character that could walk on its own and interact with park guests. Unfortunately, due to the scale and complexity of the figure and the requirements for interaction and walking, no ‘off the shelf’ platforms would do. The fact is that there are actually only a handful of truly viable bipedal robotics platforms anywhere in the world and the vast majority of them are being created for industrial applications, with a handful of ‘human-scale’ solutions that are designed as marketing set pieces rather than truly autonomous systems.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">So to hit that goal, Imagineering turned to R&amp;D and LaValley’s team. LaValley had come to Disney from Boston Dynamics, where he worked on the first version of its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQni8Uz3Q0I">biped robot Atlas</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">The project scope was that they needed a biped robot that was battery powered and could be programmed to handle autonomous interactions with park guests and striped gestures and emotes. The team would take the next 3 years to build what they needed — much of which was custom for reasons we’ll get into shortly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">It’s clear at a glance that Kiwi has no operator inside. The human brain is pretty good at instinctually understanding whether a space is just too small to have a person in it. In order to achieve the small size, the team had to first build a custom skeleton that had room for every motor and actuator Kiwi would need to achieve 50 degrees of freedom, all while keeping it humanoid in shape so that it could be ‘dressed up’ as any number of characters.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">First came the frame. Prototypes were built from custom printed polymer and then eventually custom metal parts using industrial printers. The armatures and segments that they needed to house the critical components were just too complex to mill or cast. The cleverly printed metal skeleton is hollow throughout, allowing a ‘marrow conduit’ for air which rushes through the body cooling the motors and actuators. In the current Kiwi prototype the air comes in through the collar area of the suit, rushes throughout the body, propelled by fans embedded in the skeleton and exhausts near the bottom of the unit. Eventually it will use the clothing as a shroud to help air flow out near the feet.</p>
<p class="p1">Though there is some audible noise, even in this early state it is <i>very</i> low, allowing audio playing out of a speaker to enable conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">As you can see in the exclusive progress video embedded above, the lower sections were built first. Early testing around the office shows the legs and torso sneaking, bouncing, shuffling and strutting through Imagineering. This is probably the only workplace in the world where the bottom half of a torso can tiptoe past your office while you’re eating lunch and it doesn’t even merit a pause between bites.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">An enormous amount of completely custom robotics work went into the Kiwi platform. In the demonstration I saw, young Groot had a safety tether and control cable for live programming but nothing on the rig itself needed support, it was free roaming with on board battery power that LaValley says hits around the 45 minute mark currently with more longevity hoped for in the final version. In fact, a next-generation skeleton is already under development that is lighter and more efficient.</p>

<p class="p1">The legs use a system that offers a kinetic counter-balance, allowing the force of having to move and plant a foot to be off-set, making motions more power efficient and quicker. Think of a spring loaded heavy gate that makes it easier for you to swing open — but no springs, and a robotic limb instead of a gate.</p>
<p class="p1">The feet plant realistically for the very simple reason that they must actually support the figure. This gives it an additional layer of believability that just doesn’t happen with externally supported characters that “fake” a foot plant. LaValley demonstrated that the figure could easily stay afoot even if it was shoved gently or if a hand was rested on its shoulder. This kind of self-balancing is something that humans do unconsciously and continuously but it must be built and programmed in to an ambulatory robot.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Many <a href="http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=FnetahtmlFPTOFsrchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=%2220210114203%22.PGNR.&amp;OS=DN/20210114203&amp;RS=DN/20210114203">patentable inventions</a> went into this creation. One of them is a clever system of gears that translates energy across joints, allowing them to share motors with one another even across a joint like a knee or wrist. This means fewer components and the ability to keep motor and actuator packages small and compact enough to fit underneath theming.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">In order to minimize the amount of wiring throughout Kiwi — since wires are always the biggest points of failure — the team created a set of origami-like circuit boards joined by integrated flex cabling. Think of your standard computer circuit board but sliced into segments and mounted to the exterior of the hollow ‘bones’. They wrap around the limbs and other body parts, binding the control systems and motors being controlled together into a local group that reduces the amount of harnessing that needs to be spread across joints and throughout the structure.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">No actuators — the components that decide how to move a limb — that exist had the capabilities that the team needed, so they built them from scratch. At one point, LaValley handed me a ring holding iteration after iteration of a dozen actuator elements. I was holding years worth of engineering, experimentation, failure and progress on a simple bit of wire twisted together at the end.</p>
<p class="p1">Up next for Project Kiwi is a new set of actuators that can dynamically apply torque plus added sensing capabilities for more stability and reaction to uneven ground or interactions. You can imagine that, as a free roaming character people will want to take pictures with it and I doubt kids would be able to resist running up for a hug. The skeleton must be able to sense and react quickly and smoothly to those sudden external inputs in order to stay upright and keep looking natural.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">Moving from a pure IK system to a fully torque sensing system will allow for the platform to make on the fly adjustments that compensate for terrain or interaction with other performers or guests.</p>
<p class="p1">All of the work the team put into custom gearing, motors and actuation has paid off in spades with the ridiculously smooth and natural looking movements of Kiwi’s arms and legs. Quick waves, shrugs, dance moves and even boxing jabs all look like a real — if slightly gentle — creature is performing them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">The team also demonstrated the custom built performance software that they designed which allows Kiwi to have different kinds of gaits with personality layered on top. The bottom layer is an IK-style gait system that keeps Kiwi upright and walking, but then layering the personalities on top adds character to the walk while still maintaining stability. Bouncy, jaunty walks, limps, sad or downhearted walks, all with the other motions of arms and head contributing to a constantly shifting center of mass and momentum. The paddling ducks feet under the water is that gait system that takes the external inputs and integrates it into the walk naturally.</p>
<p class="p1">The current prototype software has a series of set behaviors, with a timeline that allows them to program new behaviors and actions by toggles or adjusting curves that control movement. With a series of tweaks in the software the changes become evident immediately, with Groot’s “mood” becoming immediately evident in his walk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">One moment he is bouncing along swinging his arms jauntily, clearly happy to be there. Then the next moment his arms are slumped, his head is hung and he is slowly plodding — clearly sad to be leaving the fun behind. It’s a remarkable bit of performance software.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">And even though the expressive eyes are already impressive — the team is not done. Up next on the agenda is a sensory package that allows Kiwi to more fully understand the world around it and to identify people and their faces. This becomes important because eye contact is such an emotive and powerful tool to use in transporting a participant.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Even without the sensing software I can tell you that the experience of this 2.5ft Groot locking eyes with me, smiling and waving was just incredibly transportive. Multiple times throughout my interaction I completely forgot that it was a robot at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">As I mentioned at the top, the Project Kiwi platform still has a lot of work left to do before it makes any appearances in the parks. But it’s already well on the road to being viable for things like stage performances, photo ops and eventually free roaming deployment in the parks.</p>
<p class="p1">That is really the vision, Snoddy says that the goal is to move the characters we love from across Disney’s pantheon into the spaces of the guests, elevating the entirety of the park to a live transportive experience, rather than a single ride or dark room. And to do it <i>at the proper scale</i> to make them genuine and capable of making guests believe. With these kinds of platforms, the possibilities are there to make the entire parks themselves a living breathing home for the characters, rather than the tightly controlled environments of the rides themselves.</p>
<p class="p1">The arc of history in this Imagineering journeys is drawn in robots. From Great Moments with Mr Lincoln, to incredibly expressive characters like the Na’Vi Shaman anchored inside a dark ride, to characters that hold up in bright, well lit spaces. Project Kiwi is the next frontier, allowing them to step off of the pedestal and right into the world of the guest.</p>
<p class="p1">One of the most fascinating fields in robotics currently is HRI or human-robot interaction. This multidisciplinary effort to help humans and robots communicate better is often focused on safety and awareness in industrial settings. But I’ve long had that the most incredibly interesting work in this space is being done in Imagineering R&amp;D. Over 100 million people pass through Disney’s parks per year, and the number of opportunities that they have to react to and interact with robotic characters grows yearly. And with projects like Kiwi on the horizon, this field is going to explode with new kinds of data and learnings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">And, of course, we’ll get to meet some of our favorite characters looking and acting as real as we’ve ever seen them in our world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Union&#8217;s lead data protection supervisor has called for remote biometric surveillance in public places to be banned outright under incoming AI legislation.</p>
<p>The European Data Protection Supervisor&#8217;s (EDPS) intervention follows a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">proposal</a>, put out by EU lawmakers on Wednesday, for a risk-based approach to regulating applications of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s legislative proposal includes a partial ban on law enforcement&#8217;s use of remote biometric surveillance technologies (such as facial recognition) in public places. But the text includes wide-ranging exceptions, and digital and humans rights groups were quick to warn over loopholes they argue will lead to a drastic erosion of EU citizens&#8217; fundamental rights. And last week a cross-party group of MEPs urged the Commission to screw its courage to the sticking place and outlaw the rights-hostile tech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The EDPS, whose role includes issuing recommendations and guidance for the Commission, tends to agree. In a <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/press-publications/press-news/press-releases/2021/artificial-intelligence-act-welcomed-initiative_en">press release</a> today Wojciech Wiewiórowski urged a rethink.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EDPS regrets to see that our earlier calls for a moratorium on the use of remote biometric identification systems &#8212; including facial recognition &#8212; in publicly accessible spaces have not been addressed by the Commission,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EDPS will continue to advocate for a stricter approach to automated recognition in public spaces of human features &#8212; such as of faces but also of gait, fingerprints, DNA, voice, keystrokes and other biometric or behavioural signals &#8212; whether these are used in a commercial or administrative context, or for law enforcement purposes.</p>
<p>&#8220;A stricter approach is necessary given that remote biometric identification, where AI may contribute to unprecedented developments, presents extremely high risks of deep and non-democratic intrusion into individuals’ private lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wiewiórowski had some warm words for the legislative proposal too, saying he welcomed the horizontal approach and the broad scope set out by the Commission. He also agreed there are merits to a risk-based approach to regulating applications of AI.</p>
<p>But the EDPB has made it clear that the red lines devised by EU lawmakers are a lot pinker in hue than he&#8217;d hoped for &#8212; adding a high profile voice to the critique that the Commission hasn&#8217;t lived up to its much trumpeted claim to have devised a framework that will ensure &#8216;trustworthy&#8217; and &#8216;human-centric&#8217; AI.</p>
<p>The coming debate over the final shape of the regulation is sure to include plenty of discussion over where exactly Europe&#8217;s AI red lines should be. A final version of the text isn&#8217;t expected to be agreed until next year at the earliest.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EDPS will undertake a meticulous and comprehensive analysis of the Commission’s proposal to support the EU co-legislators in strengthening the protection of individuals and society at large. In this context, the EDPS will focus in particular on setting precise boundaries for those tools and systems which may present risks for the fundamental rights to data protection and privacy,&#8221; Wiewiórowski added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.awaveip.com/en/home/">Alphawave IP</a> is a global semiconductor IP company that focuses on the way semiconductors communicate — something which is going to be crucial as 5G data networks roll out and start to power everything from homes, industry and autonomous vehicles, for instance.</p>
<p>It’s therefore interesting to note that the Toronto-born company is planning a London public listing, with a valuation of $4.5bn, and has raised $510m in backing from Blackrock and Janus Henderson. The company will also move its HQ to the UK as part of the listing.</p>
<p>The move is being welcomed by City-watchers concerned with UK tech stock listings, after the collapse of Deliveroo’s valuation post-IPO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Chief executive Tony Pialis said: “We have chosen to come to the UK to grow our business because the UK has an incredible technology and semiconductor industry ecosystem around it. There is a deep pool of knowledge, experience, and talent here… We are specialists in connectivity. Our founding team have worked together for over 20 years and have a long history of both semiconductor innovation and in creating  significant value for investors.&#8221;</p>
<p>The proposed listing comes in the context of another UK-based deep-tech company, the proposed <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56804007">sale</a> of computer chip designer Arm Holdings to a US company, which has been delayed subject to an investigation about the implications for UK national security grounds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SpaceX has another successful human space launch to its credit, after a good takeoff and orbital delivery of its Crew Dragon spacecraft on Friday morning. The Dragon took off aboard a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 5:49 AM EDT (2:49 AM EDT). On board were four astronauts, including NASA&#8217;s Megan McArthur and Shane Kimbrough, as well as JAXA&#8217;s Akihiko Hoshide and the ESA&#8217;s Thomas Pesquet.</p>
<p>This was Spacex&#8217;s second official astronaut delivery mission for NASA, after its Crew-1 operation last year. Unlike Crew-1, Crew-2 included use of two re-flown components in the spacecraft system, including the first stage booster, which was used during the Crew-1 launch, and the Dragon capsule, which was used for SpaceX&#8217;s first ever human spaceflight, the final demonstration mission of its spacecraft certification program for NASA, which flew Bob Behnken (side note: this mission&#8217;s pilot, McArthur, is Behnken&#8217;s wife) and Doug Hurley to the ISS. SpaceX has characterized the use of re-flown elements as arguably even safer than using new ones, with CEO Elon Musk noting that you wouldn&#8217;t want to be on the &#8220;first flight of an airplane when it comes out of the factory&#8221; during a conversation with XPRIZE&#8217;s Peter Diamandis on Thursday evening.</p>
<p>Now that the Crew Dragon is in its target transfer orbit, it&#8217;ll be making its way to rendezvous with the Space Station, which will take just under 24 hours. It&#8217;ll be docking with the station early tomorrow morning, attaching to a docking port that was just cleared earlier this month when SpaceX&#8217;s other Crew Dragon relocated to another port on the ISS earlier this month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This launch also included a recovery attempt for the booster, with a landing at sea using SpaceX&#8217;s drone landing pad. That went as planned, meaning this booster which has already flown two different sets of human astronauts, could be used to fly yet another after refurbishment.</p>
<p>SpaceX&#8217;s Commercial Crew program with NASA continues to be the key success story in the agency&#8217;s move to partner with more private companies for its research and space exploration missions. NASA also recently tapped <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/16/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-to-develop-human-landing-system-for-returning-to-the-moon/">SpaceX to develop the human landing system for its Artemis program</a>, which will return humans to the Moon for the first time since the Apollo program, and which will use SpaceX&#8217;s Starship spacecraft. For SpaceX&#8217;s human spaceflight program, the next big milestone will be its first flight of a mission made up entirely of paying private citizens, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/last-two-crewmembers-named-for-spacexs-first-all-civilian-human-spaceflight-mission/">which is currently set to take place this fall</a>.</p>

<p>SpaceX is set to launch its second operational commercial crew mission to the International Space Station for NASA, with a liftoff time of 5:49 AM EDT (2:49 AM PDT) on Friday morning. The flight will carry four astronauts, including two from NASA, one from JAXA (the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) and one from the ESA (European Space Agency), to the station, where they will begin a regular tour of duty conducting science experiments, and maintaining and upgrading the orbital platform.</p>
<p>This is the second commercial crew mission for SpaceX, which officially <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/02/spacex-and-nasa-successfully-return-crew-dragon-spacecraft-to-earth-with-astronauts-on-board/">qualified its Dragon spacecraft and Falcon 9 rocket for human flight last year</a>. NASA then launched four astronauts using <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/15/spacex-and-nasa-successfully-launch-four-astronauts-to-space-for-first-operational-dragon-crew-mission/">SpaceX&#8217;s human-certified launch system later that year in November</a>, becoming the first private company to deliver people to the ISS, and the first American vehicle to do so since the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011. Since the end of that program, NASA has relied on buying rides aboard Russian Soyuz rockets to keep up its representation on the ISS.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There&#8217;s already a SpaceX Crew Dragon at the Space Station from that Crew-1 launch last year, and it was relocated to another port on the station earlier this month in preparation for the arrival of the one flying for Crew-2. The Crew-1 Dragon capsule is set to return back to Earth with astronauts on board once they&#8217;re relieved by this flight&#8217;s crew, likely later this month on April 28.</p>

<p>One major notable change for this launch is the use of a flight-proven Falcon 9 rocket booster. SpaceX has previously used new boosters fresh from the factory for its human launches, though it has a spotless track record when it comes to booster re-use for its cargo flights. It&#8217;s also the first re-use of a dragon spacecraft, and both components of this launch system actually previously supported human launches, with the first stage serving during Crew-1, and the Dragon capsule providing the ride for Demo-2, which flew astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley.</p>
<p>The astronauts on today&#8217;s flight are Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur from NASA, as well as Akihiko Hoshide from JAXA and Thomas Pesquet from the ESA. As mentioned, liftoff time is set for 5:49 AM EDT, but SpaceX will begin streaming live hours in advance at approximately 1:30 AM EDT on Friday (10:30 PM PDT on Thursday).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Move over Citi Bike, there’s a new docked, shared bike service in town — only this one is all electric. Next week, JOCO will be the first shared operator in New York City to launch a network of e-bike stations on private property for public use.</p>
<p>The service, powered by shared mobility platform Vulog, will start with 30 stations and 300 e-bikes located around Manhattan, expanding to 100 stations and 1,000 bikes by June. This is not the first new shared operator to hit the streets of New York this year. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/bird-lime-and-veoride-selected-for-nyc-e-scooter-pilot/">Last week, the city announced the winning companies of the e-scooter pilot in the Bronx</a>. But while Bird, Lime and Veo are restricted to operating in a section of the Bronx, far from any Citi Bike territory, JOCO is under no such constraints.</p>
<p>The company’s bikes will initially be stationed at parking garages around the city, including at Icon Parking garages, the city’s largest parking operators, but the company says it hopes to expand to residential and commercial buildings in the near future. The company essentially pays landlords to provide this amenity, while absolving them from having to operate or maintain the e-bikes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“What differentiates us from Citi Bike is, first of all, our bikes are 100% electric, 100% premium,” co-founder Jonathan “Johnny” Cohen from New York told TechCrunch. (The two co-founders are both named Johnathan Cohen &#8212; one is from New York, the other from London. JOCO&#8230;get it?). “You can reserve our bikes in advance, and as we’re on private property, there are hand sanitizer at our stations, the bikes aren’t getting rained on every night, they’re a bit cleaner and easier to access.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2142696" style="width: 503px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Frame-1-1-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2142696" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2142696" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Frame-1-1-1.png?w=493" alt="A map of JOCO's launch e-bike dock locations" width="493" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Frame-1-1-1.png 852w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Frame-1-1-1.png?resize=109,150 109w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Frame-1-1-1.png?resize=218,300 218w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Frame-1-1-1.png?resize=768,1059 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Frame-1-1-1.png?resize=493,680 493w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Frame-1-1-1.png?resize=36,50 36w" sizes="(max-width: 493px) 100vw, 493px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2142696" class="wp-caption-text">A map of JOCO&#8217;s 30 launch e-bike dock locations in NYC.</p></div></p>
<p>Citi Bike’s fleet is about 30% electric. To charge the e-bikes, the Lyft-owned company must manually take the drained vehicles from their stations to charge them, whereas JOCO’s vehicles are charged at the stations. Like Citi Bike, each e-bike can last for about 30 miles on a charge.</p>
<p>“That’s enough to get around Manhattan several times,” said London Jo (another moniker for differentiating between the two John/Jon Cohens). “We expect our vehicles to always be charged and ready to go for the customer. It defeats the purpose when you’re taking a bike that’s extremely sustainable, and then come along in a gas-burning vehicle to swap the battery. We’re looking to be a truly environmentally friendly company and provide a more consistent and reliable service.”</p>
<p>Founded in 2019 and funded privately by a group of former CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, and specifically investors with technology and real estate backgrounds, JOCO offers e-bikes at a price point that’s comparable, if not directly competitive, to Citi Bike. It’ll cost riders $1 to unlock the bike and .25 cents a minute, so a 10 minute ride will come out to $3.50. If you can find an electric Citi Bike, it’ll cost a rider $3.50 to unlock and .18 cents a minute, which comes out to about $5.30.</p>
<p>“That’s significantly cheaper in our opinion for a brand new, gorgeous, full electric premium bike,” said NY Jo.</p>
<p>Neither company charges unlock fees for members. JOCO’s monthly membership is $49 per month with unlimited use, and Citi Bike’s is $20 per month, with monthly members continuing to pay 18 cents per minute, and annual members paying 12 cents per minute. Under Citi Bike’s annual membership, if a rider is averaging out about five 10-minute rides per week, the monthly spend is comparable between the two companies.</p>
<p>“Citi Bike has been around since 2013 and has done a tremendous job at driving cycling adoption on the streets of NYC,” Monica Wejman, Vulog’s North America managing director, told TechCrunch. “And now you have JOCO entering this space, powered by Vulog, really there to complement Citi Bike and satisfy what we’re seeing as a significant increase in demand for access to e-bikes. We’re truly empowering mobility operators to launch mobility programs at scale.”</p>
<p>While JOCO will not be reliant on the NYC Department of Transportation to carve out street and sidewalk space for docking stations, the operator is still taking steps to ensure a good working relationship with the city.</p>
<p>London Jo says JOCO’s bikes are made with safety-critical features, like hidden cables to make them less susceptible to vandalism, puncture-proof airless tires and bike-tracking, provided by Vulog’s backend.</p>
<p>“In addition, by operating in private spaces, we’re eliminating that problem of sidewalk clutter for the city,” said the British Cohen. “And they don’t have to worry about what has to go to fit 50 new bikes on the street. We’re taking a big headache off them, and it’s allowing us to stay in control a little bit more and not have to depend on the city.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While the concept of &#8220;deepfakes,&#8221; or AI-generated synthetic imagery, has been decried primarily in connection with involuntary depictions of people, the technology is dangerous (and interesting) in other ways as well. For instance, researchers have shown that it can be used to manipulate satellite imagery to produce real-looking — but totally fake — overhead maps of cities.</p>
<p>The study, <a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2021/04/21/a-growing-problem-of-deepfake-geography-how-ai-falsifies-satellite-images/">led by Bo Zhao from the University of Washington</a>, is not intended to alarm anyone but rather to show the risks and opportunities involved in applying this rather infamous technology to cartography. In fact their approach has as much in common with &#8220;style transfer&#8221; techniques — redrawing images in an impressionistic, crayon and arbitrary other fashions — than with deepfakes as they are commonly understood.</p>
<p>The team trained a machine learning system on satellite images of three different cities: Seattle, nearby Tacoma and Beijing. Each has its own distinctive look, just as a painter or medium does. For instance, Seattle tends to have larger overhanging greenery and narrower streets, while Beijing is more monochrome and — in the images used for the study — the taller buildings cast long, dark shadows. The system learned to associate details of a street map (like Google or Apple&#8217;s) with those of the satellite view.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The resulting machine learning agent, when given a street map, returns a realistic-looking faux satellite image of what that area would look like if it were in any of those cities. In the following image, the map corresponds to the top right satellite image of Tacoma, while the lower versions show how it might look in Seattle and Beijing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2142604" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zhao-deepfake-geography-fig-4.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2142604" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2142604" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zhao-deepfake-geography-fig-4.png" alt="Four images show a street map and a real satellite image of Tacoma, and two simulated satellite images of the same streets in Seattle and Beijing." width="1024" height="1082" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zhao-deepfake-geography-fig-4.png 1226w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zhao-deepfake-geography-fig-4.png?resize=142,150 142w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zhao-deepfake-geography-fig-4.png?resize=284,300 284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zhao-deepfake-geography-fig-4.png?resize=768,811 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zhao-deepfake-geography-fig-4.png?resize=644,680 644w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zhao-deepfake-geography-fig-4.png?resize=47,50 47w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2142604" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zhao et al.</p></div></p>
<p>A close inspection will show that the fake maps aren&#8217;t as sharp as the real one, and there are probably some logical inconsistencies like streets that go nowhere and the like. But at a glance the Seattle and Beijing images are perfectly plausible.</p>
<p>One only has to think for a few minutes to conceive of uses for fake maps like this, both legitimate and otherwise. The researchers suggest that the technique could be used to simulate imagery of places for which no satellite imagery is available — like one of these cities in the days before such things were possible, or for a planned expansion or zoning change. The system doesn&#8217;t have to imitate another place altogether — it could be trained on a more densely populated part of the same city, or one with wider streets.</p>
<p>It could conceivably even be used, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/artificial-intelligence/machine-learning/ai-ancient-maps-satellite-images">as this rather more whimsical project was</a>, to make realistic-looking modern maps from ancient hand-drawn ones.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Deep Science: Alzheimer&#8217;s screening, forest-mapping drones, machine learning in space, more&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/23/deep-science-alzheimers-screening-forest-mapping-drones-machine-learning-in-space-more/embed/#?secret=GZXJia1KHP" data-secret="GZXJia1KHP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Should technology like this be bent to less constructive purposes, the paper also looks at ways to detect such simulated imagery using careful examination of colors and features.</p>
<p>The work challenges the general assumption of the &#8220;absolute reliability of satellite images or other geospatial data,&#8221; said Zhao in a UW news article, and certainly as with other media that kind thinking has to go by the wayside as new threats appear. You can read the full paper at the journal <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15230406.2021.1910075?journalCode=tcag20">Cartography and Geographic Information Science</a>.</p>

<p>For founders who self-funded (bootstrapped) their startup, a boardroom full of additional factors come into play. Some are the same as for investor-funded firms, but many are unique.</p>

<p>After 18 years of bootstrapping a BI software firm into a business that now serves 28,000 companies and three million users in 75 countries, here’s what I’ve learned about myself, my company, about entrepreneurship and about when to grab for that brass ring.</p>
<h2>Profitable or bust</h2>
<p>Starting a software company 7,900 miles southwest of Silicon Valley requires some forethought and not a small amount of crazy. When we opened, it didn’t occur to us that one could have an idea and then go knock on someone’s door and ask for money.</p>
<p>Bootstrapping forced us to be a bit more creative about how we would go about building our company. In the early days, it was a distraction to growth, because we were doing other revenue-generating activities like consulting, development work, whatever we could find to keep ourselves afloat while we built Yellowfin. It meant we couldn’t be 100% focused on our idea.</p>
<p>However, it also meant we had to generate income from our new company from Day One — something funded companies don’t have to do. We never got into the mindset that it was okay to burn lots of cash and then cross our fingers and hope that it worked.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to building a successful startup, biotech and hardware happen to be two of the most difficult verticals in the tech industry. But Oura is doing it anyway.</p>
<p>The health and fitness tracking ring has been used in a number of studies around COVID-19 and been worn by NBA and WNBA players to help prevent outbreaks in the league. Oura has raised nearly $50 million from investors including Lifeline Ventures, Bold Capital Partners and Forerunner.</p>
<p>So it should come as no surprise that we&#8217;re thrilled to have Forerunner&#8217;s Eurie Kim and Oura CEO Harpreet Rai join us on a forthcoming episode of <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-forerunner-and-oura">Extra Crunch Live</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Kim is herself a former entrepreneur and joined Forerunner in 2012. She sits on the boards of companies like The Farmer’s Dog, Curology, Attabotics, Oura Ring, Eclipse, Juni, among others, and found herself on the Midas Brink List in 2020.</p>
<p>Rai, for his part, is CEO at Oura, where he leads a team of over 150 employees. Before Oura, Rai was a portfolio manager at Eminence Capital for nine years.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-forerunner-and-oura">Extra Crunch Live</a>, the duo will talk about how Oura went about raising its $28 million Series B round and why Kim took a bet on the startup. We&#8217;ll also ask about tactical advice for founders looking to fundraise and grow their businesses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple was questioned on its inability to rein in subscription scammers on its App Store during yesterday&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/senate-antitrust-hearing-apple-tile-spotify-match-epic/">Senate antitrust hearing</a>. The tech giant has argued that one of the reasons it requires developers to pay App Store commissions is to help Apple fight marketplace fraud and protect consumers. But developers claim Apple is doing very little to stop obvious scams that are now raking in millions and impacting consumer trust in the overall subscription economy, as well as in their own legitimate, subscription-based businesses.</p>
<p>One developer in particular, Kosta Eleftheriou, has made it his mission to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou">highlight some of the most egregious scams</a> on the App Store. Functioning as a one-man bunco squad, Eleftheriou regularly tweets out examples of apps that are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/apple-urged-to-root-out-rating-scams-as-developer-highlights-ugly-cost-of-enforcement-failure/">leveraging fake reviews to promote their harmful businesses</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the more notable scams he&#8217;s uncovered as of late include a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/30/trezor-scam-bitcoin-1-million/">crypto wallet app that scammed</a> a user out of his life savings (~$600,000) in bitcoin; a kids game that actually <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/15/app-store-scam-is-a-kids-game-with-a-hidden-online-casino/">contained a hidden online casino</a>; and a VPN app <a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/another-ios-vpn-app-scam-is-uncovered_id131487">scamming users out of $5 million</a> per year. And, of course, there&#8217;s the scam that lit the fire in the first place: A competitor to Eleftheriou&#8217;s own Apple Watch app that he alleges <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356011069395755009">scammed users out of $2 million per year,</a> after stealing his marketing materials, cloning his app and buying fake reviews to make the scammer&#8217;s look like the better choice.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Eleftheriou&#8217;s tweets have caught the attention of the larger app developer community, who now email him other examples of scams they&#8217;ve uncovered. Eleftheriou more recently took his crusade a step further by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/fleksy-co-founder-is-suing-apple-over-lost-revenue-resulting-from-app-store-scammers/">filing a lawsuit against Apple</a> over the revenue he&#8217;s lost to App Store scammers.</p>
<p>Though Eleftheriou wasn&#8217;t name-checked in yesterday&#8217;s antitrust hearing, his work certainly was.</p>
<p>In a line of questioning from Georgia&#8217;s Senator Jon Ossoff, Apple&#8217;s Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer was asked why Apple was not able to locate scams, given that these fraudulent apps are, as Ossoff put it, &#8220;trivially easy to identify as scams.&#8221;</p>
<p>He asked why do we have rely upon &#8220;open-source reporting and journalists&#8221; to find the app scams &#8212; a reference that likely, at least in part, referred to Eleftheriou&#8217;s recent activities.</p>
<p>Eleftheriou himself <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou">has said</a> there&#8217;s not much to his efforts. You simply find the apps generating most revenues and then check them for suspicious user reviews and high subscription prices. When you find both, you&#8217;ve probably uncovered a scam.</p>
<p>Andeer demurred, responding to Ossoff&#8217;s questions by saying that Apple has invested &#8220;tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars&#8221; in hardening and improving the security of its App Store.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, security and fraud is a cat-and-mouse game. Any retailer will tell you that. And so we&#8217;re constantly working to improve,&#8221; Andeer said. He also claimed Apple was investing in more resources and technologies to catch wrong-doers and noted that the App Store rejected thousands of apps every year for posing a risk to consumers.</p>
<p>The exec then warned that if Apple wasn&#8217;t the intermediary, the problem would be even worse.</p>
<p>&#8221; … No one is perfect, but I think what we&#8217;ve shown over and over again that we do a better job than others. I think the real risks of opening up the iPhone to sideloading or third-party app stores is that this problem will only multiply. If we look at other app stores out there, we look at other distribution platforms, it scares us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ossoff pressed on, noting the sideloading questions could wait and inquired again about the scam apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple is making a cut on those abusive billing practices, are you not?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Andeer said he didn&#8217;t believe that was the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we find fraud &#8212; if we find a problem, we&#8217;re able to rectify that very quickly. And we do each and every day,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>But to what extent Apple was profiting from the App Store scams was less clear. Ossoff wanted to know if Apple refunded &#8220;all&#8221; of its revenues derived from the scam billing practices &#8212; in other words, if every customer who ever subscribed got their money back when a scam was identified.</p>
<p>Andeer&#8217;s answer was a little vague, however, as it could be interpreted to mean Apple refunds customers who report the scam or file a complaint &#8212; procedures it already has in place today. Instead of saying that Apple refunds &#8220;all customers&#8221; when scams are identified, he carefully worded his response to say Apple worked to make sure &#8220;the customer&#8221; is made whole.</p>
<p>&#8220;Senator, that&#8217;s my understanding. There&#8217;s obviously a dedicated team here at Apple who works this each and every day. But my understanding is that we work hard to make sure the customer is in a whole position. That&#8217;s our focus at the end of the day. If we lose the trust of our customers, that&#8217;s going to hurt us,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, Eleftheriou wasn&#8217;t buying it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple&#8217;s non-answers to Senator Ossoff&#8217;s great questions in yesterday&#8217;s hearing should anger all of us. They did not offer any explanation for why it&#8217;s so easy for people like me to keep finding multimillion-dollar scams that have been going on unchecked on the App Store for years. They also gave no clear answer to whether they&#8217;re responsible for fraudulent activity in their store,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Apple appears to profit from these scams, instead of refunding all associated revenues back to affected users when they belatedly take some of these down. We’ve been letting Apple grade their own homework for over a decade. I urge the committee to get to the bottom of these questions, including Apple&#8217;s baffling decision years ago to remove the ability for users to flag suspicious apps on the App Store,&#8221; Eleftheriou added.</p>
<p>Apple did not provide a comment.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">When the world flipped upside down last year, nearly every company in every industry was forced to implement a remote workforce in just a matter of days — they had to scramble to ensure employees had the right tools in place and customers felt little to no impact. While companies initially adopted solutions for employee safety, rapid response and short-term air cover, they are now shifting their focus to long-term, strategic investments that empower growth and streamline operations.</p>
<p>As a result, categories that make up productivity infrastructure — cloud communications services, API platforms, low-code development tools, business process automation and AI software development kits — grew exponentially in 2020. This growth was boosted by an increasing number of companies prioritizing tools that support communication, collaboration, transparency and a seamless end-to-end workflow.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Productivity infrastructure is on the rise and will continue to be front and center as companies evaluate what their future of work entails and how to maintain productivity, rapid software development and innovation with distributed teams.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>According to<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever"> McKinsey &amp; Company,</a> the pandemic accelerated the share of digitally enabled products by <em>seven years, </em>and “the digitization of customer and supply-chain interactions and of internal operations by three to four years.” As demand continues to grow, companies are taking advantage of the benefits productivity infrastructure brings to their organization both internally and externally, especially as many determine the future of their work.</p>
<h2>Automate workflows and mitigate risk</h2>
<p>Developers rely on platforms throughout the software development process to connect data, process it, increase their go-to-market velocity and stay ahead of the competition with new and existing products. They have enormous amounts of end-user data on hand, and productivity infrastructure can remove barriers to access, integrate and leverage this data to automate the workflow.</p>
<p>Access to rich interaction data combined with pre-trained ML models, automated workflows and configurable front-end components enables developers to drastically shorten development cycles. Through enhanced data protection and compliance, productivity infrastructure safeguards critical data and mitigates risk while reducing time to ROI.</p>
<p>As the post-pandemic workplace begins to take shape, how can productivity infrastructure support enterprises where they are now and where they need to go next?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Xuezhao Lan first formed <a href="https://www.basisset.ventures/">Basis Set Ventures</a>, the goal was to leverage technology to give venture capital investing super powers.</p>
<p>From the earliest days, when Lan hired former TechCrunch reporter John Mannes, and then built out the team with the data scientist Rachel Wong, former Upfront Ventures partner Chang Xu and former Opendoor vice president of growth Sheila Vashee, the focus was as much on technology products as it was on dollar investments and advisory services.</p>
<p>Together with Niniane Wang, a former advisor who now serves as the firm&#8217;s chief technology officer, Basis Set grounded its decisions in the technical bona fides of Lan&#8217;s firm. And product development isn&#8217;t something to which the firm simply pays lip service. Basis Set ships about three different updates to a massive suite of internal and external products every week, according to the partnership.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That product development is one reason the firm has managed to stay relatively lean and why it was two times oversubscribed when it went out to raise its second fund, a $165 million vehicle, which closed recently.</p>
<p>The fund isn&#8217;t that much larger than the $136 million Basis Set had previously raised, but Lan thinks it&#8217;s the right size for her goals, which are to return massive amounts of capital to her limited partners.</p>
<p>Internal technology programs like the company&#8217;s Pascal system have allowed Basis Set to review roughly 9,000 different software deals developing tech in the company&#8217;s core thesis, which is artificial intelligence-enabled software as a service and business-to-business deals.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1773691" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1773691" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1773691" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-950523108.jpg" alt="Robotic arm carrying a mechanical part" width="1024" height="672" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-950523108.jpg 1936w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-950523108.jpg?resize=150,98 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-950523108.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-950523108.jpg?resize=768,504 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-950523108.jpg?resize=680,446 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-950523108.jpg?resize=1536,1008 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GettyImages-950523108.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1773691" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>Over the next year, those technology services are going to start paying dividends, according to Lan, in the form of a couple of initial public offerings that will soon make their way to market.</p>
<p>And Basis Set doesn&#8217;t limit itself geographically, thanks to the coverage support that its software provides. &#8220;Pascal is a major asset for finding companies outside of the Bay Area,&#8221; said Lan.</p>
<p>Once those companies are identified and in the portfolio, the startups have access to a tool called <a href="https://www.basisset.ventures/hypergrowth-network">HyperGrowth</a>, which links tech companies with mentors from the Bay Area to help those companies scale. It&#8217;s another example of Basis Set&#8217;s product-driven approach, said Lan.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I started BSV, we were a pretty technical team and technical people. Every single person came back to us to ask how to grow, how to do sales, how to do tech, how to make the first hires, introductions to customers, introductions to advisors. The number one need for companies is go to market,&#8221; said Lan. &#8220;Over time we started scaling that effort. Introductions manually, and then holding events, and then bringing in a growth partner, Sheila. We built this tool where hundreds of advisors would opt in to be connected to a portfolio company.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Currently Basis Set has at least three different programs, all aimed to recruit and nurture talent that typical Bay Area firms haven&#8217;t traditionally focused on. The first is its <a href="https://www.basisset.ventures/persistence">Persistence</a> platform, which is designed to help women developers and founders network and nurture connections and foster ideas. The firm also has a service that it calls <a href="https://www.basisset.ventures/founder-superpowers">Founder Superpowers</a>, to help entrepreneurs identify and develop areas of strength while looking for additional tools to augment their capabilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We had a data science team very early and we already started automating a bunch of things. These are the ones that made it to the end of the finish line. Because of the way we operate we are constantly iterating,&#8221; said Lan. </span></p>
<p>Another key factor for the company is trying to find a more diverse set of founders with different background from the typical Silicon Valley biography, Mannes said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We talk a lot about how to find founders outside of the Bay Area… the entrepreneurs who aren’t hanging out at Blue Bottle 24-7,&#8221; said Mannes.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the increase of digital transacting over the past year, cybercriminals have been having a field day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, complaints of suspected internet crime surged by 61%, to 791,790, according to the FBI’s </span><a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2020_IC3Report.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 Internet Crime Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those crimes &#8212; ranging from personal and corporate data breaches to credit card fraud, phishing and identity theft &#8212; cost victims more than $4.2 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For companies like Sift &#8212; which aims to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">predict and prevent fraud online even more quickly than cybercriminals adopt new tactics &#8212; that increase in crime also led to an increase in business.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the San Francisco-based company assessed risk on more than $250 billion in transactions, double from what it did in 2019. The company has over several hundred customers, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter, Airbnb, Twilio, DoorDash, Wayfair and McDonald’s, as well a global data network of 70 billion events per month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To meet the surge in demand, Sift said today it has raised $50 million in a funding round that values the company at over $1 billion. Insight Partners led the financing, which included participation from Union Square Ventures and Stripes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the company would not reveal hard revenue figures, President and CEO Marc Olesen said that business has tripled since he joined the company in June 2018. Sift was founded out of Y Combinator in 2011, and has raised a total of $157 million over its lifetime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&#8217;s “Digital Trust &amp; Safety” platform aims to help merchants not only fight all types of internet fraud and abuse, but to also “reduce friction” for legitimate customers. There’s a fine line apparently between looking out for a merchant and upsetting a customer who is legitimately trying to conduct a transaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sift uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to automatically surmise whether an attempted transaction or interaction with a business online is authentic or potentially problematic.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2142332" style="width: 664px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2142332" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2142332" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Content-Integrity.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="654" height="373" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Content-Integrity.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Content-Integrity.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Content-Integrity.jpg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Content-Integrity.jpg?resize=768,438 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Content-Integrity.jpg?resize=680,388 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Content-Integrity.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2142332" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: Sift</strong></p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things the company has discovered is that fraudsters are often not working alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fraud vectors are no longer siloed. They are highly innovative and often working in concert,” Olesen said. “We’ve uncovered a number of fraud rings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olesen shared a couple of examples of how the company thwarted fraud incidents last year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One recently involved money laundering through donation sites where fraudsters tested stolen debit and credit cards through fake donation sites at guest checkout.</span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;12 top cybersecurity VCs discuss investing, valuations and no-go zones&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/02/cybersecurity-vc-survey-investing-valuations/embed/#?secret=yU8h6Bdxrw" data-secret="yU8h6Bdxrw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“By making small donations to themselves, they laundered that money and at the same tested the validity of the stolen cards so they could use it on another site with significantly higher purchases,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another case, the company uncovered fraudsters using </span><a href="https://blog.sift.com/2021/telegram-fraud-scheme/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telegram</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a social media site, to make services available, such as food delivery, with stolen credentials.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data that Sift has accumulated since its inception helps the company “act as the central nervous system for fraud teams.” Sift says that its models become more intelligent with every customer that it integrates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insight Partners Managing Director Jeff Lieberman, who is a Sift board member, said his firm initially invested in Sift in 2016 because even at that time, it was clear that online fraud was “rapidly growing.” It was growing not just in dollar amounts, he said, but in the number of methods cybercriminals used to steal from consumers and businesses.</span></p>
<p><b>“</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sift has a novel approach to fighting fraud that combines massive data sets with machine learning, and it has a track record of proving its value for hundreds of online businesses,” he wrote via email.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Olesen and the Sift team started the recent process of fundraising, Insight actually approached them before they started talking to outside investors “because both the product and business fundamentals are so strong, and the growth opportunity is massive,” Lieberman added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With more businesses heavily investing in online channels, nearly every one of them needs a solution that can intelligently weed out fraud while ensuring a seamless experience for the 99% of transactions or actions that are legitimate,” he wrote. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital primarily to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">expand its product portfolio and to scale its product, engineering and sales teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sift also recently tapped Eu-Gene Sung &#8212; who has worked in financial leadership roles at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Integral Ad Science, BSE Global and McCann &#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to serve as its CFO.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As to whether or not that meant an IPO is in Sift’s future, Olesen said that Sung’s experience of taking companies through a growth phase such as what Sift is experiencing would be valuable. The company is also for the first time looking to potentially do some M&amp;A.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When we think about expanding our portfolio, it’s really a buy/build partner approach,” Olesen said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://fi.google.com/">Google Fi</a>, Google&#8217;s cell network, is turning six today and to celebrate, the team is launching a new pricing plan, dubbed &#8220;Simply Unlimited&#8221; starting at $60 per month for a single line (down to $30 per line for three lines or more). The new plan features unlimited calls and texts in the U.S., plus unlimited data and texting in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2142425" style="width: 355px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-093358.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2142425" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2142425" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-093358.png?w=455" alt="" width="345" height="377" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-093358.png 455w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-093358.png?resize=137,150 137w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-093358.png?resize=275,300 275w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Screenshot-2021-04-22-093358.png?resize=46,50 46w" sizes="(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2142425" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>You may recall that Fi&#8217;s original promise was a single, affordable pay-as-you-go plan where you would pay a fixed price per month for the basic call and texting service and then pay an extra $10 per GB of data you used per billing cycle, capped at $80 per month. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/17/google-fi-gets-an-unlimited-plan/">In 2019</a>, Google then turned this into what is essentially an unlimited plan, dubbed Fi Unlimited, starting at $70 per month for a single line, with discounts for additional lines.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new &#8220;Simply Unlimited&#8221; plan is a pared-down version of the original Unlimited plan, which is now called the Unlimited Plus plan (yeah, that&#8217;s a lot of names). Now, that plan has still a lot of extra features that power users aren&#8217;t likely willing to give up for a slightly lower price. In addition to everything in the new Simply Unlimited plan, this plan still features free international calls to more than 50 countries and international data in more than 200 destinations, plus full-speed hotspot tethering and 100 GB of Google One cloud storage.</p>
<p>The Flexible plan is also still an option, with its base fee of $20 per month for texting and calling for a single line (down to $17 per month for three lines) and $10 per GB of data, no matter whether you use if abroad or at home &#8212; or for hotspot tethering. Google says that&#8217;s the plan to choose if you&#8217;re mostly on WiFi &#8212; as most of us are right now.</p>
<p>Basically, if you&#8217;re not planning to use your phone outside of North America, the new Simply Unlimited plan looks like a good deal that, depending on your use case, compares favorably with similarly priced plans from other carriers &#8212; especially if international data is important to you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A university student is suing exam proctoring software maker Proctorio to &#8220;quash a campaign of harassment&#8221; against critics of the company, including an accusation that the company misused copyright laws to remove his tweets that were critical of the software.</p>
<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-sues-proctorio-behalf-student-it-falsely-accused-copyright-infringement-get">filed the lawsuit</a> this week on behalf of Miami University student Erik Johnson, who also does security research on the side, accused Proctorio of having &#8220;exploited the DMCA to undermine Johnson’s commentary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Twitter hid three of Johnson&#8217;s tweets after Proctorio filed a copyright takedown notice under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or DMCA, alleging that <a href="https://twitter.com/ejohnson99/status/1303121786637373443">three of Johnson&#8217;s tweets</a> violated the company&#8217;s copyright.</p>
<p>Schools and universities have increasingly leaned on proctoring software during the pandemic to invigilate student exams, albeit virtually. Students must install the school&#8217;s choice of proctoring software to grant access to the student&#8217;s microphone and webcam to spot potential cheating. But students of color have complained that the software <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5gxg3/proctorio-is-using-racist-algorithms-to-detect-faces">fails to recognize</a> nonwhite faces and that the software also requires high-speed internet access, which many low-income houses don&#8217;t have. If a student fails these checks, the student can end up failing the exam.</p>
<p>Despite this, Vice <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3an98j/students-are-easily-cheating-state-of-the-art-test-proctoring-tech">reported</a> last month that some students are easily cheating on exams that are monitored by Proctorio. Several schools have banned or discontinued using Proctorio and other proctoring software, citing privacy concerns.</p>
<p>Proctorio&#8217;s monitoring software is a Chrome extension, which unlike most desktop software can be easily downloaded and the source code examined for bugs and flaws. Johnson examined the code and tweeted what he found — including under what circumstances a student&#8217;s test would be terminated if the software detected signs of potential cheating, and how the software monitors for suspicious eye movements and abnormal mouse clicking.</p>
<p>Johnson&#8217;s tweets also contained links to snippets of the Chrome extension&#8217;s source code on Pastebin.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Proctorio used DMCA to take down a student&#8217;s critical tweets&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/proctorio-dmca-copyright-critical-tweets/embed/#?secret=cjlC62YuIC" data-secret="cjlC62YuIC" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Proctorio claimed at the time, via its crisis communications firm Edelman, that Johnson violated the company&#8217;s rights &#8220;by copying and posting extracts from Proctorio’s software code on his Twitter account.&#8221; But Twitter <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/proctorio-dmca-copyright-critical-tweets/">reinstated Johnson&#8217;s tweets</a> after finding Proctorio&#8217;s takedown notice &#8220;incomplete.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Software companies don’t get to abuse copyright law to undermine their critics,&#8221; said Cara Gagliano, a staff attorney at the EFF. &#8220;Using pieces [of] code to explain your research or support critical commentary is no different from quoting a book in a book review.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/johnson-v-proctorio-complaint">complaint</a> argues that Proctorio&#8217;s &#8220;pattern of baseless DMCA notices&#8221; had a chilling effect on Johnson&#8217;s security research work, amid fears that &#8220;reporting on his findings will elicit more harassment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Copyright holders should be held liable when they falsely accuse their critics of copyright infringement, especially when the goal is plainly to intimidate and undermine them,&#8221; said Gagliano. &#8220;We’re asking the court for a declaratory judgment that there is no infringement to prevent further legal threats and takedown attempts against Johnson for using code excerpts and screenshots to support his comments.&#8221;</p>
<p>The EFF alleges that this is part of a wider pattern that Proctorio uses to respond to criticism. Last year Olsen posted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UBC/comments/hhbowl/proctorio_ceo_mike_olsen_under_fire_for_releasing/">a student&#8217;s private chat logs</a> on Reddit without their permission. Olsen later set his Twitter account to private following the incident. Proctorio is also suing Ian Linkletter, a learning technology specialist at the University of British Columbia, after posting tweets critical of the company’s proctoring software.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is filed in Arizona, where Proctorio is headquartered. Proctorio CEO Mike Olson did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
