										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Andium, a company focused on remote field monitoring of assets including oil and gas wells has just raised some not-insignificant cash in an investment round led by <a href="https://www.ogci.com/climate-investments/">OGCI Climate Investments</a>, a firm formed by the largest oil companies in the world.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">Launched in 2014 to &#8220;support&#8221; the targets laid out in the Paris Agreement to limit global greenhouse gas emissions, OGCI has invested in 21 projects to date.</p>
<p>With Andium, the oil majors join existing investors including Tom Miglis, the former chief investment officer of Citadel Securities and Talis Capital in backing a company developing technologies for natural gas flare monitoring, tank telemetry and object detection.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The company said it provides oil and gas companies with real-time information from remote locations at a far lower cost than other solutions.</p>
<p>Few technologies are less exciting than sensors and monitoring equipment, but there are also few tech services that are more vital to staunching the flow of greenhouse gas emissions. As Mark Tomasovic, a partner at the renewable investment firm, Energize tweeted (to me), &#8220;A few companies are involved in monitoring and reducing methane emissions from producing oil and gas wells&#8230; Given that there are over [1 million] wells in the U.S. and methane is 28x more potent than CO2, these startups have had more of an impact on global climate change then Tesla.&#8221;</p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">A few companies are involved in monitoring and reducing methane emissions from producing oil &amp; gas wells</p>
<p>Given that there are over 1M wells in the U.S. and methane is 28x more potent than CO2, these startups have had more of an impact on global climate change than Tesla</p>
<p>&mdash; Mark Tomasovic (@MarkTomasovic) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkTomasovic/status/1379476179162370048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 6, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that visibility is paramount in change leadership and operational excellence, and our remote monitoring technologies are specifically designed to offer companies an expedited path to achieve their sustainability goals,” said Jory Schwach, the chief executive of Andium, in a statement.</p>
<p>Schwach, a serial entrepreneur whose previous forays into the business world included GlobalRim, a solar global positioning system company, and an offline communications service, started out developing a battery-powered tracking system for the logistics industry.</p>
<p id="b3f8" class="io ip dr iq b ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb jc jd je jf jg jh ji jj jk ig dj eo" data-selectable-paragraph="">&#8220;I spent the better part of two years building a battery-powered tracking solution for long haul trailers so the market could replace brokers with ‘shared assets’. I failed fast and often on the hardware and realized that the real value was in the continually changing product requests that would be much more easily solved with a software change,&#8221; Schwach <a href="https://medium.com/authority-magazine/meet-the-disruptors-jory-schwach-of-andium-on-the-three-things-you-need-to-shake-up-your-industry-a8f44435a183">told the Medium publication Authority Magazine</a>. &#8220;I decided that building a new kind of operating system for small devices could be big business if I leveraged the OS to customize products based on changing use cases while managing the hardware and infrastructure on behalf of the client.&#8221;</p>
<p data-selectable-paragraph="">Andium&#8217;s technology uses off the shelf cameras and microphones with an artificial intelligence overlay to provide real-time monitoring of all sorts of industrial assets.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“The transparency created by monitoring and measuring methane is essential to reducing emissions,” said Pratima Rangarajan, CEO of OGCI Climate Investments.  “Andium’s low-cost innovative solution lowers the barrier for operators of all sizes to adopt and implement best practices and we are pleased to support their growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At first glance, <a href="https://quiq.com">Quiq</a> and <a href="https://www.snaps.io">Snaps</a> might sound like similar startups — they both help businesses talk to their customers via text messaging and other messaging apps. But Snaps CEO Christian Brucculeri said &#8220;there&#8217;s almost no overlap in what we do&#8221; and that the companies are &#8220;almost complete complements.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Quiq (based in Bozeman, Montana) is acquiring Snaps (based in New York). The entire Snaps team is joining Quiq, with Brucculeri becoming senior vice president of sales and customer success for the combined organization.</p>
<p>Quiq CEO Mike Myer echoed Bruccleri&#8217;s point, comparing the situation to dumping two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle on the floor and discovering &#8220;the two pieces fit perfectly.&#8221; More specifically, he told me that Quiq has generally focused on customer service messaging, with a &#8220;do it yourself, toolset approach.&#8221; After all, the company was founded by two technical co-founders, and Myer joked, &#8220;We can&#8217;t understand why [a customer] can&#8217;t just call an API.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Snaps, meanwhile, has focused more on marketing conversations, and on a managed service approach where it handles all of the technical work for its customers. In addition, Myer said that while Quiq has &#8220;really focused on platform aspect from beginning&#8221; — building integrations with more than a dozen messaging channels including Apple Business Chat, Google’s Business Messages, Instagram, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp — it doesn&#8217;t have &#8220;a deep natural language or conversational AI capability&#8221; the way Snaps does.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="yeHoF4sNqg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/19/snaps-series-a/">Snaps raises $6M to expand its marketing platform for messaging apps</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Snaps raises $6M to expand its marketing platform for messaging apps&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/19/snaps-series-a/embed/#?secret=yeHoF4sNqg" data-secret="yeHoF4sNqg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Myer added that demand for Quiq&#8217;s offering has been growing dramatically, with revenue up 300% year-over-year in the last six months of 2020. At the same time, he suggested that the divisions between marketing and customer service are beginning to dissolve, with service teams increasingly given sales goals, and &#8220;at younger, more commerce-focused organizations, they don’t have this differentiation between marketing and customer service&#8221; at all.</p>
<p>Apparently the two companies were already working together to create a combined offering for direct messaging on Instagram, which prompted broader discussions about how to bring the two products together. Moving forward, they will offer a combined platform for a variety of customers under the Quiq brand. (Quiq&#8217;s customers include Overstock.com, West Elm, Men’s Wearhouse and Brinks Home Security, while Snaps&#8217;ane Bryant, Live Nation, General Assembly, Clairol and Nioxin.) Brucculeri said this will give businesses one product to manage their conversations across &#8220;the full customer journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The key term you&#8217;re hearing is conversation,&#8221; Myer added. &#8220;It&#8217;s not about a ticket or a case or a question [&#8230;] it&#8217;s an ongoing conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/19/snaps-series-a/">Snaps had raised $11.3 million</a> in total funding from investors including Signal Peak Ventures. The financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="http://box.com">Box</a> announced it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/kkr-hands-box-a-500m-lifeline/">getting a $500 million investment</a> from private equity firm KKR this morning, it was hard not to see it as a positive move for the company. It has been operating under <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/as-activist-investors-loom-whats-next-for-box/">the shadow of Starboard Value</a>, and this influx of cash could give it a way forward independent of the activist investors.</p>
<p>Industry experts we spoke to were all optimistic about the deal, seeing it as a way for the company to regain control, while giving it a bushel of cash to make some moves. However, early returns from the stock market were not as upbeat as the stock price was plunging this morning.</p>
<p>Alan Pelz-Sharpe, principal analyst at Deep Analysis, a firm that follows the content management market closely, says that it&#8217;s a significant move for Box and opens up a path to expanding through acquisition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The KKR move is probably the most important strategic move Box has made <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/26/a-year-after-ipo-depressed-stock-price-not-bringing-box-ceo-down/">since it IPO’d</a>. KKR doesn’t just bring a lot of money to the deal, it gives Box the ability to shake off some naysayers and invest in further acquisitions,&#8221; Pelz-Sharpe told me, adding &#8220;Box is no longer a startup its a rapidly maturing company and organic growth will only take you so far. Inorganic growth is what will take Box to the next level.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dion Hinchcliffe, an analyst at Constellation Research, who covers the work from home trend and the digital workplace, sees it similarly, saying the investment allows the company to focus longer term again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Box very much needs to expand in new markets beyond its increasingly commoditized core business. The KKR investment will give them the opportunity to realize loftier ambitions long term so they can turn their established market presence into a growth story,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="tTZOWww205"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/27/box-looks-to-balance-growth-and-profitability-as-it-matures/">Box looks to balance growth and profitability as it matures</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Box looks to balance growth and profitability as it matures&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/27/box-looks-to-balance-growth-and-profitability-as-it-matures/embed/#?secret=tTZOWww205" data-secret="tTZOWww205" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Pelz-Sharpe says that it also changes the power dynamic after a couple of years of having Starboard pushing the direction of the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;In short, as a public company there are investors who want a quick flip and others that want to grow this company substantially before an exit. This move with KKR potentially changes the dynamic at Box and may well put Aaron Levie back in the driver&#8217;s seat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Josh Stein, a partner at DFJ and early investor in Box, who was a long time board member, says that it shows that Box is moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it makes a ton of sense. Management has done a great job growing the business and taking it to profitability. With KKR’s new investment, you have two of the top technology investors in the world putting significant capital into going long on Box,&#8221; Stein said.</p>
<p>Perhaps Stein&#8217;s optimism is warranted. In its most recent <a href="https://www.boxinvestorrelations.com/news-and-media/news/press-release-details/2021/Box-Reports-Fiscal-Year-2021-Revenue-of-771-Million-Up-11-Percent-Year-Over-Year/default.aspx">earnings report from last month</a>, the company announced revenue of $198.9 million, up 8% year-over-year with FY2021 revenue closing at $771 million up 11%. What&#8217;s more, the company is cash-flow positive, and has predicted an optimistic future outlook.</p>
<p>&#8220;As previously announced, Box is committed to achieving a revenue growth rate between 12-16%, with operating margins of between 23-27%, by fiscal 2024,&#8221; the company reiterated in a statement this morning.</p>
<p>Investors remains skeptical, however, with the company stock price getting hammered this morning. As of publication the share price was down over 9%. At this point, market investors may be waiting for the next earnings report to see if the company is headed in the right direction. For now, the $500 million certainly gives the company options, regardless of what Wall Street thinks in the short term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">You’ve got a great idea and a strong founding team. So now what? When VCs come knocking, it’s important to make sure you’re well positioned to make deals. Fenwick &amp; West partner (and business lawyer) Dawn Belt joined us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/early-stage-2021/">TechCrunch Early Stage</a> to break down some of the terms that trip up first-time entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Belt has been involved in a number of key Silicon Valley moves, including EV company Proterra’s recent decision to go public via SPAC, as well as IPOs for Bill.com and Facebook. Here, she discusses key concepts like equity and the right of first refusal, and the role they play in the early stages of startup funding.</p>
<hr />
<h2>How financially savvy should founders be?</h2>
<p>When it comes to navigating early-stage deals, how important is it to have someone on the founding team with a deep knowledge of these financial guidelines?</p>
<blockquote><p>I actually don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s really necessary. I think that it&#8217;s nice to have, and it&#8217;s good to be able to do this, but that&#8217;s not the core competency of the company. That’s actually a function. It&#8217;s pretty easy for you to outsource to somebody like me at the time when you need it and get the advice then. It&#8217;s more important for you to be really focused on building a good business, and then being open minded and a good listener and learner. <em><strong>(Time stamp: 27:48)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<p>Top early-stage startups from around the world — from any country and industry — will compete for a shot at $100,000 in equity-free prize money. That’s a huge bottom-line boost, and it also comes with global exposure, massive media attention and invaluable investor interest. Oh, and let’s not forget the bragging rights associated with winning the Disrupt Cup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here’s a quick run-down on how it all works. First and foremost: applying to and participating in Startup Battlefield is free — no fees, no equity cut. The TechCrunch editorial team reviews all applications and will choose roughly 25 stand-out startups to participate in tech’s top pitch competition.</p>
<p>Competing founders receive several weeks of intense training with the Startup Battlefield team — again at no cost. Your presentation skills, pitch and business models will be honed and burnished to perfection. You’ll be more than ready to virtually step onto the tech world’s most famous stage.</p>
<p>You’ll face a panel of judges consisting of leading VCs and have six minutes to pitch and demo. The judges will then put you through your paces with a Q&amp;A. If you make the first cut, you’ll repeat the experience in round two with a fresh set of judges. In round three — a.k.a. the finals — another set of judges will hear the pitches and then declare the Startup Battlefield champion.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering how Startup Battlefield plays out as a virtual competition, here’s a perspective that Rachael Wilcox, a creative producer at Volvo Cars, shared with us after watching last year’s competition.</p>
<p>“The Startup Battlefield translated easily to the virtual format. You could see the excitement, enthusiasm and possibility of the young founders, and I loved that. You could also ask questions through the chat feature, and you don&#8217;t always have time for questions at a live event.”</p>
<p>Here’s another important aspect of competing in Startup Battlefield. Every team receives a VIP experience at Disrupt. What’s that look like? Global exposure to for starters — to journalists hungry to cover game-changing startups and VCs eager to expand their portfolios with top talent.</p>
<p>Then there’s free exhibition space on the virtual show floor, access to the CrunchMatch networking platform, complimentary tickets to future TC events and a free subscription to Extra Crunch. You’ll also receive invitations to private events — like the Startup Battlefield reception with members of the Startup Battlefield alumni community.</p>
<p>That’s an impressive group of 922 companies — including Vurb, Dropbox, Mint, Yammer and many others that have collectively raised $9.5 billion and generated 117 exits. It’s rarified territory and a prime networking opportunity.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/tickets">TC Disrupt 2021</a> takes place September 21-23, and there are just two questions you need to ask yourself. Are you ready? Do you have what it takes? Alrighty then — <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/zM4H0xNn">apply to Startup Battlefield</a> and prepare to take your startup to a new level of success. We can wait to see you bring the heat!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sophienovati/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sophie Zhou Novati</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worked as a senior engineer at Facebook and then Nextdoor, where she struggled to hire great engineers for her team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frustrated, she decided to try training engineers to meet her team’s hiring standards by mentoring at a local coding bootcamp. After two and a half years of mentoring on nights and weekends, Novati decided to turn her passion into a career.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She and her husband, Michael, founded <a href="https://formation.dev">Formation</a> with a couple of goals in mind. For one, they wanted to offer personalized training to help people not just learn to code, but to become “exceptional” software engineers. Sophie was also struck by the diversity of the people she witnessed going through coding bootcamps, but she realized that those graduates weren’t getting access to the same opportunities that students from traditional universities do.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2135844" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Sophie-Headshot.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135844" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2135844" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Sophie-Headshot.jpg" alt="Formation co-founder and CEO Sophia Zhou Navati" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Sophie-Headshot.jpg 4898w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Sophie-Headshot.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Sophie-Headshot.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Sophie-Headshot.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Sophie-Headshot.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Sophie-Headshot.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Sophie-Headshot.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Sophie-Headshot.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2135844" class="wp-caption-text">Formation co-founder and CEO Sophia Zhou Navati</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Formation, her goal is to personalize the training experience via a remote fellowship program that combines automated instruction with access to a “network of top tier mentors” from companies such as Facebook and Google. After one year in beta, Formation is unveiling its Engineering Fellowship, where every fellow gets a “personalized training plan tailored to their unique career ambitions.” So far, it’s placed just over 30 people in engineering roles at companies such as Facebook, Microsoft and Lyft with an average starting salary of $120,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Formation aims to offer an experience beyond bootcamps, which Sophie argues “have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">gotten too big, too fast, churning hundreds or thousands of students through fixed curriculums without individualized attention.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup attracted the attention of Andreessen Horowitz, which just led its $4 million seed round. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Designer Fund, Combine, Lachy Groom, Slow Ventures and engineers from Airbnb, Notion, Rippling and others also participated in the financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The first thing that really struck me about this community is just how diverse it is. Forty-four percent of graduates are reporting that they identify as nonmale, and the percentage of Black and Latinx graduates is nearly double the national average at traditional universities,” Sophie told TechCrunch. “But the problem is that only about 55% of bootcamp grads are getting a job as a software engineer, and of the ones that do, their median salary is only about $65,000. At the same time, companies everywhere are just desperately looking for ways to diversify their talent pool.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of having students follow a fixed curriculum, Formation leverages adaptive learning technology to build a personalized training plan tailored to each student’s specific skillset and career goals. The platform continuously assesses their skills and adapts their roadmap, according to Sophie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About half of the people participating in Formation’s program are current engineers already working in the industry in some capacity. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Formation stood out to her as the “only true tech-based and scalable solution that optimizes each student&#8217;s mastery of important skills.” Its ability to dynamically change based on a student’s performance in particular was compelling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The founder-product fit is also super clear — Sophie brings her own best-in-class engineering experience to Formation, as well as her long-time passion for mentoring,” Chan wrote via email.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Edraak, an online education nonprofit, exposed the private information of thousands of students after uploading student data to an unprotected cloud storage server, apparently by mistake.</p>
<p>The nonprofit, founded by Jordan&#8217;s Queen Rania and headquartered in the kingdom&#8217;s capital, was set up in 2013 to promote education across the Arab region. The organization works with several partners, including the British Council and edX, a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/20/online-learning-platform-edx-goes-international-with-the-addition-of-six-new-schools/">consortium set up by Harvard, Stanford and MIT</a>.</p>
<p>In February, researchers at U.K. cybersecurity firm TurgenSec found one of Edraak&#8217;s cloud storage servers containing at least tens of thousands of students&#8217; data, including spreadsheets with students&#8217; names, email addresses, gender, birth year, country of nationality and some class grades.</p>
<p>TurgenSec, which runs Breaches.UK, a site for disclosing security incidents, alerted Edraak to the security lapse. A week later, their email was acknowledged by the organization but the data continued to spill. Emails seen by TechCrunch show the researchers tried to alert others who worked at the organization via LinkedIn requests, and its partners, including the British Council.</p>
<p>Two months passed and the server remained open. At its request, TechCrunch contacted Edraak, which closed the servers a few hours later.</p>
<p>In an email this week, Edraak chief executive Sherif Halawa told TechCrunch that the storage server was &#8220;meant to be publicly accessible, and to host public course content assets, such as course images, videos, and educational files,&#8221; but that &#8220;student data is never intentionally placed in this bucket.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Due to an unfortunate configuration bug, however, some academic data and student information exports were accidentally placed in the bucket,&#8221; Halawa confirmed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately our initial scan did not locate the misplaced data that made it there accidentally. We attributed the elements in the Breaches.UK email to regular student uploads. We have now located these misplaced reports today and addressed the issue,&#8221; Halawa said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How to respond to a data breach&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/how-to-respond-to-a-data-breach/embed/#?secret=1qU3JjUGBF" data-secret="1qU3JjUGBF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The server is now closed off to public access.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear why Edraak ignored the researchers&#8217; initial email, which disclosed the location of the unprotected server, or why the organization&#8217;s response was not to ask for more details. When reached, British Council spokesperson Catherine Bowden said the organization received an email from TurgenSec but mistook it for a phishing email.</p>
<p>Edraak&#8217;s CEO Halawa said that the organization had already begun notifying affected students about the incident, and put out <a href="https://blog.edraak.org/%d8%a8%d9%8a%d8%a7%d9%86-%d9%81%d9%86%d9%91%d9%8a-%d9%85%d9%86-%d9%81%d8%b1%d9%8a%d9%82-%d9%85%d9%86%d8%b5%d8%a9-%d8%a5%d8%af%d8%b1%d8%a7%d9%83/">a blog post</a> on Thursday.</p>
<p>Last year, TurgenSec found an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51768577">unencrypted customer database</a> belonging to U.K. internet provider Virgin Media that was left online by mistake, containing records linking some customers to adult and explicit websites.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The pandemic upended the way people shop for their everyday needs, including groceries. Online grocery sales in the U.S. <a href="https://info.mercatus.com/egrocery-shopper-behavior-report">are expected to reach 21.5%</a> of the total grocery sales by 2025, after leaping from 3.4% pre-pandemic to 10.2% as of 2020. One business riding this wave is <a href="https://www.mercato.com/">Mercato</a>, an online grocery platform that helps smaller grocers and specialty food stores get online quickly. After helping grow its merchant sales by 1,300% in 2020, Mercato has now closed on $26 million in Series A funding, the company tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The round was led by Velvet Sea Ventures with participation from Team Europe, the investing arm of Lukasz Gadowski, co-founder of Delivery Hero. Seed investors Greycroft and Loeb.nyc also returned for the new round; Gadowski and Mike Lazerow of Velvet Sea Ventures have also now joined Mercato&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>Mercato itself was founded in 2015 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bbrannigan/">Bobby Brannigan</a>, who had grown up helping at his family&#8217;s grocery store in Brooklyn. But instead of taking over the business, as his Dad had hoped, Brannigan left for college and eventually went on to bootstrap a college textbook marketplace, Valore Books, to $100 million in sales. After selling the business, he returned his focus to the family&#8217;s store and found that everything was still operating the way it had been decades ago.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>&#8220;He had a very basic website, no e-commerce, no social media and no point-of-sale system,&#8221; explains Brannigan. &#8220;I said, &#8216;I&#8217;m going to build what you need.&#8217; This was my opportunity to help my dad in an area that I knew about,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Brannigan recruited some engineers from his last company to help him build the software systems to modernize his dad&#8217;s store, including Mercato&#8217;s co-founders Dave Bateman, Michael Mason and Matthew Alarie. But the team soon realized it could do more than help just Brannigan&#8217;s dad &#8212; they could also help the 40,000 independent grocery stores just like him better compete with the Amazon&#8217;s of the world.</p>
<p>The result was Mercato, a platform-as-a-service that makes it easier for smaller grocers and specialty food shops to go online to offer their inventory for pickup or delivery, without having to partner with a grocery delivery service like Instacart, Amazon Fresh or Shipt.</p>
<p>The solution today includes an e-commerce website and data analytics platform that helps stores understand what their customers are looking for, where customers are located, how to price their products and other insights that help them to better run their store. And Mercato is now working on adding a supply platform to help the stores buy inventory through their system, Brannigan notes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basically, the vision of it is to give them the tech, the systems and the platform they need to be successful in this day and age,&#8221; notes Brannigan.</p>
<p>He likens Mercato as a sort of &#8220;Shopify for groceries,&#8221; as it gives stores their own page on Mercato where they can reach customers. When the customer visits Mercato on the web or via its app, they can enter their ZIP code to see which local stores offer online shopping. Some stores simply redirect their existing websites to their Mercato page, as they can continue to offer other basic information, like address, hours and other details about their stores on the Mercato-provided site, while gaining access to Mercato&#8217;s more than 1 million customers.</p>

<p>However, merchants also can opt for a white-label solution that they can plug into their own website, which uses their own branding.</p>
<p>The stores can further customize the experience they want to offer customers, in terms of pickup and delivery, and the time frames for both that they want to commit to. If they want to ease into online grocery, for example, they can start with next-day delivery services, then speed thing up to same-day when they&#8217;re ready. They also can set limits on how many time slots they offer per hour, based on staffing levels.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135830" style="width: 586px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135830" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2135830" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/merchant-instore-experience-2x.jpg?w=576" alt="" width="576" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/merchant-instore-experience-2x.jpg 910w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/merchant-instore-experience-2x.jpg?resize=127,150 127w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/merchant-instore-experience-2x.jpg?resize=254,300 254w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/merchant-instore-experience-2x.jpg?resize=768,906 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/merchant-instore-experience-2x.jpg?resize=576,680 576w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/merchant-instore-experience-2x.jpg?resize=42,50 42w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135830" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mercato</p></div></p>
<p>Unlike Instacart and others which send shoppers to stores to fill the orders, Mercato allows the merchants themselves to maintain the customer relationship by handling the orders themselves, which they can receive via email, text or even robo-phone calls.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re maintaining that relationship,&#8221; says Brannigan. &#8220;Usually, it&#8217;s a lot better if it&#8217;s somebody from the store [doing the shopping] because they might know the customer; they know the kind of product they&#8217;re looking for. And if they don&#8217;t have it, they know something else they can recommend &#8212; so they&#8217;re like a really efficient recommendation engine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The big difference between an Instacart shopper and the worker in the store is that the worker in the store understands that somebody is trying to put a meal on the table, and certain items could be an important ingredient,&#8221; he notes. &#8220;For the shoppers at Instacart, it&#8217;s about a time clock: how quickly can they pick an order to make the most money.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company contracts with both national and regional couriers to handle the delivery portion, once orders are ready.</p>
<p>Mercato&#8217;s system was put to the test during the pandemic, when demand for online grocery skyrocketed.</p>
<p>This is where Mercato&#8217;s ability to rapidly onboard merchants came in handy. The company says it can take stores online in just 24 hours, as it has built out a centralized product catalog of over a million items. It then connects with the store&#8217;s point-of-sale system, and uploads and matches the store&#8217;s products to their own database. This allows Mercato to map around 95% of the store&#8217;s products in a matter of minutes, with the last bit being added manually &#8212; which helps to build out Mercato&#8217;s catalog even further. Today, Mercato can integrate with virtually all point-of-sale (POS) solutions in the grocery market, which is more than 30 different systems.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2135838" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/merchant-quicksetup-2x-1.jpg?w=565" alt="" width="565" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/merchant-quicksetup-2x-1.jpg 928w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/merchant-quicksetup-2x-1.jpg?resize=125,150 125w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/merchant-quicksetup-2x-1.jpg?resize=249,300 249w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/merchant-quicksetup-2x-1.jpg?resize=768,924 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/merchant-quicksetup-2x-1.jpg?resize=565,680 565w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/merchant-quicksetup-2x-1.jpg?resize=42,50 42w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px" /></p>
<p>As customers shop, Mercato&#8217;s system uses machine learning to help determine if a product is likely in stock by examining movement data.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the challenges in grocery is that most stores actually don&#8217;t know how many quantities they have in stock of a product,&#8221; explains Brannigan. &#8220;So we launch a store, we integrate with the POS. And with the POS we can see how quickly a product is moving in-store and online. Based on movement, we can calculate what is in stock.&#8221;</p>
<p>This system, he says, continues to get smarter over time, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re certainly three to five years ahead, and we&#8217;re not going back,&#8221; says Brannigan of the COVID impacts to the online grocery business. &#8220;It&#8217;s very plentiful now in many places, in terms of e-commerce offerings. And the nature of retail businesses is competitive. So if 1% of people are online, it might not drive other people. But if you have 15% of stores online, then other stores have to get online or they won&#8217;t be able to compete,&#8221; he notes.</p>
<p>Mercato generates revenue both from its consumer-facing membership program, with plans that range from $96/year &#8211; $228/year, depending on distance, and from the merchants themselves, who pay a single-digit percentage transaction fee on orders &#8212; a lower percentage than what restaurant delivery companies charge.</p>
<p>The company has now scaled its service to more than 1,000 merchants across 45 U.S. states, including big cities like New York, Chicago, LA, DC, Boston, Philadelphia and others.</p>
<p>With the additional funding, Mercato aims to expand its remotely distributed team of now 80 employees, as well as its data analytics platform, which will help merchants make better decisions that impact their business. It also plans to refresh the consumer subscription to add more benefits and perks that make it more compelling.</p>
<p>Mercato declined to share its valuation or revenue, but as of the start of the pandemic last year, <a href="https://mixergy.com/interviews/mercato-with-bobby-brannigan/">the company had said</a> it was reaching a billion in sales and a $700 million run rate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There’s an “Uber for everything” these days, and now there are “Ubers for personal chefs”. Just take a look at <a href="https://www.poptop.uk.com/">PopTop</a> or <a href="https://www.100pleats.com/">100 Pleats</a> for instance. Now in London, there is <a href="http://Yhangry.com">Yhangry</a> (which brands itself as the appropriately shouty YHANGRY). This is a &#8220;private chef parties at home” website, and no doubt an app at some point. The startup has now raised a $1.5 million seed round from a number of notable U.K. angels, which also includes a few U.K. VCs for good measure, as well as &#8220;Made In Chelsea&#8221; TV star Ollie Locke.</p>
<p>Founders Heinin Zhang and Siddhi Mittal created the startup before the pandemic, which lets people order a made-to-measure dinner party online. Although it trundled along until COVID, it had to pivot into virtual chef classes during lockdowns last year and this. The company is now poised to take advantage of London’s unlocking, which will see legal outdoor and indoor dining return.</p>
<p>The startup also speaks to the decentralization of experiences going on in the wake of the pandemic. In 2019 we were working out in gyms and going to restaurants. In 2021 we are working out at home and bringing the restaurant to us.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Normally booking private dinner parties involves a lot of hassle. The idea here is that Yhangry makes the whole affair as easy to order as an Uber Eats or Deliveroo.</p>
<p>Investors in the seed round include Carmen Rico (Blossom Capital), Eileen Burbidge (Passion Capital), Orson Stadler (Antler), Martin Mignot (Index Ventures), Ollie Locke, Jack Tang (Urban), Adnan Ebrahim (MindLabs), Alex Fitzgerald (Cuckoo Internet), Georgina Kirby (Vinehealth) and Deepali Nangia (Alma Angels). Yhangry’s statement said all the investors are also keen customers. I bet they are.</p>
<p>Co-founder Mittal said in a statement: “By making private chef experiences more accessible and affordable, our customers regularly tell us they are finally able to catch up with friends at home… 70% of our customers have never had a private chef before and for them, the freedom and flexibility to curate their own evening is priceless.”</p>
<p>Yhangry now has 130 chefs on its books. Chefs have to pass a cooking trial and adhere to COVID rules. The funding will be used to double the size of the startup’s team.</p>
<p>The menus start at £17/per person for six people. The price of the booking covers everything, including the cost of the fresh ingredients, but customers can add extras, such as wine, etc. Since its launch in December 2019, the firm says it has served more than 7,000 Londoners.</p>

<p>Yhangry says it will enter key European markets, such as Paris, Berlin, Lisbon and Barcelona.</p>
<p>How will Yhangry survive post-COVID, with restaurants/bars opening up again?</p>
<p>Mittal said: “When restaurants were open between our launch and March 2020, we saw demand because people want to be able to spend time with their friends in a relaxed setting, and aren’t limited to the two-hour slot you get in a restaurant. Once places start to open up again, we believe Yhangry will follow this trend of at-home dining and socializing &#8212; not to mention for people who are not ready yet to go out to a busy pub or restaurant.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Howard Lerman, the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.yext.com">Yext</a>, has a new startup called <a href="https://www.wonder.inc">Wonder Inventions</a>, which is officially launching its first product today — Dynascore.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s focus on Dynascore first. Lerman said he and his team created the product to solve the problem of the ever-growing demand for video content, which often relies on stock music. But by its nature, stock music isn&#8217;t designed for a specific video or a specific length, which can lead to some awkward fits, or require producers to edit their videos to match the music since &#8220;you can&#8217;t just chop three seconds out of a song and put it together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dynascore, however, can take an existing piece of music and adapt it to a video of any length. It can also adjust the music to put the transitions, pauses and endings where you want them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lerman and his team demonstrated this for me, taking a fitness commercial and fitting different pieces of music to it, as well as adjusting the length of the commercial and where the transitions fell. Each time, Dynascore would generate a new version of the track that flowed well with the commercial (though I got the sense that if you&#8217;ve picked the wrong song for the video, no amount of adjustment can help).</p>
<p>To achieve this, Lerman said Dynascore examines a song and breaks it down to &#8220;the smallest unit of music that makes musical sense,&#8221; which it calls at a &#8220;morphone.&#8221; So depending on the specifications, it can assemble those morphones in ways that maximize what the company calls &#8220;musicoherence&#8221; — basically, to make sure it still flows like a real song.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135806" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135806" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2135806" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Dynascore-App-1.jpg?w=680" alt="Dynascore" width="680" height="558" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Dynascore-App-1.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Dynascore-App-1.jpg?resize=150,123 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Dynascore-App-1.jpg?resize=300,246 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Dynascore-App-1.jpg?resize=768,630 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Dynascore-App-1.jpg?resize=680,558 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Dynascore-App-1.jpg?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135806" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dynascore</p></div></p>
<p>Lerman emphasized that Dynascore&#8217;s technology isn&#8217;t trying to write music from scratch. Instead, it&#8217;s adapting human compositions — there are Masterworks, a.k.a. classic compositions that are in the public domain, as well as around 1,000 original compositions to start.</p>
<p>&#8220;There’s a lot of companies out there that use AI to write music,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They train their models on Bach, Mozart and Beethoven, but the stuff that comes out of it is trash [&#8230;] The critical breakthrough we realized is that computers cannot write music, the same way that AI can&#8217;t write a film and can&#8217;t write a book. But AI can reconstruct music in a way that the human ear responds to.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a free trial, pricing for Dynascore starts at $19 per month. It&#8217;s available as a desktop app for Mac and Windows, as well as an extension for editing software Adobe Premiere Pro. The company has also built a Developer API to integrate into other apps, starting with video builder <a href="https://biteable.com">Biteable</a> and marketing production tool <a href="https://rocketium.com">Rocketium</a>.</p>
<p>Dynascore is just the first product that we should expect from Wonder Inventions, which Lerman said will develop a whole portfolio of new products.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135809" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135809" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2135809" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PP-Create-a-new-track_launch-video.jpg?w=680" alt="Dynascore" width="680" height="369" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PP-Create-a-new-track_launch-video.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PP-Create-a-new-track_launch-video.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PP-Create-a-new-track_launch-video.jpg?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PP-Create-a-new-track_launch-video.jpg?resize=768,417 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PP-Create-a-new-track_launch-video.jpg?resize=680,369 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PP-Create-a-new-track_launch-video.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135809" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dynascore</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We’re not starting Wonder Inventions for a single idea,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Wonder Inventions is 20 master inventors who are some of the most creative and brilliant and people we’ve ever met, and they will develop many products that will have synergies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lerman himself is serving as Wonder&#8217;s chairman while he remains CEO at Yext, which he described as his full-time job. When pressed on whether there&#8217;s a unifying vision for the company beyond making cool stuff, he replied, &#8220;Thirty years ago, when people started a business, it would be about the company. Now when a company is started, it’s about the product&#8221; — something he attributed to venture capitalists&#8217; focus on a single, scalable idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think any VC would fund Dynascore — it’s too goofy and someone would look at the [total addressable market] and say, &#8216;I don&#8217;t think this is a multi-billion dollar category,'&#8221; Lerman continued. He doesn&#8217;t necessarily disagree with that assessment, but he added, &#8220;It can be great first product, with more hits to come.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Neal Sáles-Griffin, managing director of Techstars Chicago, hands out essential tips and tricks for when you're applying to an accelerator]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Should you try to get your company into an accelerator? How far along should your idea and your team be before applying? When it is time to apply, how do you make your application stand out from hundreds or thousands of others? How fancy do you need to get with the application video?</p>
<p>For answers, we spoke with Neal Sáles-Griffin, managing director of Techstars Chicago, and the founder of one of the earliest coding bootcamps with Code Academy (later known as The Starter League). He is an adjunct professor at Northwestern University and was a mayoral candidate in Chicago&#8217;s 2019 election. He&#8217;s got an incredible wealth of knowledge about all things startups — our chat was only about 40 minutes long, but he absolutely crammed it with insights.</p>
<p>Here are some highlights from our conversation at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/early-stage-2021/">TC Early Stage</a> — Extra Crunch members will find the full video and a transcript below.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Why (or why not to) join an accelerator</h2>
<p>Throughout the talk, Neal shares plenty of reasons why you might want to join an accelerator. The connections! The shared knowledge! The support network! The funding is nice too, of course — but he&#8217;s quick to point out that it shouldn&#8217;t be your sole motivation.</p>
<blockquote><p>It can&#8217;t just be about the money. If it&#8217;s just about fundraising and you don&#8217;t really want any of the other parts of the experience, you&#8217;re probably setting yourself up to not have a very good time. I would highly recommend reconsidering that and instead focusing more on talking to early-stage investors who might be interested in providing more hands-on and specific support that you would need.</p>
<p>That being said, doing an accelerator can be amazing, because all those things that you would naturally do as a startup in your local ecosystem or community, or wherever you&#8217;re trying to grow your business … all of that happens in a far more immersive, effective and accelerated way. The mentors that you get connected to, the investors that you get introduced to, the level of knowledge, the holistic educational experience that you gain from being a part of an accelerator can be a game changer for so many startups that are in those early days of trying to figure out and find their path.<br />
<em><strong> (Time stamp: 2:30)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<hr />
<h2>Be prepared and follow up</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s important to think through the <em>entire</em> interview process — not just your answers to the questions that might pop up. Knowing a little bit about the person interviewing you and showing that you really know what you&#8217;re getting into can go a long way.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Historically, the transmasculine community has been neglected by the fashion world. But <a href="https://bothandapparel.com/">Both&amp;</a> is a new brand looking to offer clothing tailored specifically for transmasculine bodies.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Finnegan Shepard, a trans man who started Both&amp; after going through top surgery and feeling like he still couldn&#8217;t find clothing that fit his body. The items are designed to emphasize a masculine figure, disguise bindings, and the line is size inclusive.</p>
<p>The general idea is that our clothing is a representation of who we are, and no one should have their clothing options limited based on their body.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Both&amp; is fully bootstrapped and sells direct to consumer through the website. The strategy is to do super small batches of capsule lines, with the first going on pre-order today.</p>
<p>The first line is comprised of three basic t-shirts.</p>
<p>The Finnegan is an everyday basics shirt. The Tyla is similar to the Finnegan, but has a ribbed sleeve cuff for a tighter fit around the biceps. The Khazeel is designed for an oversize fit, and is designed to cover bindings and appear boxy. These items range from $39 to $45.</p>
<p>Both&amp; wants to start with simple designs and forget about color and prints for now.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2135795,2135796,2135797"]</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get the basics right in terms of shape, and focus on relatively minimalist-ish colors, and then once we have those nailed, then we move on to a lot more colorful stuff,&#8221; said Shephard. &#8220;We&#8217;re not really interested in prints. That was one of the things that I actually had an adverse reaction to. There are a lot of companies out there that are printing sort of Trans Pride stuff on t-shirts, but they&#8217;re not really changing the shapes or making them fit better.&#8221;</p>
<p>The plan is to release new designs every six to eight weeks.</p>
<p>One of the challenges for Both&amp; is that the target demographic is very focused on sustainability, but traditionally doesn&#8217;t have a lot of disposable income, according to Shepard.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re making it at an accessible price point and also sustainable and we&#8217;re building items that can also be produced in small batch,&#8221; said Shepard. &#8220;That&#8217;s a lot of different things to try and juggle at once.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s been a lot of investment in machine learning startups recently as companies try to push the notion into a wider variety of endeavors. <a href="http://comet.ml">Comet</a>, a company that helps customers iterate on models in an experimentation process designed to eventually reach production, announced a $13 million Series A today.</p>
<p>Scale Venture Partners led the round with help from existing investors Trilogy Equity Partners and Two Sigma Ventures. The startup has raised almost $20 million, according to Crunchbase data.</p>
<p>Investors saw a company that has grown revenue over 500% over the last year, says Gideon Mendels, co-founder and CEO. &#8220;Things have been working very well for us. On the product side, we&#8217;ve continued to double down on what we call experimentation management where we are really tracking these models &#8212; data that came into them, the hyper parameters and helping teams to debug and understand what&#8217;s going on with their models,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to the funding, the company is also announcing an expansion of the platform to follow the models into post production with a product they are calling Comet Model Production Monitoring (MPM).</p>
<p>&#8220;The model production monitoring product essentially focuses on models post production. The original product was more around how multiple offline experiments are modeled during training, while MPM is focused on these models once they hit production for the first time,&#8221; Mendels explained.</p>

<p>Andy Vitus, partner at investor Scale Venture Partners, sees model lifecycle management tooling like Comet&#8217;s as a developing market. &#8220;Machine learning and AI will drive the future of enterprise software, and ensuring that organizations have full visibility and control of a model’s life cycle will be imperative to it,&#8221; Vitus said in a statement</p>
<p>As the company grows, it&#8217;s opening a new engineering hub in Israel in addition to its office in NYC. While these offices are closed for now, Mendels says that they will have a hybrid office when the pandemic ebbs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moving forward we are planning to have an office in New York City and another office in Tel Aviv. But we&#8217;re not going to require anyone to work from the office if they choose not to, or, they can come in a couple days a week. And we&#8217;re still going to support hires from around the world.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.omadahealth.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omada Health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one of the U.S.’s original virtual healthcare providers, today announced the creation of the Omada Insights Lab.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The Insights Lab is an approach to product development that leverages multidisciplinary teams to rapidly look at what does and does not work in a digital care setting and then scale those tools within the company,” Sean Duffy, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omada </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">offers care management for diabetes, musculoskeletal issues, preventative health, hypertension, and behavioral health. Its main differentiator from other virtual healthcare providers is the amount of handholding it offers to its patients, which in turn has shown to deliver better health outcomes. Through the Insights Lab, it plans to share insights to help improve care outcomes across the industry.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A shared sense of commitment with an Omada care professional increases the likelihood of a better outcome by 250%,” Duffy said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One tactic Omada uses to keep patients on track is the “nudge.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like your Apple watch that tells you when to stand up or breathe, the Omada app can remind its diabetes patients to have a meal and to measure their blood sugar, for example. If you’re thinking, “Yeah, but I often ignore my Apple watch,” you’re not alone. The company has also noticed that passive nudges aren’t as successful as a comprehensive and proactive approach to care, especially one that involves human interaction. As a result, the Omada doctors have made changes to their care delivery.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2135595" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2135595" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2135595" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SeanDuffy2.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="390" height="260" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SeanDuffy2.jpg 3097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SeanDuffy2.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SeanDuffy2.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SeanDuffy2.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SeanDuffy2.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SeanDuffy2.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SeanDuffy2.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/SeanDuffy2.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2135595" class="wp-caption-text">Omada co-founder and CEO Sean Duffy</p></div></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example: the Lab wanted to find out how to help their diabetes prevention patients lose weight &#8211; being overweight is a key indicator of developing diabetes. They looked at the automated nudges, reminders to track meals, mealtime push notifications, and engagement with the care team.</p>
<p>While all of<span style="font-weight: 400;"> the approaches made it more likely that people would track their meals &#8211; an important task that helps patients stay on track with their diets &#8211; only one drove increases in weight loss: engagement with the care team. They found that patients who interact with their care team or community in the first week of the program are 24% more likely to achieve their health goals and patients who message their care teams are twice as likely to achieve positive health outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consequentially, Duffy said, &#8220;It&#8217;s not just engagement that matters, it&#8217;s the type of engagement.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Omada took these insights and reduced the use of nudges and implemented ways for the care team to interact with the patients more.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Omada is already using the more than a billion data points it’s recorded from 450,000 members in the company’s 10 years of business to improve its own tools, with the launch of the Lab, the company also plans to share the data and strategies with the broader medical community through content on its website and other outlets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because the company is only virtual, it prides itself on the amount &#8211; and quality &#8211; of its data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s so hard to measure small details in in-person settings, but with digital, you can measure everything,” Duffy said. “Everything people are doing in the app are connected to meaningful outcomes,” he added. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honda and Verizon are researching how 5G and mobile edge computing might improve safety for today&#8217;s connected vehicles and the future&#8217;s autonomous ones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The two companies, which announced the partnership Thursday, are piloting different safety scenarios at the University of Michigan’s </span><a href="https://mcity.umich.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mcity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a test bed for connected and autonomous vehicles. The aim of the venture is to study </span>how 5G connectivity coupled with edge computing could allow for faster communication between cars, pedestrians and infrastructure. The upshot: faster communication could allow cars to avoid collisions and hazards and find safer routes. <span style="font-weight: 400;">[TechCrunch is owned by Verizon Media, which is itself owned by Verizon]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 5G testing is in its preliminary research phase and Honda doesn’t intend to implement this new technology as a product feature just yet. The companies do have plans to test 5G-enabled vehicles on public roads in at least four cities this year, according to Brian Peebles, Verizon’s senior manager of technology development and one of the leads on the project.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This partnership builds off of Honda’s onboard SAFE SWARM AI technology, which the automaker began developing in 2017. That technology uses Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything, or C-V2X communication, which does what the name implies and lets vehicles communicate with other road users.</span></p>

<div class="p-rich_text_section">We’ve seen similar tech before with Dedicated Short Range Communications which requires cell towers to communicate between vehicles. V2X and 5G have the advantage of being able to communicate device-to-device, not to mention <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/02/the-station-canoo-hits-the-road-coup-shutters-and-samsung-shifts/">endorsement by the FCC</a>.</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Traditionally, with V2X, the cars talk to each other,” Dr. Ehsan Moradi Pari, research group lead at Honda’s advanced technology research division told TechCrunch. “They provide their information, like their location, speed and other sensor information, and the car does a threat assessment, like whether I’m going to collide with another car. What this [5G and MEC] technology offers is that we all provide our information to the network, and the network tells me if there is a potential for an accident or not.”</span></p>
<p>Honda and Verizon&#8217;s premise is that the technology can handle communication far faster than a car&#8217;s computer. Instead of relying on a car&#8217;s less capable computer to do the work, information generated from connected cars, people and infrastructure is sent <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">up into the 5G network. The computations are then done at the edge of network (meaning not in the cloud) in real time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The payoff: a car relying on sensors and software might be </span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">able to understand a driver is about to hit something and hit the breaks, but the MEC can almost see into the future by checking out and communicating what’s happening farther down the road. </span></p>

<div class="p-rich_text_section"><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The speed of the communication is what stands out, according to Peebles, who noted that the round trip latency testing performed on Verizon’s 5G network to its MEC came back in under 50 milliseconds.</span></div>

</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the safety scenarios that Verizon and Honda tested was a red light runner. Using data from smart cameras, MEC and V2X software they were able to detect the vehicle running a red light and send a visual warning message to other vehicles approaching the intersection. They tested similar scenarios to warn drivers or vehicles about a pedestrian obscured by a building and an oncoming emergency vehicle whose sirens are drowned out by the car’s loud music. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ensuring real-time communication among all road users will play a critical role in an automated driving environment,” said Pari. “Through these connected safety technologies, we can develop vehicle systems that detect potential dangerous situations in real time to warn the driver or automated system.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this initial research stage involves making human-driven vehicles safer, the Honda-Verizon partnership might eventually lay the groundwork for the use of 5G in future autonomous vehicles. If testing proves out, connected vehicles would be safer and could lead to a more efficient network that smooths out traffic congestion and reduces air pollution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re primarily doing this to promote vehicle safety and human safety,” Peebles told TechCrunch. “There are over 42,000 people a year in the United States alone that are killed in automobile accidents, and another two million are injured. Technology is becoming more crucial as we undergo an evolution of human drivers, so as that transition happens, we need to do it in a safe and orchestrated manner, such that everything is working together.”</span></p>
<p>Autonomous vehicles being tested on public roads today don&#8217;t require 5G or edge computing. While autonomous vehicle companies are eyeing what might be possible with 5G, the vehicles they&#8217;re developing are based on present-day technology.</p>
<p>There are headwinds to this 5G-MEC combination. <span style="font-weight: 400;">This level of interconnectivity only works if there are sensors on every highway and every intersection. Many 5G-enabled vehicles and devices will be able to communicate with one another, but they can only communicate with pedestrians or infrastructure if smart cameras are clocking them and sharing that info with the network. And </span> sensors are not perfect.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would require a huge infrastructure investment as well as public acceptance and cooperation with states, cities and localities to install all of the necessary sensors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, one might look to China as a use case. The country has a national policy to move rapidly over to a 5G network, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">many <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/start-ups/article/3088419/why-5g-considered-essential-element-chinas-autonomous-driving-road">Chinese autonomous driving companies</a> are finding this type of connectivity and computational power essential to development</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Corporate training startup <a href="http://Attensi.com">Attensi</a> — which originally emerged out of Oslo, Norway — has raised $26 million from New York-based Lugard Road Capital, DX Ventures (a VC fund backed by Delivery Hero), and existing shareholder <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/viking-venture-management">Viking Venture</a>. The new funding will be used to expand in North  America and Europe.</p>
<p>Attensi uses a ‘gamified approach to corporate training, putting employees into 3D simulations of their workplace and work processes. Its competitors include companies like GoSkills, Mindflash SAP Litmos Skilljar.</p>
<p>With the pandemic shifting all office work to remote, digital training platforms like this stand to benefit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is also yet another recent example of how US VCs are &#8216;going hunting&#8217; for startups in Europe, putting pressure on local VCs.</p>
<p>Attensi co-founder and co-CEO, Trond Aas said in a statement: “With gamified simulation training, we have combined the best of workplace psychology with our expertise in simulations and gamification to create a new category of training solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company claims it’s experienced a 63% CAGR in annual recurring revenue. Its clients include Daimler Mercedes Benz, Circle K, Equinor, BCG, and ASDA.</p>
<p>Doug Friedman, a partner at Lugard Road Capital, said: “We could not be more excited to be investing in the Attensi team as they work to forever change and improve corporate  learning and development through their Attensi solutions.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://box.com">Box</a> announced this morning that private equity firm <a href="http://kkr.com">KKR</a> is investing $500 million in the company, a move that could help the struggling cloud content management vendor get out from under pressure from activist investor Starboard Value.</p>
<p>The company plans to use the proceeds in what&#8217;s called a &#8220;<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dutchauction.asp">dutch auction</a>&#8221; style sale to buy back shares from certain investors for the price determined by the auction, an activity that should take place after the company announces its next earnings report in May. This would presumably involve buying out Starboard, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/starboard-value-takes-7-5-stake-in-box/">took a 7.5% stake in the company</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>Last month <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-box-starboard-exclusive-idINKBN2AN1MX">Reuters reported</a> that Starboard could be looking to take over a majority of the board seats when the company board meets in June. That could have set them up to take some action, most likely forcing a sale.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="voIpvT2YUd"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/box-acquires-esignature-startup-signrequest-for-new-content-workflows/">Box acquires e-signature startup SignRequest for new content workflows</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Box acquires e-signature startup SignRequest for new content workflows&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/box-acquires-esignature-startup-signrequest-for-new-content-workflows/embed/#?secret=voIpvT2YUd" data-secret="voIpvT2YUd" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While it&#8217;s not clear what will happen now, it seems likely that with this cash, they will be able to stave off action from Starboard, and with KKR in the picture be able to take a longer term view. Box CEO Aaron Levie sees the move as a vote of confidence from KKR in Box&#8217;s approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;KKR is one of the world’s leading technology investors with a deep understanding of our market and a proven track record of partnering successfully with companies to create value and drive growth. With their support, we will be even better positioned to build on Box’s leadership in cloud content management as we continue to deliver value for our customers around the world,&#8221; Levie said in a statement.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, John Park, Head of Americas Technology Private Equity at KKR, will be joining the Box board of directors. The company also announced that independent board member Bethany Mayer will be appointed chairman of the board, effective on May 1st.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/box-acquires-esignature-startup-signrequest-for-new-content-workflows/">bought e-signature startup SignRequest</a>, which could help open up a new set of workflows for the company as it tries to expand its market. With KKR&#8217;s backing, it&#8217;s not unreasonable to expect that Box, which is cash flow positive, could be taking additional steps to expand the platform in the future.</p>
<p>Box stock was down over 8% premarket, a signal that perhaps Wall Street isn&#8217;t thrilled with the announcement, but the cash influx should give Box some breathing room to reset and push forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Swag has a long and patchy history in the world of business. For every hip pair of plaid socks, there are five t-shirts you may never wear, an itchy scarf, a notepad your kids might use, and an ugly mug; and most of all, likely thousands of dollars and lots of time invested to make those presents a reality. Now, a startup that has built a service to rethink the concept behind corporate gifts and make them more effective is today announcing a round of funding to continue expanding its business &#8212; and one sign that it may be on to something is its progress so far.</p>
<p><a href="https://alyce.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alyce</a>, a Boston startup that has built an AI platform that plugs into various other apps that you might use to interact and track your relationships with others in your working life &#8212; sales prospects, business partners, colleagues &#8212; and then uses the information to personalise gift recommendations for those people, has raised $30 million, a Series B that it will be using to continue building out its platform, signing up more users, and hiring more people for its team.</p>
<p>This round is being led by General Catalyst, with Boston Seed Capital, Golden Ventures, Manifest, Morningside and Victress Captial &#8212; all previous backers &#8212; also participating.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alyce says that it has grown 300% year-over-year between 2019 and 2020, tackling a corporate gifting and promotional items industry that ASI Market Research estimates is worth around $24.7 billion annually. Its customers today include Adobe&#8217;s Marketo, G2, Lenovo, Wex, Invision, DialPad, GrubHub, and 6Sense.</p>
<p>As with so many other apps and services that aim at productivity and people management, Alyce notes that this year of working remotely &#8212; which has tested many a relationship and job function, led to massive inbound and outbound digital activity (the screen is where everything gets played out now), and frankly burned a lot of us out &#8212; has given it also a new kind of relevance.</p>
<p>“As everyone was flooded with spam last year unsubscribing soared,&#8221; Greg Segall, founder and CEO of Alyce, said in a statement. &#8220;When a prospect opts out, that’s forever. It’s clear that both brands and customers crave the same thing &#8211; a much more purposeful and relatable way to engage.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alyce&#8217;s contribution to more quality engagement comes in the form of AI-fueled personalization.</p>
<p>Linking up with the other tools people typically use to track their communications with people &#8212; they include Marketo, Salesforce, Vidyard and Google&#8217;s email and calendar apps &#8212; the system has been built with algorithms that read details from those apps to construct some details about the preferences and tastes of the intended gift recipient. It then uses that to come up with a list of items that might appeal to that person from a <a href="https://help.alyce.com/article/111-what-types-of-gifts-can-i-give" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wider list that it has compiled</a>, with some 10,000 items in all. (And yes, these can also include more traditional corporate swag items like those socks or mugs.) Then, instead of sending an actual gift, &#8220;Swag Select&#8221;, as Alyce&#8217;s service is called, sends a gift code that lets the person redeem with his or her own choice from a personalised, more narrowed-down list of items.</p>
<p>Alyce itself doesn&#8217;t actually hold or distribute the presents: it connects up with third parties that send these out. (It <a href="http://alyce.com/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prices</a> its service based on how much it is used, and how many more tools a user might want to have to personalise and send out gifts.)</p>
<p>Yes, you might argue that a lot of this sounds actually very impersonal &#8212; the gift giver is not directly involved in the selection or sending of a present at all, which instead is &#8220;selected&#8221; by way of AI. Essentially, this is a variation of the personalization and recommendation technology that has been built to serve ads, suggest products to you on e-commerce sites, and more.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, it&#8217;s an interesting solution to the problem of trying to figure out what to get someone, which can be a challenge when you really know a person, and even harder when you don&#8217;t, while at the same time helping to create and fulfill a gesture that, at the end of the day, is about being thoughtful of them, not really the gift itself.</p>
<p>(You could also argue, I think, that since the gift lists are based on a person&#8217;s observations about the recipient, there is in fact some personal touches here, even if they have been run through an algorithmic mill before getting to you.)</p>
<p>And ultimately, the aim of these gifts is to say &#8220;thank you for this work relationship, which I appreciate&#8221;, or &#8220;please buy more printer paper from me&#8221; &#8212; not &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for being rude to you at dinner last night.&#8221; Although&#8230; if this works as it should, maybe there might well be an opportunity to extending the model to more use cases, for example brands looking for ways to change up their direct mail marketing campaigns, or yes, people who want to patch things up after a spat the night before.</p>
<p>Notably, for General Catalyst, it&#8217;s interested indeed in the bigger gifting category, pointing to the potential of how this service could be scaled in the future.</p>
<p>“At General Catalyst, we are proud to lead the latest round of funding for Alyce as the company has reimagined the gifting category with technology and impact. The ability to deliver products and experiences that both the giver and recipient feel good about is incredibly powerful,” said Larry Bohn, Managing Director at General Catalyst, in a statement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The once quiet world of seed investing became frenetic a few years ago as dedicated seed funds and angel networks increased in scale and velocity. That environment has now crescendoed into the present world of the seed capital hurricane: funds galore, solo capitalists splurging streams of rolling-capital dollars wherever they can find a cap table crevice, crowdfunding cash sloshing around — and in the eye of the storm are the founders looking to just snag a term sheet for their companies and get back to work.</p>
<p>Into that maelstrom comes <a href="https://www.indexventures.com">Index Ventures</a>, which today announced the close and launch of a new $200 million dedicated seed investing vehicle it’s dubbed Index Origin. The fund’s name pays homage to the firm’s long-standing commitment to seed and first-check investing, where it has backed companies as diverse as Robinhood, Figma, Deliveroo and Wise (aka <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/21/wise/">the rebranded TransferWise</a>) at the seed state.</p>
<p>“Our view is that seed investing is truly the essence of venture capital,” said Nina Achadjian, a partner at Index since 2020 who joined the firm as a principal in 2017. “It&#8217;s when you as an investor have to take the biggest leap of faith.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>She noted that the firm “in the last 18 months, I think we&#8217;ve made over almost 35 seed investments.” The new Index Origin fund would be a ramp up in terms of volume.</p>
<p>There’s extreme competition for cap tables at the earliest stages of startups today, and Index is focusing on a few offerings to maximize its sales pitch to founders.</p>
<p>The first emphasizes flexibility. Achadjian noted that there has been a sort of a devil’s bargain for founders on which type of funds to take at the seed stage. “Do you want a dedicated seed fund who is phenomenal at what they do, or do you want a multi-stage fund that might not have seed-specific resources but they can do a quick follow up [round],” she asked rhetorically. “There hasn&#8217;t really been the right product in the market to help founders have the best of both worlds, and so that was kind of our inspiration for Index Origin.”</p>
<p>Fitting its multi-stage thesis, all Index partners can write seed checks out of the new fund and they can invest in any vertical of interest to them in any geography (primarily the United States and Europe although it’s not explicitly limited to those markets). Achadjian noted that since the firm can potentially double down on later-stage rounds, the fund is more flexible in working with other firms, angels, and the whole coterie of funders at the seed stage.</p>
<p>That solves the capital component. As for providing more dedicated resources for seed founders, Index is offering a trilogy of programs to make it easier to scale businesses. They include a “First Hires” program designed to help with early hires at startups; an Early Adopter Network to help companies connect with potential design customers to find and accelerate product-market fit; and finally, The Index Network, an expert network of specialists (think DevOps, SalesOps, or technical architecture) that startup founders can consult on when they run into roadblocks. These programs and the seed fund writ large will have a dedicated team to help find and grow seed-stage companies.</p>
<p>“Our philosophy has been: we never say it&#8217;s too early for Index,” Achadjian said.</p>
<p>Part of the impetus for these new programs is the diverging mix of founders that have started companies in recent years. “We&#8217;ve actually found that a lot of founders, they used to have technical backgrounds, but in the last couple of years, it&#8217;s shifted to more business-background founders,” she said. That has meant helping these founders find technical talent and building up a network of technical expertise to help them grow.</p>
<p>Secondly, Index wants to increase the diversity of founders in its investment pipeline. “That&#8217;s another driver for why we wanted to do seed, because it gives us a broader access to the very, very top of funnel,” Achadjian explained. “I think if you want to make an impact for diversity, that&#8217;s actually the stage where you can make the biggest impact.”</p>
<p>Index’s approach matches that of Sequoia, which <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/02/25/sequoia-capital-raises-195-million-for-its-newest-seed-fund/">announced earlier this year</a> that it raised $195 million for a seed fund, also focused on the U.S. and Europe. Most other firms in the multi-stage investing game tuck seed bets inside their early-stage funds, rather than creating standalone investing vehicles. With potentially dozens of checks to write in the coming months, expect to see Index bring even more activity into the white-hot seed market.</p>
<p><em>Update: April 8, 2021: Updated the date Achadjian joined Index.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With the pandemic sending the planet indoors to workout, the at-home fitness market has boomed. It was only in October last year that three-year-old <a href="https://www.future.co/">Future</a> closed $24 million in Series B and <a href="https://playbookapp.io/">Playbook</a> (streaming for personal trainers) raised $9.3 million in a Series A. Into this market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/fab-founder-jason-goldberg-is-back-with-moxie-a-new-live-streaming-fitness-marketplace/">launched</a> <a href="https://moxie.xyz/">Moxie</a>, a platform that allowed fitness instructors to broadcast live and recorded classes, access licensed music playlists and deploy a CRM and payment tools. Classes range from $5-$25 and various subscriptions and packages are offered.</p>
<p>Moxie has now raised a $6.3M &#8216;Seed+&#8217; funding round led by Resolute Ventures with participation from Bessemer Ventures, Greycroft Ventures, Gokul Rajaram, and additional investors. With the $2.1M Seed round from last October, that means Moxie has now raised a total of $8.4M.</p>
<p>With the funding, Moxie now plans to better optimize the user experience with a curated selection of top Moxie classes; new tools that help connect users to instructors; and the ability to preview classes before attending.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company claims to have experienced &#8220;exponential growth” because of its convenience in the pandemic era, with 8,000 classes and 1 million class-minutes completed in March. Moxie’s independent instructors set their own schedules and prices, and get to keep 85% of what they earn on the platform.</p>
<p>The company will also now launch &#8216;Moxie Benefits&#8217; in partnership with Stride Health, provide instructors with access to health insurance, dental and vision plans, life insurance, and other benefits.</p>
<p>Also planned is &#8216;Moxie Teams’, enabling groups of instructors to join together to form small businesses on the platform, not unlike the way some Uber drivers form teams.</p>
<p>Jason Goldberg, CEO and founder said in a statement: “Moxie was born during the pandemic alongside thousands of independent fitness instructors who were forced out of gyms and studios and suddenly had to become entrepreneurs and navigate the new frontier of virtual fitness. Now we are seeing widespread adoption of online fitness into people&#8217;s lives, and Moxie’s growth proves that these shifts in consumer behavior have staying power. We know that 89% of Moxie users plan to continue virtual workouts post COVID — they love the convenience.”</p>
<p>Resolute Ventures Partner &amp; Co-Founder Raanan Bar-Cohen said: “Our investment theory has always been to identify entrepreneurial founders solving for today’s problems. With Moxie, we saw an experienced operator in Jason, with a product that solved for the issues that instructors and consumers had experienced in the shift to online fitness, as well as a clear roadmap for continued success.”</p>
<p>So why has Moxie managed to cleave to the new virtual workout culture? Goldberg tells me it’s down to a range of factors.</p>
<p>For starters, it’s a two-sided fitness marketplace that has live interactive group fitness classes, unlike VOD apps, and, crucially, unlike Peloton. Additionally, any instructor can teach on Moxie, rather than wait to be picked as a ‘star&#8217; by Peloton. Since 90% of classes are live group fitness classes, they are effectively replacing yoga studios and HIIT classes, rather than personal training. He says many top instructors are now earning $6-figures on the platform.</p>
<p>Certainly, Moxie has managed to capitalize on the fact that while gyms are closed, it’s easy to do virtual classes. Will they still stick around when the pandemic is over? Presumably many will find it more convenient than schlepping to the gym and less intimidating than joining classes in person. Additionally, users can switch classes as easily as switching TV channels.</p>
<p>As Goldberg told me via email: &#8220;Covid forced everyone to try virtual fitness for the first time. Guess what? People found it more convenient and more connected than going to offline gyms. And guess what? Peloton is not for everyone.&#8221;</p>
