										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TechCrunch is embarking on a major new project to <a href="https://forms.gle/jCcVCV9TgRjqJcRZ7">survey</a> European founders and investors in cities <em>outside</em> the larger European capitals.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, we will ask entrepreneurs in these cities to talk about their ecosystems, in their own words.</p>
<p><strong>This is your chance to <a href="https://forms.gle/jCcVCV9TgRjqJcRZ7">put <strong>Delft, Eindhoven, Rotterdam, Utrecht</strong> on the Techcrunch Map</a>!</strong>. We covered Amsterdam <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/5-top-investors-in-dutch-startups-discuss-trends-hopes-and-2020-opportunities/">here</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>If you are a tech startup founder or investor in one of these cities please <a href="https://forms.gle/jCcVCV9TgRjqJcRZ7">fill out the survey form here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>We are particularly interested in hearing from women founders and investors.</p>
<p>This is the follow-up to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/the-great-techcrunch-survey-of-europes-vcs-be-featured-in-our-survey/">huge survey of investors</a> (see also below) we’ve done over the last six or more months, largely in capital cities.</p>
<p>These formed part of a broader series of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/extra-crunch/investor-surveys">surveys we’re doing regularly for ExtraCrunch</a>, our subscription service that unpacks key issues for startups and investors.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/put-your-city-on-the-tc-map-techcrunchs-european-cities-survey-2021/">first wave of surveys</a>, the cities we wrote about were largely capitals. You can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/put-your-city-on-the-tc-map-techcrunchs-european-cities-survey-2021/">see them listed here</a>.</p>
<p>This time, we will be surveying founders and investors in Europe’s other cities to capture how European hubs are growing, from the perspective of the people on the ground.</p>
<p>We’d like to know how your city’s startup scene is evolving, how the tech sector is being impacted by COVID-19, and generally how your city will evolve.</p>
<p>We leave submissions mostly unedited and are generally looking for at least one or two paragraphs in answers to the questions.</p>
<p><strong>So if you are a tech startup founder or investor in one of these cities please <a href="https://forms.gle/jCcVCV9TgRjqJcRZ7">fill out our survey form here</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for participating. If you have questions you can email <a href="mailto:mike@techcrunch.com">mike@techcrunch.com</a> and/or reply on Twitter to <a href="https://twitter.com/mikebutcher">@mikebutcher</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google today <a href="https://twitter.com/googleafrica/status/1387745594270265348">announced the launch</a> of 40,000 new developer scholarships in Africa. Google will offer the scholarships &#8212; created in partnership with tech talent companies <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/">Pluralsight</a> and <a href="https://andela.com/">Andela</a> &#8212;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to developers spread across mobile and cloud development tracks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the statement released by the company, Google will give full scholarships (with certifications in Android and cloud development) to the top 1,000 students (beginner and intermediate developers) at the end of the training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">took place from</span> a <span style="font-weight: 400;">virtual event,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was also detailed in the company&#8217;s <a href="https://africa.googleblog.com/2021/04/our-continued-commitment-to-helping.html">blog post</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company hosted key stakeholders in Africa&#8217;s tech ecosystem and &#8220;reviewed opportunities unfolding throughout the internet economy, paying special attention to the support of developers and startups in the region.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the opportunities presented to developers, Google announced the continuation of its accelerator program for African startups. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going into this year, the</span><a href="https://startup.google.com/accelerator/africa/#accelerator-programs"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Google for Startups Accelerator program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will be hosting its sixth cohort</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three-month program </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to start on June 21; applications are open until May 14</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A virtual affair, this cohort will be a continuation of how the previous cohort panned out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Last year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the first virtual class of</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Google for Startups Accelerator Africa</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">was launched</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was the first all-online iteration of Google’s accelerator program for Africa and saw 20 startups from seven countries undergo a 12-week virtual journey to redefine their offering while receiving mentoring and attending workshops,&#8221; said Onajite Emerhor, head of Google for Startups Accelerator Africa in a statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This year, with the 6th cohort, we want to continue to play our part by supporting developers and startups within the Africa tech ecosystem, ensuring they get all the access and support necessary to see them continue to grow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Formerly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> known as Google Launchpad Accelerator, Google for Startups Accelerator Africa has worked with up to 50 startups across 17 African countries. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020, it selected <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/06/18/20-startups-selected-for-class-5-of-google-for-startups-accelerator-africa/">20 startups into the program</a> (eight from Nigeria, six from Kenya, two from South Africa and one each from Ghana, Tunisia, Ethiopia and Zimbabwe)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It expects to also select startups from additional countries, including Egypt, Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda, for this sixth cohort</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The growth of entrepreneurship is crucial, especially in the African context. African developers and startups play a critical role in the transformation of the African economy, creating new opportunities and paving the way for the economic and social development on the continent that we want to see. We recognize Africa’s exceptional digital potential, and that is why Google </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is committed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to providing this critical support for African startups,” says Nitin Gajria, managing director of Google Sub-Saharan Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Developer communities remain one of the most vital aspects of Google&#8217;s operations in the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It currently has more than 120 communities across 25 African countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Besides the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced scholarship program and other communities like Google Developer Groups and Developer Student Clubs, Google has provided an intersection between developers and other tech players by building a Google Developers Space in Nigeria.</span></p>

<p>This is the particular flavor of content, rich in key insights and tactical advice for founders, that goes down on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/ecl/">Extra Crunch Live</a>.</p>
<p>In an upcoming episode on Wednesday, May 19, we&#8217;ll sit down with Sequoia&#8217;s Shaun Maguire and Vise CEO and co-founder Samir Vasavada.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Maguire focuses on enterprise, fintech and frontier technology for Sequoia. His portfolio companies include AMP Robotics, Knowde, Physna and Vise. He joined Sequoia in 2019, before which he was a partner at GV, where he led investments in Stripe, Opendoor, IonQ, SpinLaunch, Lambda School, Dandelion Energy, Clutter and Mode and sourced the firm&#8217;s investment in Segment.</p>
<p>Maguire has also been an entrepreneur in his own right, co-founding Expanse (a cybersecurity company), which was ultimately acquired by Palo Alto Networks for more than $800 million.</p>
<p>If that weren&#8217;t enough, Maguire also spent two years working at DARPA, and was deployed to Afghanistan, participating on a team that earned a Joint Meritorious Unit Award from the U.S. Secretary of Defense.</p>

<p>Samir Vasavada co-founded Vise in 2016. Vise is an AI-powered investment management platform that aims to give independent financial advisors access to technology and tools to build and manage personalized portfolios for their clients, ultimately giving those advisors more time and energy to spend on the relationships.</p>
<p>Vise has raised upwards of $60 million.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk to Maguire and Vasavada about what brought them together, key tips for fundraising and how to be successful in the fintech space, and ask about the next great opportunity in fintech.</p>
<p>On the second half of the episode, Maguire and Vasavada will put on their feedback hats and listen to live elevator pitches from the audience as part of the ECL Pitch-off. Folks attending the event will be able to raise their hand and pitch their startup to the VC/founder duo, and then answer their questions and get their feedback.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In addition to Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/">Clubhouse competitor built within Messenger Rooms</a> and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/facebook-tests-hotline-a-qa-product-thats-a-mashup-of-clubhouse-and-instagram-live/">experiments with a Clubhouse-like Q&amp;A platform</a> on the web, the company is now leveraging yet another of its largest products to take on the Clubhouse threat: Instagram Live. Today, Instagram announced it&#8217;s adding new features that will allow users to mute their microphones and even turn their video off while using Instagram Live.</p>
<p>Instagram explains these new features will give hosts more flexibility during their livestream experiences, as they can decrease the pressure to look or sound a certain way while broadcasting live. While that may be true, the reality is that Facebook is simply taking another page from Clubhouse&#8217;s playbook by enabling a &#8220;video off&#8221; experience that encourages more serendipitous conversations.</p>
<p>When people don&#8217;t have to worry about how they look, they&#8217;ll often be more amenable to jumping into a voice chat. In addition, being audio-only allows creators to engage with their community while multitasking &#8212; perhaps they&#8217;re doing chores or moving around, and can&#8217;t sit and stare right at the camera. To date, this has been one of the advantages about using Clubhouse versus live video chat. You could participate in Clubhouse&#8217;s voice chat rooms without always having to give the conversation your full attention or worrying about background noise.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For the time being, hosts will not be able to turn on or off the video or mute others in the livestream, but Instagram tells us it&#8217;s working on offering more of these types of capabilities to the broadcaster, and expects to roll them out soon.</p>
<p>Instagram notes it tested the new features publicly earlier this week during <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/COLhAulnD_6/">an Instagram Live</a> between Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first feature Instagram has added in recent weeks to lure the creator community to its platform instead of Clubhouse or other competitors. In March, Instagram rolled out the option for creators to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/instagram-launches-live-rooms-for-live-broadcasts-with-up-to-four-creators/">host Live Rooms that allow up to four people to broadcast</a> at the same time. The Rooms were meant to appeal to creators who wanted to host live talk shows, expanded Q&amp;As, and more &#8212; all experiences that are often found on Clubhouse. It also added the ability for fans to buy badges to support the hosts, to cater to the needs of professional creators looking to monetize their reach.</p>
<p>Although Instagram parent company Facebook already has a more direct Clubhouse clone in development with Live Audio Rooms on Facebook and Messenger, the company said it doesn&#8217;t expect it <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/bringing-social-audio-experiences-to-facebook/">to launch into testing until this summer.</a> And it will first be available to Groups and public figures, not the broader public.</p>
<p>Instagram Live&#8217;s new features, meanwhile, are rolling out to Instagram&#8217;s global audience on both iOS and Android starting today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I don&#8217;t think Jim Belushi was high while we talked on Zoom this week. Instead of a joint, he was puffing on a cigar, but he was still happy and smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have my brother&#8217;s face on it. I have the Blues Brothers brand. It&#8217;s got to be good shit, man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Belushi was telling me about his weed, specifically about the small 0.7 gram pre-rolls he sells — the perfect size for the post-Covid era, when passing a joint to a friend is likely discouraged. Belushi started his farm with 48 cannabis plants in 2015. Now, six years and one pandemic later, there are 200 plants in each of his four high-tech greenhouses along the Rogue River in southern Oregon.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always chasing magic,&#8221; Belushi said.</p>
<p>We were talking about his new greenhouses supplied in part by <a href="https://growgeneration.com">GrowGeneration</a>, but Belushi cannot stop gushing about the benefits of cannabis. More than just a celebrity with a weed brand, Belushi is a fully-committed cannabis advocate.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s magic when I do the Blues Brothers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I chase magic on a film set when I&#8217;m acting, and chase magic when I&#8217;m singing. I mean, I&#8217;m always chasing magic, and I&#8217;m going to do this cannabis business because there&#8217;s magic here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Belushi is among a recent group of celebrities diving deep into the world of cannabis. And he&#8217;s not shy about it. Look at his social media footprint. Belushi&#8217;s Twitter name is &#8216;<a href="https://twitter.com/JimBelushi">Cannabis Farmer: Jim Belushi</a>&#8216;. His <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@belushisfarm">TikTok</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jim_belushi/?hl=en">Instagram</a> feeds are full of clips from his farm. He even has a TV series on Discovery about his farm: &#8220;Growing Belushi.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cannabis is Belushi&#8217;s life right now. He even recently turned down a movie role because filming would take place in the fall, during harvest time. His agent didn&#8217;t approve of passing on the opportunity, and told Belushi he represents actors, not farmers. But according to Jim, cannabis farming is more important than acting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a cross between Elmer Fudd and Bill Murray,&#8221; Belushi confesses. Like Murray in <em>Caddyshack</em>, Belushi is just good enough to be dangerous. According to Belushi, he&#8217;s been on the farm more than 200 days during the last year. In his eyes, this is what sets his apart from other celebrity cannabis operations.</p>
<p>Growing cannabis is more than a branding play for Belushi. It&#8217;s clear he&#8217;s not just trading his credibility and body of work for a hefty check; he&#8217;s on the farm, working the land, and tending to the bud he&#8217;s dealing.</p>
<p>&#8220;My hand is in the soil,&#8221; he said, explaining he works the land, ensuring the pH is correct, and that the soil is at the right temperature. He&#8217;s curing, smelling, testing, and tasting his crop.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, my name is on it, my brother&#8217;s name is on it, and I&#8217;m not just throwing it out there,&#8221; Belushi said. &#8220;I&#8217;m really farming, and I&#8217;m loving this profession.&#8221;</p>

<h2><strong>Helping Mother Nature</strong></h2>
<p>Like many cultivators, Belushi turned to technology to combat pests and increase yields. A team from GrowGeneration outfitted his farm with the goods to mitigate pests and improve the quality. He says what they were selling for $1,000 a pound a year ago is now going for $2,200 a pound, and points to the improved growing facility as a significant factor.</p>
<p>Jeremy Corrao, VP of Commercial Operations at GrowGeneration, says the cannabis industry benefits from a range of new technologies that enable operators to see a faster return on their investments. He points to new lighting technology as an example.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing the most movement in people moving from energy-inefficient solutions into energy-efficient solutions,&#8221; Corrao said, explaining that the industry still has doubters who are hesitant of new technology. Yet, he says it&#8217;s lowering the cost of goods and improving ROI.</p>
<p>Corrao explains that functions and practices found throughout the agriculture industry are finally making their way to cannabis cultivators such as Belushi.</p>
<p>Yet even with new greenhouses complete with automated systems, some growers like Jim Belushi still rely on nature for help.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Belushi Farm] is in Southern Oregon with 192 days of sun,&#8221; Belushi said, stressing his love for the area. Moreover, his new greenhouses rely on the Oregon sun and still offer localized climate control, and pest management, which means he can have four growth cycles per year. This hybrid approach forgoes a closed climate system in favor of something that works within Belushi&#8217;s world.</p>

<p>As legalization draws closer, cultivators are constantly look for an edge amid more competition &#8212; better soil, quicker harvest cycles, new strains &#8212; and Belushi has his name.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has the Belushi name always been associated with pot?&#8221; I ask Jim. I&#8217;m thinking back to the days of his departed brother, John Belushi, the always-on, always-authentic star of the 1970&#8217;s and &#8217;80s. After all, substances were imbibed, smoked, and regularly snorted in those days, and John Belushi was a manic presence in much of 1980s comedy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not pot, but fun&#8221;, he says after some thought. Jim gives credit to his brother John for starting the Belushi brand in 1975. To him, the Belushi brand represents &#8220;trying to make people feel good with a sense of humor or entertainment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Look at the brands from Belushi Farm: Blues Brothers, Belushi&#8217;s Secret Stash, and Captain Jack, named after the O.G. weed dealer of the early days of Saturday Night Live. Each of these brands offers strains true to Jim Belushi&#8217;s perspective on his name, too. There&#8217;s hardly anything offered with THC levels that would be considered gas (aka, stuff that gets you really high), but each offers respectable characteristics. That&#8217;s by design.</p>
<p>&#8220;My stuff has more to do with great blends of terpenes and THC,&#8221; Belushi said. &#8220;[This is] to create more of a medicinal effect that sends someone on a pathway to healing.&#8221; He added, laughingly, he has a couple of strains hasn&#8217;t smoked. He&#8217;s scared of them. Likewise, he looks at some of the strains offered by other celebrities as ready to rip and roar thanks to sky-high levels of THC. He hasn&#8217;t tried those either.</p>
<p>I ask why he thinks it&#8217;s exciting and newsworthy when celebrities launch a cannabis brand. Belushi is hardly the only one doing it. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg j<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/cannabis-banking-act-passes-u-s-house-with-bipartisan-support/">ust launched Houseplant in the U.S.</a>, a cannabis brand offering dried flower and house goods. There&#8217;s Jay-Z with his upscale cannabis brand, Monogram. Even Martha Stewart is hawking cannabis, albeit in CBD gummy form.</p>
<p>Belushi is hesitant to compare his product to his celebrity competitors (probably related to his self-identification as a cultivator), but points to Snoop and Willy&#8217;s original celebrity pot brands as paving the way for him and others.</p>
<h2><strong>The failed war on drugs</strong></h2>
<p>New regulations are quickly changing the cannabis industry. As more states decriminalize and regulate cannabis, different industry segments are looking to the federal government to loosen its hold on the cannabis business.</p>
<p>For Belushi, access to traditional banking services would immediately impact him and the industry as a whole. And it could be coming soon: Two weeks ago, the U.S. House of Representatives <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/cannabis-banking-act-passes-u-s-house-with-bipartisan-support/">passed a banking bill with broad bipartisan support</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a very exciting time in the cannabis world,&#8221; Belushi said. &#8220;People have seen changes in others [who partake in cannabis]. Tumors are shrinking, seizures are stopping, people are sleeping, and people are getting better. It&#8217;s interesting because, no matter if you&#8217;re conservative or liberal or old or young, everybody knows someone that has suffered deeply.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cannabis is not a gateway to drugs,&#8221; Belushi said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pathway to healing.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet, there are countless individuals in prison because of this so-called pathway to healing. Jim Belushi is working on that, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get them out,&#8221; Jim shouted when I talked about the Last Prisoner Project&#8217;s current goals. He&#8217;s referring to those incarcerated for crimes involving cannabis. To Belushi, who helps the cannabis activist group, this is a serious effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time to shift some energy to real justice,&#8221; Belushi said with deep passion. &#8220;Look at the Last Prisoner Project. It&#8217;s really a symbol that the war on drugs is over. It&#8217;s done. It&#8217;s ruined. The war on drugs ruined us. It ruined black and brown communities, which were especially hard hit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get me started,&#8221; Belushi warned, as he laughed and calmed down.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.lastprisonerproject.org">Last Prisoner Project</a> was founded in 2019 by Steve DeAngelo and seeks cannabis criminal justice reform. The organization is made up of activists, attorneys, advocates, and others, including Belushi, who is an advisor. It&#8217;s clear he has a deep respect for the Last Prisoner Project&#8217;s founder and leader, Steve DeAngelo. &#8220;There&#8217;s no better hustler in the world than Steve DeAngelo,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Man, he&#8217;s just relentless, and it&#8217;s beautiful to watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Belushi says the project is riding a wave right now, and they&#8217;re finding more states&#8217; Attorneys General are answering their calls. But there are still needs, he says. The project can always use capital, as a lot of the work is done pro bono. And there&#8217;s a constant need for people to write letters and sign petitions &#8212; all of which are readily available on the project&#8217;s website <a href="https://www.lastprisonerproject.org/take-action">here</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it would be great if people in the [cannabis] industry hire those that get out,&#8221; Belushi said, calling on the industry to lean in and help &#8220;these men and women who have been incarcerated for so long.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s not just suggesting it as a course of action for others; he&#8217;s actively helping raise capital, too. The Blues Brothers is hosting a fundraiser at M.J. Unpacked this coming October in Las Vegas. Belushi, actor, comedian, weed farmer, and now a member of the Blues Brothers beamed as he spoke about performing for the Last Prisoner Project.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re gonna have a big party there,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and we&#8217;re going to raise lots of funds, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because everybody needs someone to love.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Australian security software house Click Studios has told customers not to post emails sent by the company about its data breach, which allowed malicious hackers to push a malicious update to its flagship enterprise password manager Passwordstate to steal customer passwords.</p>
<p>Last week, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/passwordstate-click-studios-password-manager-breach/">told customers</a> to &#8220;commence resetting all passwords&#8221; stored in its flagship password manager after the hackers pushed the malicious update to customers over a 28-hour window between April 20-22. The malicious update was designed to contact the attacker’s servers to retrieve malware designed to steal and send the password manager’s contents back to the attackers.</p>
<p>In an email to customers, Click Studios did not say how the attackers compromised the password manager&#8217;s update feature, but included a link to a security fix.</p>
<p>But news of the breach only became public after after Danish cybersecurity firm CSIS Group published a <a href="https://www.csis.dk/newsroom-blog-overview/2021/moserpass-supply-chain/">blog post</a> with details of the attack hours after Click Studios emailed its customers.</p>
<p>Click Studios claims Passwordstate is used by “more than 29,000 customers,” including in the Fortune 500, government, banking, defense and aerospace, and most major industries.</p>
<p>In an update on its website, Click Studios said in <a href="https://clickstudios.com.au/advisories/default.aspx">a Wednesday advisory</a> that customers are &#8220;requested not to post Click Studios correspondence on Social Media.&#8221; The email adds: &#8220;It is expected that the bad actor is actively monitoring Social Media, looking for information they can use to their advantage, for related attacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is expected the bad actor is actively monitoring social media for information on the compromise and exploit. It is important customers do not post information on Social Media that can be used by the bad actor. This has happened with phishing emails being sent that replicate Click Studios email content,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>Besides a <a href="https://clickstudios.com.au/advisories/default.aspx">handful of advisories</a> published by the company since the breach was discovered, the company has refused to comment or respond to questions.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also not clear if the company has disclosed the breach to U.S. and EU authorities where the company has customers, but where data breach notification rules obligate companies to disclose incidents timely. Companies can be fined up to 4% of their annual global revenue for falling foul of Europe&#8217;s GDPR rules.</p>
<p>Click Studios chief executive Mark Sandford has not responded to repeated requests for comment by TechCrunch. Instead, TechCrunch received the same canned autoresponse from the company&#8217;s support email saying that the company&#8217;s staff are &#8220;focused only on assisting customers technically.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch emailed Sandford again on Thursday for comment on the latest advisory, but did not hear back.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.ibm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBM</a> today made another acquisition to deepen its reach into providing enterprises with AI-based services to manage their networks and workloads. It announced that it is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-to-acquire-turbonomic-building-industrys-most-comprehensive-aiops-capabilities-for-hybrid-cloud-301280441.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquiring Turbonomic</a>, a company that provides tools to manage application performance (specifically resource management), along with Kubernetes and network performance &#8212; part of its bigger strategy to bring more AI into IT ops, or as it calls it, AIOps.</p>
<p>Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but according to data in PitchBook, Turbonomic was valued at nearly $1 billion &#8212; <a href="https://my.pitchbook.com/profile/53000-02/company/profile#insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$963 million, to be exact</a> &#8212; in its last funding round in <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170123005625/en/GE-CIO-Gary-Reiner-Joins-Turbonomic-Board" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September 2019</a>. A report in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turbonomics-m-a-ibm-exclusive-idUSKBN2CG1VB">Reuters</a> rumoring the deal a little earlier today valued it at between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. A source tells us the figure is accurate.</p>
<p>The Boston-based company&#8217;s investors included General Atlantic, Cisco, Bain, Highland Capital Partners, and Red Hat. The last of these, of course, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/09/ibm-closes-red-hat-acquisition-for-34-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now a part of IBM</a> (so it was theoretically also an investor), and together Red Hat and IBM have been developing a range of cloud-based tools addressing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/ibm-and-red-hat-expand-their-telco-edge-and-ai-enterprise-offerings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">telco, edge and enterprise use cases</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This latest deal will help extend that further, and it has more generally been an area that IBM has been aggressive in recently. Last November </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/ibm-is-acquiring-apm-startup-instana-as-it-continues-to-expand-hybrid-cloud-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IBM acquired another company called Instana</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> to bring application performance management into its stable, and it pointed out today that the Turbonomic deal will complement that and the two technologies&#8217; tools will be integrated together, IBM said.</span></p>
<p>Turbonomic&#8217;s tools are particularly useful in hybrid cloud architectures, which involve not just on-premise and cloud workloads, but workloads that typically are extended across multiple cloud environments. While this may be the architecture people apply for more resilience, reasons of cost, location or other practicalities, the fact of the matter is that it can be a challenge to manage. Turbonomic&#8217;s tools automate management, analyse performance, and suggest changes for network operations engineers to make to meet usage demands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Businesses are looking for AI-driven software to help them manage the scale and complexity challenges of running applications cross-cloud,&#8221; said Ben Nye, CEO, Turbonomic, in a statement. &#8220;Turbonomic not only prescribes actions, but allows customers to take them. The combination of IBM and Turbonomic will continuously assure target application response times even during peak demand.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bigger picture for IBM is that it&#8217;s another sign of how the company is continuing to move away from its legacy business based around servers and deeper into services, and specifically services on the infrastructure of the future, cloud-based networks.</p>
<p>&#8220;IBM continues to reshape its future as a hybrid cloud and AI company,&#8221; said Rob Thomas, SVP, IBM Cloud and Data Platform, in a statement. &#8220;The Turbonomic acquisition is yet another example of our commitment to making the most impactful investments to advance this strategy and ensure customers find the most innovative ways to fuel their digital transformations.&#8221;</p>
<p>A large part of the AI promise in the world of network operations and IT ops is how it will afford companies to rely more on automation, another area where IBM has been very active. (In a very different application of this technology &#8212; in business services &#8212; this month, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/ibm-acquires-italys-myinvenio-to-integrate-process-mining-directly-into-its-suite-of-automation-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired MyInvenio</a> in Italy to bring process mining technology in house.)</p>
<p>The promise of automation, meanwhile, is lower operation costs, a critical issue for managing network performance and availability in hybrid cloud deployments.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that AI-powered automation has become inevitable, helping to make all information-centric jobs more productive,&#8221; said Dinesh Nirmal, General Manager, IBM Automation, in a statement. &#8220;That&#8217;s why IBM continues to invest in providing our customers with a one-stop shop of AI-powered automation capabilities that spans business processes and IT. The addition of Turbonomic now takes our portfolio another major step forward by ensuring customers will have full visibility into what is going on throughout their hybrid cloud infrastructure, and across their entire enterprise.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Even as signs of hope for life after the pandemic have begun to emerge here in the U.S., increases in video game spending continue. There’s no doubt that much of last year’s big numbers were driven by stay-at-home requirements in much of the country and the world. All said, U.S. spending on the industry increased 27% for 2020.</p>
<p>There remains a broader question, however, around whether this momentum can maintain, as people start to, you know, leave the house more. For now, at least, things are continuing to look rosy for the industry. NPD noted this morning that U.S. spending on the category jumped 30% y-o-y for Q1 2021 to $14.92 billion.</p>
<p>When we break the number down a bit, however, it becomes clear that the driver goes beyond mere pandemic entertainment. Content was up 25% for the quarter, accessories jumped 42% and hardware went up 82%.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The motivator behind that last figure should be immediately obvious to anyone who follows the industry with any among of interest. Where Nintendo&#8217;s Switch dominated the conversation for most of 2020, Sony and Microsoft both launched their next gen consoles late-last year.</p>
<p>“While we are still seeing elevated rates of both engagement and spending resulting from changes in consumer behavior driven by the pandemic, we are also seeing cyclical gains from the November launches of both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles,” analyst Mat Piscatella said in a release The growth driven by these new platforms, combined with gains experienced in mobile, PC and VR content spending, as well as the continued strength of Nintendo Switch, have pushed the market to new highs.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The first three months of the year were the most valuable period for fintech investing, ever. Where did the fintech venture capital market push the most money in Q1, and why? Let's dig in.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While waiting for full first-quarter venture capital results for fintech startups to drop, we knew that they were going to be outsized. The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/there-have-never-been-more-100m-fintech-rounds-than-right-now/">previously explored</a> the pace at which huge venture rounds were invested into the startup niche, noting that by mid-March the fintech market had already recorded a record number of $100 million rounds.</p>
<p>But the largest venture capital rounds are only part of the fintech investing picture, so we were looking forward to getting a deeper look into what happened in the critical startup sector more generally. We’ve now got the data, so today we’re digging in with both hands.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Per a <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/fintech-trends-q1-2021/">CB Insights compilation of Q1 2021 fintech venture capital data</a> from around the world, the first three months of the year were the most valuable period for fintech investing, ever. Somewhat shockingly, the first quarter beat the infamous second quarter of 2018, when Ant Group <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/07/ant-financial-raises-14-billion/">raised a $14 billion round</a>, so skewing the category’s longitudinal data that some analyst groups simply discount it for analytical purposes.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t necessary this time: The 614 tracked fintech deals in Q1 were worth a total of $22.8 billion, per the report, enough to set an all-time high, Ant Group be damned. Per CB Insights, the quarter’s fintech VC deal volume rose a modest 15% compared to the year-ago quarter, while VC dollar volume in the sector shot 98% higher over the same interval.</p>

We&#8217;re also going to chat sub-sectors in the fintech world, parsing where there’s the most venture activity to track, and, critically, where VCs are pushing &#8212; or pulling back &#8212; their attention and capital.</p>
<p>So, where did the fintech venture capital market push the most money in the first quarter, and why? We’ll be chatting data as we go, but The Exchange also enlisted VCs from three continents who have made fintech investments to help provide context: We’ll hear from <a href="https://twitter.com/jwedler?lang=en">Jesse Wedler</a>, a partner at <a href="https://www.capitalg.com/">CapitalG</a> based in North America; <a href="https://twitter.com/kola_aina?">Kola Aina,</a> a general partner at <a href="http://www.venturesplatform.com/">Ventures Platform</a> based in Africa; and<a href="https://twitter.com/shiyankoh"> Shiyan Koh</a>, a general partner at <a href="https://www.hustlefund.vc/">Hustle Fund</a> based in Asia.</p>
<p>Let’s talk a few key fintech numbers, and then rip into venture results by geography and focus.</p>
<h2>Huge checks, myriad exits</h2>
<p>While we’re looking beyond the largest checks today to get a more holistic perspective on the state of the fintech venture capital world, we cannot discount them. So, briefly, what matters from the mega-round space, or the funding category of rounds worth nine figures and more? Some 57 were raised by fintech startups around the world in the first quarter, or about 4.5 per week. That number was 30 in Q4 2020, and just 21 in Q1 2020.</p>
<p>The first quarter’s 57 mega-deals were worth a huge 69% of total venture capital in the fintech space during the quarter. Don’t be shocked by that figure; a single mega-round can add up to the value of 50 seed deals pretty easily.</p>
<p>The huge results should also not be a complete surprise, CapitalG’s Wedler told TechCrunch in an email, as “the reality is that fintech has been a hot category for years.” What could be driving the recent acceleration in capital disbursement into financial technology startups? Wedler mused it&#8217;s a combination of “the ubiquity of smartphones and the modern internet, the development of modern cloud technology, and advancements in APIs and modular services.&#8221;<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following November&#8217;s overhaul of Google Pay, which saw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/google-pay-gets-a-major-redesign/">the service expanding into personal finance</a>, the company today is rolling out a new set of features aimed at making Google Pay more a part of its users&#8217; everyday lives. With an update, Google Pay will now include new options for grocery savings, paying for public transit, and categorizing their spending.</p>
<p>Through partnerships with Safeway and Target, Google Pay users will now be able to browse their store&#8217;s weekly circulars that showcase the latest deals. Safeway is bringing over 500 stores to the Google Pay platform, and Target stores nationwide will offer a similar feature. Google Pay users will be able to favorite the recommended deals for later access. And soon, Google Pay will notify you of the weekly deals when you&#8217;re near a participating store, if location is enabled.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2145718" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2145718" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2145718" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image1_Xm4fzNb.max-1000x1000-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image1_Xm4fzNb.max-1000x1000-1.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image1_Xm4fzNb.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image1_Xm4fzNb.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image1_Xm4fzNb.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image1_Xm4fzNb.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image1_Xm4fzNb.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image1_Xm4fzNb.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image1_Xm4fzNb.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image1_Xm4fzNb.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image1_Xm4fzNb.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2145718" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Another update expands Google Pay&#8217;s transit features, which already today support buying and using transit tickets across over 80 cities in the U.S. New additions arriving soon now include major markets, Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area. This follows Apple Pay&#8217;s recently added and much welcomed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/you-can-now-pay-for-bart-using-an-iphone-or-apple-watch/">support for the Bay Area&#8217;s Clipper card</a>. The company is also integrating with <a href="https://tokentransit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-onclick="{&quot;event&quot;:&quot;page interaction&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:&quot;in-article links&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;link click&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https://tokentransit.com/&quot;}">Token Transit</a> to expand transit support to smaller towns across the U.S.</p>
<p>Soon, the Google Pay app will also allow Android users to access transit tickets from the app&#8217;s homescreen through a &#8220;Ride Transit&#8221; shortcut. They can then purchase, add, or top up the balance on transit cards. Once purchased, you&#8217;ll be able to hold up your transit card to a reader &#8212; or show a visual ticket in the case there&#8217;s no reader.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2145717" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image2_YQao9EX.max-1000x1000-1.png?w=330" alt="" width="330" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image2_YQao9EX.max-1000x1000-1.png 485w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image2_YQao9EX.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=73,150 73w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image2_YQao9EX.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=146,300 146w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image2_YQao9EX.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=330,680 330w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image2_YQao9EX.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 330px) 100vw, 330px" /></p>
<p>The final feature is designed for those using Google Pay for managing their finances. With last year&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/google-pay-gets-a-major-redesign/">revamp</a>, Google partnered with 11 banks to launch a new kind of bank account it called Plex. A competitor to the growing number of mobile-only digital banks, Google&#8217;s app serves as the front-end to the accounts which are actually hosted by the partner banks, like Citi and Stanford Federal Credit Union.</p>
<p>As a part of that experience, Google Pay users will now gain better access into their spending behavior, balances, bills, and more via an &#8220;Insights&#8221; tab. Here, you&#8217;ll be able to see what your balance is, what bills are coming due, get alerts about larger transactions, and tracking spending by either category or business. As Google is now automatically categorizing transactions, that means you&#8217;ll be able to search for general terms (like &#8220;food&#8221;) as well as by specific business names (like &#8220;Burger King&#8221;), Google explains.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2145716" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2145716" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2145716" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image3_gezk4aR.max-1000x1000-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image3_gezk4aR.max-1000x1000-1.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image3_gezk4aR.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image3_gezk4aR.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image3_gezk4aR.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image3_gezk4aR.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image3_gezk4aR.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image3_gezk4aR.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image3_gezk4aR.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image3_gezk4aR.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image3_gezk4aR.max-1000x1000-1.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2145716" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>These features are a part of Google&#8217;s plan to use the payments app to gain access more data on users, who can then be targeted with offers from Google Pay partners.</p>
<p>When the redesigned app launched, users were<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/11/20/google-pay-app-opt-in-privacy/3772240001/"> asked to opt in to personalization features</a> which could help the app show users better, more relevant deals. While Google says it&#8217;s not providing your data directly to these third-party brands and retailers, the app provides a conduit for those businesses to reach potential customers at a time when the tracking industry is in upheaval over <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apples-privacy-changes-are-poised-to-boost-its-ad-products-11619485863">Apple&#8217;s privacy changes</a>. Google ability to help brands reach consumers through Google Pay could prove to be a valuable service, if the is able to grow its user base, and encourage more to opt in to the personalization features.</p>
<p>To make that happen, you can expect Google Pay to roll out more useful or &#8220;must have&#8221; features in the weeks to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The chance that I am ever willing to commute on a regular basis again in the future is zero. It&#8217;s too inefficient. And while workers and employers are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/12/09/how-the-coronavirus-outbreak-has-and-hasnt-changed-the-way-americans-work/">somewhat split</a> on where they stand on the question of remote toil, the COVID-19 pandemic has permanently shaken up the working world; we&#8217;re not going back to the pre-COVID normal.</p>
<p>To support what could be droves of workers sticking to distance-labor instead of returning to offices, <a href="https://www.firstbasehq.com/">Firstbase</a> is building a software-and-hardware solution to quickly get remote workers the tools and support they need. And today the company announced that it closed a $13 million Series A led by Andreessen Horowitz. B Capital Group and Alpaca VC also put capital into the round; TechCrunch first caught wind of Firstbase when it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/09/acceleprise-announces-26-saas-startups-from-its-trio-of-accelerators/">took part in an Acceleprise accelerator cohort</a> in mid-2020.</p>
<p>Notably Firstbase didn&#8217;t start with its current product focus. As is common amongst startups, it was born as something else entirely. With an original fintech bent, the company went remote back in 2018. But the experience wasn&#8217;t stellar, Firstbase co-founder and CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/chris_herd">Chris Herd</a> told TechCrunch. It was hard to get workers the technology they needed, and hard to get it back if they left the company, he explained.</p>
<p>Later, with the fintech effort low on capital and time, the company realized that some internal tech it had built to help support remote staff&#8217;s hardware and software needs might have broader application. Firstbase pivoted in late 2019, and by March of 2020 Herd told TechCrunch that his company had 600 companies on its waitlist. That number has since multiplied.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s product is two-fold. It&#8217;s a software service that help companies track, and manage their hardware assets that remote workers use. And it&#8217;s a hardware service that can pre-install software on hardware and ship it to employees, and provide remote IT support. Notably customers can either use Firstbase&#8217;s software alone, which they pay for on a SaaS basis, or both its software and hardware offerings.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;No one is talking about remote work from space&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/remote-work-space/embed/#?secret=vX2k331wXS" data-secret="vX2k331wXS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Firstbase has two sources of gross margin. Its software business will generate obvious software incomes, and the company can extract gross profit from its hardware business, Herd explained. The hardware part of the startup&#8217;s model appears more nascent than the software component. Firstbase only began onboarding customers last November, making it a yet-nascent startup that is allowed to still be figuring things out.</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Herd what it costs to kit out a remote worker today. He said that it varied, but could land between $2,000 and $5,000, though he added that Firstbase will allow customers to pay those costs over time as a series of flat payments.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s ahead for the company? Per its CEO, the merely ten-person company, three of whom are part time, would like to grow its staff by four or five-fold this year. And unsurprisingly, Firstbase intends to hew to its remote roots, meaning that it won&#8217;t be looking for workers in a single geographic region. Some of the staff it intends on hiring will be in its sales org, a focus that Herd mentioned during our interview. The company will also build out more enterprise-friendly software features with its new capital, allowing it to target larger customers.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see how far Firstbase can scale with its Series A. And if it gets pre-empted before the year ends.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.preshow.co">PreShow Interactive</a> is giving gamers a new way to earn in-game currency in exchange for watching ads — a concept that&#8217;s <a href="https://www.adjust.com/blog/understanding-rewarded-video-ads/">become familiar in mobile games</a> but hasn&#8217;t really made much headway on PCs or consoles.</p>
<p>The startup is led by MoviePass&#8217; founding CEO Stacy Spikes. When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/21/preshow-kickstarter/">I spoke to Spikes about PreShow two years ago</a>, he was beta testing an app that provided users with free movie tickets in exchange for watching ads. But obviously, theatrical moviegoing has taken a big hit in the past year.</p>
<p>Spikes told me yesterday that he&#8217;d always hoped to bring the PreShow concept to four categories — theatrical movies, gaming, subscription streaming and video on demand — but the pandemic forced the startup to shift focus more quickly than expected and explore what a gaming experience might look like.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The current plans is to launch a new PreShow Interactive app this summer, where viewers can connect their in-game accounts and identify how much virtual currency they want to earn. Then they watch a package of ads and PreShow will automatically transfer the currency to their account — in other words, it&#8217;s buying the currency for them.</p>
<p>Users will have to download a separate app to watch the ads and get the benefits, but Spikes said this is actually better than trying to integrate advertising or branded content into the game itself, which can be a slow process for the developer and the advertiser, while also being distracting for the players. And this means PreShow Interactive should able to support 20,000 games at launch, across PCs, consoles and virtual reality.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2145696" style="width: 346px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2145696" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2145696" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2.jpg?w=336" alt="PreShow Interactive" width="336" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2.jpg 701w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2.jpg?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2.jpg?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2.jpg?resize=336,680 336w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2.jpg?resize=25,50 25w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2145696" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> PreShow Interactive</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We just didn’t see the purpose of spending the time on integrations when it&#8217;s not really necessary,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Our deal is only with the consumer for their time. We&#8217;re saying, &#8216;This is your time. It has value.'&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the key elements to Preshow&#8217;s approach is technology that can detect when the viewer is actually looking at their phone screen — the ads will stop playing if you turn away. This has been criticized as <a href="https://gizmodo.com/moviepass-co-founders-new-startup-must-be-stopped-1833464132">&#8220;creepy surveillance tech,&#8221;</a> but Spikes claimed that early PreShow users have embraced it. He also argued that it&#8217;s more transparent than the data collection and targeting currently driving online advertising.</p>
<p>&#8220;We used to think data was the new oil, but now our feeling is that permission and engagement and attention is the new oil,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In addition to revealing its new strategy, PreShow is announcing that it has raised $3 million in seed funding led by Harlem Capital, with participation Canaan Partners, Wavemaker Ventures, Front Row Fund, ROC Fund, BK Fulton and Monroe Harris.</p>
<p>And to be clear, Spikes said PreShow isn&#8217;t abandoning theatrical movies. He said that the PreShow app will eventually offer both movie and gaming deals &#8220;under one roof,&#8221; but brands aren&#8217;t currently eager to advertise to moviegoers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re ready to go when the marketplace is ready to go,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Big raise this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/robotic-vision-startup-plus-one-raises-33m/">for Plus One Robotics.</a> The San Antonio-based company raised a healthy $33 million Series B, bringing its total funding above $40 million. The company mostly traffics in the warehouse and logistics space &#8212; obviously a category with a lot of excitement around it after last year’s massive shut down. As many companies have told me, most clients are simply looking for a way to help their footing in the competition against Amazon.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to its massive headcount and seemingly bottomless resources, the e-commerce giant has deployed a huge army of robots in its warehouse. Plus One, for its part, doesn’t make the robots, but rather the vision software that works with them. The company’s product is designed to work across a broad range of robotic arms and grippers, allowing workers to control up to 50 systems at once.</p>

<p>We’ve talked about exoskeletons quite a bit on these pages, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/roam-robotics-introduces-a-smart-knee-brace/">Roam offers</a> an interesting alternative to a number of bigger, bulkier and harder products on the market. The company’s latest device I liken to a standard knee brace, with AI and robotic capabilities that assist with movement. Specifically it helps with things like walking up stairs and standing up from a seated position.</p>

<p>And here we have a tiny tree man. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/disney-imagineerings-project-kiwi-is-free-walking-robot-that-will-make-you-believe-in-groot/">Project Kiwi</a> is kind of like Pinocchio if he really leaned into the whole wooden thing in the process of becoming a real boy. Obviously Disney’s going for the (sometimes) littlest Guardian of the Galaxy, Groot, for its latest extremely impressive animatronic.</p>

<p>A fun <a href="https://www.cit.cmu.edu/news-events/news/2021/04/16-robotic-tail.html">bit of research out of Carnegie Mellon</a> this week. The latest bit of biomimicry is a bit surprising. Obviously Cheetah has been a big inspiration for a number of quadrupedal robots (MIT in particular has a whole lot going in the Cheetah department). Specifically, though, the CMU researchers are looking at the big cat’s tail. Per CMU:</p>
<blockquote><p>The cheetah’s lightweight furry tail is known as an aerodynamic drag tail; that is, it acts sort of like a parachute. Most robotic tails have high inertia, but the cheetah manages to retain low inertia. Inertia is a physical quality that describes an object’s resistance to changes in motion — high tail inertia means the tail can apply high forces. Aerodynamic tails instead use a different principle — aerodynamic drag — to achieve high forces without a large inertia.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Every developer relies on environments like testing, staging and production as they build software, but building them can be a time-consuming operation. <a href="http://ReleaseHub.com">ReleaseHub</a>, an early stage startup that was part of the Y Combinator Winter 2020 cohort, wants to change that by providing a service to make environments available on demand.</p>
<p>Today, the company announced a $2.7 million seed, and also announced that service is generally available while they were at it. Sequoia led the round with participation from Y Combinator, Rogue VC, Liquid Capital and unnamed angel investors.</p>
<p>Company co-founder and CEO Tommy McClung says that every developer in the world has to use environments in their development workflow, but it remains for the most part a manual process.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;All of those environments are incredibly difficult to build. So the problem we&#8217;re solving is the ability to create those on demand. Instead of having to have a DevOps team that is responsible for managing, creating and maintaining them, the software does that and you can instantaneously create them,&#8221; McClung told me.</p>
<p>The service is integrated into GitHub and BitBucket, so you can build the environments on the fly as you need them based on templates for the various type. &#8220;The real value that we&#8217;re bringing to the table here is that we&#8217;re bringing that together in an almost virtualized way so that you can reproduce these environments on demand,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>McClung who has been working in technology for over 20 years says this is a problem he&#8217;s seen over and over again at the various companies he&#8217;s worked at over the years. After running engineering at TrueCar, his most recent company, he decided to build a startup to solve the problem once and for all.</p>

<p>He notes that this is the second time he&#8217;s been a YC company and while the size and scope of the operation has changed since he last participated in 2009, the process remains much the same. For starters, there were 20 companies involved back then and over 200 this time around, but he says by breaking it down into smaller groups, it helped create the same feel.</p>
<p>The company launched at the beginning of last year, and spent last year building the product and working with design partners and beta customers ahead of today&#8217;s release. The plan is to offer a subscription service where companies pay by the number of environments they create.</p>
<p>ReleaseHub currently has 10 employees including the three founders with plans to add more, especially engineers to help continue building out the solution and adding more layers of functionality. As he does this, McClung says bringing in a diverse group of employees is a priority for the founding team.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean I&#8217;ve been building companies for a long time and it has to be embedded into the DNA of the company at the very earliest stages, so making sure that you have diverse talent [from the start],&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He says the plan is to stay 100% remote even after offices open again. &#8220;We were forced into being remote and actually we made it work really well for us. You know in a lot of ways it&#8217;s advantageous for work-life balance,&#8221; he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More good news from a smartphone market currently rebounding from the far reaching impacts of the pandemic. New numbers from Canalys put global shipments for Q1 2021 at 27% above where they were the same time last year.</p>
<p>The industry was hit early and hit hard by Covid-19. The first quarter saw company running into serious supply chain issues as the pandemic first hit China and parts of Asia where most manufacturing occurs. Following that, demand began to slow, as fewer people were interested in buying mobile devices, coupled with broader economic and job impacts.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2145631" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2145631" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2145631" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-29.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-29.jpg 1250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-29.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-29.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-29.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-29.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/unnamed-29.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2145631" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Canalys</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Samsung continued to lead the way globally, with 76.5 million, up from 59.6 million, representing a 28% jump, year-over-year. In all, the company controls around 22% of global shipments (same as a year prior).</p>
<p>In second place, Apple represented the biggest jump of the quarter, with a 41% increase from 37.1 million to 52.4 million. That no doubt owes substantially to the big upgrades that arrived toward to the end of last year. Huawei’s struggles, meanwhile, have knocked the company out of the top five.</p>
<p>“Xiaomi is in pole position to be the new Huawei,” said Canalys’ Ben Stanton said in a release. “Its competitors offer superior channel margin, but Xiaomi’s sheer volume actually gives distributors a better opportunity to make money than rival brands. But the race is not over. Oppo and Vivo are hot on its heels, and are positioning in the mid-range in many regions to box Xiaomi in at the low end.”</p>
<p>The study also notes that LG’s exit from the category should mix things up a bit, as well, particularly in the Americas region, which accounted for 80% of the company’s sales last year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Origin seems very close to flying paying customers on its New Shepard sub-orbital rocket, having conducted a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/blue-origin-launches-and-lands-new-shepard-rocket-in-key-prep-flight-for-human-passengers/">dress rehearsal of astronaut loading and unloading</a> on its latest mission. Today, it also revealed that it will be selling the first ticket (tickets?) on board its inaugural commercial flight starting next week, on Wednesday, May 5.</p>
<p>The &#8216;when, and how much&#8217; are the two burning questions that remain around the Jeff Bezos-backed space company&#8217;s first commercial passenger flights. Blue Origin has been in the process of testing, developing and flight-certifying its spacecraft for human use for the past few years, and in its most recent missions the focus has squarely been on what are essentially finishing touches, like the aforementioned dress rehearsal, and a test of cabin comfort, communication and control features on a flight before that earlier this year.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve tried asking Blue Origin CEO Bob Smith about the cost of flights a number of times before, but he declined to provide specifics, beyond <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/blue-origins-passengers-will-pay-hundreds-of-thousands-of-dollars-for-a-ticket-on-new-shepard/">saying that it&#8217;ll be in the &#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of dollars range</a>. That&#8217;s not a surprising ticket price given the ride, which includes a trip to space in the reusable New Shepard capsule stage that allows passengers to spend multiple minutes totally weightless in zero gravity, with ample window real estate to take in the space-based perspective of Earth.</p>
<p>Blue Origin isn&#8217;t share much more right now about what we&#8217;ll see next week when it starts selling its first passenger capacity, but did say we can expect more details come Wednesday, so stay tuned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://eraseallkittens.com/">Erase All Kittens</a> (EAK) is an EdTech startup that created a ‘Mario-style’ web-based game designed for kids aged 8-12. However, the game has a twist: it places an emphasis on inspiring girls to code (since let’s face it, most coding tools are created by men). After reaching 160,000 players in over 100 countries, it’s now raised a $1M Seed funding led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/twinkl-ltd/">Twinkl Educational Publishing</a>, with participation from first investor Christian Reyntjens of the <a href="https://ablacksquare.com/">A Black Square</a> family office, alongside angel investors, including one of the founders of Shazam.</p>
<p>While the existing EAK game is free, a new game launched in July will be paid for, further boosting the product’s business model.</p>
<p>EAK says its research shows that some 55% of its players are girls, and 95% want to learn more about coding after playing its game. EAK is currently being used in over 3,000 schools, mostly in the UK and US, and its traction increased by 500% during the lockdowns associated with the pandemic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ePTL0QtKObM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;start=30&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>It’s Erase All Kittens’ contention that coding education tools for children have been largely built by men and so naturally appeal more to boys. With most teaching repetitive coding, in a very rigid, instructional way, it tends to appeal more to boys than girls, says EAK.</p>
<p>The female-founded team has a platform for changing the perception that kids, especially girls, have of coding. After R&amp;D of two years, it came up with a game designed to teach kids and girls as young as 8 skills such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript through highly gamified, story-driven gameplay. Kids get to chat with characters on their journey, for example, a serial entrepreneur unicorn mermaid called Tarquin Glitterquiff.</p>
<p>“Players edit the code that governs the game environment, building and fixing levels as they play in order to save kittens in a fantasy internet universe,” said  Dee Saigal, cofounder, CEO and creative director. Saigal is joined by co-founder Leonie Van Der Linde; CTO Rex Van Der Spuy; Senior Games Developer Jeremy Keen; and 2D Games Artist Mikhail Malkin.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2145642" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2145642" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Erase-All-Kittens-game.jpg" alt="Erase All Kittens game" width="1024" height="692" class="size-full wp-image-2145642" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Erase-All-Kittens-game.jpg 1039w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Erase-All-Kittens-game.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Erase-All-Kittens-game.jpg?resize=300,203 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Erase-All-Kittens-game.jpg?resize=768,519 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Erase-All-Kittens-game.jpg?resize=680,459 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Erase-All-Kittens-game.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2145642" class="wp-caption-text">Erase All Kittens game</p></div></p>
<p>The existing game teaches HTML skills and how to create URLs, and the new game (released in July this year) will teach HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills &#8211; bridging the huge gap between kids learning the concepts and being able to create on the web like developers.</p>
<p>Said Saigal: “We&#8217;re designing a coding game that girls genuinely love &#8211; one that places a huge emphasis on creativity. Girls can see instant results as they code, there are different ways to progress through the game, and learning is seamlessly blended with storytelling.”</p>
<p>Saigal said: “When I was younger I wanted to be a games designer. I loved coming up with ideas for games but coding had always seemed like an impossible task. We weren’t taught coding at school, and I couldn’t see anyone who looked like me making games, so I didn&#8217;t think it was something I could do.”</p>
<p>“Whilst researching our target audience, we found that one of the biggest obstacles for girls still begins with gender stereotypes from an early age. By the time girls reach school, this snowballs into a lack of confidence in STEM skills and lower expectations from teachers, which in turn can lead to lower performance—a gap that only widens as girls get older.”</p>
<p>EAK’s competitors include Code Kingdoms, Swift Playgrounds and CodeCombat. But Saigal says these games tend to appeal far more to boys than to girls.</p>
<p>The new game (see below) will be sold to schools and parents, globally. EAK will also be carrying out a one-for-one scheme, where for every school account purchased, one will be donated to underserved schools via partnerships with tech companies, educational organizations, and NGOs.</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/O4xsnMvGBnY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>Jonathan Seaton, Co-founder and CEO at Twinkl and Director of TwinklHive, said: “We’re really excited to partner with Erase All Kittens, as a digital company Twinkl recognizes the importance of preparing children to succeed in the digital age and we believe through this partnership we can really make a difference.”</p>
<p>“The team is particularly excited about helping further Erase All Kitten’s mission to empower girls and give them the same opportunities to learn to code and build their own digital creations. Ensuring that all children have equal access to opportunities to learn is at the heart of Twinkl’s vision and a key motivation in the development of this partnership for both organizations.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2145627" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2145627" loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GirlPlaying4.png" alt="Erase All Kittens" width="600" height="400" class="size-full wp-image-2145627" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GirlPlaying4.png 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GirlPlaying4.png?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GirlPlaying4.png?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GirlPlaying4.png?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2145627" class="wp-caption-text">Erase All Kittens</p></div></p>
<p>Erase All Kittens says it is addressing the global skills gap, where the gender gap is increasingly widening. According to PWC, just 24% of the tech workforce is female and women make up just 12% of all engineers, while only 3% of female students in the UK list tech as their first career choice.</p>
<p>Research by <a href="http://www.childwise.co.uk/">Childwise</a> found that 90% of girls give up on coding after first trying it, and if they lose interest in STEM subject by the age of 11, they never recover from that. This is a huge and growing problem for the tech industry and for investors.</p>

NYC is often choked and heated by smog from car pollution, but if it wants to achieve <a href="https://onenyc.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/achieve-carbon-neutrality-and-100-percent-clean-electricity/">carbon neutrality by 2050</a>, it&#8217;ll have to get comfortable with seeing more electric micromobility crop up.</p>
<p>Lime will be directly competing with the only other existing dockless e-moped operator in the city, Revel, which just announced the launch of an all-EV rideshare service. Lime&#8217;s initial geographic zones of operation will more or less match Revel&#8217;s map, which includes much of north Brooklyn, from Williamsburg, to Greenpoint and Brooklyn Heights, but which will also extend southeast to the Flatlands, according to a Lime spokesperson.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/lime-adds-shared-electric-mopeds-to-the-mix/">Lime also launched e-mopeds in Washington D.C. and Paris</a>. With each launch, Lime has stressed its commitment to rider and road user safety with features like AI-enabled helmet detection and license verification and a liveness test, which asks the rider to make various facial expressions into the camera when signing up in order to prove they&#8217;re a real person, rather than using a static photo of someone else. A spokesperson said Lime can also use the liveness test to match the rider to their driver&#8217;s license to ensure it&#8217;s the same person.</p>
<p>Lime also requires a mandatory rider education curriculum designed in consultation with the Motorcycle Safety Foundation, and its service is covered by <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/automobile-liability-insurance.asp#:~:text=Liability%20car%20insurance%20is%20the,property%20while%20operating%20a%20vehicle.&amp;text=The%20two%20components%20of%20liability,liability%20and%20property%20damage%20liability.">motor vehicle liability insurance</a>, which provides financial protection if a rider were to harm someone else or their property while driving, but not for the rider or rider&#8217;s property.</p>
<p>Competitor Revel learned the hard way to include such safety features. Last summer, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/27/electric-moped-startup-revel-returns-to-new-york-with-helmet-selfie-other-in-app-safety-features/">the company took its mopeds off the roads for a few weeks</a> following several deaths and reports that riders weren&#8217;t wearing helmets, in order to come up with a safety plan that would assuage the city&#8217;s fears. Now Revel requires that users take a helmet selfie and requires all riders to take a 21-question safety training quiz and watch an instructional video before hopping on a moped for the first time. The app also has a community reporting tool that anyone can use to report bad behavior to Revel.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The steps Lime and Revel are taking to ensure rider safety are not dictated by the NYC Department of Transportation. Whereas the DOT engaged in a lengthy process to approve e-scooters to operate in the city, mopeds are not regulated by the city.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We made an effort to work collaboratively with DOT, keep them informed of our plans, answer their questions and address any concerns,&#8221; a Lime spokesperson told TechCrunch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Lime will also offer its Lime Aid program to give discounted rates to Pell Grant recipients, job seekers and recipients of subsidy programs, as well as free rides to frontline workers, teachers, non-profit employees, artists and hospitality workers — those who have been most affected by the pandemic.</p>
<p>As more New Yorkers get vaccinated and the city starts to open up (with a freshly-revealed plan to fully re-open the city by July 1) , Lime wants to entrench itself as a leading micromobility vessel, and they couldn&#8217;t ask for a better time than a post-pandemic summer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The pandemic has pushed New Yorkers to look for new ways to get around that are safe, sustainable and car-free,” said Lime CEO Wayne Ting in a statement. &#8220;Now, as New York emerges from a difficult year, we are eager to support an economic comeback driven not by cars, but by sustainable options that reduce congestion and allow for open-air, socially-distanced travel.&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Today’s app-based or “gig” economy is frequently dressed up in talk about “modern innovation” and the “21st century of work.” This facade is a wolf in sheep’s clothing.</p>
<p>Precarious, contingent work is nothing new — we’ve always had jobs that are low-paying, insecure and dismissed as “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/theres-no-such-thing-as-a-low-skill-worker/618674/">unskilled</a>.” Due to systemic racism and a historically exploitative economy, workers of color have always been, and continue to be, heavily concentrated in the most exploitative industries.</p>
<p>The only difference is that today, companies like Uber, DoorDash and Instacart claim they don’t have to play by the rules because they use digital apps to manage their workforce. Even as many of these tech giants remain unprofitable, they have been allowed for far too long to shirk responsibility for providing safe and just working conditions where workers can thrive on and off the job.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

	</p>
<p>Workers’ rights in the so-called gig economy are often positioned as a modern problem. But when we think about the problems faced by gig and app-based workers, who are predominantly people of color, we must learn from the past in order to move forward to a just economy.</p>
<p>The federal government has long failed to address widespread worker exploitation. Since the passage of the National Labor Relations Act, jobs like agricultural and domestic work, which were largely performed by workers of color, were carved out of labor rights and protections. The “independent contractors” of today, who are largely workers of color, fall into this same category of workers who have been excluded from labor laws. Combined, Black and Latinx workers make up less than 29% of the nation’s total workforce, but they comprise almost 42% of workers for app-based companies.</p>
<p>Gig companies argue that the drivers, delivery people, independent contractors and other workers who build their businesses, take direction from them and whose pay they set are millions of tiny businesses that do not need baseline benefits and protections. They do this in order to shield themselves from taking responsibility for their frontline workforce. Corporations then avoid paying basic costs like a minimum wage, healthcare, paid sick leave, compensation coverage and a litany of other essential benefits for their employees. For many workers, these conditions only serve to proliferate inequality nationwide and ultimately uphold a deeply flawed economy built upon worker exploitation and suffering.</p>
<p>App-based companies are the face of a larger, sinister trend. Over the last four decades, federal policies have greatly eroded the bargaining power of workers and concentrated more power in the hands of corporations and those who already have substantial wealth and power. This has perpetuated and worsened the racial wage and wealth gaps and contributed to the ever-increasing degradation of working conditions for too many.</p>
<p>It’s clear that, in order to build an economy that works for all people, “gig” and app-based companies cannot be allowed to exploit their workers under the guise of “innovation.” These companies claim their workers want to remain independent contractors, but what workers want is good pay, job security, flexibility and full rights under federal laws. This is a reasonable and just demand &#8212; and necessary to close generational gender and racial wealth gaps.</p>
<p>App-based companies are pouring significant resources into promoting government policies that prop up their worker exploitation model. Uber, Lyft, DoorDash Instacart and other app-based companies are loudly peddling misinformation in state legislatures, city councils and federal offices. Elected leaders at all levels need to recognize these policies for what they are — corporate efforts to rewrite the laws to benefit them — and reject the corporate interests behind the policies that carve out workers from universal protections.</p>
<p>Congress must also reject exclusions that lock people of color out of basic employment protections and pass legislation to extend protections to <em>all workers</em>, including app-based workers. The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/842">PRO Act</a> is a great first step, which extends bargaining protections to workers who have been wrongly classified as “independent contractors” by their employers.</p>
<p>Across the country, app-based workers have organized to protect their health and safety and demand that their rights as workers be recognized and protected. Elected leaders cannot keep falling for corporate propaganda claiming a “21st-century” model. Work in the 21st century is still work; work that is organized on an app is still work.</p>
<p>We call on Congress to recognize the labor rights and protections of all workers and act boldly to ensure that app-based companies cannot block workers from equal rights in the name of “flexibility” and “innovation.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Taking on Amazon S3 in the cloud storage game would seem to be a fool-hearty proposition, but <a href="http://wasabi.com">Wasabi</a> has found a way to build storage cheaply and pass the savings onto customers. Today the Boston-based startup announced a $112 million Series C investment on a $700 million valuation.</p>
<p>Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company led the round with participation from previous investors. It reports that it has now raised $219 million in equity so far, along with additional debt financing, but it takes a lot of money to build a storage business.</p>
<p>CEO David Friend says that business is booming and he needed the money to keep it going. &#8220;The business has just been exploding. We achieved a roughly $700 million valuation on this round, so  you can imagine that business is doing well. We&#8217;ve tripled in each of the last three years and we&#8217;re ahead of plan for this year,&#8221; Friend told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He says that demand continues to grow and he&#8217;s been getting requests internationally. That was one of the primary reasons he went looking for more capital. What&#8217;s more, data sovereignty laws require that certain types of sensitive data like financial and healthcare be stored in-country, so the company needs to build more capacity where it&#8217;s needed.</p>
<p>He says they have nailed down the process of building storage, typically inside co-location facilities, and during the pandemic they actually became more efficient as they hired a firm to put together the hardware for them onsite. They also put channel partners like managed service providers (MSPs) and value added resellers (VARs) to work by incentivizing them to sell Wasabi to their customers.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;With a $50B run rate in reach, can anyone stop AWS?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/22/with-a-50b-run-rate-in-reach-can-anyone-stop-aws/embed/#?secret=WJHjhC3BjQ" data-secret="WJHjhC3BjQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Wasabi storage starts at $5.99 per terabyte per month. That&#8217;s a heck of a lot cheaper <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/">than Amazon S3</a>, which starts at 0.23 per gigabyte for the first 50 terabytes or $23.00 a terabyte, considerably more than Wasabi&#8217;s offering.</p>
<p>But Friend admits that Wasabi still faces headwinds as a startup. No matter how cheap it is, companies want to be sure it&#8217;s going to be there for the long haul and a round this size from an investor with the pedigree of Fidelity will give the company more credibility with large enterprise buyers without the same demands of venture capital firms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fidelity to me was the ideal investor. [&#8230;] They don&#8217;t want a board seat. They don&#8217;t want to come in and tell us how to run the company. They are obviously looking toward an IPO or something like that, and they are just interested in being an investor in this business because cloud storage is a virtually unlimited market opportunity,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He sees his company as the typical kind of market irritant. He says that his company has run away from competitors in his part of the market and the hyperscalers are out there not paying attention because his business remains a fraction of theirs for the time being. While an IPO is far off, he took on an institutional investor this early because he believes it&#8217;s possible eventually.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this is a big enough market we&#8217;re in, and we were lucky to get in at just the right time with the right kind of technology. There&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that Wasabi could grow to be a fairly substantial public company doing cloud infrastructure. I think we have a nice niche cut out for ourselves, and I don&#8217;t see any reason why we can&#8217;t continue to grow,&#8221; he said.</p>
