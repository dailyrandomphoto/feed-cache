										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">GM, Google, Lenovo, Intel, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Meta, Twitter, Amazon, TikTok, Pinterest, and now Microsoft. The software giant just became the latest big name to announce that it will no long be attending CES in-person in less than two weeks’ time.</p>
<p>“After reviewing the latest data on the rapidly evolving COVID environment, Microsoft has decided not to participate in-person at CES 2022,” the company noted in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/24/22853157/ces-microsoft-canceled-omicron-covid">a statement</a> sent to The Verge.</p>
<p>What’s been billed as a return to form for the consumer electronics industry following nearly two years of virtual shows has quickly been losing steam over the past week, as concerns around the omicron variant – coupled with a potential holiday travel spike – continue to mount.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251384" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Google cancels CES in-person presence, event organizers going ahead with show&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/23/google-cancels-ces-show-presence-amid-omicron-concerns/embed/#?secret=la0KRI0lSq" data-secret="la0KRI0lSq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>CES’ governing body, the CTA, remains steadfast in its decision to continue the physical show, as planned. Last night, the organization reached out to TechCrunch with a new comment from its President, Gary Shapiro, following fast on the heels of Google and General Motors’ rapid announcements,</p>
<blockquote><p>Over 2200 companies are confirmed to participate in person at CES 2022 in Las Vegas. Our focus remains on convening the tech industry and giving those who cannot attend in person the ability to experience the magic of CES digitally. CES 2022 will provide an opportunity for companies from around the world, both large and small, to launch products, build brands and form partnerships. Given CES’ comprehensive health measures &#8212; vaccination requirement, masking and availability of COVID-19 tests &#8212; coupled with lower attendance and social distancing measures, we are confident that attendees and exhibitors can have a socially distanced but worthwhile and productive event in Las Vegas, or while experiencing it online.</p></blockquote>
<p>An earlier statement from the company offered two days prior noted that back outs had only impacted roughly 7% of its exhibitor space. The CTA has yet to offer an updated figure, in light of some rapid extractions by big name companies, along with smaller startups who have opted for a similar abundance of caution.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A number of major companies currently appear poised to continue their in-person participation, including, Samsung, LG,  BMW, Qualcomm and Sony.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As we get closer to the end of the year, we’re running more stories that look back at topics we examined in depth over the last several months, and several that offer well-informed predictions for the year ahead.</p>
<p>This week, Bill Taranto, president of Merck’s Global Health Innovation Fund, wrote a TechCrunch+ article that explored <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/the-growing-power-of-digital-healthcare-6-trends-to-watch-in-2022/">six digital health trends his corporate VC fund is tracking as we enter 2022</a>.</p>
<p>Between Q1 and Q3 2021, healthcare startups landed $21.3 billion in VC, “dwarfing the previous record of $14.6 billion set in 2020,” writes Taranto.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251359" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>“Companies with strong offerings, management teams and balance sheets are poised to capture tremendous value.”</p>
<p>According to Crunchbase, Merck GHI has made 75 investments with 22 exits so far, including companies that span everything from drug discovery to diabetes detection.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence, IoT and data analytics are the primary drivers of innovation, says Taranto, “especially with data becoming the central currency of healthcare.&#8221;</p>
<p>We’re publishing on a light schedule between now and New Year’s, but we’ll be back with another roundup on Friday, December 31 to close out 2021.</p>

<h2>10 growth marketing experts share their 2022 predictions and New Year&#8217;s resolutions</h2>

<h2>How does former Better.com CEO Vishal Garg still have a job?</h2>

<p>Former Better.com CEO Vishal Garg is now taking time off after laying off 9% of the company’s workforce a few weeks before its planned public market debut.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The announcement was so poorly handled, the company soon hired a crisis management firm and eased Garg out of his leadership role after emails surfaced in which he berated investors.</p>
<p>Better.com says it has since hired an outside firm “to do a leadership and cultural assessment.”</p>
<p>Mary Ann Azevedo and Alex Wilhelm looked at the company’s corporate structure and found that investors have enough leverage to push the embattled founder overboard — which means they “must not be agitating for Garg’s complete removal.”</p>

<p>By July 2021, startup founders had raised $268.7 billion from global VCs, an amount that surpassed the previous year’s total.</p>
<p>When cash is this plentiful, “capital is a commodity,” according to Charlie Graham-Brown, partner and chief investments officer of Seedstars, and Daniela Moreno, the firm’s investments marketing manager.</p>
<p>In a post that walks founders through different VC platform styles and the value they can provide, the authors stipulate two rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>No individual or VC firm is good at everything.</li>
<li>What a startup needs the most will change over time.</li>
</ol>

<p>Home pages with high conversion rates have one thing in common: they make it extremely easy for a customer to buy.</p>
<p>“People have short attention spans, so if your homepage is confusing, they’re going to leave,” writes Demand Curve Community Manager Joey Noble in his latest TechCrunch+ post.</p>
<p>In a detailed analysis of the homepage for SEO agency Ahrefs’, Noble explains how the site captures reader attention, reduces friction and increases desire.</p>

<p>In the final edition of The Exchange that we’ll publish in 2021, Alex Wilhelm turned his attention to a recent Twitter thread where Block CEO Jack Dorsey claimed that end users don’t own web3, “the VCs and their LPs do.”</p>
<p>His comment didn’t go over well with some prominent crypto enthusiasts who insisted that web3’s decentralized nature is one of its core features. “Is Jack wrong? No, he is not,” wrote Alex.</p>

<p><strong>Great news! After a long COVID delay, my fiancée finally arrived in the U.S. on her K visa.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We’re thinking about eloping to Las Vegas for a quick wedding so we can get started on her green card application. (In Silicon Valley, we’d have to wait a few months to get a marriage license.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>After we file, we want to have a big wedding in the spring with her family and friends in her hometown and then go on a honeymoon. Is that allowed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Happy in Hayward</strong></p>

					<description><![CDATA["You've got to help create this environment that ultimately you want to participate and thrive in."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck has had an eventful couple of years, despite the unpredictable challenges that COVID-19 threw in the path of the rocket maker&#8217;s LA and New Zealand-based operations. Just this year, Rocket Lab had its public market debut, revealed its plans for a new medium-lift launch vehicle called Neutron and acquired two companies (on top of its first acquisition from 2020).</p>
<p>I spoke to Beck at our TC Sessions: Space 2021 event where we covered what&#8217;s new and special about Neutron, and how it leverages the pedigree of the company&#8217;s Electron rockets to challenge some assumptions about how bigger rockets are built. We also dove into his vision for Rocket Lab and what it aims to accomplish in terms of making it even easier for prospective customers to get their stuff to space.</p>
<p>Beck dished on everything from the unique way that Rocket Lab plans to land the reusable first stage of Neutron back on Earth, to the &#8220;Hungry Hippo&#8221;-type design of the fairing that allows it to avoid being discarded post-use. He also described his vision for what Rocket Lab hopes to become through its built-out of more service offerings, both through acquisitions and in-house product development.</p>
<p>Check out these excerpts, and then watch the full interview below.</p>
<p>On ditching landing legs and improving aerodynamics:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s all about removing as many components and as many complexities as possible [ … ] We had this epiphany one day, where we were like, we&#8217;re working on these landing legs, and we&#8217;re just going around in circles endlessly with mechanisms, and how are we going to service those mechanisms, and all the rest of it. And then we were like, let&#8217;s just stop, and let&#8217;s just not have landing legs. So let&#8217;s just have a wide enough base, so that we can resist any of the kind of tipping or creeping movements.</p>
<p>So we start off with this big wide base and drew a satellite in the payload and the upper stage top and the fairing diamond, and then just drew two lines that joined it all up, and it looked like a traffic cone. That&#8217;s actually the optimum vehicle: It has no legs, it&#8217;s just a nice stable kind of structure. And then as we started doing some of the CFD [computational fluid dynamics] on it, and some of the aerodynamics and some of the reentry work, and that traffic cone proved very useful, because you have this decreasing pressure over the length of the vehicle, which means you don&#8217;t have any shockwaves attaching to it, which is always a challenge with reentry.</p></blockquote>

<p id="speakable-summary">A TikTok moderator has sued the social media platform and its parent ByteDance over trauma caused by graphic videos, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-24/tiktok-sued-by-content-moderator-traumatized-by-graphic-videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> has reported. In a proposed class-action lawsuit, moderator Candie Frazier said that she has screened videos showing violence, school shootings, fatal falls and even cannibalism. &#8220;Plaintiff has trouble sleeping and when she does sleep, she has horrific nightmares,&#8221; the lawsuit states.</p>
<p>Compounding the problem, TikTok allegedly requires moderators to work 12-hour shifts with only a one-hour lunch and two 15-minute breaks. &#8220;Due to the sheer volume of content, content moderators are permitted no more than 25 seconds per video, and simultaneously view three to ten videos at the same time,&#8221; according to the complaint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251340" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p>Plaintiff has trouble sleeping and when she does sleep, she has horrific nightmares.</p></blockquote>
<p>Along with other social media companies including Facebook and YouTube, TikTok developed guidelines to help moderators cope with child abuse and other traumatic images. Among the suggestions is that companies limit moderator shifts to four hours and provide psychological support. However, TikTok allegedly failed to implement those guidelines, according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Content moderators take the brunt of graphic and traumatic images that appear on social media, making sure that users don&#8217;t have to experience them. One company that provides content moderators for large tech firms even <a href="https://www.indulgexpress.com/gadgets/2020/jan/25/continually-viewing-disturbing-videos-may-cause-moderators-of-major-social-networks-to-experience-pt-21778.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">acknowledged</a> in a consent form that the job can cause post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, social media companies have been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21021005/google-youtube-moderators-ptsd-accenture-violent-disturbing-content-interviews-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">criticized</a> by their mods and others for not paying enough given the psychological hazards, and not providing enough mental health support. A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-24-facebook-sued-over-moderator-mental-trauma.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">similar lawsuit</a> was filed against Facebook in 2018.</p>
<p>Frazier is hoping to represent other Tiktok screeners in a class-action suit, and is asking for compensation for psychological injuries and a court order for a medical fund for moderators.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>It&#8217;s just about Christmas, which means you may be stuck with family at the moment. Regardless of what, if any, holidays you may celebrate, there&#8217;s good chance that there are more people around you than normal. We&#8217;re here to distract you from that.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2248070" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To ensure that you get respite from Actual Human Interaction, the Equity team has prepared a look-back at the year. Big numbers? Check. Big themes? You know it. Big moments of &#8216;wait, that happened this year?!&#8217; Well, we&#8217;d have it no other way.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we have in store for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>High-level venture capital stats from the year, from around the world including India, Latin America, and the United States.</li>
<li><strong>The rise of memes and money:</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/gamestop-memestocks-and-the-revenge-of-the-retail-trader/">Remember the Gamestop/stonk saga</a>? That was <em>this year</em>, amazingly. So too was the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/robinhood-is-now-a-stonk/">Robinhood IPO</a>, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/coinbases-direct-listing-alters-the-landscape-for-fintech-and-crypto-startups/">Coinbase direct listing</a>, and a host of other related stories. Sure, by the end of the year we had moved on to other pieces of key news, but don&#8217;t forget how wild the start of 2021 was from a trading perspective.</li>
<li><strong>The crypto boom:</strong> Love it or hate it, crypto was one of the key startup themes this year. Capital raced into NFT marketplaces, crypto infra projects, new blockchains, and more. It was a gold rush,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/cryptocurrency/"> but all the gold was digital.</a></li>
<li><strong>A changing creator economy:</strong> We had little choice but to talk talking, to chat chatting, to yammer about yammering. Yes, we riffed on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/clubhouse-will-create-billions-in-value-and-capture-none-of-it/">the rise and fall of Clubhouse</a>, and the larger live-audio market. Podcasts, videos, and the creator economy as a whole were pretty big narratives this year, so we talked through what went down.</li>
<li>We also touched on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/this-startup-is-betting-that-you-want-to-binge-remote-work-content/">remote work</a>, fintech, insurtech mistakes, media startups, and a grip of topics that you, the Equity family, <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_/status/1467971905902850048">sent in via Twitter.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Did we get to everything? Heck no. We didn&#8217;t even get close. But that&#8217;s because 2021 was a busy damn year. It started busy and never slowed down. What do we expect in 2022? Well, just wait for next week&#8217;s episode!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After seven years in the production of electronic gadgets, under his company <a href="https://imosemobile.com/">Imose Technologies</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/comm/in/osayi-izedonmwen-63096820?midToken=AQFNuEun80e6GA&amp;midSig=3jd5JtiOEV0G41&amp;trk=eml-email_accept_invite_single_01-hero-3-prof%7Ename&amp;trkEmail=eml-email_accept_invite_single_01-hero-3-prof%7Ename-null-27caqv%7Ekxads1xg%7E32-null-neptune%2Fprofile%7Evanity%2Eview&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Aemail_email_accept_invite_single_01%3BnKloMS7UT3KWJciq8t6YYg%3D%3D">Osayi Izedonmwen</a> took leave to explore an idea that he had toyed with for some time &#8212; an edtech startup, <a href="https://teesas.com/">Teesas</a>, which now offers video classes and other digital educational material for learners in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Teesas, which was launched less than two months ago, has had a rapid takeoff, leading to a successful $1.6 million pre-seed funding round. Izedonmwen plans to use the investment to expand into new markets, launch a marketplace that will link learners with tutors for private lessons, and expand the range of products in its portfolio.</p>
<p>“We started beta testing around August this year, and fully launched the android version in November. Already Teesas has over 150,000 downloads at the Google Play store, where we are now growing by at least 20% every week,” Izedonmwen told TechCrunch.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251316" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Teesas’ content is aligned with Nigeria’s national curriculum, and is delivered to learners in both live and recorded formats, through a subscription program that starts at $6 a month. In addition to regular school work, the startup also offers local language classes.</p>
<p>“Live classes deal with concepts where learners have challenges. The learners sit with teachers in small remote classes of 10 or 15 for a personalized engagement, and to get more rigor into the teaching process,” said Izedonmwen.</p>
<p>In the near future, Teesas will offer full-curriculum modules for learners aged up to 12 years.</p>
<p>“We foresee a future where kids don&#8217;t have to attend in-person classes because they can cover entire curriculums on an app, and be ready enough for their secondary school entrance exams,” he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Teesas is also set to introduce life-skill classes in the first half of next year to prepare learners for self-discovery. This is in addition to anti-bullying lessons, inspired by the reports of increasing spate of bullying in Nigeria, with some incidents leading to death.</p>

<p><strong>Product development</strong></p>
<p>Work on Teesas began in March last year, with the platform’s design and development borrowing heavily from its edtech peers in India, which were used as benchmarks for content structure and lesson delivery.</p>
<p>“I was looking at India because they are really advanced, and have some big companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/indian-edtech-giant-byjus-valued-at-18-billion-in-new-funding/">Byju leading the edtech revolution</a>. I actually went out there to spend some time to really understand the model, and also looked at opportunities to improve on what they were doing…then we applied indigenous adaptation,” he said.</p>
<p>The adaptation he refers to, includes the use of local art, food, animals, cultural practices and languages to complement the learning process.</p>
<p>While Izedonmwen is now fully engaged with Teesas, where he is the CEO, he also continues to serve as the chairman of Imose Technologies, the Lagos-based tech company he founded to manufacture and assemble electronic devices including mobile phones, tablets, internet routers and laptops.</p>
<p>“Teesas is going to have the biggest impact on the future of education in Africa. And I really want to be certain that I&#8217;m putting my best effort in leading that transformation &#8211; that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m focusing on it fully,” he said while confirming that part of their next plan will be to enter new markets in Francophone, East and Southern Africa.</p>
<p>Before he founded Imose, Izedonmwen, a trained engineer, worked at the oil and gas company ExxonMobil for 15 years, rising through the ranks to become the company’s operations manager in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Teesas now joins a growing list of edtech startups in Africa that have in recent times received funding from investors making a bet on the fledgling edtech industry in Africa – which has recently seen an upsurge driven by the tailwinds of the covid pandemic.</p>
<p>Among the new players in the space are Kenya’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/25/yc-backed-kidato-raises-1-4m-seed-to-scale-its-online-school-for-k-12-students-in-africa/">Kidato</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/kenyan-edtech-startup-craydel-raises-1-million-to-grow-its-higher-education-platform/">Craydel</a>, and Nigeria’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/target-global-leads-3-5m-pre-seed-in-nigerian-online-learning-platform-edukoya/">Edukoya</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/african-edtech-startup-ulesson-raises-15m-backed-by-nielsen-ventures-and-tencent/">ULesson</a>.</p>
<p>Teesas round was led by Haresh Aswani, Tolaram Group&#8217;s Africa managing director, with the participation of Olivegreen Advisory Partners, an Africa-focused venture studio, and other angel investors.</p>
<p>“We believe in the mission Izedonmwen and the Teesas team has set forth on, and we are confident that they are best suited to crack the challenge of using technology to enhance access to quality education across Africa,” said Aswani.</p>

<p>The Soviet Union kicked off the Space Age when it propelled the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/baikonur.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">world’s first satellite</a> into space from a desert steppe in Kazakhstan on October 4, 1957. The launch of Sputnik I — a small <a href="https://www.cfr.org/event/legacy-sputnik-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aluminum orb</a>, no bigger than a <a href="https://www.space.com/38331-sputnik-satellite-fun-facts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beach ball</a> — proved a transformative moment for the United States. It triggered the U.S.-Soviet space race, served as the impetus for new <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/nasa-created#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Congress%20passes%20legislation,%2C%20on%20July%2029%2C%201958.&amp;text=NASA%20was%20created%20in%20response,its%20first%20satellite%2C%20Sputnik%20I" target="_blank" rel="noopener">government</a> <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/darpa-history-and-timeline#:~:text=The%20Sputnik%20Surprise,)%20on%20February%207%2C%201958." target="_blank" rel="noopener">institutions</a>, and <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/about/history/nsf50/nsf8816.jsp#chapter3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">precipitated</a> substantial increases in federal R&amp;D spending and <a href="https://history.house.gov/HouseRecord/Detail/15032436195" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funding</a> for STEM education.</p>
<p>Sputnik was a galvanizing force, providing the shock and momentum needed to revolutionize the country’s science and technology base. In recent years, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-03/u-s-ploughs-cash-into-r-d-as-china-triggers-a-sputnik-moment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">government</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/8ba8b63db0a74be78baefb8e5c6d8795" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officials</a> and lawmakers have called for a new “Sputnik moment” as they reckon with how to successfully compete economically and technologically with China. While a singular, transformative “Sputnik moment” has yet to occur, there is growing consensus in Washington that the U.S. has fallen or is at risk of falling behind China.<br />

<p>The U.S.-China competition is novel in many ways, but that doesn’t mean America’s way of competing has to be. To <a href="https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/taking-the-helm-a-national-technology-strategy-to-meet-the-china-challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reclaim</a> its inimitable role as a driver of American innovation, the U.S. government must muster the kind of energy it did in the aftermath of Sputnik — mobilizing the country’s remarkable talent, institutions and R&amp;D resources — to successfully compete with China.</p>
<p>First, it’s important to revisit what happened 60 some years ago. In the months following Sputnik’s launch, the U.S. government created two new institutions. Congress <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/is-america-facing-another-sputnik-moment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed</a> the National Aeronautics and Space Act in July 1958, creating NASA and placing the country’s space program under civilian control. NASA’s primary objective was to land a man on the moon, and it was given a lot of money to do it. Its budget increased almost <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/space-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener">500%</a> from 1961 to 1964, accounting for nearly <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/04/the-reinvention-of-nasa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4.5%</a> of federal spending <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/feb/01/nasa-budgets-us-spending-space-travel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at its peak</a>. NASA took Americans to the moon and contributed to the development of <a href="https://spinoff.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major technologies</a> with wide commercial application.</p>
<p>The federal government also <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/darpa-history-and-timeline#:~:text=The%20Sputnik%20Surprise,)%20on%20February%207%2C%201958." target="_blank" rel="noopener">established</a> the Advanced Research Projects Agency (now the <em>Defense</em> Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA) with the <a href="http://63052261.weebly.com/arpa.html#:~:text=Purpose%20%2D%20The%20Beginnings%20of%20ARPA&amp;text=President%20Eisenhower%20immediately%20took%20action%20by%20establishing%20ARPA%20and%20NASA%20in%201958.&amp;text=%22DARPA's%20original%20mission%2C%20established%20in,beaten%20the%20U.S.%20into%20space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mission</a> to prevent future technology surprises. Its research and work contributed to a <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13908-fifty-years-of-darpa-a-surprising-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">variety of technologies</a> that remain critical to America’s economic competitiveness, including GPS, voice recognition, and most notably, the foundational elements for the internet.</p>
<p>The Sputnik launch also motivated the passage of the 1958 National Defense Education Act (NDEA) of 1958. The <a href="https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Sputnik_Spurs_Passage_of_National_Defense_Education_Act.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NDEA</a> devoted federal funding for STEM and foreign language education and established the country’s first <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20180612_R45223_0d8146ae3d553873204cf7caab1ab06085de8d0a.html#_Toc516496454" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federal student loan</a> program. The NDEA explicitly linked the promotion of education to addressing America’s defense needs, recognizing it as an integral component of U.S. national security.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Sputnik spurred massive growth in federal R&amp;D spending, which was instrumental in creating today’s robust tech and startup community. The federal government was funding close to <a href="https://time.com/longform/america-innovation/">70%</a> of total U.S. R&amp;D by the 1960s — more than the <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/17/1003318/why-venture-capital-doesnt-build-the-things-we-really-need/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rest of the world</a> combined. Government R&amp;D investment has declined in the decades since, however. As the Cold War ended and the private sector started spending more on R&amp;D, federal R&amp;D spending as a percentage of GDP <a href="https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/2019-06/RDGDP.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fell</a> from about 1.2% in 1972 to approximately 0.7% in 2018.</p>
<p>As policymakers deliberate on how the U.S. should compete technologically, economically and militarily against China, they should heed the lessons learned in the Sputnik moment.</p>
<p>First, while Sputnik provided the political capital to create new institutions and increase spending on R&amp;D and education, the <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/making-most-crisis-what-sputnik-should-have-taught-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">groundwork</a> for many of these efforts was already in place. NASA built off the work of its <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/naca/overview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predecessor</a>, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, and the preparations for many of the provisions in the NDEA were <a href="https://www.ida.org/-/media/feature/publications/t/th/the-national-defense-education-act-of-1958-selected-outcomes/d-3306.ashx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in motion</a> for some time. Sputnik provided shock and urgency, but the momentum and much of the legwork was already underway. Today, the U.S. government should commit to sustained investment in its science and technology base — ensuring a strong foundation for American innovation no matter what challenge the country faces in the future.</p>
<p>Second, the federal government should establish clear national objectives to direct technology investment and motivate the public to contribute to those priorities. President Kennedy’s call to land a man on the moon was unambiguous, inspiring and provided direction for R&amp;D investment. Policymakers should identify specific goals with measurable metrics for critical technology sectors, explaining how these goals will bolster American national security and economic growth.</p>
<p>Finally, while the government’s R&amp;D investments helped spawn remarkable technological advancements, its approach for allocating and overseeing that spending was equally important. As Margaret O’Mara explains in <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/534709/the-code-by-margaret-omara/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her book</a>, “The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America,” federal funding flowed “indirectly” and “competitively,” giving the tech community “remarkable freedom to define what the future might look like” and “push the boundaries of the technologically possible.” The U.S. government must again take care that its investments fuel technological competitiveness without morphing into what could be conceived of as broad-based, inefficient industrial policy.</p>
<p>The phrase “Sputnik moment” is often invoked in an attempt to spur government action and public involvement. And indeed, actions taken in Sputnik’s aftermath are illustrative of what the U.S. government can accomplish when its approach is unified and driven by clear objectives. Rarely, however, has America achieved comparable improvements to the country’s innovation base. That doesn’t have to be the case. After Sputnik, the U.S. government reinvigorated its science and technology base by investing in the people, infrastructure and resources that would ultimately establish American technological hegemony. A new Sputnik spirit today can power American technological competitiveness into the future. Time is of the essence.<br />

A spokeswoman for the regulator said Tesla promised the change after discussing the matter with officials. There was no mention of when the update might arrive, but it&#8217;s safe to presume you&#8217;ll have to park for future gaming sessions.</p>
<p>The representative stressed the investigation would continue despite the update. The NHTSA reiterated that the Vehicle Safety Act bars companies from selling cars that pose significant safety risks, including from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-05-nhtsa-in-car-monitoring-regulation-distracted-driving-safety.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="29" data-v9y="1">distracted driving</a>. The investigation covers roughly 580,000 Tesla EVs between the 2017 and 2022 model years.</p>
<p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>Tesla no longer operates a public relations team and wasn&#8217;t available for comment. The feature change isn&#8217;t surprising, though. Inaction could worsen the consequences if the NHTSA finds Tesla was negligent. There&#8217;s also the matter of competitive pressure. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-benz-mbux-server-side-configuration-error-224912962.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="30" data-v9y="1">Mercedes-Benz recently fixed an error</a> that allowed mid-drive video playback — it wouldn&#8217;t look good if Tesla refused to follow suit.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251326" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Because of the unpredictable nature of the fashion industry, fashion brands often have to ‘guestimate’ demand for their products, and if they get that demand wrong, they have to deal with the wasted inventory. All too often clothes end up being incinerated unnecessarily, adding to their environmental impact. UK startup <a href="https://www.purpledotprice.com/">Purple Dot</a> has an ecommerce &#8216;waitlist and pre-order&#8217; platform, allowing fashion brands to only produce the exact volume of goods ordered, thereby cutting down waste.</p>
<p>Purple Dot has now raised a $4 million early stage funding round led by US-based <a href="https://www.unusual.vc/">Unusual Ventures</a>. Previous investors Connect Ventures, Moxxie Ventures, and the family office of Indeed co-founder Paul Forster also participated.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019 by entrepreneurs Madeline Parra and John Talbott, Purple Dot says it allows ecommerce businesses the ability to “sell inventory earlier as a way to maximize sales, build brand loyalty, and access demand data earlier.” Purple Dot’s waitlist solution allows inventory to be sold before it arrives in the warehouse. The startup claims it’s the only solution of its type available in the market.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251323" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Madeline Parra, CEO and co-founder of Purple Dot, said: “By selling earlier, brands open up a whole new window to capture sales.  The legacy mindset and technology assumes you need inventory in the warehouse to sell it. But with Purple Dot, you can always be selling because selling and shipping can be asynchronous. This is the “A-ha” moment for our brand partners. To get a sell-earlier strategy right, you need a dedicated approach that gets the customer experience, and internal tooling, right.”</p>
<p>Rachel Star, Investor at Unusual Ventures, said: “Purple Dot is more than an ecommerce enabler; they are revolutionizing how supply chains are managed and how brands sell, and we believe that pre-orders and waitlists will shape the future of online shopping.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[For a country with limited resources that relies on trade, developing thriving tech exports may not just be a good idea — it may be a necessity to survive.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">New Zealand, a country of just under 5 million people, has historically flown under the radar of venture capitalism. A geographically isolated country with a “no worries!” culture and an economy based on raw materials, Aotearoa hasn’t stood out to investors in the Asia-Pacific region, especially not when they could set their sights on larger markets in China and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Now, investors see New Zealand as a country with a track record of building companies with global exits in SaaS, health tech and deep tech. Notable companies and exits like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/24/xero-accel-matrix-111-million/">Xero</a>, Pushpay, <a href="https://www.afr.com/companies/healthcare-and-fitness/why-aroa-is-pushing-ahead-with-its-ipo-despite-pandemic-20200623-p55592" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aroa Biosurgery</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/09/vend-anton-commissaris/">Vend</a>, <a href="https://news.bpstech.nz/2021/03/15/the-big-exit-nearly-2-billion-reaped-in-one-week-from-kiwi-tech-acquisitions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seequent</a>, <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/smart-cow-startup-halter-backed-by-rocket-labs-peter-beck-close-to-launch/C3U24YQGEXJ4EPRJSCO2BDU6GA/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Halter</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/peter-beck-says-rocket-lab-actively-prepared-for-interplanetary-missions-from-day-one/">Rocket Lab</a> have put local startups on the map, but the scene is still immature and will need steady direction before it becomes a globally competitive ecosystem. That said, the signs are all pointing to technology being New Zealand&#8217;s next export industry, as long as everyone keeps pushing in the same direction.</p>
<p>“For a very long time, startups in New Zealand had been crying out for capital,” said Imche Fourie, co-founder and CEO of Outset Ventures, a deep tech incubator in Auckland that invests in seed and pre-seed science and engineering companies. “That’s changed so much the last couple of years partly because the government’s been putting more initiatives into attracting international capital. It’s been ridiculous how much money is flooding into the country at the moment.”</p>
<p>Despite the pandemic, venture and early-stage investment in New Zealand is reaching record highs. In 2020, <a href="https://www.venturecapitaljournal.com/how-venture-down-under-is-growing-amid-the-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VC investments totaled NZD $127.2 million</a> (USD $86 million), up from NZD $112.2 (USD $76 million) in 2019, due to a near doubling of transactions from 46 in 2019 to 92 in 2020. According to Crunchbase, money raised by New Zealand startups increased 30%, from around $1 billion to $1.3 billion, from Q1 2020 to Q4 2021. In addition, in 2020, investors provided more follow-on capital than ever before at 56%, or NZD $109 million (USD $79 million), which shows a dedication to supporting startups through to exit, <a href="https://www.pwc.co.nz/news-releases/2021-news-releases/Increasing-growth-and-maturity-in-NZ-startup-investment-despite-COVID-19-disruptions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a PwC analysis</a>.</p>
<p>New Zealand investors say most of the money is coming from either international (mainly U.S. or Australian) VCs or the government. Last March, the New Zealand government launched the <a href="https://www.nzgcp.co.nz/funding/elevate-venture-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elevate NZ Venture Fund,</a> an NZD $300 million (USD $203 million) fund of funds program that invests into VC firms aimed at filling the Series A and B capital gap for high-growth New Zealand tech companies.</p>

					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>The fresh capital signals a shift both in the country’s economy and mindset around diversifying its exports and strengthening GDP at a time when the cost of living is quickly becoming unsustainable for many Kiwis.</p>
<p>Housing prices in New Zealand are <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/454741/housing-prices-pose-risk-to-new-zealand-s-financial-stability-rbnz-governor-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">among the most unaffordable</a> among OECD nations, and an <a href="https://thespinoff.co.nz/business/31-07-2021/the-supermarket-duopoly-is-a-disaster-for-consumers-but-dont-bet-on-a-break-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">active supermarket duopoly</a> sees Kiwis spending the fourth-most per capita on groceries in the world. Not to mention the banking and electricity oligopolies running the country. Taken together, you’ve got a society primed for <a href="https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/1935430/WP-21-10-wealth-inequality-in-New-Zealand.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wealth inequalities</a>.</p>
<p>For a country with limited resources that relies on trade, developing thriving tech exports may not just be a good idea — it may be a necessity to survive.</p>
<p>“We’ve long had a strategic focus in New Zealand on moving away from commodity exports like timber, wool, milk powder, and attracting more value for what we export,” Phoebe Harrop, an associate at Blackbird Ventures, a New Zealand and Australia-based VC, told TechCrunch. “Technology startups are the pinnacle of that strategy. And it’s something we should be good at because we have a really good education system and we have this unusual cultural dynamic of people going out and spending time overseas in Silicon Valley, London, Amsterdam, Berlin, getting world-class experience, and then usually wanting to return home and do something here.”<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em><strong>Update:</strong> CTA head Gary Shapiro has offered TechCrunch the following updated statement, </em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Over 2200 companies are confirmed to participate in person at CES 2022 in Las Vegas. Our focus remains on convening the tech industry and giving those who cannot attend in person the ability to experience the magic of CES digitally. CES 2022 will provide an opportunity for companies from around the world, both large and small, to launch products, build brands and form partnerships. Given CES’ comprehensive health measures &#8212; vaccination requirement, masking and availability of COVID-19 tests &#8212; coupled with lower attendance and social distancing measures, we are confident that attendees and exhibitors can have a socially distanced but worthwhile and productive event in Las Vegas, or while experiencing it online.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The last several years have seen a massive increase in automotive presence at CES. It’s not a car show exactly, but as more car makers adopt a technology-first approach, it sure feels like it’s getting there. Tonight, however, General Motors became the latest in a long string of top names bailing out of an in-person presence at the massive Consumer Electronics Show.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251290" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p class="Text__text___3eVx1j Text__dark-grey___AS2I_p Text__regular___Bh17t- Text__large___1i0u1F Body__base___25kqPt Body__large_body___3g04wK ArticleBody__element___3UrnEs" data-testid="paragraph-2">&#8220;We have decided to move to an all-digital approach with our activation at CES 2022 in January,&#8221; company <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/alphabets-waymo-says-no-longer-going-consumer-electronics-show-person-due-covid-2021-12-23/">said in a statement</a>. &#8220;We are continuing with our plans on Jan. 5 to share our significant company news, including the reveal of the Chevrolet Silverado EV.&#8221;</p>
<p>It’s a big change for a company with a big planned presence, including a headlining keynote address from CEO Mary Barra, as well as the in-person debut of the electric Chevy Silverado. Barra plans to give her talk remotely now, according to the company. GM isn’t the first car marker to reverse its plans, but it is the largest. It follows similar announcements from Waymo and Intel, which has a sizable presence in the form of Mobileye. Notably, U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is currently scheduled to be interviewed by Qualcomm President and CEO, Cristiano Amon.</p>

<p>Other big, recently dropped dominoes include Google, Lenovo, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Meta, Twitter, Amazon, TikTok, Pinterest, and Casio as well as a number of prominent media outlets. Other companies, including Nvidia, had planned a virtual-first presence from the outset. After narrowly dodging the first COVID-19 wave in early 2020, CES was expected to be a major return for in-person tech events &#8212; albeit one that would be more muted than in past years.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The persistence of the virus’s omicron variant has, however, changed plans for a number of companies, large and small. When we last spoke to the CTA earlier today, however, the show’s governing body still planned to go forward with the event, employing increased safety measures, including vaccine mandates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em><strong>Update:</strong> CTA head Gary Shapiro has offered TechCrunch the following updated statement, </em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>Over 2200 companies are confirmed to participate in person at CES 2022 in Las Vegas.

<p>Today started with big news from Lenovo, followed by Waymo and Intel. Now it seems that Google is extracting itself entirely from its in-person presence at CES. A spokesperson for the company tells TechCrunch:</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251275" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<blockquote><p>After careful consideration we have decided to withhold from having a presence on the show floor of CES 2022. We’ve been closely monitoring the development of the Omicron variant, and have decided that this is the best choice for the health and safety of our teams. We will continue to collaborate closely with both CTA and our partners to identify and support virtual opportunities, and we look forward to sharing the latest Google innovations with you all.</p></blockquote>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4vJr6eAVYl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/23/intel-becomes-the-latest-company-to-back-away-from-an-in-person-ces/">Intel becomes the latest company to back away from an in-person CES</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Intel becomes the latest company to back away from an in-person CES&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/23/intel-becomes-the-latest-company-to-back-away-from-an-in-person-ces/embed/#?secret=4vJr6eAVYl" data-secret="4vJr6eAVYl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Google’s decision to lean into a virtual presence isn’t entirely surprising, given the earlier news from fellow Alphabet subsidiary, Waymo. Still, the software giant has become a tentpole presence in recent years, as it has increasingly expanded its hardware footprint through its Nest line of home products and Pixel handsets. For the last several years, Google&#8217;s complex outdoor exhibits have been a mainstay in the Las Vegas Convention Center Parking lot.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, the show’s governing body, the CTA, remains steadfast in its decision to keep the event going in early January, though big name losses continue piling up. The list of companies staying away from Vegas amid omicron concerns now also includes T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Meta, Twitter, Amazon, TikTok and Pinterest, along with a number of media outlets, including TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We&#8217;ve reached out to the CTA in light of this latest news &#8212; a rough portent heading into a long holiday weekend. At the time of the organization&#8217;s last comment, cancelations amounted to 42 cancelations, comprising roughly 7% of the exhibit floor. That number has no doubt shifted since the last report, as both major players and startups have begun rethinking their presence at the show.</p>
<p>No one wants to be the first big company to remove itself from an event, but the parallels to MWC&#8217;s cancelation in the early days of the pandemic are becoming more difficult to shake off. Such rapid succession of big name losses tends to make way for even more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I&#8217;m annoyed that the magic black box on the table occasionally seems unable to track my hands.</p>
<p>My three-year-old, meanwhile, doesn&#8217;t seem to mind at all. He&#8217;s laughing so hard he can barely breath as he repeatedly vacuums up dinosaurs his grandma is putting on the table from 200 miles away.</p>
<p>I suppose none of that really makes sense out of context, so let&#8217;s rewind a bit.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251206" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We&#8217;re playing with Amazon Glow — the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/amazon-introduces-amazon-glow-an-interactive-video-calling-device-for-kids-and-families/">new one</a>, not to be confused with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/25/echo-glow-is-a-30-alexa-powered-glowing-sphere/">other thing Amazon named &#8220;Glow&#8221;</a> just two years ago.</p>
<p>Take a touchscreen and make it stand upright on its own. Give it a projector that can blast images onto the table in front of it, and two cameras — one to capture video of the person in front of it, and another, pointed at the table, to detect where your hands are and let that projected image act like a touch screen. That&#8217;s the Glow.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2251212" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2251212" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2251212" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/glow.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="388" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/glow.jpg 2014w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/glow.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/glow.jpg?resize=300,171 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/glow.jpg?resize=768,438 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/glow.jpg?resize=680,388 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/glow.jpg?resize=1536,876 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/glow.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2251212" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Amazon</p></div></p>
<p>The Glow is meant to let kids* play, read and video chat with a strictly curated list of family and friends from afar. The screen up top always shows the person they&#8217;re talking to. What they see projected on the table, Grandma — or whoever — sees on their tablet. When Grandma turns the page in her book, the page on the kid&#8217;s end turns as well. When one side draws, the other sees it too.</p>
<p><em>(* &#8220;3 and up&#8221;, Amazon suggests, but in its current form I&#8217;d probably cap it at 3-8.)</em></p>
<p>The whole thing is built up around Amazon Kids+, a premium subscription service (separate from Prime) full of kids books, games, movies and TV shows. Only the books and a handful of games work with the Glow; video content doesn&#8217;t show up on the Glow, which is probably the right call or my kid would just demand Blippi 100% of the time. Kids+ is free for a year with the purchase of a Glow, after which it costs $3 (or $5, if you don&#8217;t have Amazon Prime) per month.</p>
<p>The book selection seems good, particularly for a younger audience. The games are all simple, multiplayer-y things like memory matching, chess, a pong-style arcade game and a drawing app that throws me back <em>hard</em> to the days of sitting at my dad&#8217;s computer for hours on end to draw in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Pix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kid Pix</a>. Except this time it&#8217;s projected onto a table, and my kid is co-op drawing with his grandma across the state. She places a dinosaur sticker on the screen; he uses the vacuum (erase) tool to gobble it up. They both laugh. Rinse and repeat about a million times.</p>
<p>Each person a kid can call has to be explicitly whitelisted by their parent&#8217;s account, and has to have an Amazon account. Getting that set up might take a bit depending on how savvy the other person is — but once it&#8217;s all configured, you won&#8217;t have to do it again. I like that whitelisting system because it means my kid probably won&#8217;t accidentally end up talking to a stranger.</p>
<p>The Glow is a device very much born from the pandemic, and from a time when seeing family in person — especially older members of the family — can feel like tempting fate.</p>
<p>&#8220;But wait,&#8221; you ask. &#8220;If they just want to talk with Grandma remotely, can&#8217;t they just FaceTime while using a reading app or something?&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes! Of course. And yet&#8230;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s something different about the Glow. My kid treats it <em>entirely</em> different from FaceTimes, or Zooms, or whatever. It feels different to me, too.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2251230" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2251230" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2251230" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GLOW-small.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="466" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GLOW-small.png 982w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GLOW-small.png?resize=150,103 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GLOW-small.png?resize=300,206 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GLOW-small.png?resize=768,526 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GLOW-small.png?resize=680,466 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/GLOW-small.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2251230" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Greg Kumparak</p></div></p>
<p>Something about the design gives the person you&#8217;re chatting with&#8230; presence? Maybe it&#8217;s because you can&#8217;t really move the Glow around during a call; there&#8217;s no battery, so it flips off the second you unplug it from the wall. Maybe it&#8217;s because you&#8217;re interacting with something on the table and then looking up to someone on a separate/dedicated screen, nearly eye-to-eye. It feels less like staring at a screen, more like sitting at a table around a boardgame.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, it&#8217;s weirdly effective. My kid will usually spend about five minutes FaceTiming with Grandma, showing her his toys, and then running off to do something else. When I ask if he wants to call Grandma now, he specifically requests they &#8220;glow&#8221; (using it as a verb) instead. He&#8217;ll <em>gladly</em> sit in front of the Glow playing and reading with Grandma for a solid hour, bugs be damned.</p>
<p>Ah, right, the bugs.</p>
<p>The Glow is sort of strange in that it&#8217;s <em>kind of</em> out now, but also kind of not. It&#8217;s part of Amazon&#8217;s &#8220;Day 1 Editions&#8221; program, which is really a more marketable way of saying &#8220;products you buy when they&#8217;re still in beta.&#8221; You request an &#8220;invite,&#8221; Amazon chooses who gets to buy it, and said chosen ones get to play with things a bit early while Amazon tinkers. It costs $250 if you get it as part of the Day 1 program, and will cost $299 after that.</p>
<p>In a program like that, bugs come with the territory. And the Glow, as it currently exists at the end of 2021, has them. It fails to detect touches somewhat frequently (it seems particularly iffy when the kid is wearing longer sleeves), making a &#8220;KLONK&#8221; sound and throwing up an error (for both users!) when it gets confused. Books and games occasionally fail to load. Sometimes it just randomly resets.</p>
<p>There are also some bits that are less bugs, more just rough. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>For some reason, the caller on the Glow&#8217;s screen tends to end up with half their face cut off, as pictured above. I think it&#8217;s because the Glow screen is portrait (taller than it is wide) mode, while the person calling will generally be in landscape (wider than it is tall) mode. Meanwhile, the caller generally can&#8217;t see their <em>own</em> face most of the time — just the kid&#8217;s, and a view of what the kid is seeing projected — so they don&#8217;t know it&#8217;s happening. At first I thought it was just that person not knowing how to position their tablet. Then it happened with another person. Then I called my kid on the Glow from another room, and my wife laughed at me for ending up with a cut-off face after maybe three minutes. Amazon should probably build in some Center Stage-style face following to account for that.</li>
<li>A number of books in Amazon Kid&#8217;s library don&#8217;t look great on these screens, with words that are too small for either side to read. There&#8217;s a &#8220;Bubble&#8221; mode that automatically tries to zoom in on these words to make them more readable; more often than not, it just gets in the way. Sometimes this mode just switches itself on, confusing anyone who hasn&#8217;t encountered it before.</li>
<li>The UI, overall, can be slow and oddly formatted.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these things seem like issues that can be fixed. And I hope Amazon does! Because with a bit more polish, and more content added over time, the Glow could be a really, really sweet little device. But how much love it gets from here is unclear; we&#8217;ve had it around our house for weeks now and, if there&#8217;s been patches, they&#8217;ve been&#8230; subtle.</p>
<p>But even in its current form, there&#8217;s a lot I like. The projected screen is nice and bright, picking up some extra brightness and tactility from a bright white roll-out mat included in the box. I&#8217;ve never had to adjust the room&#8217;s lighting to make it work. It&#8217;s very quick to set up and tear down if you don&#8217;t want it sitting out all the time — something Amazon clearly considered, as the box it comes in acts as a very nice, durable storage container. If you <em>do</em> want it out all the time, there&#8217;s a physical shutter switch you can use to cover the camera for added privacy. I also like that Amazon promises to replace it for free if it breaks in the first two years, because, well, kids break things.</p>
<p>But my kid doesn&#8217;t care about that stuff, either. He just wants to vacuum up more dinosaurs.</p>
<p>I like to end my reviews with a simple question: Once I send this loaner review unit back, would I buy it? In this case, I already have. Or, at least, I&#8217;ve requested an invite to buy one. Partly because I think my kid would be very bummed if he couldn&#8217;t &#8220;glow with grandma&#8221; again, and partly because I honestly just like that uniquely physical presence it gives his grandparents when they call.</p>
<p>Should you? If your kid is already content with FaceTiming their grandparents, maybe not. If books and drawing and basic games won&#8217;t keep them interested, maybe not. If you&#8217;re not willing to put up with a bug or three while Amazon figures out what this thing means for them in the long run, maybe not. But if that all sounds fine, it really is a lot of fun.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What does 2022 mean to marketers?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This is a quiet period for marketing: End-of-year campaigns are already underway, teams are on holiday vacations and there&#8217;s little to do until after the new year.</p>
<p>Setting aside the holiday spirit, this has been a difficult year for growth professionals. Most are still adapting to pandemic-driven changes to consumer habits, but Apple&#8217;s new privacy options and the impending death of the browser cookie are making it more difficult to reach the right consumers. Growth marketers have a wide variety of tools available, but which ones do the pros use?</p>
<p>We reached out to 10 growth marketing experts to find how they were preparing for 2022 and to ask they had any New Year&#8217;s resolutions to share.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Help TechCrunch find the best growth marketers for startups. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Provide a recommendation in <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/bwwIWF03" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this quick survey</a> and we&#8217;ll share the results with everybody.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answers and advice we received were as varied as the people we polled, but nearly all of them indicated that learning — e.g., analytics training, getting started with AI tools, etc. — was high on their to-do list. &#8220;Google Analytics 4 is the new default in 2022 and beyond, so get ready to relearn how to configure your analytics reporting in a way that makes sense for your organization,&#8221; said Richard Meyer of Tuff.</p>
<p>Kate Adams, SVP of marketing at Validity, said it&#8217;s important to keep honing one&#8217;s skills, but growth marketers shouldn&#8217;t feel compelled to become experts at everything: &#8220;Overall, there’s more value in being able to articulate what your problems are and develop strategies to fix them than to be a technology savant gobbling up whatever solution you can get your hands on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Our questions also addressed the future of influencer marketing, which automation tools they&#8217;re working with and recommending to clients and whether they&#8217;re continuing to invest in short-form videos.</p>

<h2>Jonathan Martinez, founder, JMStrategy</h2>
<p><strong>What are your 2022 growth marketing resolutions?</strong></p>
<p>In 2022, the companies that come out on top will be those that unlock iOS 14 and leverage influencers. My goal is to continue testing everything on iOS 14, such as optimal account structures, bidding, flows and more. I’m really interested to see how channels/MMPs/etc. evolve and what types of measurement betas they all roll out.</p>
<p>Equally as important to me is to continue leveraging the power of influencers. I think we’re still less than 10% of the way there on how impactful influencers will be in the next decade. Utilizing TikTok’s creator marketplace, platforms such as Billo for UGC content, etc., are all tactics that I’ll be employing.</p>
<p><strong>There was a lot of discussion about influencer marketing in 2021, but is it a fad or a requirement? If it is a must, what types of companies need to invest in this area?</strong></p>
<p>While influencer marketing may have been discussed in magnitudes over the last year, I believe we’re still at the infancy of this tactic. We’ll see channels start to create influencer marketplaces (akin to TikTok’s creator marketplace), which will remove barriers to working with influencers. The pandemic has accelerated people watching even more content from influencers on various channels. These same people are becoming more responsive to ads from a personal voice and increasingly numb to typical brand ads.</p>
<p><strong>Where does AI marketing fall on your list of priorities for 2022? Should marketing teams be leaning into this, or is it industry/customer-specific?</strong></p>
<p>As growth marketers, we should always be on the hunt for tools that’ll either help solve monotonous tasks or increase our analysis throughput. The creative AI space is something I’m keeping a close eye on because I think this is where there’s huge room for advancement. As targeting and bidding become increasingly channel automated, creative is an area that I believe still needs the human touch. If AI platforms can help speed learnings and provide useful insights on creative launches, it’ll be immensely helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Which marketing automation tools do you think are poised to take off in 2022? Should growth marketers plan to become more technical in the coming year?</strong></p>
<p>Growth marketing has always been a nice blend of analytics + creativity, with distribution being dependent on the stage of the company. As data becomes less clear with industrywide privacy changes, growth marketers are being forced to be more analytical and technical than ever. Running incrementality tests, applying scalars to channels and validating data across tools will be paramount in 2022 to understanding growth efforts.</p>
<h2>Kate Adams, SVP of marketing, Validity</h2>
<p><strong>What are your 2022 growth marketing resolutions?</strong></p>
<p>In 2022 marketers can expect to see a resurgence of product-led growth models, which have historically centered on creating free products that are appealing, easy to use and accessible. For so long, we’ve held this notion that growth models have to incorporate a trial period to succeed with consumers. What if that wasn’t the case? With the convergence of product-led growth strategies and the elimination of friction, it doesn’t have to be.</p>
<p>This year, marketers should resolve to embrace this resurgence, but in a modern, differentiated way. Let’s rethink how we approach growth models; maybe we don’t have to include a trial or free version of our products &#8212; especially when not every company is able to sustain the investment and resources required for trial products.</p>
<p>Another resolution is to not let yourselves fall in the trap of believing that everything is back to normal — COVID is still disrupting in-person events as well as entire industries and will continue to do so. So as marketers we have to resolve to pivot early and often to ensure our larger campaigns and investments are able to succeed regardless of the status of the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>There was a lot of discussion about influencer marketing in 2021, but is it a fad or a requirement? If it is a must, what types of companies need to invest in this area?</strong></p>
<p>Influencers have their time and place — we all saw the “Just Like That” Peloton ad and that was cool and will stay with us for a week, maybe a month. But the reality is that no matter how much you pay or what influencer your brand snags, these are passing moments in time.</p>
<p>As a B2B marketer, I’m much more interested in making customers part of a community and giving them a platform to share their success stories of which we play a part. Instead of going for one person with 10 million followers via a flashy influencer program, why not invite 1,000 people with 10,000 followers to talk about your product? Not every industry has a Kim Kardashian for the moment, and even if they do, it&#8217;s not a sustainable model. It’s much more impactful, especially in the B2B world, to have a steady, ongoing drumbeat of customers telling their stories about your brand than investing heavily in one mega influencer.</p>
<p><strong>Have short-form videos (2:30 or less) peaked, or should marketers keep using this tool in 2022? </strong></p>
<p>Video definitely hasn’t peaked — and I don’t believe it will any time soon. There is an entire generation of individuals who essentially grew up on YouTube and TikTok. They know how to get to what they want (information included) faster. These are all the same people that are joining the workforce and suddenly becoming B2B buyers and, if you want to be successful, you have to communicate with them in the way they&#8217;re most familiar with. Short-form video content is one big way to do that.</p>
<p>There’s so much more room for video. In our industry, webinars still reign supreme but stopping there is antiquated thinking. Marketing teams should be challenging themselves to come up with ways to address the webinar fatigue happening in really technical industries. For example, taking long-form content (like webinars) and cutting them up into smaller, more readily consumable snippets is a quick and easy way to ensure these learnings live on and reach a broader audience.</p>
<p><strong>Where does AI marketing fall on your list of priorities for 2022? Should marketing teams be leaning into this, or is it industry/customer-specific?</strong></p>
<p>AI is some of the most exciting technology I’ve seen in a really long time. The fact that AI can achieve any number of tasks — whether it&#8217;s improving user experience or actually having a conversation with somebody — is truly incredible. But, I think of these things as pendulums. Consumers may experience AI and think, “I just want to talk to a person.” While using AI to mitigate issues with user experience and have it dealt with automatically is an ideal solution, there are instances when you actually need to enable a human being and have a human conversation.</p>
<p>AI is like a house; without the appropriate technology and engineering infrastructure at the foundation, that house is going to crumble. AI is only as good as what you put into it. The minute you try to train your machine based on bad data, it will find faulty trends or just not work at all. Right now too many people are running toward AI as the solution for all their problems without solving for the data decay already taking place in their organization.</p>
<p><strong>Similarly, is the personalization trend overhyped? Which specific tools and platforms do you recommend for non-technical marketers who want to get up to speed?</strong></p>
<p>Too many marketers today are enacting tokenization and claiming that as personalization. They’ll put your name and your company name in their materials and think, “I put these tokens in, and therefore I delivered you a personalized experience.” That’s missing the forest for the trees. From a technology perspective, it&#8217;s about the website experiences. We need to deliver a personalized experience based on who you are, how many times you’ve been here and what we know about you.</p>
<p>In terms of tools, I think there’s a ton of folks out there doing really interesting stuff right now — for everything from content personalization to web personalization. The important piece here is the ability to test and understand the impact of your personalization efforts on customers. A lot of ESPs and companies like Adobe are doing an incredible job building out tools to enable marketers to really hone in on the customer journey and demonstrate what the next best action is for each customer. I’m incredibly biased but I also think our solutions Everest and Demandtools can go a long way in providing today’s marketers with the ability to take their campaigns to the next level in terms of personalization and accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>Which marketing automation tools do you think are poised to take off in 2022? Should growth marketers plan to become more technical in the coming year?</strong></p>
<p>Marketing is incredibly difficult; more so than ever before. And there are also more solutions (8,000+ in fact) that claim to be the silver bullet to fix any marketing woes. But those are just claims as often no one solution is the end-all-be-all. While you definitely have to be savvy in technology (and the implementation of that technology) to be a successful marketer, there are many considerations in a marketer&#8217;s skillset outside of this technical piece.</p>
<p>For instance, there&#8217;s a marketing technologist, a marketing strategist, the marketing execution piece — in today’s market, you have to be all three of those to be a really strong marketer. Mastering all of these skills is difficult for one person, especially because it’s using both sides of the brain. Understanding the analytical aspects of a marketing program, but also how to write the copy that captures people’s attention and portrays the message you want to say is tricky. Overall, there’s more value in being able to articulate what your problems are and develop strategies to fix them, than to be a technology savant gobbling up whatever solution you can get your hands on.</p>
<h2>Richard Meyer, growth marketer, Tuff</h2>
<p><strong>What are your 2022 growth marketing resolutions?</strong></p>
<p>In 2022, I want to commit to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking additional training courses on the new Google Analytics tool, Google Analytics 4.</li>
<li>Developing additional attribution reporting cadences that rely on first-touch attribution, instead of Google Analytic’s default “last-click&#8221; attribution.</li>
<li>Developing additional demand-generating strategies (instead of demand-capturing strategies) for niche-product and service markets, such as fintech, B2B SaaS, etc.</li>
</ul>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Even after the unprecedented year that we had in 2020, the VC markets picked up in 2021 and founders raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/5-factors-founders-must-consider-before-choosing-their-vc/">157% more capital</a> in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the previous year. Global VCs have invested <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/global-venture-capital-investments-hit-record-high-2021-07-21/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$268.7 billion</a> as of July 2021, already passing the total investment amount in 2020.</p>
<p>In emerging markets, where our company Seedstars focuses its attention, VC capital flow has been growing 40% year on year but still represents less than 4% of global volumes, despite accounting for the majority of the world’s population. <a href="https://practicalvc.com/is-vc-experiencing-a-bubble/">Whether you think this is a bubble</a>, one fact remains true: Capital is a commodity.</p>
<p>Some capital will flow faster than others and investment terms must be considered, but assuming all things are equal, the real value lies beyond the capital. It lies in the knowledge, network and support an investor brings to the table.</p>
<p>It is not only a matter of market perception or an identified trend. <a href="https://www.desantisbreindel.com/insights/big-venture-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">De Santis Breindel</a> asked CEOs what was the top evaluation criteria when choosing a VC firm. Reputation of the firm came first place, followed by the ability to add value to portfolio companies beyond funding. So how has the industry responded to this?</p>
<h2>&#8220;Smart money&#8221; and the VC platform</h2>
<p>At some point, the concept of “smart money” slipped into the VC vernacular referring to the idea that some money also came with highly sought after expertise and the likelihood of crowding in other investors.</p>
<p>Today, the evolution of the concept has brought us the VC “platform.” Smart money was definitely a catchier phrase but not institutional enough to be turned into something official. The concept of a platform, on the other hand, gives more room for innovation but still leaves most founders (and even some platform managers) confused. So, the big questions are: What exactly is a platform? How does it bring value? Do you need it as a startup? How can you evaluate it? Read on.</p>
<h2>T-shaped platforms and the Tetris fit</h2>
<p>Keep two rules in mind:<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I’ve been up to my neck in CES planning &#8212; and, I suppose, unplanning this week. There’s a strange disconnect getting pitches for the one millionth UV light sanitizing robot while you’re weighing the pros and cons of attending a show in-person, amid the latest variant surge. Ultimately, we’ve decided not to go to Vegas this time, but I’m anticipating we’ll still have plenty to discuss for the newsletter in a few weeks.</p>
<p>Nearly two years later, it feels so strange to note that CES and then our Robotics Session were the last events I attended in person. Having played a role in organizing the latter and heading up TechCrunch’s CES efforts, I understand well how important it is to not take these decisions lightly.</p>
<p>And I certainly feel there’s still a benefit for me in attending conferences in person, particularly when it comes to evaluating robots. There’s a limitation to how good a look you can get at a robot via a Zoom call.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2250850" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If anything, all of this has really driven home how mainstream adoption of robotics systems feels, at once, extremely close and still a ways off. Anecdotally, I can tell you that I’ve gotten far more robotics pitches for this CES &#8212; a show that’s designed to be the bellwether for the year to follow. They represent a wide range, from consumer to industrial &#8212; and everything in between.</p>
<p>The pandemic has undoubtedly accelerated excitement and investments in the industry, but the actual speed of adoption varies greatly from category to category. The two examples we’ve looked at thus far for our year-end roundup are reasonably far along. Like manufacturing before it, warehouse and fulfillment robotics are very much a reality right now. If you’ve recently purchased something online, there’s a pretty good chance a robot helped get it to you at some point along the line.</p>
<p>Delivery robots are tougher. There are a number of pilots out there, and depending on where you live (especially if it’s anywhere near a college campus), you may have seen one of them cruising by &#8212; even if it hasn’t gotten your food to you directly. Sidewalks are, generally, less controlled spaces than warehouses and there’s regulatory red tape to deal with in terms of getting them out into the world, so in spite of all of the funding, don’t expect to wake up tomorrow to sidewalks saturated by robots.</p>
<p>This week I want to talk to you about who &#8212; or, perhaps, what &#8212; is actually making the food that those robots may or may not be delivering to your door.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2250851" style="width: 809px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2250851" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2250851" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/35994859235_aae7902eb7_c.jpg" alt="" width="799" height="533" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/35994859235_aae7902eb7_c.jpg 799w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/35994859235_aae7902eb7_c.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/35994859235_aae7902eb7_c.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/35994859235_aae7902eb7_c.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/35994859235_aae7902eb7_c.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/35994859235_aae7902eb7_c.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 799px) 100vw, 799px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2250851" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> (Photo by Paul Marotta/Getty Images for TechCrunch)</p></div></p>
<p>Before we get into it, we asked iRobot co-founder and CEO Colin Angle to reflect on the past year in robotics and give us a prediction for the year to come.</p>
<p><strong>What was the defining robotics / AI / automation trend of 2021?</strong> Warehouse automation, assisted driving technology &#8212; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/actuator-4/">poop detection, of course</a> &#8212; were all areas where we saw breakthroughs in 2021. It was a remarkable year when the meteoric rise in online shopping (which almost broke 2020) seemed to work remarkably well, due largely to major investments in automation. I actually saw TV commercials for autonomous-driving trucks targeted at Middle America. Is this really happening? And I am proud to say one of the dirty, rarely discussed challenges of robot vacuuming is now in the rearview mirror, with the advent of high-reliability visual object recognition at a consumer price point. I think it’s safe to say 2021 was a transformational year for robots.</p>
<p><strong>What will 2022 bring for these categories?</strong> As we move into 2022, I would love to see real progress on the smart home people have been waiting for. In the current version of the smart home, complexity is too high, and usability is too low &#8212; but the tools are coming into place for experience-first ecosystems to emerge and begin to grow in capability and system simplicity. So I look to 2022 as not just a year of continued industry acceleration among the regular suspects, but also one in which we’ll see a significant step forward in the thoughtful integration of robotics into our daily lives. It’s exciting to see momentum growing on so many fronts!</p>
<p>And now for one of the most uncomfortable segues I’ve had to make in my long and illustrious career, we move from poop detection to food prep [leaving a note here for when corporate asks why my new newsletter lost all of its subscribers in its third week].</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236551" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236551" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2236551" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-566066679.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="689" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-566066679.jpg 2400w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-566066679.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-566066679.jpg?resize=300,202 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-566066679.jpg?resize=768,517 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-566066679.jpg?resize=680,458 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-566066679.jpg?resize=1536,1034 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-566066679.jpg?resize=2048,1378 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-566066679.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236551" class="wp-caption-text">Food shoot in the test kitchen of the Los Angeles Times via Getty Images of a pizza margherita being removed from the brick oven shot on March 11, 2009.

<p>This past year was a big one for robotic food preparation. Prior to the pandemic, prominent startups involved in the space were few and far between. Some &#8212; including, notably, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/zume-kills-plastics/">Zume Robotics</a> &#8212; pivoted out of the category. But along with an influx in venture capital for robotics at large comes increases in automating the restaurant business. The primary reasons are two you probably know by heart nearly two years into this thing. First, there’s a massive staffing shortage in the U.S. Second, robots don’t get sick &#8212; nor do they get people sick.</p>
<p>If I had to sum up the current state of food robotics in four words, they would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pizza</li>
<li>Bowls</li>
<li>Fastfood (yes, I cheated by making this one word)</li>
<li>Kiosks</li>
</ul>
<p><div id="attachment_2250852" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2250852" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2250852" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Precision.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Precision.jpeg 1390w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Precision.jpeg?resize=150,112 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Precision.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Precision.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Precision.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Precision.jpeg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2250852" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Picnic</p></div></p>
<p>The first two sit at the top of the list for similar reasons. If you’re going to automate a food, it needs to be something that’s popular and relatively uniform. Sure, there are a ton of different toppings, but for a robot, making pizza is a fairly straightforward experience: dough, sauce, cheese, topping, cook, repeat. Companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/18/pizza-robot-maker-picnic-raises-another-13-3m/">Picnic</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/02/xrobotics-is-keeping-the-dream-of-pizza-robots-alive/"> XRobotics</a> are looking to pick up where Zume left off.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2194092" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2194092" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2194092" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Spyce-Restaurant-Boston-Infinite-Kitchen-Front.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="954" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Spyce-Restaurant-Boston-Infinite-Kitchen-Front.jpeg 6666w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Spyce-Restaurant-Boston-Infinite-Kitchen-Front.jpeg?resize=150,140 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Spyce-Restaurant-Boston-Infinite-Kitchen-Front.jpeg?resize=300,279 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Spyce-Restaurant-Boston-Infinite-Kitchen-Front.jpeg?resize=768,715 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Spyce-Restaurant-Boston-Infinite-Kitchen-Front.jpeg?resize=680,633 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Spyce-Restaurant-Boston-Infinite-Kitchen-Front.jpeg?resize=1536,1431 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Spyce-Restaurant-Boston-Infinite-Kitchen-Front.jpeg?resize=2048,1908 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Spyce-Restaurant-Boston-Infinite-Kitchen-Front.jpeg?resize=50,47 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2194092" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spyce</p></div></p>
<p>Bowls fill a similar niche. They’ve grown in popularity in recent years and work around a fairly basic template. Even with variations between toppings and bases like salad, quinoa and the like, the principle is fairly simple. So it’s probably no surprise that California-based fast casual salad chain Sweetgreens leaned in back in August with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/salad-chain-sweetgreen-buys-kitchen-robotics-startup-spyce/">its acquisition of MIT spinout, Spyce</a>. The move followed a similar acquisition by DoorDash, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/doordash-acquires-salad-making-robotics-startup-chowbotics/">purchased salad making robotics firm Chowbotics in February</a>.</p>
<p>Miso <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/flippy-the-hamburger-cooking-robogets-a-more-capable-successor/">leads the fast food charge</a> at the moment, with a number of big partnerships announced. The company’s hamburger-flipping and fry-cooking robot can’t replace a kitchen staff outright just yet, but it’s getting more and more capable, generation after generation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2233724" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2233724" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2233724" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-bowl-in-conveyor-belt.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-bowl-in-conveyor-belt.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-bowl-in-conveyor-belt.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-bowl-in-conveyor-belt.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-bowl-in-conveyor-belt.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-bowl-in-conveyor-belt.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-bowl-in-conveyor-belt.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Nommi-bowl-in-conveyor-belt.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2233724" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nommi</p></div></p>
<p>Kiosks, meanwhile, are designed to largely take humans out of the equation. The solution has been gaining a lot of steam of late, courtesy of the aforementioned labor shortage. Human interaction with the systems are largely limited to loading, maintenance and ordering. But with the right technology, you can effectively have a self-contained kitchen preparing fresh food with the push of a button, as seen with<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/nommi-announces-plans-for-rollout-of-its-food-bowl-making-kitchen-robot/"> products like Nommi</a>, whose recent deal with C3 brings food from Iron Chef’s Masaharu Morimoto to the 24/7 food prep machine.</p>
<p>As for this week’s news, things have slowed down a bit, ahead of the holiday. We did, however, manage to get a glimpse of what <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/hyundais-mobile-eccentric-droid-tries-hard-to-live-up-to-its-name/">Hyundai is cooking up for this CES</a>. The automaker has really doubled down on its robotics efforts, including its acquisition of Boston Dynamics. The new Mobile Eccentric Droid (MobED) is a platform in every sense. It is a literal one; a four-wheel mobility device with a staging area in the middle. It can also house a range of different features, from teleconferencing to package delivery to smart baby carriage.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2250855" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2250855" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2250855" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Large-49097-HyundaiMotorGroupRevealMobileEccentricDroidMobEDanAll-NewMobilityPlatformforVersatileApplications-1.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="569" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Large-49097-HyundaiMotorGroupRevealMobileEccentricDroidMobEDanAll-NewMobilityPlatformforVersatileApplications-1.jpeg 1266w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Large-49097-HyundaiMotorGroupRevealMobileEccentricDroidMobEDanAll-NewMobilityPlatformforVersatileApplications-1.jpeg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Large-49097-HyundaiMotorGroupRevealMobileEccentricDroidMobEDanAll-NewMobilityPlatformforVersatileApplications-1.jpeg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Large-49097-HyundaiMotorGroupRevealMobileEccentricDroidMobEDanAll-NewMobilityPlatformforVersatileApplications-1.jpeg?resize=768,427 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Large-49097-HyundaiMotorGroupRevealMobileEccentricDroidMobEDanAll-NewMobilityPlatformforVersatileApplications-1.jpeg?resize=680,378 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Large-49097-HyundaiMotorGroupRevealMobileEccentricDroidMobEDanAll-NewMobilityPlatformforVersatileApplications-1.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2250855" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hyundai</p></div></p>
<p>Of its stabilizing technology, Hyundai says:</p>
<blockquote><p>The eccentric mechanism-based posture control system also stabilizes the body attitude by adjusting the height of each wheel according to the ground environment. The MobED’s 12-inch pneumatic tires further help to absorb bumps and vibrations.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tiger Global, meanwhile, continues its spending spree. This week the firm led a $30 million Series B for Pasadena, California’s Elementary. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/tiger-global-leads-cash-infusion-into-elementary-for-automated-manufacturing-inspection/">The round</a>, which also features Fika Ventures, Fathom Capital, Riot VC and Toyota Ventures, brings the machine vision startup’s total funding to $47.5 million. Founder and CEO Arye Barnehama tells TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote><p>During the pandemic, manufacturing and logistics have undergone major labor shortages that were already beginning before the pandemic but were significantly increased. As companies look to continue to automate without having to rely on expensive and hard to find engineering talent, our business has scaled because we are able to provide them with no-code AI solutions.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Following <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/23/lenovo-to-suspend-in-person-ces-activities-as-more-exhibitors-embrace-omicron-caution/">today’s news</a> that Lenovo and Alphabet-owned Waymo are sitting out the in-person element of CES 2022, Intel just announced that it’s moving to “minimize” its presence at the tech show, over growing concerns around the omicron variant.</p>
<p>“The health and safety of our employees, partners and customers is always a top priority,” the chip giant said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. “After consulting with health officials and in the spirit of Intel’s safety policy, our plans for CES will move to a digital-first, live experience, with minimal on-site staff. We encourage you to join us as we deliver all our CES content and experiences virtually via the Intel Newsroom.”</p>
<p>Along with Lenovo and Waymo, Intel joins a growing list of names that includes T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Meta, Twitter, Amazon, TikTok and Pinterest. In its latest statement provided to TechCrunch, CES’s governing body, the CTA, says the show will go on (citing its health protocols and a relatively low number of dropouts thus far).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251196" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Given CES’ comprehensive health measures — vaccination requirement, masking and availability of COVID-19 tests — coupled with lower attendance and social distancing measures, we are confident that attendees and exhibitors can have a socially distanced but worthwhile and productive event in Las Vegas, as well as a rewarding experience on our digital access,” the organization notes.</p>
<p>In addition to bigger names, a number of startups have announced similar plans, out of concern over omicron.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">I am sore.</p>
<p>Not in a oh-hell-I-cannot-sit-down kind of sore. More like, &#8220;OK!, I worked some-long-ignored-muscles sore.&#8221; And in year where I&#8217;m trying to extract myself out of the COVID-19 pandemic doldrums, this is a good thing.</p>
<p>The cause isn&#8217;t from cycling on a Peloton but another newer entrant to the connected home gym scene. It&#8217;s called FightCamp; and as the name implies, this home exercise system, which includes a punching bag and gloves with connected smart trackers, focuses on boxing and kickboxing.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2246356" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>After more than a month with FightCamp it&#8217;s safe to say (or write) that it provides a sweat-producing workout that if completed regularly will improve the user&#8217;s core, balance, speed and basic boxing know-how. It also provides a safe &#8220;non-judgy&#8221; path for those who have always wanted to try boxing, but were too intimidated to walk into a boxing gym or mixed martial arts center and let that rookie flag fly.</p>
<h2>Origin story</h2>
<p>To understand what FightCamp is and does, it&#8217;s worth going back to the beginning. The company was founded in 2014 as Hykso, four years before the connect home workout system FightCamp was launched. During that four years, the company developed fitness trackers that were tested, further improved and used by Olympic boxing athletes. Several Olympic boxing teams including the United States, Canada and China used the trackers. Manny Pacquiao, considered one of the best boxers of all time, was an early user as well.</p>
<p>There was no content layer since these athletes already were competing at the highest level of the sport. It was just the trackers and loads of data.</p>
<p>But a curious thing happened. The boxing coaches started using them with their private clients, according to Khalil Zahar, founder and CEO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;They were the bridge,&#8221; Zahar said referring to the coaches. From here the idea of FightCamp was borne. &#8220;We thought, let&#8217;s provide a way for people to not only use it in their workouts with coaches, but let&#8217;s teach them the art form of boxing and build a beginner-based program that they can follow from the home and learn techniques,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>The options</h2>
<p>FightCamp offers three &#8220;hardware&#8221; packages: Connect for $439 ($399 during holidays), Personal for $1,219 (but on sale over the holidays at $999) and Tribe for $1,299. Users must also subscribe to the content for a monthly fee of $39, which gives access more than 1,000 classes, drills and other content in the iOS app and more recently, the Android app. And this is not just about throwing punches. There are workouts that include kickboxing and a little toggle on the app will ensure that every session ends with core work like situps and planks.</p>
<p>Connect comes without the bag, just the digital punch trackers and quick wraps and is designed for folks who already have their own punching bag. The Personal package, which is what I tested, includes the punch trackers, quick wraps, gloves, the free-standing bag and bag ring. Mine also came with a mat, but I&#8217;ve been told that is no longer included, which is too bad.</p>
<p>The FightCamp Tribe package is like it sounds and is meant for more than one person and includes punch trackers, quick wraps, a free-standing bag, a heavy workout mat, premium boxing gloves, bag ring, additional premium boxing gloves and wraps as well as kids boxing gloves.</p>
<h2>The setup</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2251132" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_3169.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2251132" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2251132 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_3169.jpg" alt="FightCamp package" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_3169.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_3169.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_3169.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_3169.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_3169.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_3169.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_3169.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2251132" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>The FightCamp Personal package came in two boxes: a massive cardboard box carrying the bag and base and another box holding the punch trackers that track the user&#8217;s output and number of punches, quick wraps, a mat and pair of gloves. (The mat is no longer included in the Personal package.)</p>
<p>The instructions to set up the bag and ready the trackers are simple. However, it is a bulky, somewhat awkward endeavor depending on where the user decides to place the bag. I brought mine into our guest house, a spot out of the way of normal daily living, yet near a TV. (More on that later.)</p>
<p>After laying out the mat, users position the base that the bag will sit in. The base is then filled with water or sand. I opted to run a hose from outside into the guest house, which greatly reduced the setup time. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll be trekking back and forth with a pitcher of water or bucket of sand. If that sounds like a pain, well it is, although you do get exercise in the process.</p>
<p>The mistake I made, and one that I missed and later corrected, was to make sure to place the base EXACTLY where I wanted it. Once it is filled with water or sand or both (user&#8217;s choice) and the bag is placed on top, it is impossible to move without a dolly.</p>
<p>My mistake was placing the base and bag on the wrong end of the mat so that I would be facing away from the TV. Once I corrected the error, it made a dramatic difference in the quality of workouts.</p>
<h2>What works and doesn&#8217;t</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2251129" style="width: 4042px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_3171.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2251129" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2251129 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_3171.jpg" alt="FightCamp trackers" width="4032" height="3024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_3171.jpg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_3171.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_3171.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_3171.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_3171.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_3171.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_3171.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_3171.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4032px) 100vw, 4032px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2251129" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>The good news is that the punch trackers, pictured above, work as advertised and truly track every punch. The app is also easy to use and there are loads of workouts, all of which are led by USA boxing certified coaches and NASM CPTs.</p>
<p>I particularly liked the setting that ensures core exercises follow the boxing or kickboxing instruction. The company even has some shadowboxing classes, which are meant for new customers to begin to learn the lingo and the basic punches and jabs before their bag, gloves, wraps and trackers arrive.</p>
<p>There are a few downsides to FightCamp that may or may not turn users off.</p>
<p>One is the sheer size of the system. In a small apartment, the bag will take up valuable real estate that some may welcome and others may find problematic. Folks with a larger home or garage might be more attracted to this system. I didn&#8217;t have this issue since I had the space.</p>
<p>To me, the main drawback of FightCamp is that without a TV nearby, it&#8217;s hard to properly follow the instructor until you&#8217;ve logged enough workouts that you can follow along without having to stare at the screen.</p>
<p>The actual content is clear and easy to understand. The coaches deliver the right combination of stoke and instruction to keep the user motivated and informed. I personally learned a lot.</p>
<p>However, there is a learning curve. In the beginning, and before I had hooked up the phone to my TV, I found myself repeatedly stopping the video to playback the previous movement. That created a staggered experience.</p>
<p>Once I had the TV hookup and was able to stream the workouts, I was able to more easily follow along. I did improve to the point where I no longer had to watch the exact movement to know what to do. Instead I was able to listen and know that 1-2-3 means jab, cross, lead hook.</p>
<p>Finally, I still don&#8217;t know if I have good form since there is no way for the trackers or the app to provide that kind of feedback. That probably doesn&#8217;t matter for people like myself who just want a sweat-producing workout.</p>
<h2>Where is this all going?</h2>
<p>Zahar and the company have plans to expand, not just in content, but trackers that can help provide better feedback on form as well as further gamify the workout.</p>
<p>&#8220;We basically want to make your body the game controller,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The trackers are just enabling you to use your body as a game controller.&#8221;</p>
<p>Today, people can use data captured from the punch trackers on their wrists to compete against each other and monitor their progress. Zahar wants to add trackers to the feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then we want to expand to everything that a fighter touches and make it into a connected fitness accessory,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So think anything from jump rope, to battle ropes to kettlebells to plyo boxes, and basically reward you for every movement you&#8217;re doing during the workout.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zahar doesn&#8217;t want FightCamp to be an equipment-only workout system either. The additional trackers and additional content that doesn&#8217;t require a punching bag will help the company meet that goal, he said.</p>
<p>FightCamp is already beefing up its free content. The company recently announced it will offer more than 100 free workout every week. These workouts are listed as &#8220;tracker optional,&#8221; which means they&#8217;re free and don&#8217;t require the punch trackers. These workouts will focus on shadowboxing, recovery, stretching, kickboxing and body weight exercises. For now, these free workouts will only be available on the iOS app since the recently added Android app is still in beta.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snapchat released an <a href="https://lens.snapchat.com/cec030acb86d4de7a6c976226eecef67?share_id=RUEyOTMw&amp;locale=en_US?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Organic&amp;utm_campaign=OYS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avatar lens</a> AR filter today, which makes you look like a Sims character. Or, in more modern parlance, it makes you look like what you&#8217;d look like in the metaverse. To use the lens, open your camera in the Snapchat app to <a href="https://lens.snapchat.com/cec030acb86d4de7a6c976226eecef67?share_id=RUEyOTMw&amp;locale=en_US?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Organic&amp;utm_campaign=OYS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scan the QR code</a> on Snapchat&#8217;s website, then look at how scarily smooth your skin is in the metaverse, where freckles and acne evidently do not exist.</p>
<p>A new Snapchat lens isn&#8217;t inherently notable, especially as the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/at-lens-fest-snap-debuts-creations-tools-for-more-sophisticated-augmented-reality-experiences/">goes all-in</a> on augmented reality &#8212; but this is a continuation of a years-long, on-and-off viral trend. And if the past is any indication, it&#8217;ll probably go viral and crop up on TikTok soon.</p>
<p>In August 2020, Snapchat released the <a href="https://lens.snapchat.com/0ad185e6dd5e418a9659fa96dce788e0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cartoon Face lens</a>, which users realized could be used to “Disneyfy” their pets — the tag <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@djangosmiles/video/6860585253157752070?is_copy_url=1&amp;is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#disneydog</a> jumped over to TikTok to get 40.9 million views. Then, Snapchat struck viral gold again that December when it released the <a href="https://lens.snapchat.com/449d01c9513c40288d74397352cb304e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cartoon lens</a>, which rendered more even realistic results for human faces than the previous iteration.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251081" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>But the app keeps manufacturing slightly improved versions of this trend, which end up going viral as well. Humans are so predictable.</p>
<p>In June of this year, the Disney-like trend struck again with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/14/everyone-you-know-is-a-disney-princess-which-means-ar-is-queen/">Cartoon Style 3D lens</a>, which earned 2.8 billion impressions in its first week after release. And now, we&#8217;ve arrived at the Avatar lens, which also makes your clothing look cartoonish, not just your face. What&#8217;s next, a lens that also makes our surroundings look like something that someone built on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/metas-horizon-worlds-is-available-in-the-us-and-canada-for-18-users/">Horizon Worlds</a>? Probably.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Snapchat hosted <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/lens-fest-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lens Fest</a>, a celebration of the app&#8217;s AR technology. The company announced at the event that there are over 250,000 lens creators from more than 200 countries. Combined, they have made 2.5 million lenses that have been viewed more than 3.5 trillion times. Meanwhile, on Snapchat&#8217;s TikTok clone Spotlight, the app awarded 12,000 creators <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/14/snap-paid-250-million-to-creators-on-its-tiktok-clone-this-year/">a total of $250 million</a> for their posts. The company says that over 65% of Spotlight submissions use one of Snapchat’s creative tools or lenses.</p>
<p>Companies like Niantic and Snapchat think that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/niantic-raises-300m-at-a-9b-valuation-to-build-the-real-world-metaverse/">augmented reality is better suited</a> to build the metaverse than virtual reality. But even for headset-loving tech giants like Meta, AR can help make us actually look like ourselves in the metaverse. The Snapchat Avatar filter makes me look like an unrealistic, Barbie-esque version of myself, yet it still feels a bit more personalized than my Meta Horizon avatar, which just looks like any random white woman with brown hair and glasses.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Still, there&#8217;s something disorienting about seeing ourselves like this &#8212; my avatar in the Snapchat lens looks like me, but my eyebrows become perfectly manicured, like I just got them tediously threaded by a beautician. My lips become fuller, like I&#8217;m wearing a plumping lip gloss, but I didn&#8217;t put on any makeup today.</p>
<p>In the VR metaverse, we need some sort of avatar to represent us, because otherwise, we&#8217;re just an invisible blob. Startups like <a href="https://readyplayer.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ready Player Me</a>, <a href="https://spatial.io/create-an-avatar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spatial</a> and <a href="https://genies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genies</a> are cropping up to help us craft our virtual personas. But in augmented reality, the premise is to alter the real world in a way that helps us engage more deeply in it. Snapchat&#8217;s AR filters are fun, but we don&#8217;t really need avatars in the AR metaverse, and maybe that&#8217;s a good thing &#8212; we already know <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how dangerous it can be</a> when we only present the best versions of ourselves online.</p>

<p>Kathy Lueders, head of NASA&#8217;s newly minted Space Operations Mission Directorate, joined us at TC Sessions: Space last week for a chat about the future of the agency and what she is looking forward to — and dreading — in the next decade of missions.</p>
<p>In the first place, Lueders explained the reasoning behind NASA&#8217;s decision in September to split the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate in two.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251131" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Thirty years ago it was really, in the human exploration area, it was Shuttle, and then it was Shuttle and station&#8230; Now we&#8217;ve added Commercial Crew, [Lunar] Gateway, you know, HLS [Human Landing System], I mean, we&#8217;re mushrooming!&#8221; she explained.</p>
<p>This was putting too much pressure on the existing structure and it was amicably decided to split off, essentially, the development and planning side from operations. Lueders said she was pleased to be put in charge of the latter.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best thing is I got to have, you know, the missions! I got to have the execution,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve spent probably about 15 years doing development. But my favorite part was when we started flying. So guess what — I&#8217;m firmly in the flying division. So I&#8217;m very, very happy to be there. I get to do all the launches and operations and I love it.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the big launches and landings tend to hog all the glory, Artemis and its related lunar missions are more diverse and wide-ranging than that. I asked what pieces of the puzzle may not be getting enough attention.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the infrastructure pieces that people don&#8217;t talk about,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;You know, we&#8217;re gonna need power on the moon. We&#8217;re going to need to be able to move cargo around on the moon. We&#8217;re going to need to be able to have communication and additional relays on the moon. We tend to not think of roads and power lines as sexy things. But this is infrastructure that, if you ever run a business, you need those kinds of things to be able to operate. Try to run a business without power — try to run a business without comms.&#8221;</p>

<p>But not all of her duties will be pleasant. She was among those who saw the ISS go up, and she will be there when it comes down — or at least, in the near term, is decommissioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh gosh&#8230; I mean, when I moved to JSC [Johnson Space Center], it was to go work on an International Space Station. And so I actually was one of the lucky people that came onto the space station program at <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/iss_assembly_2a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[mission] 2A</a>. Been on the job two weeks and I got to be at the launch, and there were people there that invested 10 years of their life and were there crying. And so I will be crying when we have to deorbit the Space Station,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But it was also very painful for us to, you know, retire the Shuttle. Part of the things we&#8217;ve got to recognize is when&#8217;s the right time, right?</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s the right time, because we really need to go off and we need to focus on living and working around the moon&#8230; and wherever other crazy place that NASA people dream up to be able to go to.&#8221;</p>
