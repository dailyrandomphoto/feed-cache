										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One of the fastest-growing apps in China right now, by installs, is the central bank&#8217;s digital yuan wallet. 261 million individual users (as opposed to enterprises), about one-fifth of the population, have set up e-CNY wallets so far, and 87.5 billion yuan ($13.78 billion) worth of transactions has been made using the digital fiat currency, Zou Lan, head of financial markets at the People&#8217;s Bank of China (PBOC), <a href="http://m.thepaper.cn/rss_newsDetail_16337430?from=sohu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> at a <a href="http://www.scio.gov.cn/xwfbh/xwbfbh/wqfbh/47673/47730/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press event</a> on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, China has been piloting the use of digital yuan in a number of major cities, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/11/china-digital-yuan-shenzhen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shenzhen</a>. People needed to enter a draw and apply to be early users in the beginning. Then at the start of 2022, in a clear sign of accelerating the trial, the PBOC made the e-CNY wallet available on the iOS and Android stores in China.</p>
<p>The digital yuan is by no means a manifestation of cryptocurrency, which is banned in China. The PBOC has <a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/en/3688110/3688172/4157443/4293696/2021071614584691871.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deemed</a> bitcoin and the likes highly volatile, speculative, lacking intrinsic value, and pointed out that cryptocurrencies could be an instrument of money-laundering.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258708" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The e-CNY aspires to achieve different results. Issued by the central bank, it serves as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/11/china-digital-yuan-shenzhen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statutory, digital version of China&#8217;s cash in circulation</a>, or &#8220;M0&#8221;; indeed, the regulator intends to make e-yuan payments <a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/en/3688110/3688172/4157443/4293696/2021071614584691871.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work even without the internet</a>, using NFC technology.</p>
<p>According to a research paper <a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/en/3688110/3688172/4157443/4293696/2021071614584691871.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> by the Working Group on e-CNY Research and Development at the central bank last year, the digital yuan aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>diversify the forms of cash provided to the public by<br />
the central bank, satisfy the public’s demand for digital cash and support financial inclusion;</li>
<li>support fair competition, efficiency and safety of retail payment services; and</li>
<li>echo the international initiative and explore the improvement of cross-border payment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though the e-CNY wallet is now downloadable in the Chinese app stores, only users in a list of pilot cities and at the upcoming Winter Olympics venue can actually sign up, top up their accounts, and spend the virtual currency at one of the 8 million &#8220;pilot scenarios,&#8221; such as making purchases on Alibaba and paying Didi rides.</p>
<p>To exchange cash into e-CNY, users will have to move money from one of the commercial banks authorized by the PBOC to operate and circulate the digital currency, including digital-only banks like Tencent-backed WeBank and Ant-backed MyBank.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In terms of its relationship with China&#8217;s popular payments services, the PBOC said in its report that e-CNY is supposed to &#8220;complement&#8221; rather than replace WeChat Pay and Alipay. For instance, it could support anonymity for small value transactions just like physical cash. In other cases, large amounts of funds sent from a provincial government to a town<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/11/china-digital-yuan-shenzhen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> could be paid in e-CNY</a> to prevent corruption using the digital currency&#8217;s traceable capabilities.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, though, e-CNY still needs to compete with the private payments giants on user experience, if it wants to achieve a meaningful active user base.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2020, Africa50, an infrastructure financier backed by the Africa Development Bank (AfDB) Group and a good number of African governments, hosted an innovation challenge that sought affordable and reliable solutions for last-mile internet connectivity across the continent. A proposal by <a href="https://poa.co.ke/">Poa Internet</a>, a Kenyan startup beat 673 others from across the world as a result of which it was added to Africa50’s investment pipeline in addition to winning a cash prize.</p>
<p>Slightly over one year after the win, the internet service provider (ISP) has received $28 million in a Series C funding round led by Africa50, bringing the total amount it has raised to date to $36 million. Also participating in the latest round was <a href="https://novastarventures.com/">Novastar Ventures</a>, one of the firm’s earliest backers.</p>
<p>Poa plans to use the new funding to grow its reach, first across Kenya then progressively to other countries in the continent.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258675" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We are focused on Kenya at the moment, but the problem we&#8217;re solving is continent-wide. And for us, it&#8217;s not just about getting people some connectivity. Our aim is to get a lot of people online and to give them a meaningful internet experience like the ability to stream videos, without worrying about how much data they&#8217;re consuming,” Poa Internet’s CEO and founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahalsall/?originalSubdomain=ke">Andy Halsall</a>, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Poa Internet currently serves over 12,000 customers (homes and small businesses) in Nairobi’s low and middle-income neighborhoods, and tens of thousands more through its street Wi-Fi connections. The startup has laid out its fiber network in neighborhoods that are typically not the first target markets for its competitors like Safaricom Home by East Africa’s biggest telco Safaricom, Faiba by Jamii Telecommunication Limited and Zuku.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2258680" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2258680" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2258680" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Founding-Team.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Founding-Team.jpeg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Founding-Team.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Founding-Team.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Founding-Team.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Founding-Team.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Founding-Team.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Founding-Team.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2258680" class="wp-caption-text">Poa Internet founding team from left to right: Mike Puchol (CTO), Andy Halsall (CEO), Chris Rhodes (COO) and DJ Koeman (CBDO)<strong>. Image Credits:</strong> Poa Internet</p></div></p>
<p>Poa Internet charges its customers a monthly fee of about $13, which is half the market rate, giving it a competitive edge. Its customers also have unlimited data usage, another aspect that makes their products attractive to internet users in the country, where major ISPs offer monthly subscription bundles with data caps.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup has also set up Wi-Fi hotspots in public areas, where users pay about $0.18 for 1 GB of data, 10 times cheaper than the country’s telcos charge for a similar bundle of non-expiring internet.</p>
<p>“Our internet speeds are 4mbps, which is fast enough for video, because everyone wants to stream Netflix, use YouTube, download movies and make video calls. So, we&#8217;ve designed our service to be fast enough to deliver video, but most importantly, our price is a winning factor,” said Halsall.</p>
<p>“Our primary focus is to get the price as low as possible and to operate in the communities that don&#8217;t have fiber connectivity or are unlikely to get fiber. Therefore, we&#8217;re not really going to compete really against anyone because we are going after a market sector that is not well served.”</p>
<p>Affordability remains one of the main roadblocks to internet access across the continent and Poa Internet service has been trying to solve this puzzle since it entered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/kenyan-bnpl-startup-lipa-later-eyes-more-african-markets-after-raising-12-million/">Kenya</a> in 2015.</p>
<p>Africa, and more narrowly sub-Saharan Africa, has the most expensive internet prices in the world, and this negatively impacts on the continent’s ability to grow its digital economies and to adapt to situations like the Covid pandemic. The pandemic’s containment measures, for instance, required most people to work from home and for students to continue learning online &#8212; but this remained impractical in most countries across the continent due to the lack of necessary gadgets and internet connectivity, partly due to underdeveloped infrastructure and pricing.</p>
<p>Benefits of affordable data and a more connected continent are massive in that as more people get connected sectors such as e-commerce and e-learning will experience a take-off.</p>
<p>There were 303 million people, which is less than a third of the population, connected to the mobile internet according to the 2021 GSM Association, an industry organization representing mobile operators, mobile economy <a href="https://data.gsmaintelligence.com/research/research/research-2021/the-mobile-economy-2021">report</a>. This figure is expected to grow to about 40% of this population by 2025. However, while mobile internet contributes a great deal in getting people online, as Halsall hinted earlier, the experience of limited connectivity is incomparable to freedom that comes with a limitless connection.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2258683" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2258683" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2258683" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Poa-Internet-targets-low-and-middle-income-neighborhoods.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Poa-Internet-targets-low-and-middle-income-neighborhoods.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Poa-Internet-targets-low-and-middle-income-neighborhoods.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Poa-Internet-targets-low-and-middle-income-neighborhoods.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Poa-Internet-targets-low-and-middle-income-neighborhoods.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Poa-Internet-targets-low-and-middle-income-neighborhoods.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Poa-Internet-targets-low-and-middle-income-neighborhoods.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Poa-Internet-targets-low-and-middle-income-neighborhoods.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2258683" class="wp-caption-text"><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Poa Internet currently serves homes and small businesses in Nairobi’s low and middle-income neighborhoods, and tens of thousands more through its street Wi-Fi connections. </span>Image Credits:</strong> Poa Internet (Brian Otieno)</p></div></p>
<p>“Poa has been instrumental in bridging the needs of last- mile connectivity, and their ultra-low-cost solutions can be used to address the significant connectivity gaps in Kenya and across the continent as a whole. This is particularly important at a time when societies and economic activities are increasingly becoming digitized as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Africa50 managing director and head of infrastructure investments at Africa50, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/razahasnani/">Raza Hasnani</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.africa50.com/">Africa50</a> currently has 31 shareholders including the AfDB, the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), Bank Al-Maghrib (the Central Bank of the Kingdom of Morocco, and 28 African countries.</p>
<p>“Increasing access to reliable and affordable internet connectivity is strongly aligned with the key pillars of Africa50’s strategy, and we are excited to be part of this high impact journey and to support Poa’s growth in Africa,” said Hasnani.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gogoro, the Taiwanese company best known for its electric Smartscooters and swappable battery infrastructure, has just added current strategic partner Hero MotoCorp, activist and impact investment firm Engine No. 1 and another investor to its PIPE investment, bringing the total funding to $285 million, up from $257 million.</p>
<p>The oversubscribed PIPE (private investment in public equity) round, which includes investors like Foxconn (Hon Hai), GoTo, Temasek, Generation Investment Management and others, comes to Gogoro in addition to the $345 million coming from Poema Global, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/gogoro-will-go-public-on-nasdaq-after-2-35b-spac-deal/">the special purpose acquisition company that Gogoro is expected to merge with</a> in Q1 2022.</p>
<p>“This additional funding, in addition to our recent F-4 filing, keeps us on track for closing in Q1,&#8221; said Bruce Aitken, chief financial officer of Gogoro, in a statement. &#8220;We have three investor groups in our PIPE. Existing investors who wanted to continue to support our vision, new strategic investors who can help us scale and new institutional investors. Adding Hero MotoCorp and Engine No. 1 continues to validate our strategy and plans. Hero MotoCorp is a key OEM and expansion partner and Engine No. 1 will provide strategic guidance on how environmental impact can drive economic value.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258670" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In April last year, Gogoro partnered with Hero MotoCorp, a market leader in India and one of the world&#8217;s largest two-wheeled vehicle makers, to build a joint battery-swapping network in India. HeroMotoCorp will also launch electric two-wheelers using Gogoro technology under its own brand.</p>
<p>Gogoro currently has market dominance in Taiwan, <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/12/21/gogoro-is-silently-crushing-the-domestic-electric-scooter-competition-and-its-not-even-close/">accounting for over 63,000 e-scooter registrations</a> in the country in the first 11 months of 2021. Its next closest competitor, Aeon, had just over 7,000 registrations. But Gogoro has its sights set on globally scaling its battery swapping infrastructure, which is where partnerships with local vehicle makers like Hero and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/10/gogoro-launches-battery-swapping-stations-in-china/">Chinese companies Yadea and DCJ</a> come in.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we go tackle these large markets, we need as many friends on our side as possible,&#8221; Horace Luke, founder and CEO of Gogoro, told TechCrunch. &#8220;It&#8217;s one thing to say, &#8216;We will partner with you and use your technology,&#8217; but it&#8217;s another to say, &#8216;We&#8217;re going to put money into your company to ensure that you have enough capital to actually light up my market.&#8217; So having vehicle partners coming in is great because it makes the conversation so much easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>The capital will also help Gogoro ensure momentum as it scales into new markets. While the company has accumulated over $1 billion in revenue and over 450,000 battery swapping subscribers over the past five years, it&#8217;s still not yet profitable.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re still not yet bottom line positive,&#8221; said Luke. &#8220;We still have a little way to go to build the scale that we need to in order to breakeven. Having more capital will help with that.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European startups collectively raised <a href="https://stateofeuropeantech.com/chapter/europe-global-tech-force/article/kicking-full-gear/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a record $100 billion+ in funding in 2021</a>, a sign of their swelling ranks, ambitions and stature. Now, a VC in London has closed a record round of funding to cater specifically to that opportunity. <a href="https://www.blossomcap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blossom Capital</a>, which makes investments in European startups at the Series A stage, has raised $432 million in its third fund, from a mix of limited partners that span Europe and the U.S. At $432 million, is the largest fund to date focused on European startups&#8217; Series A rounds, Blossom said.</p>
<p>(Note: Balderton closed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/balderton-closes-600m-fund-its-biggest-yet-earmarked-for-early-stage-investments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$600 million round for &#8220;early stage&#8221; investments last year</a>, so this I guess gives Blossom room to claim to be the biggest to focus on Series A alone.)</p>
<p>Founded by Ophelia Brown, formerly of Index Ventures and Local Globe, Blossom&#8217;s growth has mirrored that of the startup landscape in Europe.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258586" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For years, all the action happened in Silicon Valley &#8212; so much so that even when startups were hatched in Europe, the U.S. is where they went to find traction and grow, raise serious money, and hire talent. VCs based there often even mandated startups move to the U.S., and specifically the Bay Area, as a condition of funding.</p>
<p>But over time, the Valley became more expensive and competitive. So both founders, and investors &#8212; armed with ever more money from LPs keen to reap the rewards of a rapidly-growing tech industry &#8212; have started to do business further afield. That trend was given a big fillip in the wake of Covid-19, which shifted perceptions on where and how we should work. Now, the Valley VCs are opening and funding operations here to meet the opportunity.</p>
<p>If one of the best attributes of a venture capitalist is that he or she can spot (and then fund) a trend early on, it&#8217;s a pretty strong vote of confidence that Blossom was very prescient in identifying how things would evolve for startups in Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;We launched back in 2018 thinking there was a gap in Series A funding,&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;Now we see that opportunity set growing each year, and not just in London, Paris and Berlin, but a lot of other cities in Europe.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In keeping with that, so too have the size of rounds grown here.</p>
<p>A decade ago, it was not uncommon for a Series A for a European startup to be under $5 million. But in 2021, the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/878807/median-venture-capital-deal-size-in-europe-by-series/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">median size</a> started to push $10 million, and is often much, much higher than this. Of course, this is still being outpaced by rounds in the U.S., where the median Series A in 2021 was <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/startups-rounds-vc-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$13 million</a>, but again can be much higher than this. (And I&#8217;m willing to bet that as we see more successful exits, major growth milestones, and skyrocketing valuations come around the corner, Series A rounds across the different regions will converge to be level with each other.)</p>
<p>The VCs making their way into Europe, meanwhile, are less competitors right now than partners, looking to Blossom for better local insights for future deals. Co-investment partners have included Accel, Addition, Coatue, Greenoaks and Tiger Global, the company says.</p>
<p>Blossom has to date been a generalist VC, investing in a pretty diverse range of startups that have included instant delivery startup Dija (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/after-acquiring-dija-and-fancy-instant-grocery-startup-gopuff-launches-in-the-uk-en-route-to-european-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by GoPuff</a> last year); payments specialist Checkout.com (which last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/checkout-com-raises-450-million-and-reaches-15-billion-valuation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a $450 million round that valued it at $15 billion); business forecasting specialist <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/14/pigment-series-b-business-planning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pigment</a>; and cybersecurity, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/omnichannel-customer-messaging-platform-superchat-raises-15-6m-round-led-by-blossom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">messaging</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/24/api-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video startups</a> and more.</p>
<p>This latest fund will mostly follow the same course, save for one very notable exception: one-third of it has been earmarked specifically for cryptocurrency startups.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an area where Brown said she and firm were interested early on &#8212; she said she personally bought her first bitcoin back in 2012 &#8212; and despite some of the speculation and volatility that have been hallmarks of the cyrpto market, she remains optimistic that there will be some significant companies emerging out of that in the longer term.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.moonpay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moonpay</a>, a platform that lets people buy and sell cryptocurrency using fiat currency, is the firm&#8217;s first big investment in the space: it was part of the startup&#8217;s an eye-watering $555 million Series A in November last year (as we said, these rounds were sometimes significantly higher than $10 million).</p>
<p>Going forward, managing partner Alex Lim (who joined Blossom recently from IVP) said that the firm wants to do more in crypto infrastructure, Web3 and protocols, and more consumer services.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our focus is to invest early,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just a bubble. There are markets being created here.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2258710" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blossom-Partners.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blossom-Partners.jpg 6820w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blossom-Partners.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blossom-Partners.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blossom-Partners.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blossom-Partners.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blossom-Partners.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blossom-Partners.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blossom-Partners.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s notable that Blossom was founded and is led by a woman (Imran Ghory, the third partner, is pictured above left, with Lim and Brown). Females remain a rarity in venture capital, especially in Europe. Brown said that diversity is a significant factor for Blossom, but it&#8217;s approach is to work with portfolio companies to bring more diversity into their ranks, rather than use that as part of the overall investment thesis.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don’t think about diversity in terms of [our investment] agenda but in terms of how do they think about building that into their team or products, or addressing it with customers,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how the influx of yet more capital will impact how startups in Europe grow over the longer term, not just how they scale but whether that impacts their exit prospects, too. It was not that long ago that a promising startup in Europe most often took one of two routes: move to the U.S. to grow, or get acquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we invest in a company, we assume it’s a standalone business for the longer term, and I think the chances of that have now significantly increased,&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;Selling a company for more than $250 million was practically impossible 10 years ago. Now startups have a lot more options.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The digital banking space in Africa is taking shape as neobanks on the continent grow in numbers like their global counterparts</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Venture capital bet from institutional investors in this class of fintechs is massive and in the latest development from Africa, it seems individual investors appetite is increasing likewise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.finclusiongroup.com/">Finclusion Group</a>, a fintech that uses AI algorithms to provide financial services to African customers via an array of credit-centric products, has raised $20 million in debt and equity pre-Series A financing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors in the round include Andela and Flutterwave co-founder Iyin Aboyeji (who invested via his VC firm Future Africa), LendInvest founder Christian Faes and ComplyAdvantage founder Charlie Delingpole.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258606" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others include Amandine Lobelle, Jai Mahtani, Sudeep Ramnani, Jonathan Doerr, Richard Aseme (RCA Ventures), Klemens Hallmann, among others. They join the likes of Manuel Koser, Alexander Schuetz and Christian Angermayer, Leo Stiegeler, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">investors in the company’s previous round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finclusion’s debt financing, which makes up the larger share </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overall</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> round, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was provided by local currency funds in Eswatini and South Africa. It follows the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2021/african-fintech-finclusion-raises-20m-for-https://ventureburn.com/2021/09/african-fintech-platform-finclusion-group-secures-20-million-in-funding/nterprise-development/">$20 million debt facility</a> supplied by emerging markets debt provider Lendable last September.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fintech intends to grow existing operations in South Africa, Eswatini, Kenya, Namibia and Tanzania and expand into Mozambique and Uganda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a statement by the company, the expansion, facilitated by the recent financing, is part of Finclusion’s strategy to “drive financial inclusion within market segments that have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">traditionally</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">been underserved</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across the African continent, with a current focus on southern and eastern Africa.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018, Finclusion has built consumer-facing credit products to close the credit gap in countries where it operates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s SmartAdvance, where Finclusion, via employer partnerships, offers solutions for employees’ financial well-being. Its wage streaming product provides payroll loans and future wage loans where employees can take loans off the back of their salary, deduct from their payroll, and lend through employer relationships. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Africa-focused fintech has disbursed over $300 million worth of loans to more than 240,000 customers up until this point</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Following the Lendable debt capital raise in September, the group has recorded an uptick in monthly disbursements, increasing 140% over the last 18 months. Finclusion’s loan book also grew 30% from December 2020 to December 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this growth, Finclusion only has 28,000 customers with active loans outstanding, almost 10% of the total customers the company has served since 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is one of the reasons we are going into a neobank strategy to maintain old and new users rather than </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">effectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> churning them out,” said chief executive Timothy Nuy to TechCrunch on why the credit provider is transforming into a neobank now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuy affirmed that it had always been Finclusion’s intention to become a neobank. Leading with a credit-led approach— which several digital banks across Africa such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/nigerian-digital-bank-carbon-hit-240m-in-payments-processed-last-year-up-89-from-2019/">Carbon</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiger-global-leads-42m-series-b-in-nigerian-credit-led-neobank-fairmoney/">FairMoney</a> have adopted—was a great customer acquisition tool for the company, he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">African customers are in dire need of credit. But from a long term perspective of a company offering </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> loans, it can be hard to compete with other lenders that provide deposits and investments, financial services that any lender, backed with years of customers’ credit history, can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">efficiently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> cross-sell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finclusion, taking a cue from other credit-first neobanks, has started diversifying its offerings. Nuy said the company has an insurance product and plans to offer savings products, cards and buy now, pay later offerings via a merchant network in a bid to form a pan-African neobank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the well-funded digital banks on the continent are either in a single country or, at most, two countries. Carbon operates in Nigeria and Kenya; FairMoney has customers in Nigeria and India; Kuda, a deposit-led neobank <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/kuda-the-african-challenger-bank-raises-55m-at-a-500m-valuation/">worth half a billion dollars</a> in its last round, only serves customers in Nigeria; and Patrice Motsepe-backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/south-african-digital-bank-tymebank-lands-109m-from-uk-and-phillippines-investors/">TymeBank</a> focuses on South Africa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A pan-African approach doesn’t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">necessarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mean more customers (Finclusion, despite its presence in five countries, has fewer customers than the aforementioned digital banks). Still, Finclusion’s strategy is pretty ambitious compared to other digital banks’ play-it-safe model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there’s a lot of similarities, often between regional markets. Many things we do for South Africa will work the same way as in Nairobi. A lot of what we do there, we can use it in Kampala and Dar es Salaam with some adjustments,” said Nuy on how Finclusion operates across </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rolling it [digital banking] out across </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> countries, if you have the operational experience, isn’t difficult. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that’s where we have an edge that we can build towards a pan-African play quicker than others. And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that experience is something that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sets us apart right now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finclusion also uses a holistic tech stack that gets </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">continuously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> upgraded with specific amendments in each country. This way, the company can scale across </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> geographies simultaneously and efficiently, said the chief executive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the company has administrative hubs to oversee operations in its five markets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With one each in Kenya and South Africa for the eastern and southern regions (its tech teams are also in these countries), Finclusion says it will open another in West Africa soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having proven that it can raise institutional debt (over $32 million in the last six months from Lendable and 12 local currency facilities) and build credit histories of thousands of customers, Finclusion needs to increase its efforts on distribution to reach neobank-like numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its employer partnerships offering provides an avenue to achieve </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">this. With over 1.2 million employees working for its existing employer partners, Finclusion says it holds many potential users at its disposal to activate in the long run.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yoga, personal trainers and other kinds of online coaches have a bewildering array of platforms on which they can launch their class, either in platforms specializing in verticals (PTs) or more general ones.</p>
<p>A new UK player hopes &#8211; perhaps a little optimistically &#8211; hopes to make inroads into this market with a ‘one stop shop’ for live online coaches.</p>
<p><a href="https://livehive.biz/">LiveHive</a> is aimed at anyone coaching online &#8211; from yoga teachers to professionals offering specialist expertise, personal trainers, influencers and lifestyle gurus. In other words, it’s trying to be all things to all coaches, whether full time, part time, or as as a side income.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258140" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The B2B platform offers a browser-based video studio; integrated payments and payouts; automatic recordings; integrated social media, as well a SMS and email notifications for clients.</p>
<p>Co-founder and CEO of LiveHive, Dave Nicholson said: “Looking at the UK’s growing knowledge economy, it was clear that providing live online coaching as a business was too technically complex, time consuming and confusing. LiveHive makes the entire process simpler, easier and more effective for all involved.”<br />
 <br />
LifeHive has bootstrapped to date and now plans a seed round.</p>
<p>It is of course up against some large and better-funded players including Moxie and Kuula.tv.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud-based point of sales for small, medium and large-sized restaurants has increased </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tremendously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in both size and popularity. The market, dominated by incumbents like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/toast-the-restaurant-management-platform-has-raised-250m-at-a-2-7b-valuation/">Toast</a> and upcoming players such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/marginedge-a-restaurant-management-software-company-raises-18m/">MarginEdge</a> and Brazil’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/digital-restaurant-startup-zak-orders-up-new-capital-on-mission-to-be-toast-of-latam/">Zak</a>, has its value pegged at over $70 billion globally and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is expected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to reach $116 billion in the next four years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with most technologies, Africa is playing catch up in this food-tech segment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But a few startups are paying attention to the market, positioning themselves to become top players when it matures</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One such startup is Nigeria’s <a href="https://orda.africa/">Orda</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">formerly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> known as StarKitchens. Today, it is announcing that it has secured a $1.1 million pre-seed round to scale its software across Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which describes itself as a ‘cloud-based restaurant operating system built for African chefs and food business owners,’ had its round led by pan-African investor LoftyInc Capital.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258517" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other institutional investors include Techstars Boulder, Magic Fund, Hustle Fund, Norrsken Foundation, Microtraction, DFS Labs, Oxford Seed Fund, Enza Capital, Agrolay Advisors, and angel investors such as Buycoins’ Ire Aderinokun, Jesse Ovia and Ademola Adesina.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While big restaurants and restaurant chains are often capable of setting their management systems or using well-known point-of-sale providers, thousands of smaller restaurants in Africa rely on offline methods such as pen and paper to produce receipts and make reconciliations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orda’s addressable market is this segment of Africa’s restaurant industry. With its cloud-based software, Orda wants these businesses not to rely on manual ways of managing their businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There are two kinds of restaurants where the majority of our focus is on &#8212; the bukkas [local restaurants] and the small restaurants, for instance,” Orda co-founder and CEO <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/guyfuti">Guy Futi</a> told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These are the restaurants that have been using paper and pen and then that spend three to four hours on reconciliation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They don’t have access to software that does analytics and inventory management right off the gate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, we decided to build a cloud-based restaurant software tailor-made for Africa’s massive chefs and restaurant industry</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The typical examples of food or restaurant-focused tech businesses help restaurants make online deliveries, such as Jumia Food or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/07/glovo-to-double-down-african-investment-in-the-next-12-months-but-will-it-stay-put/">Glovo</a>; others try to handle entire supply chains like YC-backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/25/vendease-gets-3-2m-to-help-hotels-and-restaurants-buy-food-supplies-in-africa/">Vendease</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orda’s full-stack and end-to-end approach &#8212; a result of constant building and iteration according to CTO <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/adinlewa-akinwale-a59625117">Fikayo Akinwale</a> &#8212; helps restaurants manage these processes online while integrating local payments, logistics, inventory management and business analytics features.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Orda </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was built</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from a near 18 months of a collaborative customer feedback loop. We listened to everything, from how African restaurants reconcile inventory, how customers pay, to how they handle logistics and more. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">confidently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> say that no one has done as much work as we have to build an end-to-end solution for our food business owners.”, said the CTO in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restaurants who use the management platform also have access to a dashboard that allows them to accept and process orders from food delivery services Jumia Food, Glovo, Bolt Food, and in-store, website, social media channels like WhatsApp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orda claims no other company in its space has made similar integrations. These integrations, including an ePos solution that restaurants can operate in remote areas with little or no internet coverage, give Orda an edge </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the market, said Futi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Futi also remarked that the adoption from restaurants in markets where it operates (Nigeria and Kenya) has been “very seamless,” adding that the cloud-based software doubles its growth rate every three weeks. In a statement, Orda said its gross merchandise value (GMV) grows 15% week-on-week while processing up to 10,000 transactions weekly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Orda charges restaurants between $5 (~₦2,500) to $50 (~₦30,000) monthly to access its software. Having closed its pre-seed and working towards raising a seed round, the CEO said Orda would build out financial products, especially in lending, and venture into processing payments for restaurants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orda is somewhat replicating the business model of companies like Toast that have noticed massive growth after launching fintech technology solutions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, 80% of the U.S. company’s <a href="https://pos.toasttab.com/news/toast-announces-third-quarter-2021-financial-results">third-quarter revenue of $486.4 million</a> came from payment processing and offering financial products; however, most of its total costs incurred came from the segment as well</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to become like the Toast of Africa,” expressed the chief executive, adding that Orda would also double down on its white-label mobile applications (similar to Toast Takeout) for restaurants that leverage its cloud-based infrastructure to operate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Futi, who founded the company with Akinwale,</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/medomwande/"> Mark Edomwande,</a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olakunle-ogungbamila/"> Kunle Ogungbamila</a>, and<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/namir-el-khouri-9b77a253/"> Namir El-Khouri</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2020, said with the new and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funding, Orda is working on an expansion into South Africa by the end of this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Idris Ayo Bello, the managing partner of lead investor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/loftyinc-capital-launches-third-fund-at-10m-for-a-more-diverse-portfolio-of-african-startups/">LoftyInc Capital</a>, said this of the investment, “We loved investing in Orda because it is building the core digital infrastructure for restaurants across Africa. The team has done the hard work of figuring out the core problems that African restaurant owners are facing and is building a solution that can revolutionise the food business across the continent.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="http://spendesk.com">Spendesk</a> is announcing that it has raised an extension to its Series C round. Tiger Global is investing $114 million (€100 million) in the startup. Following today’s funding round, the company says that is has reached a valuation of more than $1.14 billion (more than €1 billion).</p>
<p>In other words, Spendesk is a new unicorn in the French tech ecosystem. Funding news has been accelerating over the last few months in France. In January alone, five startups announced that they have crossed the threshold to reach unicorn status —&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/payroll-startup-payfit-is-frances-latest-unicorn-as-it-raises-289-million/">PayFit</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/09/ankorstore-reaches-2-billion-valuation-two-years-after-launching-its-wholesale-marketplace/">Ankorstore</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/business-banking-startup-qonto-raises-552-million-at-5-billion-valuation/">Qonto</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/16/warehouse-robotics-system-exotec-raises-335-million/">Exotec</a> and Spendesk.</p>
<p>Back Market, an e-commerce marketplace focused on refurbished smartphones and electronics devices, has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/back-market-reaches-5-7b-valuation-for-its-refurbished-device-marketplace/">raised a mega round</a> and reached a $5.7 billion valuation.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258559" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Let’s go back to Spendesk. The startup offers an all-in-one corporate spend management platform for medium companies in Europe. Originally focused on virtual cards for online payments, the company has expanded its product offering to tackle everything related to corporate spending.</p>
<p>Spendesk customers can order physical cards for employees, team members can use the platform to pay outstanding invoices, file expense reports, manage budgets and generate spending reports. By offering everything in a single service, Spendesk wants to simplify accounting and approvals in general so that money moves more freely.</p>
<p>The startup defines its platform as a “7-in-1 spend management solution”, meaning that Spendesk is no longer just a product that lets you order debit cards for your employees.</p>
<p>“We have had this goal since the beginning — we really want to become this platform, this operational system to manage your spending,” co-founder and CEO Rodolphe Ardant told me. “When we started working on the product, we looked at each use case and designed the right workflow for that.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In particular, Spendesk helps you formalize your internal processes. You can define team budgets, set up complicated approval workflows for expensive payments, automate some pesky tasks, such as VAT extraction.</p>
<p>“We target mid-market clients. Those are customers with 50 to 1,000 employees. We have a few clients that are bigger than that and a few clients that are smaller than that,” Ardant said.</p>
<p>And the company currently has 3,500 clients — around&nbsp;half of them are based in France while other clients are mostly based in Germany and the U.K. Clients have spent €3 billion through Spendesk in 2021 alone.</p>
<p>With its central positioning in the financial stack, Spendesk needs to interface perfectly with other financial tools — banks on one side and ERP products on the other side.</p>
<p>The startup currently supports many of the popular accounting tools used by European companies, such as Xero and Datev. Spendesk customers can also export transaction batches and import them into Sage, Cegid and other accounting software solutions.</p>
<p>Spendesk is also working on automating the integrations with your bank accounts, which could be particularly useful for companies with multiple bank accounts. For instance, you could imagine setting up a rule that automatically triggers a transfer between your German bank account and your Spendesk account when you want to pay a German supplier.</p>

<h2>Spend management in Europe</h2>
<p>Spendesk isn’t the only spend management solution in Europe. There are some competitors, such as <a href="https://www.pleo.io/en">Pleo</a>, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/pleo-picks-up-200m-at-a-4-7b-valuation-to-build-the-next-generation-of-business-expense-management/">reached a $4.7 billion valuation</a>, and <a href="https://www.soldo.com">Soldo</a> — another well-funded competitor as it has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/soldo-raises-180m-for-its-expense-management-platform-for-businesses/">raised $180 million</a> last year.</p>
<p>In the U.S. as well, companies like <a href="https://www.brex.com">Brex</a> and <a href="https://ramp.com">Ramp</a> have reached sky-high valuations. And yet, Spendesk doesn’t think it has the same positioning as American startups.</p>
<p>“On the American market, it shouldn&#8217;t be called the spend management industry — it’s the corporate card industry. Players like Brex and Ramp position themselves as a payment method,” Spendesk co-founder and CEO Rodolphe Ardant told me. “Europe’s corporate culture is a culture of debit — not credit. We don’t provide payment methods, we provide a process.”</p>
<p>It’s a slight difference in product positioning, so it’s going to be interesting to see if a European spend management startup can successfully enter the U.S. and vice versa.</p>
<p>When it comes to business model as well, Spendesk considers itself as a software-as-a-service company with recurring subscriptions. The startup didn’t want to share any hard numbers for its revenue. Its CEO just said that Spendesk’s revenue “more than doubles every year.”</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, Spendesk plans to triple the size of its team over the next two years. The company plans to have 1,000 employees by the end of 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Crypto.com, a popular cryptocurrency exchange, has extended its venture arm&#8217;s fund size to $500 million as it looks to more aggressively back early-stage startups to help the nascent ecosystem grow, following similar moves by rivals Binance, Coinbase and FTX.</p>
<p>The broadening of Crypto.com Capital comes less than a year after the Singapore-headquartered firm unveiled its maiden fund of $200 million. The fund, unlike those of many of its rivals, has no LPs (meaning, it&#8217;s fully financed by the firm&#8217;s balance sheet.)</p>
<p>The maiden fund, whose individual checks run up to $10 million in size, has been so far deployed to back about 20 startups including YGG SEA, multi-chain crypto portfolio tracker DeBank, cross-chain token infrastructure Efinity and Ethereum scaling solution Matter Labs.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258617" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Crypto.com will continue to focus on backing early-stage startups, said Jon Russell, who joined the firm as a general partner this month, in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>With the fund, Crypto.com is broadly focusing on gaming, decentralized-finance and startups innovating on cross-chain solutions. But he cautioned that the industry could change and expand, as it has in recent years, to areas “we don’t know about,” hence the firm is keeping an eye out on everything.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s announcement also further illustrates the growing involvement of cryptocurrency exchanges in being the rainmaker – and beneficiary – of the ecosystem which encompasses the industry in which they operate.</p>
<p>FTX, which has backed over 15 startups, last week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/15/the-race-to-fund-cryptos-future-sure-is-expensive/">announced a $2 billion crypto fund</a>. Its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, also owns Alameda Research, a venture firm that has backed close to 100 web3 startups.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Coinbase Ventures, the investment arm of the only crypto exchange that is publicly traded, and Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, are also among the most prolific investors in the web3 space.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2258633" style="width: 1210px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2258633" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2258633 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venture-investment-crypto-2021.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="602" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venture-investment-crypto-2021.jpg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venture-investment-crypto-2021.jpg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venture-investment-crypto-2021.jpg?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venture-investment-crypto-2021.jpg?resize=768,385 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venture-investment-crypto-2021.jpg?resize=680,341 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/venture-investment-crypto-2021.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2258633" class="wp-caption-text">Venture investment in crypto / web3 in 2021 by category (Image credits: Galaxy Digital)</p></div></p>
<p>The funding activity in the space, even as most of the aforementioned names often co-invest in startups, is at an all-time high. VCs invested more than $33 billion in crypto/web3 startups in 2021, more than all prior years combined, Galaxy Digital, another prolific investor in the space, wrote in a recent report.</p>
<p>“Valuations in the crypto/blockchain space were 141% higher than the rest of the venture capital space in Q4, highlighting a founder-friendly environment and the intense competition among investors for deal allocations,” the report added.</p>
<p>Scores of venture capital firms have also raised new funds for their crypto investments. Just last year, Andreessen Horowitz <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/24/andreessen-horowitz-triples-down-on-blockchain-startups-with-massive-2-2-billion-crypto-fund-iii/">added a $2.2 billion crypto fund</a>, Paradigm <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/crypto-vc-firm-paradigm-debuts-monster-2-5-billion-fund/">unveiled a $2.5 billion fund</a>, and Hivemind Capital Partners announced a $1.5 billion fund. Katie Haun, who co-led a16z&#8217;s $2.2 billion crypto fund, has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/katie-haun-is-splitting-off-from-a16z-to-launch-her-own-crypto-fund/">left the firm to launch her own crypto-focused fund</a>.</p>
<p>Russell – a former journalist who previously had stints at TechCrunch, The Next Web, and The Ken – said Crypto.com is backing startups to help the ecosystem grow.</p>
<p>“If you’re in the industry, it’s in your interest to help companies grow in the ecosystem and the ecosystem itself to grow,” he said. (Worth pointing out that Solana, Avalanche, Polkadot &#8212; as well as some of their major investors &#8212; are also aggressively backing startups that are building applications for the native blockchains.)</p>
<p>The startups Crypto.com backs are under no obligation to list their tokens on Crypto.com over any of its rivals or offer the exchange any other preferential treatment, he said. The exchange team similarly doesn’t have a soft spot for the investment arm’s portfolio firms, he added.</p>
<p>(What&#8217;s up with the career move? “I’ve been crypto curious for a number of years but I wasn’t gasping to dive in full-time. This project appeals to me because Crypto.com is ambitious but yet it does things the right way. There’s certainly a lot of hype and hot air in crypto and web3 right now, but it’s impossible to ignore the talent that’s pouring into the industry,&#8221; he said.)</p>
<p>Crypto.com, which started its life as a blog of professor Matt Blaze (who <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/07/rip-crypto/">sold the domain to the crypto exchange</a>), has aggressively expanded in the past year as it looks to court more users. The Singapore-headquartered firm last year agreed to pay more than $700 million for the naming rights of the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The downtown Los Angeles complex has been rebranded as Crypto.com Arena for the next 20 years.</p>
<p>The firm, which bills itself as the &#8220;fastest-growing&#8221; crypto exchange, said at the time of the announcement that the move is positioned to make cryptocurrencies mainstream. Crypto.com, which processes trade volumes of over $2.5 billion every day, also teamed up with Hollywood star Matt Damon last year to promote the brand and cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The Damon-starring ad equated buying crypto tokens and NFTs to one of the greatest and boldest accomplishments in the history of humankind. Hyperbole, to be sure, but having the most mainstream American actor as Crypto.com’s celebrity sponsor has certainly helped bring the trading platform, and all that it sells, into the mainstream. The ad went viral and also attracted criticism for being cringeworthy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://mioapp.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mio</a>, the Vietnamese social commerce platform, has raised an $8 million Series A, less than a year after announcing its seed round. The funding was led by Jungle Ventures, with participation from Patamar Capital and Oliver Jung. Existing investors investors GGV, Venturra, Hustle Fund, iSEED SEA and Gokul Rajaram also returned for the round.</p>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/mio-a-social-commerce-startup-focused-on-smaller-cities-and-rural-areas-in-vietnam-raises-1m-seed/">first covered Mio at the time of its $1 million seed funding in May 2021</a>. Founded in 2020, Mio is a group buying platform that focuses on selling fresh produce and groceries in Tier 2 and 3 cities in Vietnam. The company is able to offer next day delivery because it built a logistics infrastructure that enables it to send produce directly from farms to customers.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Mio, a social commerce startup focused on smaller cities and rural areas in Vietnam, raises $1M seed&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/20/mio-a-social-commerce-startup-focused-on-smaller-cities-and-rural-areas-in-vietnam-raises-1m-seed/embed/#?secret=oC0gR6guX6" data-secret="oC0gR6guX6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Series A brings Mio’s total raised to $9.1 million, and will be used to expand its logistics and fulfillment system, enter new areas in Vietnam and add new product categories like fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and household appliances.</p>
<p>Mio co-founder and chief executive officer Trung Huynh said that since TechCrunch first covered Mio seven months ago, it has achieved 10x gross merchandise value growth, a 10x increase in agents, or resellers, and grew its team from 60 people to 240. It now fulfills more than 10,000 pieces of fresh produce per day, operating in Ho Chi Minh, Thu Duc, Binh Duong, Dong Nai and Long An, with plans to expand into northern Vietnam.</p>
<p>The numbers “strengthened our conviction in this model and its potential,” he said. “We need fresh capital to accelerate hiring, product development and supply chain to keep up with the pace of growth as we deepen our presence in existing geographies and expand to new provinces.”</p>
<p>Mio is able to offer next day deliveries because its vertically integrated mayor layers of the value chain, including procurement, warehousing, order sorting and bulk delivery. The startup owns the majority of its logistics infrastructure and uses its own fleet of couriers. Its ability to delivery fresh produce directly from farms to customers in less than 16 hours contributed to higher customer retention and growth, Huynh said, and it will continue to shorten delivery times. .</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Mio resellers are called Mio Partners. Huynh said one of the driving factors behind Mio is targeting the right people for the program, or “housewives and stay-home-moms in lower income regions who love sharing value-for-money products to their social circle of friends.”</p>
<p>They aggregate orders, usually from friends and family, and orders are delivered to them in batches for distribution. The startup claims Mio Partners can make up to $400 a month, including a 10% commission on each order and additional commissions based on the monthly performance of other resellers they referred to the program.</p>
<p>“There is a strong possibility” that Mio will expand beyond Vietnam, Huynh said, “but will only be considered at a more appropriate time after we successfully built our playbook for Vietnam.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">South Korea-based human resources management platform <a href="https://flex.team/"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">flex</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> announced today it has closed a $32 million Series B round at a valuation of $287 million. The latest funding, which brings its total raised to $42 million, was led by </span><a href="https://www.greenoaks.com/"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Greenoaks</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, with participation from <a href="https://dst-global.com/">DST Global Partners</a>.  </span></p>
<p>The startup’s mission is to enable corporations to automate and streamline manual human resources work processes and focus more on people. Its automation tools optimize the employee experience to ensure seamless data flow across groups for use in payroll, e-signature support, on/offboarding and people analytics. <span data-preserver-spaces="true">It also plans to launch performance review and talents relation management tools in the first quarter of 2022. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“At flex we define HR as Human Relations, not Human Resources. We believe HR teams deserve world-class software to manage and service their employees, but today it’s clear that many organizations still use spreadsheets or legacy products to make ends meet, said Haenam Chang, CEO of flex. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258380" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The two-year-old startup will use the proceeds to scale operations to meet demand, advance its HR automation and SaaS products and increase its headcount.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Series B funding comes on the back of growth in revenue of almost ten times, compared to last year, driven by a number of product launches and new customers. The startup has primarily been serving SMBs in the IT sector. However, flex plans to expand the addressable market by targeting new industries in the SMB space this year. It did not disclose any user or customer numbers when asked. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Currently, flex is focused on growing in South Korea by offering a SaaS solution that modernizes the HR functions and processes, which have been slow to adapt to technical progress over the past 20 years. The company said its deep understanding of cultural nuances in people management and the HR regulations in the country help flex to be well-positioned to offer a set of products tailored to South Korean businesses.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“While some companies have adopted solutions to track and improve how they manage their employees, most still rely on gut instinct or insufficient data to make ad-hoc decisions on employees. At flex, we empower customers with a reliable source of employee data and a rich set of tools to manage their people, maximizing individual and organizational performance. Our goal isn’t just to provide a great HR software solution – it’s to empower companies to better track and manage their most important assets, their people,&#8221; Chang said. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Korea is one of the world’s largest and most dynamic economies but has historically lacked a native solution for companies to manage and pay their employees – leaving businesses frustrated and left to develop their own homegrown solutions,” said Josh Cho of Greenoaks. “Now, flex is rapidly building the country’s first next-generation human resources information system and payroll platform. We are excited about their vision for an end-to-end product that will let companies handle all their HR functions in a single place, from performance management to recruiting to payroll and more.” </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian agritech startup Arya, which reaches hundreds of thousands of farmers in the South Asian market and helps them store and sell their produce and secure credit, has raised $60 million in a new financing round as it enters a new phase of growth.</p>
<p>Asia Impact SA, Lightrock India and Quona Capital co-led the $46 million Series C financing round. US International Development France Corporation and others provided an additional $14 million as debt. The new round values the eight-year-old, Noida-based startup at $300 million, a person familiar with the matter said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.arya.ag">Arya</a> is attempting to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/arya-raises-21-million-for-its-agritech-and-finance-platform/">solve three challenges</a> that have distressed farmers in India for decades. Only about a third of the yields they produce reaches the big markets, where most of the sales occur, creating an uneven concentration that continues to deprive millions of farmers from being able to efficiently store and sell their produce.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258589" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The vast majority of farmers struggle to find buyers for their yields, and they typically go through a cash crunch until they have sold the produce.</p>
<p>Arya, co-founded by Prasanna Rao, is addressing this through a network of close to 10,000 warehouses, up from about 1,500 a year ago, it has seeded across 21 Indian states. By making these warehouses available to farmers near their farms, the startup has made it possible for them to be able to store their produce for the first time.</p>
<p>The warehouse is designed to store grain produce from the farmers for about three months and gives them insurance coverage. Farmers are able to monitor in real-time as the produce leaves their farm to the nearby warehouse, establishing a level of transparency and trust that is crucial to court farmers, said Rao in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>At the warehouse, Arya also helps farmers connect with buyers and provides them the option to negotiate on prices. “Because we hold the commodity in our warehouses, we have complete visibility into quantity and quality. This is how we are able to establish a connect between the buyer and seller,” he said, adding that the startup has visibility into grains worth over $2 billion on its platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup has devised a level of sophistication that it is able to spin up a new warehouse within two days in any region they are required, he said. Arya doesn&#8217;t own these warehouses and instead revamps warehouses owned by other businesses. There are over 100,000 of such warehouses spread across the country and most of them are being under-utilised.</p>
<p>Arya works with farmer associations to reach the farmers. The farmers can use Arya.ag website or use traditional ways such as guidance provided in-person to use the platform and clear any confusions.</p>
<p>But the work isn&#8217;t done there.</p>
<p>As we have seen in the case of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/indian-e-commerce-udaan-raises-250-million/"> tens of millions of neighbourhood stores in India</a>, the farmers also rely heavily on the earnings they make from selling their current batches of produce before being able to start a new season of cropping.</p>
<p>Arya works with banks and non-banking financial institutions to help these farmers secure loans, allowing them to get back to work while their produces are sold. The $18 million it has raised as debt in the new round is meant to provide credit to the farmers who financial institutions don&#8217;t find credit-worthy, he said, adding that in the past one year, the startup has grown its financing book by three times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Arya’s unparalleled reach across rural India, coupled with its tech-driven integrated service model, has made it one of the fastest-growing agri-commerce platforms in India,&#8221; said Varun Malhotra, Partner at Quona Capital, in a statement. &#8220;<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Arya is successfully bridging the trust gap in post-harvest agri transactions through complete transparency and assurance on quality, quantity and payments. We are excited to deepen our partnership with Arya.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Once an overlooked sector, scores of startups and tech giants are exploring ways to tap what is one of the world’s largest annual harvest of grains. I<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ndia’s agri-tech industry has the potential to reach about $24 billion in revenue by 2025, according to consultancy firm EY. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Amazon recently began offering real-time advice and information to farmers to help them inform their decisions on crops. Microsoft is working with 100 villages to deploy AI and build a platform.</span></p>
<p>Rao said it has been heartening to see more players in the industry to pay attention to the sector. He said Arya alone is hoping to have a network of over 60,000 warehouses in the next four years and is also evaluating acquiring smaller startups to fuel faster growth.</p>
<p>“Through the pandemic, we have seen Arya transform agri-commerce across India,” said Matteo Pusineri, director of Asia Impact SA, in a statement.</p>
<p>“Arya will help accomplish Asia Impact&#8217;s vision to integrate rural under-served farming communities across Asia to markets at scale. We are confident that Arya, under the leadership of Prasanna Rao, Anand Chandra and Chattanathan Devarajan, will greatly contribute to a unique ecosystem supporting the sustainable growth story of rural India.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A full page advertisement in Sunday&#8217;s New York Times took aim at Tesla&#8217;s &#8220;Full Self-Driving&#8221; software, calling it &#8220;the worst software ever sold by a Fortune 500 company&#8221; and offering $10,000, the same price as the software itself to the first person who could name &#8220;another commercial product from a Fortune 500 company that has a critical malfunction every 8 minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ad was taken out by The Dawn Project, a recently founded organization aiming to ban unsafe software from safety critical systems that can be targeted by military-style hackers, as part of a campaign to remove Tesla Full Self-Driving (FSD)  from public roads until it has &#8220;1,000 times fewer critical malfunctions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The founder of the advocacy group, Dan O&#8217;Dowd, is also the CEO of Green Hill Software, a company that builds operating systems and programming tools for embedded safety and security systems. At CES, the company said <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/green-hills-software-technologies-used-in-2022-bmw-ix-all-electric-sports-activity-vehicle-301451788.html">BMW&#8217;s iX vehicle is using its real-time OS</a> and other safety software, and it also announced the availability of its new over-the-air software product and data services for automotive electronic systems.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258372" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Despite the potential competitive bias of The Dawn Project&#8217;s founder, Tesla&#8217;s FSD beta software, an advanced driver assistance system that Tesla owners can access to handle some driving function on city streets, has come under scrutiny in recent months after a series of YouTube videos that showed flaws in the system went viral.</p>
<p>The NYT ad comes just days after the California Department of Motor Vehicles told Tesla it would be <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-01-11/dmv-message-to-legislatures-ontesla-full-self-driving-safety-its-not-our-job">&#8220;revisiting&#8221; its opinion</a> that the company&#8217;s test program, which uses consumers and not professional safety operators, doesn&#8217;t fall under the department&#8217;s autonomous vehicle regulations. The California DMV regulates autonomous driving testing in the state and requires other companies like Waymo and Cruise that are developing, testing and planning to deploy robotaxis to report crashes and system failures called &#8220;disengagements. Tesla has never issued those reports.</p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has since <a href="https://twitter.com/GerberKawasaki/status/1482809775565926404?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1482817514476347392%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Felectrek.co%2F2022%2F01%2F17%2Felon-musk-claims-no-crash-tesla-full-self-driving-beta%2F">vaguely responded on Twitter</a>, claiming Tesla&#8217;s FSD has not resulted in accident or injury since its launch. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-safety-regulator-says-aware-tesla-owner-complaint-self-driving-test-software-2021-11-13/">investigating a report</a> from the owner of a Tesla Model Y, who reported his vehicle went into the wrong lane while making a left turn in FSD mode, resulting in the vehicle being struck by another driver.</p>
<p>Even if that was the first FSD crash, Tesla&#8217;s Autopilot, the automaker&#8217;s ADAS that comes standard on vehicles, has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/u-s-safety-regulator-opens-investigation-into-tesla-autopilot-following-crashes-with-parked-emergency-vehicles/">involved in around a dozen crashes</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alongside the NYT ad, The Dawn Project published a <a href="https://dawnproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NYTAdFactCheck.pdf">fact check</a> of its claims, referring to its <a href="https://dawnproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Tesla-FSD-Safety-Analysis.pdf">own FSD safety analysis</a> that studied data from 21 YouTube videos totaling seven hours of drive time.</p>
<p>The videos analyzed included beta versions 8 (released December 2020) and 10 (released September 2021), and the study avoided videos with significantly positive or negative titles to reduce bias. Each video was graded according to the California DMV&#8217;s Driver Performance Evaluation, which is what human drivers must pass in order to gain a driver&#8217;s license. To pass a driver&#8217;s test, drivers in California must have 15 or fewer scoring maneuver errors, like failing to use turn signals when changing lanes or maintaining a safe distance from other moving vehicles, and zero critical driving errors, like crashing or running a red light.</p>
<p>The study found that FSD v10 committed 16 scoring maneuver errors on average in under an hour and a critical driving error about every 8 minutes. There as an improvement in errors over the nine months between v8 and v10, the analysis found, but at the current rate of improvement, &#8220;it will take another 7.8 years (per AAA data) to 8.8 years (per Bureau of Transportation data) to achieve the accident rate of a human driver.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Dawn Project&#8217;s ad makes some bold claims that should be taken with a grain of salt, particularly because the sample size is far too small to be taken seriously from a statistical standpoint. If, however, the seven hours of footage is indeed representative of an average FSD drive, the findings could be indicative of a larger problem with Tesla&#8217;s FSD software and speak to the broader question of whether Tesla should be allowed to test this software on public roads with no regulation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We did not sign up for our families to be crash test dummies for thousands of Tesla cars being driven on the public roads&#8230;&#8221; the ad reads.</p>
<p>Federal regulators have started to take some action against Tesla and its Autopilot and FSD beta software systems.</p>
<p>In October, NHTSA sent two letters to the automaker targeting the its<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/us-regulator-targets-tesla-on-ndas-over-the-air-software-updates/"> use of non-disclosure agreements</a> for owners who gain early access to FSD beta, as well as the company&#8217;s decision to use over-the-air software updates to fix an issue in the standard Autopilot system that should have been a recall. In addition, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/us-regulator-targets-tesla-on-ndas-over-the-air-software-updates/">Consumer Reports issued a statement</a> over the summer saying the FSD version 9 software upgrade didn&#8217;t appear to be safe enough for public roads and that it would independently test the software. <a href="https://twitter.com/ConsumerReports/status/1482084783991705603?s=20">Last week, the organization published its test results</a>, which revealed that &#8220;Tesla&#8217;s camera-based driver monitoring system fails to keep a driver&#8217;s attention on the road.&#8221; CR found that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/ford-takes-aim-at-tesla-gm-with-its-new-hands-free-driving-system/">Ford&#8217;s BlueCruise</a>, on the other hand, issues alerts when the driver&#8217;s eyes are diverted.</p>
<p>Since then, Tesla has rolled out many different versions of its v10 software – 10.9 should be here any day now, and version 11 with &#8220;single city/highway software stack&#8221; and &#8220;many other architectural upgrades&#8221; coming out in February,  <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1479590174828998663">according to CEO Elon Musk</a>.</p>
<p>Reviews of the latest version 10.8 are skewed, with some online commenters saying it&#8217;s much smoother, and many others stating that they don&#8217;t feel confident in using the tech at all. A thread reviewing the newest FSD version on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/rucv50/the_state_of_tesla_fsd_beta_108_ai_drivr/">Tesla Motors subreddit page</a> shows owners sharing complaints about the software, with one even writing, &#8220;Definitely not ready for the general public yet&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Another commenter said it took too long for the car to turn right onto &#8220;an entirely empty, straight road&#8230;Then it had to turn left and kept hesitating for no reason, blocking the oncoming lane, to then suddenly accelerate once it had made it onto the next street, followed by a just-as-sudden deceleration because it changed its mind about the speed and now thought a 45 mph road was 25 mph.&#8221;</p>
<p>The driver said it eventually had to disengage entirely because the system completely ignored an upcoming left turn, one that was to occur at a standard intersection &#8220;with lights and clear visibility in all directions and no other traffic.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://dawnproject.com/full-self-driving-cars-software-at-its-most-dangerous/">The Dawn Project&#8217;s campaign</a> highlights a warning from Tesla that its FSD &#8220;may do the wrong thing at the worst time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can anyone tolerate a safety-critical product on the market which may do the wrong thing at the worst time,&#8221; said the advocacy group. &#8220;Isn’t that the definition of defective? Full Self-Driving must be removed from our roads immediately.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither Tesla nor The Dawn Project could be reached for comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford Motor Company has signed a five year agreement with Stripe, an online payment processor, to scale the automaker&#8217;s e-commerce capabilities. Stripe will facilitate transactions for vehicle orders and reservations, handle financing options for Ford&#8217;s commercial customers and route customer&#8217;s payments from the automaker&#8217;s website to the correct local Ford or Lincoln dealer.</p>
<p>Ford plans to begin rolling out Stripe&#8217;s technology in the second half of 2022, starting with North America but with aims to roll out in Europe, as well, <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2022/01/17/ford-credit.html">according to the company</a>. Last year, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/14/stripe-closes-600m-round-at-a-95b-valuation/">Stripe raised a $600 million</a> round at a valuation of $95 billion, funds the company said it would use to expand in Europe.</p>
<p>The tie-up with Stripe is part of Ford&#8217;s larger Ford+ restructuring plan, an electrification and growth strategy into which the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/fords-30b-investment-in-electric-revs-up-in-house-battery-rd/">plans to invest $30 billion by 2025</a>. The strategic decision is also in line with much of the <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/industrial-products/library/auto-industry-transformation.html">auto industry&#8217;s move towards investing in technology that will offer the greatest likelihood of capturing returns</a>, specifically in the short-term as the pandemic stunted automakers&#8217; abilities to meet customer demands. And with Ford and Lincoln gearing up to add a number of subscription services, like, most recently, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/05/amazon-fire-tv-is-coming-to-more-cars-in-2022/">Amazon&#8217;s Fire TV</a>, it makes sense for the automaker to establish a robust digital payment platform.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258558" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“As part of the Ford+ plan for growth and value creation, we are making strategic decisions about where to bring in providers with robust expertise and where to build the differentiated, always-on experiences our customers will value,” said  Marion Harris, CEO of Ford&#8217;s financial services arm, Ford Motor Credit Company, in a statement. “Stripe has developed strong expertise in user experiences that will help provide easy, intuitive and secure payment processes for our customers.”</p>
<p>Stripe&#8217;s platform, which has other big-name customers like Deliveroo, Shopify and Salesforce, will be a key part of Ford&#8217;s product and service tech stack, the company says. The payment processor should help create more efficiency in a range of e-commerce payments, which also will include charging services.</p>
<p>So far, investors are reacting positively to the Ford+ plan. The automaker was the<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/03/ford-beats-tesla-to-become-auto-industrys-top-growth-stock-in-2021.html"> best-performing auto stock in 2021</a>, over Tesla, General Motors and even the new and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/rivian-raises-10-5b-in-one-of-the-hottest-ipos-of-2021/"> overhyped Rivian</a>. Last week, Ford&#8217;s market capitalization topped $100 billion for the first time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A Canadian startup working at the cutting edge of satellite imaging has raised $4.5 million across a combination of a $2.25 million seed round, and $2.25 million from a combined pre-seed and government funding. <a href="https://wyvern.space">Wyvern</a>, which is working specifically on hyperspectral imaging (imaging that captures light across many different wavelengths, including non-visible ones) is also joining Y Combinator&#8217;s Winter 2022 cohort.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve covered Wyvern in the past, including when the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/21/space-startup-wyvern-wants-to-make-data-about-earths-health-much-more-accessible/">startup participated in incubator Creative Destruction Lab (CDL)&#8217;s academic conference-like demo day back in 2019</a>. Since then, the startup has made some significant moves beyond just the funding, including growing to a total of 18 employees and bringing on aerospace industry veteran and former Airbus CTO Christine Tovee. Wyvern is also set to launch its first satellites to orbit this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Launch is the next big thing we&#8217;re looking forward to,&#8221; said Christopher Robson, co-founder and CEO of Wyvern. &#8220;This is going to be our first set of imagery products. This is the first step that&#8217;s going to take us to getting some super high-resolution hyperspectral. We won&#8217;t see the super high resolution stuff for another couple of years yet, but when it gets here, it&#8217;s going to be pretty great and game changing.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258526" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Making hyperspectral imaging captured from space accessible to commercial customers could unlock major efficiencies in existing industries, including Wyvern&#8217;s first target, agriculture, but it&#8217;s also likely to open up opportunities for entirely new businesses and industries to emerge. Hyperspectral imaging can provide detail about previously hidden information, including the chemical makeup of the scene it captures.</p>
<p>Seed round lead investor MaC Venture Capital recognized the immense potential for hyperspectral, and Robson told me that it was clear from the start the firm and new Wyvern Board member Adrian Fenty were a perfect match for the young company.</p>
<p>&#8220;First, we hit it off right from the first meeting,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Both of our teams really meshed well together. But the other thing that really appealed to us about MaC is that they&#8217;ve had previous space investments, and they were very bullish about the space market. They were very strategic in the sense that there were a lot of different either customers or investors or partners that they could connect us to through those investments in the space, as well as in some of our customer markets.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtyYxDZJEeM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded by a team of young entrepreneurs, engineers and scientists, Wyvern also added to its strategic advantage with the recent hire of Tovee. Robson told me about how that key leadership team member came onboard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Christine had been on our technical board of advisors for quite some time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We also built a strong relationship with her through CDL. And I think we just really enjoyed working with one another: There was a lot of mutual respect between Christine and the team. We realized that we need some kind of veteran aerospace industry expertise on our exec team to understand how we can play in that part of the of the space industry, too. So definitely a fantastic addition in terms of tech strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tovee also joins the company as yet another female senior leader in an industry where gender diversity is woefully underrepresented. Wyvern co-founder and COO Callie Lissinna (who also joined our recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space event</a>) told me that that has been, and remains a priority for the startup, and it has served them well in conversations with investors and potential team members.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a lot of our conversations with investors, they would mentioned how unique our team is in the space industry for having a 50/50 gender diverse founding team and around a 66% female exec team as a space startup,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And that really flows through to our hiring and recruitment: We&#8217;ve had students say they really like the diversity on our founding team or in our company. So that seems to be an attractive factor for both talent recruitment and investors.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://rebundle.co/">Rebundle</a>, a hair-focused startup based in St. Louis, announced that it has raised $1.4 million in a pre-seed round. <a href="https://m25vc.com/">M25</a>, a venture firm with a geographic focus on the Midwest, led the funding event. Prior to its pre-seed round, Rebundle had raised what CEO and co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ciaraimanimay/">Ciara Imani May</a> described as six-figures worth of grant, and other non-dilutive capital in an interview with TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Rebundle creates and sells hair extensions made from plant-based materials. My knowledge of hair extensions is modest, but May walked me through a few key points. First, the market is <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/hair-extension-market-105688">both large</a>, and varied, with myriad price points from low-cost (plastic-based products), to expensive (human hair). And second, plastic extensions can irritate one&#8217;s scalp.</p>
<p>May had a focus on living more sustainably before founding Rebundle, she said, and was aware of the irritation that plastic extensions can cause. What her startup created has the potential to both remove plastics from the product, helping customers&#8217; heads feel better, and limit waste, helping the environment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258527" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To create its product, Rebundle uses banana fiber as the core material in extensions that it sells in a variety of colors. Notably the company is building out new production facilities in the United States instead of offshore.</p>
<p>Manufacturing brings us back to the funding round, which the CEO said will be used to invest both in her team, and her supply chain. Rebundle was selling out of stock in an hour or less before raising more capital, which meant that prior funding sources were too small for it to properly scale. Enter venture capital.</p>
<p>Rebundle is a DTC company, selling its products through its website. I asked May how many times per year someone employing hair extensions might change them out for a new set. She said up to five times per year. This means that Rebundle is selling what appears to be a recurring-purchase physical good through its own channels. The gross margin profile of the extensions market isn&#8217;t clear to us at this juncture, but the potential regularity of extensions sales makes Rebundle an interesting business case.</p>
<p>Recall that mountains of venture capital has been invested in the DTC model for products that lacked a recurring hook, an experiment that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/15/caspers-return-to-private-life-isnt-a-canary-for-dtc-companies-going-public/">had mixed results</a>.</p>
<p>On the obvious question of subscriptions to its products, the co-founder demurred to share specifics, allowing only that there is &#8220;room to play&#8221; with the idea. Extensions customers today, she explained, do not typically buy subscriptions to the product. If Rebundle can scale its onshore manufacturing and introduce a recurring service to its product mix, I wouldn&#8217;t be shocked to see the company raise again this year.</p>
<p>It likely won&#8217;t need to. The company&#8217;s CEO told TechCrunch that her latest round was compiled with a rolling close, but that the capital will provide at least 18 months of runway, and perhaps a little more. So there&#8217;s not likely a near-term need for more funds at Rebundle, though not needing money has certainly not slowed many startups from taking on more capital when offered.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://burnt.com/">Burnt Finance</a> is a crypto startup which, as a stunt, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56335948">burnt a Banksy artwork</a> and but then the NFT they’d minted for it for $400,000, double what it cost on the &#8216;normal&#8217; open art market.</p>
<p>Based on the idea that auctions for NFTs could be improved, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/could-nft-auctions-be-moving-away-from-ethereum-one-new-group-is-betting-they-will/">went on to raise</a> $3 million for a decentralized auction protocol built on the Solana blockchain. That round was led by led by Multicoin and Alameda Research and was incubated by Injective Labs, the core contributors to the multi-chain network Injective Protocol. </p>
<p>It’s now getting more serious.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258522" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Burnt Finance has now raised an $8M Series A round led by <a href="https://www.animocabrands.com">Animoca Brands</a>, which develops and publishes a broad portfolio of blockchain games, traditional games, and other products.</p>
<p>Also participating was Multicoin Capital, Alameda Research, DeFiance, Valor Capital Group, Figment, Spartan Capital, Tribe Capital, Play Ventures, HashKey, Mechanism Capital, DeFi Alliance, Terra, and others.</p>
<p>Of those investors, Multicoin is perhaps among the best known, as it’s been investing in the blockchain space since 2017, and has invested in Solana, NEAR, MobileCoin (used for P2P payments in Signal), and several other significant projects.</p>
<p>Burnt Finance will now launch its own NFT marketplace, which will feature English, Dutch, and Buy Now auctions, aiming to be a hub for NFTs by integrating DeFi functionality, such a NFT lending, liquidity mining with staking incentives, fractionalization, and GameFi.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This will provide permissionless access to NFTs and claims to have low fees and fast speeds, with “160,000 users” on its waitlist. It also claims to have processed over $100 million of trading volume in 7 days on its Spark testnet.</p>
<p>It also plans to expand to additional blockchains including Terra and other EVM compatible layer one protocols. </p>
<p>Yat Siu, the executive chairman and co-founder of Animoca Brands, commented: &#8220;Minting and trading assets in a permissionless ecosystem is crucially important to the economic groundwork of the open metaverse.”<br />

The global market for non-fungible tokens hit around $22B in 2021 according to DappRadar. Traditional auction houses Christie’s and Sotheby’s have also expanded into the NFT space.</p>
<p>Burnt Finance is pushing at an open door. NFT sales <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/as-nft-sales-top-4-billion-whats-in-store-for-2022-210612228.html">topped</a> $4b in December 2021 alone.</p>
<p>Competitors include, at various levels of course, OpenSea, SuperRare, Rarible and NiftyGateway. However, although Burnt is clearly still very early, it’s attempting to outpace larger players by using Solana and going for the DeFi space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Istanbul has become a city to watch when it comes to casual gaming startups, boosted by the likes of Peak (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/01/zynga-acquires-turkeys-peak-games-for-1-8b-after-buying-its-card-games-studio-for-100m-in-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Zynga for $1.8 billion</a>) and Dream (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/dream-games-raises-155m-at-a-1b-valuation-as-its-royal-match-puzzle-game-hits-a-royal-flush/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">valued at $1 billion</a> in a funding round last year). Now, a new startup is announcing a major round of funding to make its own mark on the space. <a href="https://spykegames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spyke Games</a>, which hopes to bring a new dimension to casual games by using multiplayer functionality and other social elements, has raised $55 million in a seed round of funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teams and alliances, clans, tournaments &#8212; these exist in the midcore genre and that is why they are so sticky,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Rina Onur Sirinoglu said in an interview. &#8220;They let people play together and compete together. We are betting this will start happening in casual games, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding is coming from a single investor, Griffin Gaming Partners, a VC that focuses (as you can guess by its name) on startups working in and around the games industry. Other companies in its portfolio include Discord, Forte, AppLovin, Overwolf and WinZO.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258514" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>This is a big sum for a seed round in any country, but as it happens, it&#8217;s the largest seed round to date for a startup out of Turkey, underscoring just how much things have evolved in the country when it comes to attracting investment. As a point of reference, when Peak was acquired for $1.8 billion by Zynga, it had raised a mere $19 million in 10 years.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s even more notable is that Spyke has raised this money before it&#8217;s even launched anything. Its first game, Royal Riches, has been out in a limited release and is due to launch globally this month.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for the strong investor interest lies in the co-founders and their collective track record. Co-founder and CEO Rina Onur Sirinoglu had also been a co-founder at Peak and its chief product officer; COO Remi Onur was previously Peak&#8217;s head of design; CPO Barkin Basaran had been a senior product manager both at Peak and then Zynga, CTO Fuat Coşkun was Peak&#8217;s director of engineering; and CMO Mithat Madra had been an executive at Riot Games, among other places.</p>
<p>For Spyke, the outsized round was raised to match the startup&#8217;s ambitions. Sirinoglu acknowledged that the round is an outsized one for the Turkish market.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Turkey has always been known as a capital-efficient place for startups,&#8221; she said in an interview, referring to the fact that there is a strong pipeline of engineers coming out of education in the country, but also the fact that hiring them is &#8220;super affordable&#8221; compared to hiring equivalent talent in London or the Bay Area. &#8220;Historically startups have been able to stretch a couple of million dollars to great lengths.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she added that Spyke decided to take a different approach. &#8220;We are doing this a second time around, and we think we have landed on something huge,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We have long-term goals to be one of the largest gaming companies in the world, and we want to be able to reach that goal in a quick amount of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Spyke&#8217;s arrival in the market comes at an interesting crossroads for casual gaming. On one side, the genre has been around for years now, and so the time is ripe to try to disrupt it. The big question will be whether it will be another casual gaming company, or another kind of entity altogether that is also vying for the same engagement hours as casual games.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just competing against the world of other casual games, but also companies like TikTok,&#8221; Sirinoglu said.</p>
<p>The hugely popular video app has not, to date, published any games that you actively play in the app, but it has very much carved out a place for itself in the gaming community. Last November it launched a new games experience, <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/gaming-goes-live-on-tiktok" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Game Room</a>, where people go to watch a live show where high profile people play games. Others regularly post gameplay videos in the app. It feels sometimes like it&#8217;s just a short step further for TikTok itself to launch games within the app.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s for this reason that Spyke&#8217;s basic premise is not just to make more casual games, but to bring in more social elements into the mix, something that she and her co-founders started to see hints of while still at Peak.</p>
<p>She said the team there &#8220;unintentionally&#8221; built in social elements into Toy Blast and &#8220;stumbled&#8221; on to a community of players.</p>
<p>&#8220;With Peak, we didn’t have the infrastructure but across games we noticed a cross pollination between Toy Blast, Toon Blast and other similar games.&#8221; User patterns that they found, meanwhile, are going to be applied at Spyke.</p>
<p>&#8220;The interesting thing about the social studio is that the majority of revenues came not from chips or coins but those selling virtual items in private chat rooms,&#8221; she said. These were related to games, but also to relationships being formed among players. &#8220;That was in the back of our minds and so we want to create technology to keep that activity within our infrastructure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Their decision to leave and build a new company to explore this says a lot about how often some of the best ideas at startups are easier to explore at a clean slate than trying to carve out a place for disruption within an existing entity. It&#8217;s all the more interesting considering Zynga&#8217;s track record in social gaming over the years, and its early days of looking to build in social elements by way of Facebook integrations.</p>
<p>“Spyke has the perfect combination of a deeply experienced team with proven success developing games and an unwavering  focus on execution,” said Griffin Gaming Partner’s MD Phil Sanderson. He has joined Spyke’s board of directors with this round.</p>

<p>Hello readers: Welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be taking over this week because your usual host, Kirsten Korosec, is busy doing Kirsten things. (Kirsten here to say &#8216;yes, I sure am, although I do have a little item below.&#8217;)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258530" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest micromobility news from the past week is that Ford-owned </span><b>Spin</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> laid off a quarter of its staff and is preparing to exit all open-permit markets around the world. The company will wind down operations in some U.S. markets, Germany and Portugal and is projected to close in Spain as early as February 2022. In a</span><a href="https://www.spin.app/blog-posts/spin-forward"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> blog post </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Ben Bear said this strategy would help accelerate the company’s path to profitability, as “open permit market dynamics have made it difficult to identify a clear path to profitability.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t say I didn’t see something like this coming. Back in June, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/ford-owned-spin-shakes-up-scooter-business-with-new-ceo-e-bikes-and-city-strategy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wrote about how Spin was shifting its strategy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to angle for more exclusive partnerships with cities and campuses. This came as Bear took over as CEO and amid reports that Ford might be divesting Spin. Ford told TechCrunch it is still committed to helping the micromobility company on its path to profitability. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether Bear knew all along that this strategy would require closing down operations in certain markets is unclear. Back in June, he told me Spin was “full speed ahead on the hiring front” with ambitious growth plans. Perhaps Spin was just hoping cities would align with the company’s strategy and start moving towards limited vendor permits. That trend might be true in mid-tier cities, which are just as important to convert to micromobility as the big dogs, so here’s hoping Spin’s strategy turns out alright in the end. </span></p>
<p><b>Micromobilty World 2022</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week was also Micromobility World 2022, an event for micromobility lovers around the world, including yours truly, to talk about all things related to the space. Here are just a few of the many highlights: </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2JwmHyFT44&amp;list=PL8xVg_NZwODQUqKTYqqYRcPvXdS6wJ9Ki&amp;index=3&amp;ab_channel=MicromobilityIndustries"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke to Horace Luke, CEO of Gogoro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, about how </span><b>Gogoro</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has dominated Taiwan, why it’s so important to make charging easy and fast through battery swapping to increase adoption of micro-electric vehicles and why partnering with local businesses is key to expanding into new markets quicker. </span></p>
<p><b>Bird </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Travis VanderZanden talked to Horace Dediu about how Bird wants to continue the micromobility momentum started by the pandemic by focusing on climate change and congestion in cities, how to create main market adoption by showing cities that people are willing and ready to get out of cars and potential plans to create new form factors for the bike lane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caroline Samponaro</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, VP of micromobility at </span><b>Lyft</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, spoke to The Verge’s Andrew Hawkins about public-private partnerships in micromobility. Samponaro spoke about how Lyft’s docked bikeshares have contributed to the public transit ecosystem by being reliably stationed, and she talked about the challenges of running a shared business, like the need for exclusivity with a city (such as <strong>CitiBike</strong> kind of has with NYC) and cost-prohibitive insurance obligations. Samponaro said that cities needed to work on their systemic vehicle-centric mindset, and she spoke of the importance of the bike and scooter working together. </span></p>
<p><b>In other news &#8230;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">EV maker </span><b>Rivian</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/rivian-files-trademark-for-electric-bikes/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">filed a trademark to produce electric bikes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company wouldn’t tell TechCrunch anything else about the matter, but Rivian wouldn’t be the only OEM to recognize the micromobility trend and try to get on board. </span></p>
<p><b>Lime</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/lime-new-e-bike-swappable-battery-works-with-scooters/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">finally launching its new Gen4 e-bike</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, starting in Washington, D.C. The new bike will have a swappable battery that’s interchangeable with the company’s scooters, which should help improve Lime’s bottom line by making vehicle charges much easier.</span></p>
<p><b>Trek Bicycle </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><b>World Bicycle Relief</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> teamed up to do a nice thing and donate $1.8M to communities in developing regions. Consumers around the world made donations towards Trek’s 2021 Bike of the Year, WBR’s Buffalo Bicycle, which is designed to help people traveling long distances over difficult terrain.</span></p>
<p><b>Helbiz </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is partnering with </span><b>Wheels</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it deploy 2,500 seated e-mobility vehicles in four U.S. cities and two Italian innovation hubs starting next month, with plans to expand into other markets in the future. </span></p>
<p><b>Cake </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is mounting </span><b>Dometic</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s temperature-controlled thermal box for food delivery, the DeliBox, onto some of its :work series bike to create a more innovative delivery solution.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seattle-based e-bike maker </span><b>Propella</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> recently released its new bike, </span><a href="https://www.propella.bike/shop/ebikes/mini"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Mini,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which at the time of this writing is going for $899 (+$50 for U.S. shipping). It’s a single-speed, pedal-assist, ultra lightweight (33 lbs) e-bike with 20-inch wheels. It’s got a range of 20-35 miles and a top speed of 18 mph. Looks like a nice little commuter bike!  </span></p>
<p><b>Retrospec</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has l</span><a href="https://retrospec.com/collections/electric-bikes/products/koa-rev-26-electric-fat-tire-bike"><span style="font-weight: 400;">aunched its new Koa Rev</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">fat tire e-bike,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> complete with shock absorbers, up to 46 miles of range, a top speed of 20 mph and a throttle. Starting at $1,799.99.</span></p>
<h2>Deal of the week</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1896226 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png" alt="money the station" width="1600" height="400" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=150,38 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=1536,384 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/money-the-station.png?resize=50,13 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Peer-to-peer car-sharing startup </span><b>Turo</b> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/peer-to-peer-car-sharing-company-turo-files-ipo-to-go-public/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">released its filing to become a publicly traded company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the U.S., which unfortunately did not include terms for its offering. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Turo, which was founded in 2010, allows private car owners to rent out their vehicles through the startup’s website or app – like Airbnb for cars. As car rental prices are increasing due to supply chain issues, Turo is gaining some market share that could lead to success. However, Turo comes with a lot of risk, as its S-1 filing showed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, the company might face liability for criminal activities of its hosts, like the ones who have been using Turo and other similar apps to smuggle humans near the U.S. border. Turo is also liable to lawsuits from airport authorities that require the startup to obtain rental car permits to operate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said there’s plenty of room for growth and expansion within the U.S. and internationally. </span></p>
<p><b>Other deals that got my attention …</b></p>
<p><strong>Arive</strong>, an instant delivery service focused on the wider world of consumer goods, raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/arive-raises-20m-for-an-instant-delivery-service-beyond-groceries-and-essentials/">Series A round of $20 million</a>. The funding is being led by Balderton Capital, with Global Founders Capital (the firm connected to Rocket Internet&#8217;s Samwer family), Burda Principal Investments, La Famiglia and 468 Capital also participating.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Auto parks maker </span><b>Aptiv</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is acquiring software developer </span><b>Wind River</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/auto-parts-supplier-aptiv-buy-software-firm-wind-river-43-bln-2022-01-11/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$4.3B in cash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to boost its offerings to an auto industry that’s quickly becoming autonomous and electric, and thus, software-defined. </span></p>
<p><b>Bolt</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which offers on-demand ride-hailing, shared cars and scooters, and restaurant and grocery delivery, </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/bolt-raises-709m-at-an-8-4b-valuation-to-expand-its-transportation-and-food-delivery-super-app/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">has raised $709M at a valuation of $8.4B</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to expand into new geographies and bulk out new business lines like its 15-minute grocery delivery option by building out more “dark stores.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Delivery Hero</strong>, the German food delivery group, sold $150 million worth of its stake in the Latin-American delivery company Rappi, close to the entire capital it had invested in the company, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/delivery-hero-sells-part-its-stake-rappi-2022-01-10/">Reuters reported</a>.</p>
<p><strong>EVage</strong>, the all-electric commercial vehicle startup based in India, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/evage-raises-28m-to-be-a-driving-force-in-indias-commercial-ev-revolution/">raised a $28 million seed round</a>, led by new U.S.-based VC RedBlue Capital. The company plans to use the funds to complete its production-ready factory outside of Delhi in the first quarter of 2022 and scale up production to meet growing demand.</p>
<p><strong>HeyCharge</strong>, a Germany-based startup focused on underground carparks, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/heycharges-underground-charging-solution-raises-4-7m-seed-led-by-bmw-i-ventures/">raised a $4.7 million seed round</a> led by BMW i Ventures (also an early investor in Chargepoint and Chargemaster), the venture capital arm of BMW Group. Also participating was Statkraft Ventures, the venture capital arm of Statkraft, a large European generator of renewable energy.</p>
<p><b>Magna </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">has acquired the tech, IP and assets of </span><b>Optimus Ride</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Boston-based electric autonomous shuttle startup.

<p>Kirsten here, popping in to give some historical insight into Optimus Ride, the autonomous shuttle company that ceased operations and sold its assets and IP to Magna. About 120 engineers have also joined Magna, as the company looks to beef up its advanced driver assistance system offerings.</p>
<p>It turns out that Optimus Ride was considering a merger with a special purpose acquisition company in a bid to go public. My sources say the company was shopping this idea around in early 2021 with a target of raising $400 million to $500 million during the process of going public. The plan was to close the deal by the end of the second quarter.</p>
<p>That obviously didn&#8217;t happen. Sources tell me they just couldn&#8217;t make the deal happen as some investors lost their appetite for mobility SPACs.</p>

<h3><b>Autonomous vehicles</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-01-11/dmv-message-to-legislatures-ontesla-full-self-driving-safety-its-not-our-job"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The California DMV is revisiting its approach to regulating</span></a> <b>Tesla</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s “Full Self-Driving” beta  software after being confronted with a ton of evidence that the technology drives cars into dangerous situations and a letter of concern from a state legislator. Tesla has been getting away with testing its AV tech on public roads and not reporting crashes and system failures to the DMV, as other autonomous car developers are required to do, for years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tesla owners/fans have paid $10K (soon to be $12K) for the privilege of testing the FSD software on public roads, when they’re meant to be, but often aren’t, supervising the operation of cars as they autonomously navigate on highways and city streets – features that other developers, like </span><b>Waymo</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>Cruise</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>Argo</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>Zoox</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, must report on to the DMV.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The DMV has good timing, as it looks like </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-features-an-assertive-mode-with-rolling-stops/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FSD’s latest update to 10.3 is bringing driver profiles back</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with typically bro-ey names like “Chill,” “Average,” and “Assertive.” The Assertive one may perform rolling stops, have a smaller follow distance, perform more frequent speed lane changes and will not exit passing lanes. Ok, Elon. </span></p>
<p><b>Ford </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">appears to be toying with the idea of building its next AV facility in Dallas, according to city documents. </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/dallas-wants-to-be-the-site-of-ford-and-argo-ais-next-autonomous-vehicle-facility/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dallas city council members voted on Wednesday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on an economic package that would entice the OEM to its city, rather than one of two potential sites in California, with a $3M tax break and a $250,000 grant towards the production of the facility.</span></p>
<p><b>Local Motors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the company behind the Olli autonomous shuttle and the Rally Fighter, has </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/local-motors-the-startup-that-created-the-olli-autonomous-shuttle-has-shutdown/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shut down operations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to several posts from employees on LinkedIn who are already looking for work. Olli is the main feature photo for this post and was an early symbol of the burgeoning autonomous vehicle industry. The closure of Local Motors takes yet another autonomous shuttle out of operations and shows there is still room for consolidation in the industry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autonomous delivery company </span><b>Nuro</b> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/nuro-autonomous-delivery-bot-launch/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unveiled its next-gen electric self-driving vehicle </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">designed and manufactured in partnership with BYD North America. The “Nuro,” an auto-grade vehicle that operates on public roads but doesn’t carry passengers, has twice the cargo volume of its previous model, customizable storage, temp-controlled compartments and a series of safety features like exterior airbags designed to protect other road users. </span></p>
<p><b>Serve Robotics</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an Uber spinout that builds sidewalk delivery robots, is </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/serve-robotics-new-autonomous-sidewalk-delivery-robots-dont-require-human-assist/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deploying its next-gen robots</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that can reach Level 4 autonomy (meaning no human in the loop) for deliveries in certain geofenced areas in Los Angeles. </span></p>
<p><b>Waymo</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is expanding its pilot-partnership with J.B. Hunt into a long term deal that will see the logistics company become </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waymo Via’s first launch partner for freight movement when it deploys fully autonomous operations in Texas the next few years.</span></p>
<h3><b>Electric vehicles</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/11/first-drive-2022-mercedes-amg-eqs-and-2022-mercedes-amg-sl/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roberto Baldwin gave us a First Drive </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the all-electric 2022 </span><b>Mercedes</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AMG EQS and the still-V8-powered SL Roadster, two new cars out of Mercedes’s high performance unit that tick all the boxes for performance, luxury and comfort. </span></p>
<p><b>Rivian</b> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/rivian-produced-a-skosh-more-than-1000-electric-vehicles-in-2021/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported that it produced 1,015 vehicles in 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, delivering 920 by the end of the year – it had originally targeted production of 1,200 vehicles by EOY. The company has more than 71,000 pre-orders for its R1T pickup trucks.</span></p>
<p><b>General Motors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/gm-finally-agrees-california-can-set-vehicle-emissions-rules-as-it-preps-to-scale-evs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">finally recognized California’s authority under the Clean Air Act </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to set its own vehicle emissions standards, which adds it to the list of potential OEMs the state can consider for fleet vehicle purchases. </span></p>
<h3><b>Miscellaneous </b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of our featured articles this week from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Motavilli looked into the real reason the auto industry is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/09/feature-bloat-cars-chip-shortage/">facing a chip shortage</a> – “feature bloat,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">or “the tendency, fueled by sales competition, to slather new cars with as much technology as possible.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The auto tech released at CES, which includes a range of unnecessary tech that can watch and learn from drivers to anticipate their needs, schedule maintenance on their behalf, connect with smart devices at home and even stream YouTube, is proof that automakers are leaning in way too hard to making vehicles defined by software. Especially when we consider that there is no bug-free software and much of this tech can and will be unreliable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Meanwhile, market reality has resulted in a collision course for buyers on the ground: higher prices and spotty availability of some of the features they say they most want,” writes Motavilli.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon appears to have rowed back from a public threat to end support for Visa payments in the UK in a dispute over payment fees.</p>
<p>The ecommerce giant sent an email to users of Amazon.co.uk today informing them that the &#8220;expected change&#8221; &#8212; which was due to take place on January 19 &#8212; will not now take place on that day.</p>
<p>Although it is still not clear if the two companies have come to sustained terms on fees.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2258496" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“The expected change regarding the use of Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk will no longer take place on January 19. We are working closely with Visa on a potential solution that will enable customers to continue using their Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk,&#8221; Amazon writes in the email sent to UK users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should we make any changes related to Visa credit cards, we will give you advance notice,&#8221; it goes on, adding: &#8220;Until then, you can continue to use Visa credit cards, debit cards, Mastercard, American Express, and Eurocard as you do today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reached for comment, Amazon and Visa confirmed the development &#8212; but did not offer any further detail.</p>
<p>Amazon declined to provide any comment beyond its brief statement to users that nothing is changing for now.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While a Visa spokesperson also did not elaborate on what &#8220;potential solutions&#8221; might mean in practice &#8212; implying that negotiations on fees are ongoing in a statement in which it writes: “Amazon customers can continue to use Visa cards on Amazon.co.uk after January 19 while we work closely together to reach an agreement.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an earlier email to UK users, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/amazon-says-it-will-stop-accepting-uk-issued-visa-credit-cards-on-january-19th/">late last year</a>, Amazon had blamed high payment fees charged by Visa for credit card transactions for ending support for Visa payments &#8212; warning Brits to make alternative arrangements for paying for their purchases on Amazon.co.uk.</p>
<p>Its very public mass email had looked like an attempt to leverage its market power to extract better terms from Visa.</p>
<p>Whether that worked to convince Visa to reduce its credit card fees or whether Amazon has just decided to step back from the brink of causing major disruption to UK shoppers is unclear.</p>
<p>If the latter, Amazon had already caused UK users who rely on Visa-based payment methods months of uncertainty over whether they would be able to continue making purchases on its site in the near future.</p>
<p>Back in November, Visa described it as disappointing that Amazon &#8220;is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future&#8221;, as it put it then, also arguing &#8220;when consumer choice is limited, nobody wins&#8221;.</p>
<p>At the time, Visa had said it was working towards a resolution with Amazon to ensure Visa cardholders can keep on using their UK-issued Visa credit cards on its website.</p>
<p>Months later talks apparently continue &#8212; just without a looming public deadline for Amazon to stop accepting UK-issued Visa cards.</p>
<p>Rising fees for Visa transactions on Amazon.co.uk have been linked to the UK&#8217;s departure from the European Union &#8212; as Brexit removed the cap on fees that can be charged on transactions between the UK and the European Economic Area/EU.</p>
<p>But the issue also likely involves the specifics of how Amazon structures its UK business &#8212; since it bills UK customers via an EU-based entity, shifting revenue booked via its UK website to its European HQ in Luxembourg.</p>
<p>A report covered by <a href="https://www.cityam.com/amazon-transfers-8-2bn-of-uk-revenue-to-luxembourg-report-says/">City AM</a> last August suggested this corporate structure has enabled Amazon to evade paying considerably higher sums in UK tax. However it looks like the same &#8216;profits shifting&#8217; structure costs (or, well, has costed&#8230; ) Amazon considerably more in Visa &#8216;taxes&#8217; than it would like to pay.</p>
