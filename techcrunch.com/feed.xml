										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When <a href="http://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a> bought <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a> earlier <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">this week for $27.7 billion</a>, it was in some ways the end of a startup fairytale. Slack was the living embodiment of the Silicon Valley startup success fantasy. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/the-slack-origin-story/">started as a pivot</a> from a game company, of all things. It raised $1.4 billion, went from zero to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/07/slack-raising/">a $7 billion valuation</a> to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/19/slack-reportedly-prices-ipo-at-26-per-share/">IPO</a>, checking off every box on the startup founder&#8217;s wish list.</p>
<p>Then quite suddenly this week, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/slack" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="slack">Slack <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was part of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="salesforce">Salesforce, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> plucked off the market for an enormous sum of money.</p>
<p>While we might not ever know the back (Slack) room maneuvering that went on to make the deal a reality, it is interesting to note that Slack CEO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/stewart-butterfield" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="stewart-butterfield">Stewart Butterfield <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> told me in an interview this week that he was not actually trying to sell the company when he approached Salesforce president and COO <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/bret-taylor" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="bret-taylor">Bret Taylor <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> earlier this year. Instead, he wanted to buy something from them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I actually talked to Bret in the early days of the pandemic to see if they wanted to sell us Quip because I thought it would be good for us, and I didn&#8217;t really know what their plans were [for it]. He said he&#8217;d get back to me, and then got back to me six months later or so,&#8221; Butterfield said.</p>
<p>At that point, the conversation flipped and the companies began a series of discussions that eventually led to Salesforce acquiring Slack.</p>
<h2>Big money, big expectations</h2>
<p>From the Salesforce perspective, Taylor says that the Slack deal was worth the money because it really allows his company to bring together all the pieces of their platform, one that has expanded over the years from pure CRM to include marketing, customer service, data visualization, workflow and more. Taylor also said that having Slack gives Salesforce a missing communication layer on top of its other products, something especially important when interactions with customers, partners or fellow employees, have become mostly digital.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we say we really want Slack to be this next generation interface for Customer 360, what we mean is we&#8217;re pulling together all these systems. How do you rally your teams around these systems in this digital work-anywhere world that we&#8217;re in right now where these teams are distributed and collaboration is more important than ever,&#8221; Taylor said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Everyone has an opinion on the $27.7B Slack acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/everyone-has-an-opinion-on-the-27-7b-slack-acquisition/embed/#?secret=3kxr2l48Rp" data-secret="3kxr2l48Rp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Butterfield sees a natural connection between what people do in the course of their work, what machines do behind the scenes in these systems of record and engagement, and how Slack can help bridge the gap between humans and machines.</p>
<p>He says that by putting Slack in the middle of business processes, you can begin to eliminate friction that occurs in complex enterprise software like Salesforce. Instead of moving stuff through email, clicking a link, opening a browser, signing in, and then finally accessing the tool you want, the approval could be built into a single Slack message.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have hundreds of those kinds of actions a day, there&#8217;s a real opportunity to increase the velocity and that has an impact, and not just in the minutes saved by the person doing the approval, but the speed of how the whole business operates,&#8221; Butterfield said.</p>
<h2>Competing with Microsoft</h2>
<p>While neither executive said the deal was about competing with Microsoft, it was likely an underlying reason that the companies decided to join forces. They may prove better together than they are separately, and both have complicated histories with Microsoft.</p>
<p>Slack has had an ongoing battle with Microsoft and its Teams product for years. It <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/22/slack-has-filed-an-antitrust-complaint-against-microsoft-teams-in-the-eu/">filed suit against the company</a> last summer in the EU over what it called unfairly bundling of Teams for free with Office 365. In an interview last year with the Wall Street Journal, Butterfield said that he believes Microsoft sees his company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/24/stewart-butterfield-says-microsoft-sees-slack-as-existential-threat/">as an existential threat</a>. Hyperbole aside, there is tension and competition between the two enterprise software companies.</p>
<p>Salesforce and Microsoft also have a long history <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-salesforce-microsoft/salesforce-sues-microsoft-as-legal-feud-escalates-idUSTRE65O4HT20100625">from lawsuits in the early days</a>, to making friends and working together when it makes sense after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/04/after-5-years-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-has-transformed-more-than-the-stock-price/">Satya Nadella took over in 2014</a>, while still competing hard in the market. It&#8217;s hard not to see the deal in that context.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As Slack acquisition rumors swirl, a look at Salesforce&#8217;s six biggest deals&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/as-slack-acquisition-rumors-swirl-a-look-at-salesforces-six-biggest-deals/embed/#?secret=dLhIzLh1wG" data-secret="dLhIzLh1wG" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/everyone-has-an-opinion-on-the-27-7b-slack-acquisition/">a recent interview with TechCrunch</a>, Battery Ventures general partner Neeraj Agrawal said the deal was at least partially about catching Microsoft.</p>
<p>&#8220;To get to a market cap of $1 trillion, Salesforce now has to take MSFT head on. Until now, the company has mostly been able to stay in its own swim lane in terms of products,&#8221; Agrawal told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>As for Butterfield, while he saw the obvious competition, he denied the deal was about putting his company in a better position to compete with his rival.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that was really an important part of the rationale, at least for me,&#8221; he said, adding &#8220;the competition with Microsoft is overblown. The challenge for us was the narrative. They&#8217;re just good PR or something that I couldn&#8217;t figure out,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While Butterfield cited a list of large clients in enterprise tech, insurance and banking, the narrative has always been that Slack was favored by developer teams, which is where it initially gained traction. Whatever the reality, with Salesforce, Slack is definitely in a better position to compete with any and all comers in the enterprise communications space, and while it will be part of Salesforce, the two companies also have to figure out how to maintain some separation.</p>
<h2>Keeping Slack independent</h2>
<p>Taylor certainly recognizes that Slack&#8217;s current customers are watching closely to see how they handle the acquisition, and his company will have to walk a fine line between respecting the brand and product independence on one hand, while finding ways to create and build upon existing hooks into Salesforce to allow the CRM giant to take full advantage of its substantial investment.</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t be easy to do, but you can see a similar level of independence in some of Salesforce&#8217;s recent big-money purchases like MuleSoft, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/20/salesforce-is-buying-mulesoft-at-enterprise-value-of-6-5-billion/">it bought in 2018 for $6.5 billion</a>, and Tableau, the company it bought last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/10/salesforce-is-buying-data-visualization-company-tableau-for-15-7b-in-all-stock-deal/">for over $15 billion</a>. As Butterfield points out, those two companies have clearly maintained their brand identity and independence, and he sees them as role models for Slack.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="wKb3LCzZkN"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/slacks-stock-climbs-on-possible-salesforce-acquisition/">Slack’s stock climbs on possible Salesforce acquisition</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Slack’s stock climbs on possible Salesforce acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/25/slacks-stock-climbs-on-possible-salesforce-acquisition/embed/#?secret=wKb3LCzZkN" data-secret="wKb3LCzZkN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;So there&#8217;s a layer of independence that&#8217;s like that [for Mulesoft and Tableau] because it&#8217;s not going to help anyone call us Chat Cloud or something like that. They paid a lot of money for us, so they want us to do more of what we were already doing,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Taylor, whose opinion matters greatly here, certainly sees it in similar terms.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to make sure we have a real integrated value proposition, a real integrated platform for developers, but also maintain Slack&#8217;s technology independence, technology agnostic platform and its brand,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>Better together</h2>
<p>As for the companies coming together, both men see a lot of potential here to merge Slack communications with Salesforce&#8217;s enterprise software prowess to make something better, and Taylor sees Slack helping link the two with workflows and automations.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you think about automation, it&#8217;s event driven, these long running processes, automations. If you look at what people are doing with the Slack platform, it&#8217;s essentially incorporating workflows and bots and all these things. The combination of the Salesforce platform where I think we have the best automation intelligence capabilities with the Slack platform is incredible,&#8221; Taylor said.</p>
<p>The challenge these two men now face as they move forward with this acquisition, and all of the expectations inherent in a deal this large, is making it work. Salesforce has a lot of experience with large acquisitions, and they have handled some well, and some not so well. It&#8217;s going to be imperative for both companies that they get this right. It&#8217;s now up to Taylor and Butterfield to make sure that happens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://www.revolut.com">Revolut</a> is launching its own <a href="https://www.revolut.com/business/online-payments">acquiring solution</a>. With this move, the company is competing directly with Stripe, Adyen, Braintree or Checkout.com. This is an in-house product and not just a fresh coat of paint on an existing solution.</p>
<p>As a reminder, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/revolut" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="revolut">Revolut <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> already offers <a href="https://www.revolut.com/business/">business accounts</a>. It lets you send and receive international payments, exchange funds in multiple currencies. You can also order debit cards to spend money from your Revolut account directly.</p>
<p>With Revolut’s acquiring solution, the company is going one step further as you can now accept card payments from your customers. Revolut supports 14 currencies and settle payments on your Revolut Business account the next day.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When it comes to fees, you get a small allowance of free card payment processing fees <a href="https://www.revolut.com/business/business-account-plans">depending on your plan</a>. Above that limit, you pay 1.3% on card transactions from customers based in Europe and the U.K. For other cards, you pay 2.8% on all transactions —&nbsp;there’s no free allowance.</p>
<p>This is slightly cheaper than Stripe, which costs 1.4% + £0.20 for European cards and 2.9% + £0.20 for non-European card. Of course, companies like Stripe have been optimizing their payments infrastructure for many years. Right now, Stripe supports more payment methods, more currencies, advanced fraud prevention features, etc.</p>
<p>After you’ve created your merchant account, Revolut offers plugins for WooCommerce, Prestashop and Magento already. You can also use the Merchant API to add a checkout widget on your custom website.</p>
<p>If you’re a freelancer and you just need to send a couple of invoices per month, you can also generate <a href="https://www.revolut.com/business/payment-links">payment links</a>. The recipient can then pay from a web page hosted by Revolut.</p>
<p>The main advantage of Revolut’s acquiring solution is that it’s integrated with Revolut Business. You can see payments and banking in the same interface, you don’t need to alternate between your Stripe account and your bank account to reconcile transaction data.</p>
<p>It could work particularly well for B2B businesses that don’t handle a ton of transactions and don’t want to set up a separate payments solution. Let’s see what customers think of the API when they start using it.</p>
<p>Online payments are available for business customers in the U.K., Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain and Sweden. The rest of the European Economic Area should get the feature soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/doordash" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="doordash">DoorDash <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> filed a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520309968/d752207ds1a.htm">fresh S-1/A</a>, providing the market with a new price range for its impending IPO.</p>
<p>The American food delivery unicorn now expects to debut at $90 to $95 per share, up from a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/doordash-aims-to-add-11-billion-to-its-valuation-during-public-offering/">previous range of $75 to $85.</a> That&#8217;s a bump of 20% on the low end and 12% on the upper end of its IPO range.</p>

<hr />
<p>DoorDash still anticipates 317,656,521 shares outstanding after its IPO, giving the company a new, non-diluted valuation range between $28.6 billion and $30.2 billion. On a fully diluted basis, the company&#8217;s valuation rises to more than $35 billion.</p>
<p>For the on-demand giant, the upgrade is enormously positive news. Not only will its valuation stretch even further above its most recent private price &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/after-ipo-delays-doordash-confirms-400m-raise/">around $16 billion, set this summer</a> &#8212; but DoorDash will also raise even more money than it previously anticipated. That war chest will be welcome when a vaccine becomes widely available and food consumption habits could shift.</p>
<p>DoorDash will raise as much as $3.135 billion in its IPO, according to the filing.</p>
<p>After mulling over the company&#8217;s updated valuation from its new SEC filing, I&#8217;ve decided there are three things worth calling out and discussing. Let&#8217;s get into them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Friday, so to make our analysis as easy as possible I&#8217;ve broken it into discrete sections for your perusal. Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<h2>A path to profitability is important</h2>
<p>DoorDash&#8217;s most profitable quarters that we are aware of were its two most recent. During the June 30 quarter, the company saw positive net income of $23 million off revenues of $675 million. In the September 30 quarter, on the back of even more revenue growth, DoorDash lost a modest $42 million against $879 million in top line.</p>
<p>Those two quarters contrast with the first quarter of 2020 when DoorDash lost a far-greater $129 million against a far-smaller revenue result of $362 million, and Q4 2019 when the figures were a $134 million loss and revenues of just $298 million.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Many companies will not see the uncertainty of a global pandemic as the perfect moment to go international, but for others (particularly in healthcare, online communications, and workplace mobility) the market is stronger than ever and companies are having to respond quickly internationally to both service existing clients and take advantage of the growth in demand.</p>
<p>We and our team at <a href="https://www.taylorwessing.com/en">Taylor Wessing</a> advise 50 to 75 venture-backed North American companies each year on setting up in Europe or Asia. We’ve helped companies such as TaskRabbit, Lime, Glossier, InVision and many others translate their domestic success to new jurisdictions and cultures and to thrive as global businesses.</p>
<p>This is a practical guide to international expansion with the challenges of the current time in mind. It&#8217;s a quick-read providing some practical tips and sharing best practices from peer companies to help you come out of the pandemic with a strong international presence. A great deal of this advice is evergreen and will serve you well whatever the circumstances may be.</p>
<p>In particular, we&#8217;ll cover the rise (and risks) of distributed workforces — a way for CEOs to hire the best talent anywhere in the world. This has taken on new significance with the boom in remote working as one of several options for CEOs looking for strategic growth during and after COVID.</p>
<h2>Is this the right time to expand overseas?</h2>
<p>Ten years ago, the timing question was much simpler. Founders would first of all focus on developing a product and winning over their domestic market, funded through their Series A and B rounds, and then go on to raise their Series C round, which investors would expect to be used to push into new markets.</p>
<p>Since then, with the age of the smartphone in full swing and international direct ordering ubiquitous, opportunities to sell into new markets appeared far earlier in a company&#8217;s growth and there is no longer a canned strategy for timing your international expansion.</p>
<p>The current circumstances have exaggerated this trend. There are many challenges in traditional sectors, but also many new market opportunities quickly appearing in healthcare and other technology sectors with founders wanting to move quickly into new markets.</p>
<p>Although it may be tempting to just get a few sales people on the ground to go for it, we would still recommend laying some groundwork and making some key decisions before diving in. For example: ensuring management can give sufficient time and attention to the new market; tweaking your product to comply with local regulations; reworking your sales approach.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			If you are early-stage, tread carefully. Our belief is that the Series B round is still the earliest a founder or board should consider international expansion.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</span></p>
<p>If you are early-stage, tread carefully. Our belief is that the Series B round is still the earliest a founder or board should consider international expansion. The companies we&#8217;ve worked with who have moved earlier than the B round will generally end up realizing it&#8217;s too early. They&#8217;ll end up pressing pause, or making a full strategic exit, tail between legs.</p>
<p>International expansion is a matter of focus, as well as financial resources. Once you&#8217;re selling into a new market, everyone in the business needs to be thinking internationally, including the CEO, CFO, general counsel, the board, engineers and staff. It can stretch everyone before there are the necessary resources in place to cope.</p>
<h2>Decision made: How do you get going quickly?</h2>
<p>Even in the best of times our advice would be to not experiment or push the boundaries when it comes to your international strategy, do that elsewhere in your business. You should follow the path <em>most</em> travelled at this stage. This is especially true in the current climate. If you&#8217;re thinking of doing something new, something your peers haven&#8217;t done before, we should have a conversation first.</p>
<p>Whichever market you&#8217;ve chosen, there are some universal first steps (although they might vary slightly between jurisdictions). For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a permanent establishment for tax purposes (i.e., the local tax authorities consider you established enough to be paying income tax and corporation tax), work on the basis that you&#8217;ll need to incorporate a company or register a local branch.</li>
<li>Consider flexible options when it comes to taking on people (more on this below). Remember that in all cases local employment contracts will be needed (subject to the use of PEOs – see below).</li>
<li>Perhaps most importantly, local agreements transferring IP ownership will be needed (see next chapter).</li>
<li>There will also be some local filings (e.g., tax, corporate, payroll) where you will need a local service provider such as an accountant and payroll provider.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Singapore on Friday granted four firms including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ant-group" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ant-group">Ant Group <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/grabtaxi" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="grabtaxi">Grab <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> the licenses to run digital banks in the Southeast Asian country, in a move that would allow tech giants to expand their financial services offerings.</p>
<p>The nation’s central bank, Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), said it applied a “rigorous, merit-based process” to select a strong slate of digital banks. As these digital banks start their pilot operations, MAS said it will review whether more companies could be granted this license.</p>
<p>A total of 21 firms including TikTok-parent firm ByteDance had applied to get a digital license, of which 14 met the eligibility criteria, MAS <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2020/mas-announces-successful-applicants-of-licences-to-operate-new-digital-banks-in-singapore">said</a>. Tech giants see a major opportunity in expanding to financial services as a way to supercharge their revenue in the rapidly growing region.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The other two licenses went to an entity wholly-owned by internet giant Sea, and a consortium of Greenland Financial Holdings, Linklogis Hong Kong and Beijing Cooperative Equity Investment Fund Management.</p>
<p>Like traditional banks, Grab-<a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/singtel" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="singtel">Singtel <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Sea will be able to offer customers banking accounts, debit and credit cards and other services. Digital wholesale banks &#8212; the licenses of which went to Ant-owned entity and Greenland Financial consortium &#8212; will serve small and medium-sized businesses. None of them will be required to have a physical presence.</p>
<p>“We expect them to thrive alongside the incumbent banks and raise the industry’s bar in delivering quality financial services, particularly for currently underserved businesses and individuals,” said MAS MD Ravi Menon in a statement. A handful of countries including the UK, India, and Hong Kong have streamlined their regulations in recent years to grant tech companies the ability to operate as digital banks.</p>
<p>Ride-hailing firm Grab and telecom operator Singtel <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/30/grab-and-singtel-team-up-to-apply-for-a-digital-full-bank-license-in-singapore/">formed a consortium last year</a> to apply for the digital full bank license. Their combined experience and expertise “will further our goal to empower more people to gain better control of their money and achieve better economic outcomes for themselves, their businesses and families,” said Anthony Tan, Group CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Grab, in a statement Friday.</p>
<p>In a statement, Ant Group said, “Over the years, Ant Group has accumulated substantial experience and proven success, especially in China where we work with partner financial institutions to serve the needs of SMEs,” Ant said in a statement. “We look forward to building stronger and deeper collaborations with all participants in the financial services industry in Singapore.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The world&#8217;s food supply <a href="https://www.un.org/press/en/2009/gaef3242.doc.htm#:~:text=Food%20production%20must%20double%20by%202050%20to%20meet%20the%20demand,a%20panel%20discussion%20on%20%E2%80%9CNew">must double by the year 2050</a> to meet the demands of a growing population, according to a report from the United Nations. And as pressure mounts to find new crop land to support the growth, the world&#8217;s eyes are increasingly turning to the African continent as the next potential global bread basket.</p>
<p>While Africa has 65% of the world&#8217;s remaining uncultivated arable land, according to the African Development Bank, the countries on the continent face significant obstacles as they look to boost the productivity of their agricultural industries.</p>
<p>On the continent, 80% of families depend on agriculture for their livelihoods, but only 4% use irrigation. Many families also lack access to reliable and affordable electricity. It&#8217;s these twin problems that Samir Ibrahim and his co-founder at <a href="https://sunculture.com/">SunCulture</a>, Charlie Nichols, have spent the last eight years trying to solve.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Armed with a new financing model and purpose-built small solar-powered generators and water pumps, Nichols and Ibrahim have already built a network of customers using their equipment to increase incomes by anywhere from five to 10 times their previous levels by growing higher-value cash crops, cultivating more land and raising more livestock.</p>
<p>The company also just closed on $14 million in funding to expand its business across Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to double the amount of food we have to create by 2050, and if you look at where there are enough resources to grow food &#8212; all signs point to Africa. You have a lot of farmers and a lot of land, and a lot of resources,&#8221; Ibrahim said.</p>
<p>African small farmers face two big problems as they look to increase productivity, Ibrahim said.<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/apeel-gets-more-cash-to-fight-food-insecurity-in-emerging-markets-with-its-food-preserving-tech/"> One is access to markets</a>, which alone is a huge source of food waste, and the other is food security because of a lack of stable growing conditions exacerbated by climate change.</p>

<p>As one small farmer <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2020/03/26/african-countries-must-get-smarter-with-their-agriculture">told The Economist</a> earlier this year, “The rainy season is not predictable. When it is supposed to rain it doesn’t, then it all comes at once.”</p>
<p>Ibrahim, who graduated from New York University in 2011, had long been drawn to the African continent. His father was born in Tanzania and his mother grew up in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/kenya" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="kenya">Kenya <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and they eventually found their way to the U.S. But growing up, Ibrahim was told stories about East Africa.</p>
<p>While pursuing a business degree at NYU Ibrahim met Nichols, who had been working on large-scale solar projects in the U.S., at an event for budding entrepreneurs in New York.</p>
<p>The two began a friendship and discussed potential business opportunities stemming from a paper Nichols had read about renewable energy applications in the agriculture industry.</p>
<p>After winning second place in a business plan competition sponsored by NYU, the two men decided to prove that they should have won first. They booked tickets to Kenya and tried to launch a pilot program for their business selling solar-powered water pumps and generators.</p>
<p>Conceptually solar water-pumping systems have been around for decades. But as the costs of solar equipment and energy storage have declined, the systems that leverage those components have become more accessible to a broader swath of the global population.</p>
<p>That timing is part of what has enabled <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sunculture-2" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sunculture-2">SunCulture <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to succeed where other companies have stumbled. &#8220;We moved here at a time when [solar] reached grid parity in a lot of markets. It was at a time when a lot of development financiers were funding the nexus between agriculture and energy,&#8221; said Ibrahim.</p>
<p>Initially, the company sold its integrated energy generation and water-pumping systems to the middle income farmers who hold jobs in cities like Nairobi and cultivate crops on land they own in rural areas. These &#8220;telephone farmers&#8221; were willing to spend the $5,000 required to install SunCulture&#8217;s initial systems.</p>
<p>Now, the cost of a system is somewhere between $500 and $1,000 and is more accessible for the 570 million farming households across the word &#8212; with the company&#8217;s &#8220;pay-as-you-grow&#8221; model.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a spin on what&#8217;s become a popular business model for the distribution of solar systems of all types across Africa. Investors have poured nearly $1 billion into the development of off-grid solar energy and retail technology companies like M-kopa, Greenlight Planet, d.light design, ZOLA Electric and SolarHome, according to Ibrahim. In some ways, SunCulture just extends that model to agricultural applications.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have had to bundle services and financing. The reason this particularly works is because our customers are increasing their incomes four or five times,&#8221; said Ibrahim. &#8220;Most of the money has been going to consuming power. This is the first time there has been productive power.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SunCulture&#8217;s hardware consists of 300-watt solar panels and a 440-watt-hour battery system. The batteries can support up to four lights, two phones and a plug-in submersible water pump. </span></p>
<p>The company&#8217;s best-selling product line can support irrigation for a two-and-a-half acre farm, Ibrahim said. &#8220;<span style="font-weight: 400;">We see ourselves as an entry point for other types of appliances. We’re growing to be the largest solar company for Africa.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>With the $14 million in funding, from investors including <span style="font-weight: 400;">Energy Access Ventures (EAV), Électricité</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">de France (EDF), Acumen Capital Partners (ACP) and Dream Project Incubators (DPI), SunCulture will expand its footprint in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Zambia, Senegal, Togo and Cote D’Ivoire, the company said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China is a step closer to cracking down on unscrupulous data collection by app developers. This week, the country&#8217;s cybersecurity watchdog <a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/2020-12/01/c_1608389002456595.htm">began seeking comment</a> on the range of user information that apps from instant messengers to ride-hailing services are allowed to collect.</p>
<p>The move follows in the footstep of a <a href="https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/personal-information-protection-draft/">proposed data protection law</a> that was released in October and is currently under review. The comprehensive data privacy law is set to be a &#8220;milestone&#8221; if passed and implemented, <a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202010/13/WS5f85968ea31024ad0ba7e715.html">wrote</a> the editorial of China Daily, the Chinese Communist Party&#8217;s official mouthpiece. The law is set to restrict data practices not just by private firms but also among government departments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some leaking of personal information has resulted in economic losses for individuals when the information is used to swindle the targeted individual of his or her money,&#8221; said the party paper. &#8220;With increasingly advanced technology, the collection of personal information has been extended to biological information such as an individual&#8217;s face or even genes, which could result in serious consequences if such information is misused.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apps in China often force users into surrendering excessive personal information by declining access when users refuse to consent. The draft rules released this week take aim at the practice by defining the types of data collection that are &#8220;<a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/2020-12/01/c_1608389002247944.htm">legal, proper and necessary</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the draft, &#8220;necessary&#8221; data are those that ensure the &#8220;normal operation of apps&#8217; basic functions.&#8221; As long as users have allowed the collection of necessary data, apps must grant them access.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of what&#8217;s considered &#8220;necessary&#8221; personal data for different types of apps, as translated by <a href="https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/app-necessary-data/">China Law Translate</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigation: location</li>
<li>Ride-hailing: the registered user&#8217;s real identity (normally in the form of one&#8217;s mobile phone number in China) and location information</li>
<li>Messaging: the registered user&#8217;s real identity and contact list</li>
<li>Payment: the registered user&#8217;s real identity, the payer/payee&#8217;s bank information</li>
<li>Online shopping: the registered user&#8217;s real identity, payment details, information about the recipient like their name, address and phone number</li>
<li>Games: the registered user&#8217;s real identity</li>
<li>Dating: the registered user&#8217;s real identity, and the age, sex and marital status of the person looking for marriage or dating</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also categories of apps that are required to grant users access without gathering any personal information upfront: live streaming, short video, video/music streaming, news, browsers, photo editors and app stores.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that while the draft provides clear rules for apps to follow, it gives no details on how they will be enforced or how offenders will be punished. For instance, will app stores incorporate the benchmark into their approval process? Or will internet users be the watchdog? It remains to be seen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Like many overseas Chinese, Derek Weng gets shopping requests from his family and friends whenever he returns to China. Some of the most wanted imported products are maternity items, cosmetics and vitamin supplements. Many in China still uphold the belief that &#8220;imported products are better.&#8221;</p>
<p>The demand gave Weng a business idea. In 2018, he founded <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/lemonbox" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="lemonbox">LemonBox <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> to sell American health supplements to Chinese millennials like himself via online channels. The company soon <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/13/lemonbox-raises-2-million/">attracted seed funding from Y Combinator</a> and just this week, it announced the completion of a pre-A round of $2.5 million led by Panda Capital and followed by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/y-combinator" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="y-combinator">Y Combinator <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>LemonBox tries to differentiate itself from other import businesses on two levels &#8212; affordability and personalization. Weng, who previously worked at Walmart, where he was involved in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/20/walmart-sells-yihaodian-its-chinese-e-commerce-marketplace-to-alibaba-rival-jd-com/">retail giant&#8217;s China import business</a>, told TechCrunch that he&#8217;s acquainted with a lot of American supplement manufacturers and is thus able to cut middleman costs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;In China, most supplements are sold at a big markup through pharmacies or multi-level marketing companies like Amway,&#8221; Weng said. &#8220;But vitamins aren&#8217;t that expensive to produce. Amway and the likes spend a lot on marketing and sales.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2083004" style="width: 670px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2083004" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2083004 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/951607041281_.pic_.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="495" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/951607041281_.pic_.jpg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/951607041281_.pic_.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/951607041281_.pic_.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/951607041281_.pic_.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/951607041281_.pic_.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/951607041281_.pic_.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2083004" class="wp-caption-text">Inside LemonBox&#8217;s fulfillment center (Image: LemonBox)</p></div></p>
<p>LemonBox designed a WeChat-based lite app, where users receive product recommendations after taking a questionnaire about their health conditions. Instead of selling by the bottle, the company customizes user needs by offering daily packs of various supplements.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are a vegetarian and travel a lot, and the other person smokes a lot, [your demands] are going to be very different. I wanted to customize user prescriptions using big data,&#8221; explained Weng, who studied artificial intelligence in business school.</p>
<p>A monthly basket of 30 B-complex tablets, for instance, costs 35 yuan ($5) on LemonBox. Amway&#8217;s counterpart product, a bottle of 120 tablets, asks for 229 yuan on JD.com. That&#8217;s about 57 yuan ($9) for 30 tablets.</p>
<p>Selling cheaper vitamins is just a means for LemonBox to attract consumers and gather health insights into Chinese millennials, with which the company hopes to widen its product range. Weng declined to disclose the company&#8217;s customer size, but claimed that its user conversion rate is &#8220;higher than most e-commerce sites.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the new proceeds, LemonBox is opening a second fulfillment center in the Shenzhen free-trade zone after its Silicon Valley-based one. That&#8217;s to provide more stability to its supply chain as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupts international flights and cross-border trade. Moreover, the startup will spend the money on securing health-related certificates and adding Japan to its sourcing regions.</p>
<h2>Returnees adapt</h2>

<p>In the decade or so when Weng was living in the U.S., the Chinese internet saw drastic changes and gave rise to an industry largely in the grip of Alibaba and Tencent. Weng realized he couldn&#8217;t simply replicate America&#8217;s direct-to-customer playbook in China.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the U.S., you might build a website and maybe an app. You will embed your service into Google, Facebook or Instagram to market your products. Every continent is connected with one other,&#8221; said Weng.</p>
<p>&#8220;In China, it&#8217;s pretty significantly different. First off, not a lot of people use web browsers, but everyone is on mobile phones. Baidu is not as popular as Google, but everybody is using WeChat, and WeChat is isolated from other major traffic platforms.&#8221;</p>
<p>As such, LemonBox is looking to diversify beyond its WeChat store by launching a web version as well as a store through Alibaba&#8217;s Tmall marketplace.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of learning to be done. It&#8217;s a very humbling experience,&#8221; said Weng.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.otv.vc/">OTV</a> (formerly known as Olive Tree Ventures), an Israeli venture capital firm that focuses on digital health tech, announced it has closed a new fund totaling $170 million. The firm also launched a new office in Shanghai, China to spearhead its growth in the Asia Pacific region.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/olive-tree-ventures" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="olive-tree-ventures">OTV <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> currently has a total of 11 companies in its portfolio. This year, it led rounds in telehealth platforms TytoCare and Lemonaid Health, and its other investments include genomic machine learning platform Emedgene; microscopy imaging startup Scopio; and at-home cardiac and pulmonary monitor Donisi Health. OTV has begun investing in more B and C rounds, with the goal of helping companies that have already validated products deal with regulations and other issues as they expand.</p>
<p>OTV focuses on digital health products that have the potential to work in different countries, make healthcare more affordable and fill gaps in overwhelmed healthcare systems.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Jose Antonio Urrutia Rivas will serve as OTV’s head of Asia Pacific, managing its Shanghai office and helping the firm&#8217;s portfolio companies expand in China and other Asian countries. This brings OTV’s offices to a total of four, with other locations in New York, Tel Aviv and Montreal. Before joining OTV, Rivas worked at financial firm LarrainVial as its Asian market director.</p>
<p>OTV was founded in 2015 by general partners Mayer Gniwisch, Amir Lahat and Alejandro Weinstein. OTV partner Manor Zemer, who has worked in Asian markets for over 15 years and spent the last five living in Beijing, told TechCrunch that the firm decided it was the right time to expand into Asia because &#8220;digital health is already highly well-developed in many Asia-Pacific countries, where digital health products complement in-person healthcare providers, making that region a natural fit for a venture capital firm specializing in the field.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that OTV &#8220;wanted to capitalize on how the COVID-19 pandemic has thrust the internationalized and interconnected nature of the world’s healthcare infrastructures into the limelight, even though digital health was a growth area long before the pandemic.&#8221;</p>

The EO is like others in that it is [&#8230;]]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">An executive order was <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-promoting-use-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence-federal-government/">just issued</a> from the White House regarding &#8220;the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Government.&#8221; Leaving aside the meritless presumption of the government&#8217;s own trustworthiness and that it is the <em>software</em> that has trust issues, the order is almost entirely hot air.</p>
<p>The EO is like others in that it is limited to what a president can peremptorily force federal agencies to do — and that really isn&#8217;t very much, practically speaking. This one &#8220;directs Federal agencies to be guided&#8221; by nine principles, which gives away the level of impact right there. Please, agencies — be guided!</p>
<p>And then, of course, all military and national security activities are excepted, which is where AI systems are at their most dangerous and oversight is most important. No one is worried about what NOAA is doing with AI — but they are very concerned with what three-letter agencies and the Pentagon are getting up to. (They have their own, self-imposed rules.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The principles are something of a wish list. AI used by the feds must be:</p>
<blockquote><p>lawful; purposeful and performance-driven; accurate, reliable, and effective; safe, secure, and resilient; understandable; responsible and traceable; regularly monitored; transparent; and accountable.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would challenge anyone to find <em>any</em> significant deployment of AI that is all of these things, anywhere in the world. Any agency claims that an AI or machine learning system they use adheres to all these principles as they are detailed in the EO should be treated with extreme skepticism.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that the principles themselves are bad or pointless — it&#8217;s certainly important that an agency be able to quantify the risks when considering using AI for something, and that there is a process in place for monitoring their effects. But an executive order doesn&#8217;t accomplish this. Strong laws, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/massachusetts-votes-to-pass-statewide-police-ban-on-facial-recognition/">likely starting at the city and state level</a>, have already shown what it is to demand AI accountability, and though a federal law is unlikely to appear any time soon, this is not a replacement for a comprehensive bill. It&#8217;s just too hand-wavey on just about everything. Besides, many agencies already adopted &#8220;principles&#8221; like these years ago.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="BpAOlCW92M"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facial-recognition-ban-portland-oregon/">Portland passes expansive city ban on facial recognition tech</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Portland passes expansive city ban on facial recognition tech&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/facial-recognition-ban-portland-oregon/embed/#?secret=BpAOlCW92M" data-secret="BpAOlCW92M" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The one thing the EO does in fact do is compel each agency to produce a list of all the uses to which it is putting AI, however it may be defined. Of course, it&#8217;ll be more than a year before we see that.</p>
<p>Within 60 days of the order, the agencies will choose the format for this AI inventory; 180 days after that, the inventory must be completed; 120 days after that, the inventory must be completed and reviewed for consistency with the principles; plans to bring systems in line with them the agencies must &#8220;strive&#8221; to accomplish within 180 further days; meanwhile, within 60 days of the inventories having been completed they must be shared with other agencies; then, within 120 days of completion, they must be shared with the public (minus anything sensitive for law enforcement, national security, etc.).</p>
<p>In theory we might have those inventories in a month, but in practice we&#8217;re looking at about a year and a half, at which point we&#8217;ll have a snapshot of AI tools from the previous administration, with all the juicy bits taken out at their discretion. Still, it might make for interesting reading depending on what exactly goes into it.</p>
<p>This executive order is, like others of its ilk, an attempt by this White House to appear as an active leader on something that is almost entirely out of their hands. To develop and deploy AI should certainly be done according to common principles, but even if those principles could be established in a top-down fashion, this loose, lightly binding gesture that kind-of, sort-of makes some agencies have to pinky-swear to think real hard about them isn&#8217;t the way to do it.</p>

<p>One of the key figures from the last two decades of the tech industry in the U.K., most recently White has been co-chair of <a href="https://gbxglobal.org/">GBx</a>, a curated network of British entrepreneurs; a non-executive director for the U.K.’s Behavioural Insights Team where he advised on social impact technology products; and a former co-founder of <a href="https://www.moonfruit.com/">Moonfruit</a>, a website and e-commerce platform hosting 7 million sites, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/15/moonfruit-finally-exits-for-29-million-in-cash-to-re-energise-yell/">acquired by Yell.com</a> in 2012. He received an MBE from HM Queen in 2017 for Services to Technology Businesses.</p>
<p>White brings to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) huge experience as an entrepreneur and VC. The appointment is also a first for the U.K. White’s role as HM Consul-General has been combined with that of the new role of Technology Envoy to the United States. TechCrunch understands that this will involve high-level activity not just in San Francisco but also in Washington, DC, as tech goes up the political agenda under the new Biden presidency.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>White&#8217;s combined role will lead the Consulate, manage relationships in the northwest of the U.S., support the U.K. Ambassador to the U.S. on areas of shared U.K.-U.S. interest, including technology and entrepreneurship, and support Her Majesty&#8217;s Trade Commissioner in “promoting and enhancing the U.K. as partner of choice in trade, investment and research and development.”</p>
<p>In a statement, White said: “It is an honour to represent the UK at this critical time, and a pleasure to support our world-renowned tech sector which continues to go from strength to strength. I am looking forward to working closely with UK government tech teams in the US and in the UK, to further our growing and important relationship with the US tech community.”</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab added: “The UK and the US are the largest investors in each other’s economies and this important appointment further underlines our commitment to the tech sector. I am delighted Joe will take on this enhanced role as we look to build back better and support an innovative post-pandemic global economy.”</p>
<p>White will take up his appointment later this year. He will report to Dame Karen Pierce DCMG, Her Majesty’s Ambassador to the United States of America.</p>
<p><strong>TechCrunch Comment: </strong></p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/person/joe-white-2" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="joe-white-2">Joe White <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> just hit a quadruple. He is the right man, in the right place, with the right experience, at the right time.</p>
<p>He’s a former entrepreneur, investor and has worked on both sides of &#8220;the pond&#8221;, so knows the U.K. and European tech scene as well as Silicon Valley. He has deep connections in all those ecosystems. And it can’t hurt that his wife, Wendy Tan White MBE, is vice president at X, (formerly Google X), Alphabet&#8217;s moonshot company, and co-founded Moonfruit with him. Furthermore, White is no stranger to the worlds of politics and diplomacy. His father, Michael White, was The Guardian newspaper&#8217;s political editor for many years.</p>
<p>Under Prime Minister David Cameron, the U.K. government was a keen exponent of the tech industry. Brexit cooled its ire in recent years, but the current chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has proved his interest by creating the U.K.’s Future Fund, hailed as a big success during the COVID period.</p>
<p>The U.K. and U.S. not only have a shared history, but they also have shared industries. The U.K. has been the traditional launching pad for U.S. startups into Europe. Likewise, Silicon Valley is now awash with British-born entrepreneurs and investors. But with tensions around the actions of U.S. Big Tech in the U.K. (the &#8220;Online Harms&#8221; legislation is aimed at social platforms), controversies over tax and global security issues all on the agenda, it’s right that the Consul General role in SF is bolstered by this new Tech Envoy moniker.</p>
<p>Silicon Valley is also about to get a fellow tech entrepreneur into one of the highest roles the U.K. government can bestow overseas. There could hardly be a better person for the job.</p>

Do you know what happened since? Silencing in the most fundamental way possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Google declined to comment, except to point to an email from Jeff Dean, the head of Google Research, in which he said Gebru had threatened to resign unless certain conditions were met.

<p>It&#8217;s a great time to be a gamer — I mean, what else is there to do? And with the prospect of a long winter and lonely holiday season ahead of us, here&#8217;s a list of games on all the major platforms that you can really sink your teeth — and a few dozen hours — into.</p>

<h1>All major platforms</h1>
<h2><strong>Assassin&#8217;s Creed: Valhalla<br />
</strong></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2080748" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ac-valhalla.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2080748" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2080748" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ac-valhalla.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Assassin's creed valhalla showing a viking on a british landscape" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ac-valhalla.jpg 1449w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ac-valhalla.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ac-valhalla.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ac-valhalla.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ac-valhalla.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ac-valhalla.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2080748" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Ubisoft</p></div></p>
<p>I genuinely enjoyed AC: Odyssey&#8217;s gorgeous landscapes and main characters, but the game systems felt disconnected and arbitrary. That&#8217;s much less the case with AC: Valhalla, which tells a similarly sprawling tale of Vikings in England but works a little harder to put it together into a cohesive whole. It&#8217;s still very much &#8220;Ubisoft Game, but with Vikings&#8221; but that&#8217;s not necessarily a bad thing.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>$50 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B087XTT5GZ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B087XTT5GZ&amp;linkId=6c7c3a83cd71f7da11b7777412daa3b5">from Amazon</a></p>
<h2><strong>Minecraft Dungeons</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/minecraft-dungeons-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1992762" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/minecraft-dungeons-1.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="394" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/minecraft-dungeons-1.jpg 700w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/minecraft-dungeons-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/minecraft-dungeons-1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/minecraft-dungeons-1.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/minecraft-dungeons-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a>I thought this game was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/22/minecraft-dungeons-has-charm-and-potential-but-needs-lot-more-time-in-the-furnace/">a bit limited when it first came out</a>, but since then it has gotten several new areas and cross-platform multiplayer. Between that and its simplified systems and PG-level violence, Minecraft Dungeons is a great option for families that want to fight monsters together.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $20-30 (depending on platform)<a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-dungeons"> from Mojang</a></p>
<h2><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</strong></h2>
<p>Reviewers agree: The new CODBLOPS is definitely more CODBLOPS. The latest in the gritty military series is the one everyone will be playing for the next year, so it&#8217;s definitely a must-have for quite a few people.</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> $50-60 (depending on platform) <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GR4QMC9/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B08GR4QMC9&amp;linkId=79759a7cfc8cdabab03d980a9dda04ca">from Amazon</a></p>
<h2><strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2082772" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2077.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082772" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2082772" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2077.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2077.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2077.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2077.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2077.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2077.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2077.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cyberpunk-2077.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2082772" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> CD Projekt Red</p></div></p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077, the futuristic RPG from the creators of the Witcher, isn&#8217;t out yet, but it&#8217;s one of the most anticipated titles in recent years and your special someone might like the idea that they&#8217;re getting it day one. Of course if it&#8217;s anything like The Witcher 3, they&#8217;re probably going to want to wait a few months for the bugs to get ironed out. But hey, it&#8217;s an option.</p>
<p><strong>Price: </strong>$50 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DJWBYKP/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=techcrunchgg-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B07DJWBYKP&amp;linkId=4fc23c1d2db47bac2ac8947d664ec08b">from Amazon</a></p>
<h1>PS4 and PS5</h1>
<h2><strong>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</strong></h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2082780" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ps5-miles.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082780" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2082780" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ps5-miles.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ps5-miles.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ps5-miles.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ps5-miles.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ps5-miles.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ps5-miles.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ps5-miles.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ps5-miles.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ps5-miles.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2082780" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Sony</p></div></p>
<p>This semi-sequel to the much-lauded 2018 Spider-Man is smaller in scale but plays even better. Plus it has a wonderfully inclusive cast and tone and feels authentic, where the original, for all its strengths, had a pretty flat take on New York. Bonus: If you buy the PS5 version of Miles Morales, you get the remastered 2018 game for free. I&#8217;d argue you&#8217;re simply not going to find a better bang for your buck right now with any other new game.</p>

<p>The only &#8220;true&#8221; next-generation game out there right now is a remake of a PlayStation 3 game, and in many ways it feels like it. But in other ways, it&#8217;s the most amazing game on the market right now. If your loved one has enjoyed Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro and other incredibly hard games, this is the one to get.</p>

<p>Between Nioh 2, Sekiro and Ghost of Tsushima, there&#8217;s a real bumper crop of samurai and ninja action to be had. But Ghost is the broadest and most beautiful of them all — if not necessarily the deepest.</p>
<p>What it lacks in challenge&#8230; first of all, is more than made up by the difficulty of those other two games I mentioned, give me a break. But Ghost&#8217;s draw is in the unity and beauty of its game world and systems. For example, instead of a quest marker or arrow pointing toward your objective, the wind is just always blowing in that direction. Amazing, right? The single player campaign is remarkably well acted, and a free update has brought a surprisingly extensive multiplayer co-op mode as well. This is truly a game you can lose yourself in. Just don&#8217;t start trying to collect everything or you&#8217;ll never leave the first area.</p>

<p>This totally unique game came out of left field and obsessed me for two solid weeks. A combination of adventure game, visual novel and tactical action game, 13 Sentinels puts you in charge of a bunch of high school kids piloting giant robots to save the world from alien invaders. (In case you can&#8217;t tell, it&#8217;s a Japanese production.)</p>
<p>Sound familiar? That&#8217;s the idea — and then it starts pulling rugs out from under you and doesn&#8217;t stop until the last few minutes. The labyrinthine story, which progresses simultaneously through 13 interwoven narratives, is the very best kind of sci-fi mind-boggler and a pleasure to unravel from start to finish. The combat is also compelling and satisfying, if not particularly deep or challenging. There&#8217;s simply nothing else like this out there.</p>

<p>If your loved one is a Halo fan, they&#8217;re likely very sad since Halo: Infinite, once a launch title for the new console, won&#8217;t be coming out until next year. But it can&#8217;t hurt to have the original games all updated and beautified to play through as an appetizer. Plus there&#8217;s the famous Halo multiplayer to get everyone through the winter.</p>

<p>No one really expected that the Gears of War series would lend itself to a tactics game in the style of XCOM — let alone that it would leapfrog others in the genre and become one of the best you can get, period. Naturally it isn&#8217;t quite the urgent, visceral experience that Gears normally is, but this is a surprisingly deep and engrossing game.</p>

<p>The sequel to the lauded &#8220;metroidvania&#8221; Ori and the Blind Forest is technically on several platforms, but the Series X seems to be the absolute best one on which to play it. With beautifully updated art and a silky-smooth framerate, this will look better on that new 4K HDR TV than many &#8220;real&#8221; next-generation games. But don&#8217;t let the beautiful yet cute art style make you think this will be a cakewalk. Like the first in the series, you&#8217;ll need some serious dexterity to complete this platformer.</p>

<p>No one is quite sure whether the first Halo of the next generation is going to be as good as everyone hopes, and a delay to early next year didn&#8217;t allay anyone&#8217;s fears.

<p>Spelunky 2 is the most traditional, in a way. Sequel to one of the best games out there, this one adds more variety, more weirdness and more challenge to the unforgiving platforming of the original. Like before, every death (and there will be a lot) is avoidable and while some runs may last only seconds, it&#8217;s hard to be deterred when you know that if you just paid a little more attention, or saved your bombs, or went over that other way&#8230; just one more game. (Pro tip: Buy a couple copies for friends and indulge in jolly cooperation.)</p>
<p>Hades combines the procedurally generated levels with an incredibly beautiful art style and an ingenious story and progression system. Escaping from the ever-shifting landscape of Hades, you&#8217;re going to die over and over, but as a young god, that&#8217;s more inconvenience than obstacle. Meanwhile every death and every inch of progress moves you closer to the mystery of your birth in a clever modern take on Greek mythology. It&#8217;s honestly hard to imagine how Hades could be improved in almost any way.</p>

<p>This long-awaited strategy title puts you in the throne room of a European medieval dynasty, where you can do&#8230; pretty much anything to get ahead. Assassinations, proxy wars, brutal taxes, religious cannibalism, strategic marriages&#8230; it&#8217;s all on the table. This is a story-telling engine that&#8217;s remarkably robust and, once you get past the initial learning curve, very fun. It&#8217;s also very, very nerdy, and proud of it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Latin America’s startup scene has attracted troves of venture investment, lifting highly-valued companies such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/30/softbank-makes-a-huge-bet-on-latin-america/">Rappi</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/26/fintech-decacorn-nubank-raises-400m-led-by-tcv/"> NuBank</a> into behemoth businesses. Now that the spotlight has arrived, those same startups need more talent than ever before to meet demand.</p>
<p>That’s where one seed-stage Buenos Aires startup wants to help. <a href="https://www.soyhenry.com/">Henry </a>has created an online computer science school that trains software developers from low-income backgrounds to understand technical skills and get employed. The company was founded by brother-sister duo <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luzborchardt/">Luz</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-borchardt?originalSubdomain=ar">Martin Borchardt</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mbarnaferres/">Manuel Barna Ferrés</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antoniotralice/">Antonio Tralice</a> and Leonardo Maglia.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2082887" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2082887" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2082887 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/HENRY-TEAM.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/HENRY-TEAM.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/HENRY-TEAM.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/HENRY-TEAM.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/HENRY-TEAM.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/HENRY-TEAM.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/HENRY-TEAM.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/HENRY-TEAM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2082887" class="wp-caption-text">The Henry team.</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company claims that there’s an estimated 1 million software engineering job openings in Latin America, but fewer than 100,000 professionals that have training suitable for those roles.</p>
<p>“Higher education is only for 13% of the population in Latin America,” says Martin Borchardt, CEO and co-founder of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/henry-18a0" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="henry-18a0">Henry <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>. “It’s very exclusive, very expensive, and has very low impact skills. So we’re giving these people an opportunity.”</p>
<p>With 90% of graduates coming from no formal higher education background, Henry seeks to help bring more back-end junior developers and full-stack developers into startups. Henry offers a five-month course that goes from Monday to Friday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., which focuses on software developer skills. Beyond technical training, Henry gives participants job coaching, resume workshops and up-skilling opportunities post-graduation.</p>
<p>To make the school more affordable, Henry looks to take on the same strategy used by Lambda School, a YC-graduate that has raised over $122 million in known funding: income-share agreements. The set-up would allow for boot camp participants to join the program at zero upfront costs, and then only pay once they get hired at a job.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;As edtech grows cash rich, some lessons for early stage&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/24/as-edtech-grows-cash-rich-some-lessons-for-early-stage/embed/#?secret=19wBVWdInO" data-secret="19wBVWdInO" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Lambda School’s ISA terms ask students to pay 17% of their monthly salary for 24 months once they earn $4,167 monthly. The students pay a maximum of $30,000. Henry takes a much smaller slice of the pie, partly because salaries are lower in Latin American than in the United States. Henry asks students to pay 15% of their monthly salary for 24 months once students earn $500 a month.</p>
<p>If a Henry student doesn&#8217;t get employed in a job that allows them to make $500 a month within five years after the program completes, they are off the hook for paying back the boot camp.</p>
<p>Henry is also focused on helping more women get into the field of software development. Internally, Henry&#8217;s remote team is 20% women, 64% men. The current students reflect the same breakdown.</p>
<p>One issue with coding boot camps is that while it might help a student go from unemployed to employed, the lack of credential and degree might limit career mobility past that first job. For that reason, Henry has created a database of alumni resources, including up-skilling and reskilling opportunities in the latest skill, which will be free of charge for graduates.</p>
<p>Henry needs to execute on job placement to be successful in its field. Currently, more than 80% of students in Henry’s first cohort have found jobs, but it’s too soon in the startups’ trajectory to get a stronger metric on that front. About four Henry graduates have been employed by the startup.</p>
<p>The need for more talent in emerging countries has not gone unnoticed. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/investors-bet-millions-on-microverse-a-lambda-school-for-the-developing-world/">Microverse</a>, also funded by Y Combinator, is similarly using income-sharing agreements to bring education to the masses in developing countries, including spaces in Latin America. Henry thinks the competitor is approaching the dynamic too broadly.</p>

<p>“They’re focusing on all emerging markets and don’t teach to Spanish speakers,” Borchardt said. Henry, alternatively, focuses on Spanish speakers, over 60% of its market in Latin America.</p>
<p>What if Lambda School, the source of Henry&#8217;s inspiration, was to break into Latin America? The founder added that the richly funded company has tried, and failed, to expand into international geographies, including China and Europe, due to fragmentation.</p>
<p>Currently, Henry has graduated 200 students and is working with 600 students across Colombia, Chile, Uruguay and Argentina. It plans to expand into Mexico and to bring on Portuguese instruction.</p>
<p>Now, VCs are giving Henry some cash to do so. After going through Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer batch, Henry announced today that it has raised $1.5 million in seed funding in a round led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/venture-lab" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="venture-lab">Accion Venture Lab, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Emles Venture Partners and Noveus VC. There were also a number of edtech angel investors from Latin American that participated in the round.</p>
<p>“I love the human interaction within instructors and our staff and students,” Borchardt said. “That is something very powerful of Henry compared to a MOOC. The biggest challenge is how do you scale maintaining those assets that bring you that?”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://esportsone.com/">Esports One</a>, a startup bringing the fantasy approach to esports, is announcing that it has raised an additional $4 million in funding.</p>
<p>When I first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/09/esports-one-launches-its-fantasy-esports-platform/">wrote about Esports One in April</a>, co-founder and COO Sharon Winter described it as the first &#8220;all-in-one fantasy platform&#8221; in the esports world, allowing you to research players, create fantasy teams and watch games, with an initial focus on the North American and European divisions of League of Legends.</p>
<p>According to the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/esports-one" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="esports-one">Esports One <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> team, creating this platform required building out a set of data and analytics products, as well as using computer vision technology that can track game activity (and update player stats) without relying on a publisher&#8217;s API.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup says its user base has been growing by more than 25% month-over-month. It may also have benefited from the pause in professional sports earlier this year, while CEO and co-founder Matt Gunnin told me recently that he also sees fantasy as a way to make video games accessible to a broader audience — he recalled one Esports One user who introduced his sister to League of Legends using the fantasy platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;I use the example of growing up and sitting there with my dad, watching a baseball game, he&#8217;s telling me everything that’s happening,&#8221; Gunnin said. &#8220;Now it&#8217;s the opposite — parents are sitting and watching their kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many parents, he suggested, are &#8220;never going to pick up a mouse and keyboard and play League of Legends,&#8221; but they might play the fantasy version: &#8220;That’s an entry point &#8230; if we can make it easily accessible to individuals both that are hardcore gamers playing video games and watching League of Legends their entire life, as well as someone who has no idea what’s going on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new funding was led led by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/xseed-capital" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="xseed-capital">XSeed Capital, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Eniac Ventures, and Chestnut Street Ventures, bringing Esports One to a total of $7.3 million raised. The company also recently signed a partnership deal with lifestyle company <a href="https://www.eslgaming.com">ESL Gaming</a>.</p>
<p>Gunnin said the money will allow the company to grow its Bytes virtual currency, which players use to enter contests and buy customizations — starting next year, players will be able to spend real money to purchase Bytes. In addition, it&#8217;s working on native iOS and Android apps (Esports One is currently accessible via desktop and mobile web).</p>
<p>Gunnin and his team also plan to develop fantasy competitions for Rainbow Six: Siege, Rocket League, Valorant and Fortnite.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a fairly new player in the esports world, we’ve seen immense determination and grit from Matt, Sharon, and the whole Esports One team to grow into a household name,” said XSeed&#8217;s Damon Cronkey in a statement. “I’m excited to be partnering with a company that will deliver new perspectives and features to an evolving industry. We’re eager to see how Esports One grows in 2021.”</p>

					</ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Like many things in life, building great businesses is all about timing. We’ve seen multibillion dollar failures from the dot-com era such as Pets.com and Webvan be reincarnated a decade later as Chewy and Instacart &#8212; this time as runaway successes.</p>
<p>The same could be said about real estate technology companies, but startups in this category have not gotten the same opportunity and attention as their peers in other sectors.</p>
<p>For decades, proptech has received the short end of the stick. Real estate is the world&#8217;s largest asset class worth $277 trillion, three times the total value of all publicly traded companies. Still, fintech companies have received seven times more VC funding than real estate companies.</p>
<p>These lower levels of investment were previously attributed to the slow rate of technology adoption and digitalization within the real estate industry, but this is no longer the case. Companies in real estate are adopting innovation faster than ever. Now, 81% of real estate organizations plan to use new digital technologies in traditional business processes and spending on tech and software is growing at over 11% per year. Technological adoption has even accelerated throughout the pandemic as enterprises were forced to quickly adapt.</p>
<p>Historically, the strength or weakness of the broader economy and the real estate industry have been tightly coupled and correlated. While some may point to COVID-19&#8217;s negative impact on certain parts of real estate as evidence that proptech can only thrive in boom times, I believe building a successful proptech company is less about anticipating economic upswings and markets and more about timing and taking advantage of the right technological trends. In short, this is as good of a time as any to start a proptech company if you know where to look.</p>
<p>History is littered with examples of companies that have done just this. Let’s take a look at three:</p>
<h2>Procore</h2>
<ul>
<li>Founded: 2002.</li>
<li>Early traction: Used by celebrity housing projects in California.</li>
<li>Inflection point: 2012 (people start using iPads and smartphones on job sites).</li>
<li>Today: $5 billion valuation as of May 2020.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/procore-technologies" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="procore-technologies">Procore <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was founded in 2002 in the aftermath of the dot-com bust, well before widespread WiFi and five years before the iPhone. The company saw the capability for software and technology to transform the construction industry long before practitioners did. Its team faithfully and stubbornly kept at it through the financial crisis, but only had $5 million in revenue by 2012. Here’s where the timing kicks in: At this time, iPads and smartphones had become more common on worksites, enabling widespread adoption.</p>
<p>Realizing this change in-market and adapting to it, Procore strategically priced its product as a subscription, rather than based on headcount, as was typical in the industry. In this way, early customers like Wieland and Mortenson got their subcontractors and temp employees to use the product, which then created a flywheel effect that spread Procore to other projects and clients. Fast forward to today, Procore now has more than $290 million in ARR and is valued over $5 billion.</p>
<p>Procore&#8217;s persistence and agility ultimately enabled it to capitalize on the right technological trends and shifts, despite what initially seemed like a poorly timed decision to start a software company in a recession. Procore is now on a venture exit path as it continues to acquire new-age proptech companies like Avata Technologies, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/honest-buildings" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="honest-buildings">Honest Buildings <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and BIMAnywhere.</p>
<h2>Zillow</h2>
<ul>
<li>Founded: 2006.</li>
<li>Early traction: Launched with 1 million website visits.</li>
<li>Inflection point: 2009 (financial crisis mindset).</li>
<li>Today: Public — $27 billion market capitalization.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/zillow" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="zillow">Zillow <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was founded by the co-founders of Hotwire and Expedia. While that might not seem relevant, the vision to bring transparency to consumers is the connecting line, the mission being to provide access to siloed data and knowledge to previously convoluted industries. Before Zillow, homeowners did not know how much their house was worth. With Zillow’s Zestimate, consumers can put a price tag on every roof across North America.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">few weeks back</a>, we learned that Apple would be launching an &#8220;App Store Small Business Program&#8221; that would reduce its fees from 30% to 15% for developers earning less than $1 million per year from the App Store.</p>
<p>That program is starting to roll out now, with <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/apple" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="apple">Apple <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/">opening up the enrollment process</a> just this morning.</p>
<p>Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/">outlines the program here</a>, with a few things standing out:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s open to both new developers and existing developers who made less than $1 million this year across all of their apps combined.</li>
<li>Once a developer surpasses $1 million for the year, the rate goes back up to the standard rate.</li>
<li>Once the program kicks in after December 31, participating developers won&#8217;t be able to transfer apps to/from other accounts — presumably so that people don&#8217;t go &#8220;Oh, this app is making too much money. Quick, switch it to another account!&#8221;. &#8220;If you initiate an app transfer after December 31, 2020, or accept a transfer of an app that was initiated after December 31, 2020,&#8221; Apple writes, &#8220;you will no longer be eligible to participate in program.&#8221;</li>
<li>If you oversee multiple developer accounts, Apple wants you to identify them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple says that if you enroll by December 18, reduced fees should be active by January 1 of 2021. Existing developers can still enroll after that cutoff, but things get a bit more complicated, with reduced fees generally kicking in midway through the next fiscal calendar month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fintech startup <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> has announced an ambitious new product today called <a href="https://stripe.com/treasury">Stripe Treasury</a>. The company is partnering with banks to offer a banking-as-a-service API. In other words, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/stripe" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="stripe">Stripe <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> clients will be able to provide bank accounts to their customers — the service is invite-only for now.</p>
<p>This is part of a bigger trend called embedded finance. Essentially, instead of separating banking services from other services that you use, embedded finance products provide financial services as close as possible to the end customer in the services that they already use.</p>
<p>Other companies have been working on embedded business banking products, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/wise-raises-another-12-million-to-double-down-on-embedded-business-banking/">Wise</a>. Stripe could take advantage of its existing user base to convince them to use Stripe Treasury for new banking products.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For example, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/shopify" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="shopify">Shopify <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> will use Stripe Treasury for <a href="https://www.shopify.com/balance">Shopify Balance</a>. If a Shopify merchant wants to hold money, pay bills and spend money from their Shopify account, they can open a bank account in Shopify Balance directly. This way, they can skip the traditional bank account. Behind the scenes, Stripe Treasury powers that feature.</p>
<p>And yet, Stripe doesn’t want to become a bank. As usual, the company is focused on infrastructure and payments. It partners with banks, such as Evolve Bank and Goldman Sachs in the U.S. Eventually, Stripe also plans to launch Stripe Treasury in other countries thanks to partnerships with Citibank and Barclays.</p>
<p>Stripe turns everything into API calls. An API is a programming interface that lets you interact with third-party services using simple instructions. For instance, a developer can take advantage of Stripe Treasury to open bank accounts directly from their service by triggering Stripe’s API.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can move money or pay bills using API calls. Combined with <a href="https://stripe.com/issuing">Stripe Issuing</a>, you can also issue a virtual or physical card and connect it to a bank account. Slowly, Stripe is building products that cover a bigger chunk of the payment chain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Advancements in the tech and the cyber threat landscape are creating vast job opportunities. The global cybersecurity market is projected to reach £210 billion by 2026. But in the U.K., out of 952,000 working-age (16-64) U.K. military veterans and 15,000 service leavers a year, only 4% of them are working in tech and cyber. This is 20% lower than the non-veteran population. The cost to the U.K. economy of underemployed or unemployed veterans has been estimated at £1.5 billion over five years. This means all this talent &#8212; talent which has literally been trained to adapt to fast-moving situations like the one the world finds itself in now &#8212; is going to waste, just when the era of massive digitization of business and society is upon us.</p>
<p>So it’s significant that the U.K.’s <a href="https://www.rfea.org.uk/">RFEA</a>, the Forces Employment charity, is launching a new partnership with <a href="http://TechVets.co">TechVets</a>, the nonprofit set up to build a bridge for veterans into cybersecurity and the technology sector.</p>
<p>With the RFEA’s support, TechVets will create extensive new free upskilling and job opportunities for &#8220;tech-curious&#8221; service leavers and veterans, through its offering of networking, mentoring, signposting and training services, via its new TechVets Academy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The initiative is timely. It’s estimated that more than 173,000 U.K. military veterans are at risk due to the economic impact of COVID and the ending of the government&#8217;s furlough scheme in March 2021.</p>
<p>Since its launch in 2018, TechVets has grown to a community of over 6,000 members and several &#8220;chapters&#8221; around the U.K.</p>
<p>TechVets uses a blend of open-source resources, partner training and community support to empower those new to cyber/tech to choose the pathway that is best for them. And it’s all free to veterans and service leavers.</p>

<p>TechVets Programme Director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-m-062/">James Murphy</a> (pictured above) is an Army Veteran of 19 years. He joined the 1st Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment in 2000, before transferring to the Intelligence Corps in 2013 after sustaining life-long injuries in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.</p>
<p>In a statement, he said: “Anyone who has held a role in the Forces comes armed with an understanding of the sensitivities of working in security. Ex-Services also possess an innate ability to learn new skills and are natural problem solvers, who can work quickly and fit into a team with ease. Ex-military personnel are also the kind of people who thrive in pressurized, or time-sensitive, situations. These soft skills are incredible assets in the security and technology industries, which can be used to fill the current skills shortage in this area.”</p>
<p>RFEA’s Chief Executive Officer Alistair Halliday, added: “The TechVets Programme is a fantastic new addition to RFEA’s services that will, no doubt, encourage talented veterans to consider tech and security-based roles that may have otherwise overlooked. It will also help veterans to upskill digitally to help them get into wider roles too.”</p>
<p>TechVets member Gareth Paterson joined the Army in 1994. He started out as a tank crewman and then transferred to the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers as an instructor in 2001. He left in 2018, having completed operational tours of Northern Ireland, former Yugoslavia and Afghanistan. He says his life has been changed by TechVets: “I left the Army as I was at the end of my 24-year career… I did not have a clue what career to move into, then I was introduced to offensive cybersecurity and penetration testing. I joined TechVets and it gave me my first insight into the tools and techniques of penetration testing. After that, I was hooked! The support of everyone at TechVets, and its community, has helped me to gain confidence and push harder. I was able to gain qualifications in penetration testing which improved my job prospects in the sector. By November 2018 I started working as a cybersecurity consultant.”</p>
