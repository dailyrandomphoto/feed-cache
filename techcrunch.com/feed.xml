										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Locus (not to be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/locus-raises-50-million-for-its-logistics-management-business/">confused with this Locus</a>) is one of those names that’s been popping up a lot in the news &#8212; and this roundup &#8212; over the past year. Last time we spoke to the Massachusetts company, it was around a sizable raise &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/locus-robotics-has-raised-a-150m-series-e/">$150 million to be nearly precise</a>. That effectively valued the company as a unicorn.</p>
<p>Core to the company’s successes are its partnerships (as is the case with any robotics fulfillment company). DHL has been a big (or the biggest) name in the mix since 2017. Amid pandemic lockdowns, the logistic giant signed up for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/dhl-will-deploy-1000-robots-from-locus-robotics-for-delivery-fulfillment/">1,000 robots last year</a> and, as of yesterday, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/dhl-will-deploy-2000-locus-robotics-units-by-2022/">is doubling that number</a>.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2114223" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2114223" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2114223" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Locus-Robotics-Pickers-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2114223" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Locus Robotics</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>DHL is really committing to robotics here. At last count, it said it had deployed around 200,000 across the U.S. alone, which puts its right around the same number as Amazon (which admittedly, hasn’t updated that figure lately). Of course, the big difference there is that Amazon is primarily pulling from in-house systems &#8212; perhaps Locus is a prime acquisition target?</p>
<p>The robotics company’s CEO shot down that suggestion when I spoke to him earlier this year, stating, “We have no interest in being acquired. We think we can build the most and greatest value by operating independently. There are investors that want to invest in helping everyone that’s not named ‘Amazon’ compete.”</p>
<p>When it comes to companies with deep pockets, though, I never say never.</p>

<p>Also out this morning, is a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/realtime-robotics-raises-a-31m-series-a/"> good size round from Realtime Robotics</a>. The Boston-based company is one of a number of startups looking to streamline the process of installing and deploying industrial robotics. The $31.4 million Series A includes participation from (deep breath)  HAHN Automation, SAIC Capital Management, Soundproof Ventures , Heroic Ventures, SPARX Asset Management, Omron Ventures, Toyota AI Ventures, Scrum Ventures and Duke Angels.</p>

<p>There’s no such thing as a small raise, only a small…I’m not sure. Honestly, I didn’t really thing this one all the way through before I started typing. Anyway, here’s an early-stage, pre-seed from a London based startup <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/467073-82#overview">called E-Nano</a>. The company has developed a modular robotics system for monitoring sports turf.</p>
<p>Per a press release on the £100,000 ($141,000) raise, “These robots will eventually be able to assess agricultural land and contribute to landowners growing more sustainably. The team aims to implement 5G connectivity into their robots and platform, using this raise to deliver more immediate, real-time data with high throughput.”</p>

<p>Some good news for DJI comes <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/556370-pentagon-report-clears-use-of-drones-made-by-top-chinese-manufacturer?rl=1">courtesy of The Hill</a>, which reports that the Pentagon has effectively cleared the drone giant in an audit. DJI was one of the names caught up in all of the flagging of Chinese companies that’s occurred over the past couple of years (read: during the Trump administration), which has severely kneecapped brands like Huawei and ZTE. DJI was never banned for sale outright in the States, but this is still a pretty massive relief for its ability to operate in such a large market.</p>
<p>The filing notes that it found “no malicious code or intent” from the company, going so far as “recommend[ing] use by government entities and forces working with US services.” Government use is a nice bonus there.</p>
<p>The company took a victory lap in a comment provided to TechCrunch, noting, “This U.S. government report is the strongest confirmation to date of what we, and independent security validations, have been saying for years – DJI drones are safe and secure for government and enterprise operations.”</p>

<p>Starship Technologies, meanwhile, snagged a high-profile name to lead the delivery robotics firm. Former Alphabet Loon CEO Alastair Westgarth will be taking the same title at his new company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roku is expanding its programming for its free content hub, The Roku Channel, with today&#8217;s launch of its own weekly entertainment program called &#8220;Roku Recommends.&#8221; The 15-minute show will leverage Roku&#8217;s data to highlight the Top 5 titles for viewers to stream that week. While not exactly &#8220;original programming&#8221; the way that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/roku-launches-an-original-programming-lineup-fueled-by-quibis-content/">Roku&#8217;s recent additions of its acquired Quibi content</a> is, the series will run only on Roku, where it can be found in The Roku Channel and Featured Free, with new episodes every Thursday.</p>
<p>The series is the first production to emerge from the new Roku Brand Studio &#8212;<a href="https://advertising.roku.com/en-ca/resources/videos/roku-brand-studio"> a studio that aims to produce</a> video ads and other custom branded content for ad partners. The show is produced by Funny Or Die and Mike Farah, Beth Belew, and Jim Ziegler serve as executive producers.</p>
<p>The show&#8217;s co-hosts include entertainment reporter and AfterBuzz TV co-founder Maria Menounos and former NFL player, Andrew “Hawk” Hawkins. The duo will present the Top 5 titles to viewers. These recommended shows or movies may come from any of the thousands of channels across the Roku platform, based on data exclusive to the platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;According to Nielsen data, the average streamer spends more than seven minutes searching for what to watch next,&#8221; said Chris Bruss, Head of Roku Brand Studio, in a statement. &#8220;We are uniquely positioned to use our trending data both to help consumers find incredible movies and shows and to help advertisers go beyond the traditional 30-second ad to entertain streamers who otherwise spend time in ad-free, subscription-only environments,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The series will also allow for ad sponsors. The company says it has already signed on several national advertisers, starting with Walmart, to sponsor the program. Advertisers will have access to Roku&#8217;s Measurement Partner Program to determine whether or not their integration reaches subscription video on-demand (SVOD)-only streaming users, as well as view other metrics about their video ad campaign&#8217;s reach, brand perception and impact.</p>
<p>The series comes at a time when the streaming landscape is shifting. Today&#8217;s streaming services regularly serve up recommended content based on what their customers are watching &#8212; Netflix, for example, shows rows of popular and trending content, as well as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/24/new-netflix-feature-reveals-the-top-10-most-popular-programs-on-its-service/">Top 10 list of newly popular titles.</a> But as the number of available streaming services grows, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/discovery-warnermedia-merger-company-name-1234955035/">larger entities merge</a>, and content jumps around as licensing agreements end and start, consumers may be more in need of a set of current recommendations from across channels and services, not just those isolated inside one service.</p>
<p><a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/introducing-the-all-new-fire-tv-experience-b1ebecbd813">Amazon Fire TV&#8217;s update</a> recently addressed this need with the introduction of a new &#8220;Find&#8221; feature that aims to make it easier for users to search and browse movies, shows and free content across its platform. Roku, however, didn&#8217;t have a recommendation system of its own.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also interesting to see that Roku is willing to use its proprietary streaming data in this way &#8212; something it could choose to do more with further down the road to help build out a broader set of recommendations, if it chose.</p>

<p>Realtime is one of a number of startups building control on top of industrial robotics. Specifically, the startup looks to help companies deploy systems with limited programming and offering adaptable controls that work for multiple systems at once.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This round, which nearly doubles the company’s existing funding, will be used to accelerate it product development and extend its offering to more markets, globally. It comes as interest in robotics have ramped up amid the global pandemic.</p>
<p>“This investment by some of the world’s leading manufacturers and automation providers stands as a testament to our ability to dramatically improve the value proposition for robotic implementations,” CEO Peter Howard says in a release. “Having already realized early deployment success, a broad spectrum of customers and partners are working closely with us to refine features and user experiences, readying our technology for rollouts in their engineering, factory and warehouse operations.”</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s offerings serve a wide range of different industrial robotics tasks, including pick and place machines, packaging and palletizing boxes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early-stage startups are increasingly looking for alternative ways to access capital, meaning not every company wants to raise money from VCs or take on debt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, a flurry of startups have emerged to give companies other options. (Think <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/pipe-raises-250m-at-a-2b-valuation/">Pipe</a>, for example.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today, San Francisco-based </span><a href="https://www.architectcap.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Architect Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a new firm that is launching with over $100 million in funds to serve as an “asset-based lender” to “high-growth,” early-stage tech companies. Specifically, the new firm aims to provide non-dilutive or less-dilutive financing options to asset-rich fintech, e-commerce and SaaS companies in the U.S. and Latin America, but with an emphasis on the latter. The region, Architect maintains, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">does not have a plethora of institutional financing available against assets.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm is not out to replace traditional venture capital or venture debt, emphasizes founder and CEO James Sagan, but rather to offer asset-based products that will complement them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some context, Sagan is no stranger to the startup world, having co-founded and served as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">managing partner of Arc Labs, an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">early-stage credit fund focused on lending to technology-enabled businesses. He’s been investing in Latin America for years, and recognized the need for new forms of financing to fund “novel and underappreciated assets.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, he </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">believes the region is home to “the most prominent fintech ecosystem in the world.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Sagan,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> traditional forms of equity and debt financing in the venture world are vital for things like growing headcount, but he believes they are “not engineered to support the growth of a company’s underlying financial products.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“VC is highly dilutive and should be used for ROI activities such as hiring engineers and building great teams,” Sagan told TechCrunch. “It’s expensive to use equity to fund assets. Equity should not be put in a loan book. We’ll fund the loan book.”</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160604" style="width: 272px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160604" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2160604" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/James-Sagan-Architect-Capital.jpg?w=225" alt="" width="262" height="349" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/James-Sagan-Architect-Capital.jpg 3024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/James-Sagan-Architect-Capital.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/James-Sagan-Architect-Capital.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/James-Sagan-Architect-Capital.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/James-Sagan-Architect-Capital.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/James-Sagan-Architect-Capital.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/James-Sagan-Architect-Capital.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/James-Sagan-Architect-Capital.jpg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160604" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Architect Capital founder James Sagan / Architect Capital</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Architect’s goal is to provide “tailored and less dilutive funding,” especially to companies that produce repeatable revenues, such as SaaS and subscription businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sagan said he first discovered the strategy in 2015 when he was working for a multifamily office that was lending against a bunch of traditional assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A colleague and good friend of mine started a business and raised some equity and venture debt, but he couldn’t find the asset-specific financing for the receivables he was generating,” Sagan recalls. “He was lending to small businesses and needed asset-specific financing against those receivables.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venture debt doesn&#8217;t really work for receivables-based lending because venture debt shops typically are underwriting assets, or rather, underwriting the quality of the investors in the company, Sagan believes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So we really tailor our underwriting towards those assets themselves right and those assets range from unsecured consumer receivables to secure small business receivables to real estate,” he told TechCrunch. “Essentially, we’re providing an additional instrument for asset-heavy businesses that will allow them to scale in a way that venture debt will not.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Architect’s LPs are mostly large institutions, as opposed to traditional high net worth individuals. The firm’s average check size will land at around $10 million to $15 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">portfolio allocation is more concentrated in general,” Sagan said. “We expect to grow our AUM (assets under management) pretty precipitously.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Architect Capital has invested in six companies since inception, including PayJoy, a company that delivers consumer financing and smartphone technology to customers in emerging markets; Forum Brands, a U.S.-based e-commerce marketplace aggregator; and ADDI, a fintech that aims to give Colombian consumers access to fair and affordable credit through point-of-sale-financing that recently <a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2021/06/colombian-bnpl-addi-raises-65m-in-series-b-funding-round/">raised $65 million</a>.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/10/nextdoor-adds-new-funding-from-mary-meekers-bond-closes-growth-round-at-170m/">Nextdoor</a>, the app that helps neighbors connect, launched a new feature called Free Finds today, which will help people browse the free items available in their neighborhoods. Since the start of 2020, monthly listings to buy, sell, and give away items on Nextdoor have increased by 80%, but 25% of these listings advertised free stuff. So, the company decided to create a more streamlined way to get the word out about cool, free stuff on the curbs of your neighborhood.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to be a member of Nextdoor to scroll through the free listings. Typically, becoming a member can be a complicated process that requires you to verify your home address via snail mail. But now, whether you&#8217;re looking for a free blender or seeking your next trash-to-treasure upcycle project, you can browse what&#8217;s up for grabs in your neighborhood.</p>
<p>To contact the seller, you need to set up a free account and go through the standard Nextdoor sign-up process. If your cell service billing address is at the same address where you live, the sign-up process is quick – you can verify your address via text. But, if the addresses don&#8217;t match (read: if you&#8217;re still on your parents&#8217; family plan), it can take up to ten days to receive an invitation letter to become a verified Nextdoor member. By then, that lightly worn pair of boots might be long gone.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you live in a densely populated area, you can probably find a neighborhood &#8220;free and for sale&#8221;-themed group pretty easily on Facebook. But, at the outset, Nextdoor adds a level of functionality by filtering items into categories, like &#8220;for young ones,&#8221; &#8220;for plant parents,&#8221; &#8220;spoil your pets,&#8221; and &#8220;hidden treasures.&#8221; It could also appeal to those who don&#8217;t want to deal with browsing through multiple Facebook groups, including those that  stretch beyond their neighborhood to nearby areas that would require a commute.</p>
<p>Nextdoor emphasizes the environmental benefits of a feature like Free Finds, which can help neighbors reduce waste when they discard perfectly usable items – instead, they can share resources with their neighbors. But more broadly, Free Finds is about leveraging people&#8217;s interest in free stuff to grow Nextdoor&#8217;s user base.</p>
<p>It also comes at a time when Facebook is threatening Nextdoor more directly. The tech giant launched its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/facebook-neighborhoods-nextdoor/">Neighborhoods</a> feature in Canada last month, which is an obvious Nextdoor clone (Facebook copying other social media apps? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/facebook-invests-in-audio-with-short-form-soundbites-feature-podcast-support-and-a-clubhouse-clone/">Stop me</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/15/facebook-stories-roll-out/">if you&#8217;ve</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/09/lasso-facebook-app-store/">heard this</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/10/that-time-facebook-went-too-far/">one before</a>). The feature should roll out soon for U.S. users.</p>
<p>Over the last year, Nextdoor has launched multiple initiatives that aim to support communities, like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/nextdoor-sell-for-good/">Sell For Good</a>, which allowed users to sell items on the social network and donate proceeds to nonprofit causes. In response to the coronavirus outbreak, it also added features like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/19/nextdoor-adds-help-maps-and-groups-to-connect-neighbors-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/">Help Maps</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/19/nextdoor-adds-help-maps-and-groups-to-connect-neighbors-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak/">Groups</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/nextdoor-updates-its-app-to-allow-businesses-to-link-to-fundraisers-gift-cards-and-more/">a fundraising option</a> for local businesses, and a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/nextdoor-and-walmart-partner-on-a-new-neighborly-assistance-program/">neighborly assistance program</a> created with Walmart.</p>
<p>Still, some consumers have become understandably skeptical of neighborhood-based social media apps. The <em>Black Mirror</em>-adjacent crime-reporting app Citizen <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3dpyw/inside-crime-app-citizen-vigilante">recently came under fire</a> when its CEO Andrew Frame bribed users with $30,000 to catch an arsonist using the app&#8217;s new livestreaming service, but had targeted the wrong person. Nextdoor, meanwhile, had in the past developed such reputation for racial profiling, that the company eventually had to<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/nextdoor-rolls-out-product-fix-it-hopes-will-stem-racial-pro"> roll out special tools to address this</a>. Today, it still faces <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21283993/nextdoor-app-racism-community-moderation-guidance-protests">accusations</a> of allowing unneighborly behavior, including political discussions and other posts that can make minority groups feel <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21283993/nextdoor-app-racism-community-moderation-guidance-protests">unwelcome or even unsafe.</a></p>
<p>Ultimately, investing in new products that encourage the opposite behavior &#8212; neighbors helping neighbors, as Free Finds offers &#8212; can only go so far to combat the app&#8217;s reputation.</p>
<p>The new Free Finds feature is live today in all the countries where Nextdoor operates at either <a href="https://nextdoor.com/marketplace/finds/free?init_source=pr" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://nextdoor.com/marketplace/finds/free?init_source%3Dpr&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622651422982000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFWSNZYBXoEPTTVyeo5YgXRWHHcFQ">nextdoor.com/freefinds</a> or by visiting the Nextdoor Finds section in the Nextdoor app.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Japanese multinational conglomerate <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/fujifilm/">Fujifilm</a> has been forced to shut down parts of its global network after falling victim to a suspected <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> attack.</p>
<p>The company, which is best known for its digital imaging products but also produces high tech medical kit including devices for rapid processing of COVID-19 tests, confirmed that its Tokyo headquarters was hit by a cyberattack on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fujifilm Corporation is currently carrying out an investigation into possible unauthorized access to its server from outside of the company. As part of this investigation, the network is partially shut down and disconnected from external correspondence,&#8221; the company said <a href="https://www.fujifilm.com/uk/en/news/hq/6642">in a statement</a> posted to its website.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We want to state what we understand as of now and the measures that the company has taken. In the late evening of June 1, 2021, we became aware of the possibility of a ransomware attack. As a result, we have taken measures to suspend all affected systems in coordination with our various global entities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are currently working to determine the extent and the scale of the issue. We sincerely apologize to our customers and business partners for the inconvenience this has caused.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a result of the partial network shutdown, Fujifilm USA added a notice to its website stating that it is currently experiencing problems <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">affecting all forms of communications, including emails and incoming calls. In an earlier statement, Fujifilm confirmed that the cyberattack is also preventing the company from accepting and processing orders. </span></p>
<p>Fujifilm has yet to respond to our request for comment.</p>
<p>While Fujifilm is keeping tight-lipped on further details, such as the identity of the ransomware used in the attack, <a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://news.softpedia.com/news/fujifilm-shuts-down-network-after-suspected-ransomware-attack-533110.shtml">Bleeping Computer</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> reports that the company&#8217;s servers have been infected by Qbot. Advanced Intel CEO Vitali Kremez told the publication that the company&#8217;s systems were hit by the 13-year-old Trojan, typically initiated by </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/phishing/">phishing</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, last month.</span></p>
<p class="mgbot_20">The creators of Qbot, also known as QakBot or QuakBot, have a long history of partnering with ransomware operators. It previously worked with the ProLock and Egregor ransomware gangs, but is currently said to be linked with the notorious REvil group.</p>
<p>“Initial forensic analysis suggests that the ransomware attack on Fujifilm started with a Qbot trojan infection last month, which gave hackers a foothold in the company’s systems with which to deliver the secondary ransomware payload,” Ray Walsh, digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy, told TechCrunch.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“Most recently, the Qbot trojan has been actively exploited by the REvil hacking collective, and it seems highly plausible that the Russian-based hackers are behind this cyberattack.&#8221;</p>
<p>REvil, also known as Sodinokibi, not only encrypts a victim&#8217;s files but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/08/as-ransomware-gets-craftier-companies-must-start-thinking-creatively/">also exfiltrates data</a> from their network. The hackers typically threaten to publish the victim’s files if their ransom isn’t paid. But a<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> site on the dark web used by REvil to publicize stolen data appeared offline at the time of writing.</span></p>
<p class="mgbot_20">Ransomware attacks have been on the rise since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, so much so that they have become the biggest single money earner for cybercriminals. Threat hunting and cyber intelligence firm <a href="https://www.group-ib.com/media/ransomware-empire-2021/">Group-IB</a> estimates that the number of ransomware attacks grew by more than 150% in 2020, and that the average ransom demand increased more than twofold to $170,000.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, it&#8217;s unclear whether Fujifilm has paid any ransom to the hackers responsible for the attack on its systems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The governing party of the UK has been fined £10k by the national data protection watchdog for sending spam.</p>
<p>The Information Commissioner&#8217;s (ICO) Office has sanctioned the Conservative Party following an investigation triggered by complaints from 51 recipients of unwanted marketing emails <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">sent in the name of prime minister, Boris Johnson</span>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The emails in question were sent during eight days in </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">July 2019 after Johnson had been elected as Party leader (and also therefore became UK PM) &#8212; urging the recipients to click on a link that directed them to a website for joining the Conservative Party.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Direct marketing is regulated in the UK by PECR (the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations) &#8212; which requires senders to obtain individual consent to distribute digital marketing missives.</p>
<p>But the <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/mpns/2619896/conservative-party-mpn-20210601.pdf">ICO&#8217;s investigation</a> found that the Conservative Party lacked written policies addressing PECR and appeared to be operating under the misguided assumption that their &#8220;legitimate interests&#8221; overrode the legal requirements related to sending this type of direct marketing.</p>
<div class="page" title="Page 14">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>The Party had also switched bulk email provider &#8212; during which unsubscribe records were apparently lost. But ofc that&#8217;s not an excuse for breaking the law. (Indeed, record-keeping is a core requirement of UK data protection law, especially since the EU General Data Protection Regulation was transposed into national law back in 2018.) And the ICO found the Tories were unable to adequately explain what had gone wrong.</p>
<p>In another damningly twist, the Conservative Party had been subject to what the ICO calls &#8220;detailed engagement&#8221; at the time it was spamming people.</p>
<p>This was a result of wider action by the regulator, looking into the ecosystem and ethics around online political ads in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/11/facebook-under-fresh-political-pressure-as-uk-watchdog-calls-for-ethical-pause-of-ad-ops/">the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> &#8212; and the Party had already been warned of inadequate standards in its <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">compliance with data protection and privacy law. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But it went ahead and spammed people anyway. </span></p>
<p>So while &#8216;only&#8217; 51 complaints were received by the ICO from individual recipients of Boris Johnson&#8217;s spam, the ICO found the Tories could not fully demonstrate they had the proper consents for over a million (<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">1,190,280) direct marketing emails sent between July 24 and 31 2019. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">(The ICO takes that view that at least 549,030 of those, which were send to non-Party members, were &#8220;inherently likely&#8221; to have the same compliance issues as were identified with the emails sent to the 51 complainants.)</span></p>
<p>Moreover, the Party continued to have scant regard for the law as it spun up its spam engines ahead of the 2019 General Election &#8212; which saw Johnson gain a landslide majority of 80 seats in a winter ballot.</p>
<p>&#8220;During the course of the Commissioner’s investigation, the Party proceeded to engage in an industrial-scale direct marketing email exercise during the 2019 General Election campaign, sending nearly 23M emails,&#8221; the ICO notes. &#8220;This generated a further 95 complaints to the Commissioner, which are likely to have resulted from the Party’s failure to address the compliance issues identified in the Commissioner’s investigation into the July 2019 email campaign and the wider audit of the Party’s processing of personal data.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its report also chronicles &#8220;extensive delays&#8221; by the Conservative Party in responding to its requests for <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">information and clarification &#8212; so while it was not found to have obstructed the investigation the regulator does write that its conduct &#8220;cannot be characterised as a mitigating factor&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>While the ICO penalty is an embarrassing slap for Boris Johnson&#8217;s Tories, a data audit of all the main UK political parties it put out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/data-audit-of-uk-political-parties-finds-laundry-list-of-failings/">last year</a> spared no blushes &#8212; with all parties found wanting in how they handle and safeguard voter information.</p>
<p>However it&#8217;s only the Conservatives&#8217; fast and loose attitude toward people&#8217;s data and privacy online that could have contributed to them being able to consolidate power at the last election.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Our relationship with fashion has changed, not just because of the pandemic. Months in lockdown means people are probably more aware of their fashion purchases and how they consume, given its been such a long time without socialising. But the oft-talked about ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNDubWJU0aU">Clueless wardrobe</a>’ which would allow women to both see into their collections, as well as share and potentially borrow from friends, has yet to go mainstream. Now a UK startup aims to change this.</p>
<p>The Little Black door app, previously in closed beta, has just <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1483914220">launched on the Apple iOS store</a> here and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.littleblackdoor">on Android</a>.</p>
<p>The app allows women to share the content of their wardrobes, in an Instagram-like manner by creating collections (“Lookbooks”), as well as curating their private wardrobe for their own use, with a focus on premium and luxury fashion. Women, says LBD, can &#8220;see, style and share&#8221;, as well as borrow clothes offline, and resell them.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Lookbook feature allows women to share wardrobes collections with friends or followers in a controlled way, a feature that lets users borrow from each other.</p>
<p>Co-founder Lexi Willetts tells me: &#8220;We&#8217;d simply gotten to a point where we didn&#8217;t know what fashion we owned, given that almost every other area of life allows this. Most fashion can be easily dash-boarded on our phones &#8211; we couldn&#8217;t understand why our wardrobe wasn&#8217;t! Equally the effort required to list an item on resale was also super hard.”</p>
<p>Willetts and co-founder Marina Pengilly came up with the app when they realized they could make as much as £30,000 a year reselling their luxury clothes and accessories online. LBD is going after four key trends: the rise of resale (Depop etc); rentals like Rent the Runway; AI in e-commerce; and re-receipts.</p>
<p>Users upload their wardrobe by taking a photo of an item. The app will then recognize the item using computer vision. Lookbooks showcasing fashion collections, new and old also have an “I have this” button, allowing users to add items to their own wardrobes, or add as they buy automatically via links to retailers.</p>
<p>Another key feature allows users to see into their own wardrobes to see what they have, and, crucially, see how much they’ve spent, and own, in value.</p>
<p>Users can also create a Lookbook, not unlike on Pinterest, which can be shared with friends or a wider fashion community in a public or private group-controlled way. Lookbooks can be shared with a user’s network to allow them to see your style, or borrow the outfit in real life. As well as this, LBD itself also curates a feed of fashion/lifestyle news and surveys.</p>
<p>Willetts says partnerships with retailers and supplier deals for sales and fashion repairs are also in the offing.</p>
<p>LBD competes with the &#8216;<a href="https://www.saveyourwardrobe.com/">Save Your Wardrobe</a>’ app.</p>
<p>But is pushing the fact that it places a greater emphasis on sharing the wardrobe as well also allowing people to borrow items, with this focus on premium and luxury fashion &#8211; ADD …this is a truly social wardrobe.</p>
<p>The business model is likely to be a Premium version that unlocks extra features, affiliate revenues, advertising, and resale commissions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford is adding a new entry-level truck called Maverick to its lineup as the automaker seeks to offer pickups at every price level in this increasingly competitive market.</p>
<p>The company said Thursday it will debut the vehicle June 8, including on its new Tiktok channel. The automaker tapped actress Gabrille Union to do the official unveiling, which will largely occur on social media. Union will show-off the all-new truck on her own Instagram and TikTok channels, on Ford’s social channels as well as on Hulu.</p>
<p>Little was seen of the vehicle, just a one second glimpse of it in a teaser ad on YouTube. From the photo, it is obviously a Ford and a compact one. The rest of the details will have to wait until next week, unless they&#8217;re leaked between now and then.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In Ford pickup hierarchy, that means the Maverick will sit under the mid-sized Ranger and F series models. The Ranger XL, the most affordable of the trims, starts at about $25,070 before destination fees. That means the Maverick should start at least few thousand dollars below that figure.</p>
<p>The automaker didn&#8217;t provide any more details about if it would be a hybrid, electric or gas-powered vehicle. However, noting the direction Ford has taken recently with the hybrid F-150 and the recently revealed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/ford-unveils-the-f-150-lightning-its-all-electric-pickup-truck-that-will-start-under-40000/">all-electric F-150 Lightning</a>, it&#8217;s likely that there will at least be a hybrid version offered.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Ford F-150 is the profitable cornerstone of the U.S. automaker&#8217;s business. By adding in an electric sibling to the lineup it seemed like perhaps all the boxes had been ticked. But Ford wants to capture that entry level market of customers who want a pickup that is affordable and more suitable for city living.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter today is officially <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-twitter-blue.html">launching</a> its first-ever subscription service, Twitter Blue, initially in Australia and Canada. The subscription will allow Twitter users to access premium features, including tools to organize your bookmarks, read threads in a clutter-free format and take advantage of an &#8220;Undo Tweet&#8221; feature &#8212; which is the closest thing Twitter will have to the long-requested &#8220;Edit&#8221; button.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s plans for the subscription service had been previously scooped by app researcher <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1393541248049303555">Jane Manchun Wong,</a> who uncovered the service&#8217;s name, pricing and feature set by digging around inside the mobile app&#8217;s code. Twitter Blue also recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/twitter-blue-a-3-monthly-subscription-service-could-be-coming-soon/">showed up as an in-app purchase</a>, further confirming some of Wong&#8217;s findings.</p>
<p>The only questions that seemingly remained, then, were when Twitter Blue would finally launch and when it would reach all global users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Twitter tells TechCrunch it&#8217;s starting Twitter Blue with the select markets of Canada and Australia to help it determine whether its existing feature set will meet the needs of those who are looking for more customization over their Twitter experience, as well as to encourage discussion around other features that Twitter should prioritize for future iterations of Twitter Blue.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going to continue to iterate on different tier and pricing opportunities as we continue to learn more about what is &#8212; and isn&#8217;t &#8212; working,&#8221; a Twitter spokesperson told us.</p>
<p>In Canada and Australia, the subscription will cost $3.49 CAD or $4.49 AUD, respectively.</p>

<p>There are also a few things to know about Twitter Blue&#8217;s current feature set, beyond the basics.</p>
<p>The new Bookmark Folders option is designed to help Twitter users organize their saved content, collected through Twitter&#8217;s Bookmarks feature. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/28/twitter-launches-bookmarks-a-private-way-to-save-tweets/">Introduced in early 2018</a>, Twitter&#8217;s Bookmarks gives users a private way to save tweets for later reference. This is useful for those who want to read long-form content at a later time, or for those who want to save tweets without alerting others to that fact. For example, if the tweets being saved aren&#8217;t those they would normally &#8220;Favorite&#8221; (the heart icon), perhaps because the user disagrees with the sentiment being expressed, the bookmarks button lets them save the tweet more privately.</p>

<p>The Folders feature will let users create subfolders for their bookmarks, which are also color-coded for easy at-a-glance access. And there&#8217;s an &#8220;Add Bookmark&#8221; button on this screen, so you can add a tweet to the collection from the Bookmarks section directly.</p>
<p>The new Reader Mode feature, meanwhile, may not be exactly what some Twitter users were expecting.</p>
<p>Ahead of Twitter Blue&#8217;s launch, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/04/twitter-acquires-distraction-free-reading-service-scroll-to-beef-up-its-subscription-product/">Twitter acquired Scroll, a distraction-free reading service</a> that cleans up news articles by removing ads and other clutter for a better reading experience. Scroll CEO Tony Haile <a href="https://twitter.com/arctictony/status/1389565785555836929?s=20">then tweeted</a> that the product&#8217;s features would be integrated into Twitter&#8217;s subscription &#8220;later in the year.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160436" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160436" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2160436" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/feature-reader-mode-canada-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/feature-reader-mode-canada-1.png 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/feature-reader-mode-canada-1.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/feature-reader-mode-canada-1.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/feature-reader-mode-canada-1.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/feature-reader-mode-canada-1.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/feature-reader-mode-canada-1.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/feature-reader-mode-canada-1.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/feature-reader-mode-canada-1.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/feature-reader-mode-canada-1.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/feature-reader-mode-canada-1.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/feature-reader-mode-canada-1.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160436" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>But Twitter tells us that Reader Mode isn&#8217;t correlated to any of the company&#8217;s recent acquisitions, including Scroll, and instead was built separately for the Twitter Blue offering. For the time being at least, Reader Mode is focused on making it easier to read through longer Twitter threads &#8212; basically, an alternative to something like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/04/thread-reader-app-twitter/">the third-party app</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/threadreaderapp?lang=en">Thread Reader App.</a></p>
<p>When you go into the tweet detail view where it shows you the full Twitter thread, Twitter Blue subscribers will see a button which lets you change the screen to show you long-form text. You can exit Reader Mode to see the thread as usual.</p>
<p>As for Scroll, Twitter says the better reading experiences it brings to the platform will be incorporated into Twitter Blue later on.</p>
<p>Finally, there&#8217;s Twitter Blue&#8217;s flagship feature, Undo Tweet. While not the Edit button users really want, it will allow you to quickly &#8220;unsend&#8221; a tweet when you spot a typo or make some other kind of mistake &#8212; like forgetting to tag someone, for instance.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160433" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160433" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2160433" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/feature-undo-tweet-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/feature-undo-tweet-1.png 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/feature-undo-tweet-1.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/feature-undo-tweet-1.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/feature-undo-tweet-1.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/feature-undo-tweet-1.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/feature-undo-tweet-1.png?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/feature-undo-tweet-1.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/feature-undo-tweet-1.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/feature-undo-tweet-1.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/feature-undo-tweet-1.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/feature-undo-tweet-1.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160433" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>Smaller subscriber perks include customizable app icons for your device’s home screen, color themes for the Twitter app, and access to dedicated subscription customer support.</p>
<p>Users can set their own customizable time of up to 30 seconds to &#8220;undo&#8221; the tweet or reply from being posted to their Timeline, Twitter says. Before Twitter Blue&#8217;s launch, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/twitter-confirms-plans-to-experiment-with-new-models-like-subscriptions-in-2021/">the company had hinted</a> that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/twitter-survey-reveals-the-subscription-options-its-eyeing-including-an-undo-send-option/"> this &#8220;undo&#8221; option was the way</a> it would likely address user demand for an Edit button. Twitter had feared actually allowing users to correct their tweets at any time, as it could lead to malicious activity &#8212; like changing the text of the tweet to later have a different meaning, for example.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="nZiXMUZBvB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/twitter-confirms-plans-to-experiment-with-new-models-like-subscriptions-in-2021/">Twitter confirms plans to experiment with new models, like subscriptions, in 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Twitter confirms plans to experiment with new models, like subscriptions, in 2021&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/08/twitter-confirms-plans-to-experiment-with-new-models-like-subscriptions-in-2021/embed/#?secret=nZiXMUZBvB" data-secret="nZiXMUZBvB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Undo Tweet will address many scenarios, however, where users have quickly posted only to belatedly spot a typo. That alone may be worth a few dollars per month for Twitter power users who tweet frequently.</p>
<p>Twitter stressed today that the launch of Twitter Blue won&#8217;t mean anything about the free version of Twitter is changing. The subscription will remain focused on adding enhancements and other complementary features to Twitter&#8217;s free tier. And it may grow to include more options over time.</p>
<p>One thing Twitter wouldn&#8217;t say, maddeningly, is when Twitter Blue could arrive in the U.S. or other markets. For some context, though, Twitter launched Fleets first in spring 2020 but didn&#8217;t roll out the feature to all global users until that November. Asked if Twitter Blue would follow a similar path, Twitter declined to comment.</p>
<p>The subscription service isn&#8217;t just a way to better serve Twitter&#8217;s power users, it&#8217;s part of the company&#8217;s broader plan to reduce its reliance on advertising revenue as its only source of profit. As Twitter has struggled to grow its user base over the years, it&#8217;s more recently begun looking to generate more money from the dedicated users it does have. These plans will include offering tools to creators, including the upcoming Super Follow subscription, as well as Twitter Blue.</p>
<p>Twitter told investors earlier this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitter-plans-to-double-revenue-by-2023-reach-315m-daily-users/">it plans to at least double its total annual revenue</a>, from $3.7 billion in 2020 to $7.5 billion or more, in 2023, in part thanks to its new initiatives, including subscriptions.</p>
<p>Twitter Blue will initially be available in its supported markets on iOS only. Early adopters are asked to tweet their product feedback to @TwitterBlue.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.gong.io/">Gong</a>, the revenue intelligence startup, has been raising capital at a rapid pace, and today the company announced another $250 million on a $7.25 billion valuation, a number that triples its previous valuation from last summer.</p>
<p>Franklin Templeton led today&#8217;s festivities with participation from Coatue, Salesforce Ventures, Sequoia, Thrive Capital and Tiger Global. The company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/12/gong-raises-another-200m-on-2-2-billion-valuation/">raised $200 million last August</a> at a $2.2 billion valuation, and has now raised $584 million, $450 million coming in the last year.</p>
<p>What is making investors open their wallets and pull out such large sums of cash? The company is helping solve a hard problem on how to bring more intelligence to the revenue process. They do this by using artificial intelligence to listen to every customer interaction, whether that&#8217;s a sales or service call (or anything else), and use that information to determine valuable information like who is most likely to buy and who is most likely to churn.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>It&#8217;s been going well and CEO Amit Bendov says the company&#8217;s performance really validates the valuation. While he wasn&#8217;t ready to discuss specific numbers, he did say that ARR grew 2.3x between Q1 last year and this year, and he says Q2 is on pace to triple ARR.</p>
<p>&#8220;The valuation is up about 3x from last summer, but sales are more than 3x. We have high logo customers. [Last year], it was still unclear how COVID was going to impact us. People believed [our business] was going to do well [during the pandemic], but it wasn&#8217;t as obvious. Now, it is obvious. And all the [&#8230;] financials are way better, so from a pure financials [perspective] our multipliers are pretty reasonable for our revenue trajectory,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>With all this growth, the company is adding employees at a rapid pace. It closed the year with 400 people, and is up to around 550 today with a goal of reaching 950 by year end. It has partnered with a consulting firm called <a href="https://www.thereadyset.co/">ReadySet</a>, which helps companies build diverse and inclusive organizations, and Bendov says they are an equal pay company.</p>
<p>Women represent around 40% of the employees and around 4% are Black, a number he hopes to increase by growing the Atlanta office. In the office in Israel, he has set up employment and training programs to build bridges to the Arab community.</p>
<p>Bendov says he looks forward to meeting his U.S. employees in the coming weeks when he&#8217;ll be visiting the Atlanta office for the first time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Joor, an online marketplace that connects fashion brands and retailers around the world, has opened its first China office in downtown Shanghai as it eyes growth in the region.</p>
<p>The 11-year-old New York-based company works as a virtual showroom for brands, which traditionally would meet with their retail partners in physical venues to showcase the latest collections. With Joor, showrooms become live videos, a feature that has no doubt proven useful during COVID-19.</p>
<p>The company also gives brands a set of data tools to analyze their sales that can inform future productions. For buyers, the benefits are similar &#8212; they are able to see which brand or product is trending and make better forecasts.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The expansion into China follows a robust year for Joor in APAC and the opening of its offices in Melbourne and Tokyo. Joor&#8217;s wholesale volume ordered by retailers in the region grew 139% year-over-year in 2021, and wholesale volume for APAC-based brands was up 419%, the company said in an announcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The establishment of JOOR Shanghai will allow us to provide frictionless wholesale management to the range of fine brands and retailers across the country,&#8221; said Joor&#8217;s CEO Kristin Savilia in a statement. &#8220;It builds on our existing leadership position in North America and Europe, and we expect continued expansion across the Asia-Pacific region.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joor&#8217;s marketplace boasts more than 12,500 brands and over 325,000 retailers around the world to date. The company has raised over $35 million in funding, according to its disclosed rounds. Its investors include venture capital firms Battery Ventures and Canaan Partners as well as the 71-year-old Japanese trading house Itochu.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Low Earth orbit is full of stuff: not only bits of debris and junk, but also satellites — the number of which is growing rapidly alongside the decreasing cost of launch. This can occasionally pose a problem for satellite providers, whose valuable spacecraft run the risk of colliding with other satellites, or with the many thousands of other objects in orbit.</p>
<p>For most of the space age, debris tracking was performed by a smattering of military outfits and other governmental organizations, but that hardly paints a complete and broadly accessible picture. <a href="https://www.leolabs.space/">LeoLabs</a> has been aiming to fill what it calls this “data deficit” in orbital object tracking since the company’s founding in 2016. Now it will be scaling its operations with a $65 million Series B financing round, jointly led by Insight Partners and Velvet Sea Ventures. This latest round brings the company&#8217;s total funding to over $100 million.</p>
<p>LeoLabs uses ground-based phased array radars – one in Alaska, one in Texas, two in New Zealand and two in Costa Rica – to monitor low Earth orbit, and to track and measure any object that flies through its observational area. One main advantage of LeoLabs’ tracking system is the size of the objects it can detect: as small as 2 centimeters across, as opposed to the much larger 10 centimeter objects tracked by legacy detection systems.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2160504" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160504" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2160504" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/leolabs2.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="678" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/leolabs2.jpeg 1711w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/leolabs2.jpeg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/leolabs2.jpeg?resize=300,199 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/leolabs2.jpeg?resize=768,509 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/leolabs2.jpeg?resize=680,450 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/leolabs2.jpeg?resize=1536,1017 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/leolabs2.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160504" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> <a href="http://leolabs.space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LeoLabs <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>The difference in scale is huge: there are around 17,000 objects in orbit 10 centimeters or larger, but that number jumps to 250,000 when monitoring from 2 centimeters. That’s a lot of opportunity for collision, and though 2 centimeters sounds small (that&#8217;s less than an inch), they can do catastrophic damage traveling at orbital velocity. Customers can access this information using a subscription service, which will automatically alert them about collision risks.</p>
<p>“There just isn&#8217;t much information about what&#8217;s going on,” Dan Ceperley told TechCrunch. “So we&#8217;re rolling out this global radar network to generate a lot of data, and then all that software infrastructure to make it useful.”</p>
<p>LeoLabs sees around three to five close approaches involving larger objects, Ceperley said per year. Those are noteworthy because a collision could potentially produce thousands of smaller fragments – even more space junk. When tracking smaller objects, the company sees up to 20 times more collision risks. Fortunately, many satellites have electric thrusters that can be activated to avoid collisions or maintain orbit. With sufficient advance, companies can maneuver a few days prior to the anticipated collision.</p>
<p>With this new injection of funds, Ceperley said the company is looking to expand the number of radar sites around the world and scale its software-as-a-service business. While LeoLabs already has complete orbital coverage, more radars will increase the frequency with which objects are tracked, he explained. LeoLabs will also be scaling its software and data science teams (already the largest in the company), setting up locations outside the U.S., and adding new products and services.</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s a once in a lifetime revolution going on in the space industry, all this new investment has driven down the costs of launching satellites, building satellites and operating satellites, so there’s a lot of satellites going into low Earth orbit,” Ceperley said. “There’s a need for a new generation of services to actually track all these things [. . .] And so we&#8217;re building out that next generation tracking service, mapping service, for that new era.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As more people return to the office over the next few months, companies will have to work harder than ever to make sure the environment is comfortable and inviting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One company that is out to ease the pain of millions of employees leaving the comfy confines of their homes and losing the convenience of conducting meetings in nice tops and sweatpants has just raised new funding to help it advance on its goals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York-based </span><a href="https://www.newstand.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Stand</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced it has raised $40 million in a Series B funding round led by </span><a href="https://bpy.brookfield.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brookfield Property Group</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one of the largest commercial real estate owners in the United States. Existing backers Maywic, Fantail Ventures and Raga Partners also participated in the financing, which brings the company’s total raised to just over $56 million since its 2015 inception.  </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Stand is a clever take on the “newsstand” concept. The startup has built a modern-looking smart vending physical product that can be set up in all sorts of different spots –– from office lobbies to floors of companies within an office building to hotels to college campuses to airports. The company’s first location was at the Union Square subway station in New York City. Over time, New Stand has combined that physical presence with an app that is designed to give people convenience in getting basics (think snacks, books and personal care items such as umbrellas or pain relievers, for example) as well as access to “location-based media.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of that, it wants to partner with companies to offer its platform as a way to communicate internal news in a more fun and engaging manner. The company is making a big push in the office vertical with the launch of its </span><a href="http://www.work.newstand.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Stand at Work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a workplace amenity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it’s not entirely surprising that Brookfield, one of the biggest commercial landlords in the country, would want to back a company that aims to make tenants and their employees happier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TechCrunch talked with co-founder and CEO Andrew Deitchman about the new raise and plans for the capital. He earnestly describes New Stand as a “day improvement company” that aims to make people’s days easier and more interesting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And we do it by making sure we have basic stuff that people need, but also curating things that we think they would like,” he said. “We have little shops or touch points that are like convenience stores, and we combine that with an app that introduces people to content, and also allows them to interact in other ways to accumulate points and rewards.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So what New Stand really is building is a media and technology company, using convenience points as a means of accessing people&#8217;s lives and making their days a little bit better,” Deitchman added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Stand is working to evolve from being primarily a consumer business to an enterprise one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can take care of basic needs but also engage people in a deeper relationship,” Deitchman said. “If you&#8217;re an employer who wants to relate to an employee or if you are a landlord who wants to relate better to your tenants, we can help make that happen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is planning to use its new capital primarily toward expanding into new spaces, office and otherwise. Currently, it’s in about 20 locations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s also planning to create “new engaging services and formats” and “grow and densify its distribution.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In line with its investment, Brookfield Properties said it plans to “further activate” its properties in New York and, ultimately beyond, with New Stand’s offering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ben Brown, managing partner and head of the U.S. office in Brookfield&#8217;s Real Estate group, notes that prior to this investment, Brookfield had already partnered with New Stand at its flagship property, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brookfield Place New York &#8212; both as an amenity for its tenants and as an offering in its own office space for employees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On both fronts, New Stand has provided an elevated experience with tangible benefits,” he told TechCrunch. “As one of the largest &#8212; if not </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> largest &#8212; commercial real estate owners in the country and world, we have a particular interest in investing in enterprises we ourselves use, see the value in, and can help scale over time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown said the combination of New Stand’s physical assets and media platform has given Brookfield the opportunity to boost engagement with its tenants’ employees as well as its own, something “all landlords are trying to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Helping the world’s leading companies attract, retain and motivate their workforces has long been job one for us, and that has only intensified today as firms increasingly look for ways to have the office compete with the home,” he added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">TikTok announced a ban on political advertising all the way back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/tiktok-explains-its-ban-on-political-advertising/">2019</a>. So you&#8217;d be forgiven for thinking the ugly problem of democracy-denting political disinformation doesn&#8217;t apply inside its walled garden of dancing Gen Zers. But you&#8217;d be wrong.</p>
<p>New research by Mozilla suggests that policy loopholes and lax oversight, especially around influencer marketing, coupled with an ongoing lack of ads transparency by TikTok &#8212; which offers no publicly searchable ad archive &#8212; are making its video-sharing platform vulnerable to passing off political ads as organic content.</p>
<p>Mozilla says it found over a dozen instances of TikTok influencers across the political spectrum who were being paid (or otherwise compensated) by a variety of political organizations to promote partisan messages without disclosing that these posts were sponsored.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Our research found that TikTok influencers across the political spectrum had undisclosed paid relationships with various political organizations in the U.S.,&#8221; it writes. &#8220;Several right-wing TikTok influencers appear to be funded by conservative<br />
organizations like Turning Point USA, a tax-exempt nonprofit which has a dedicated influencer program specifically targeted at funding young conservative content creators on social media.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2160754" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2160754" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2160754" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/influencer-example.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="398" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/influencer-example.png 1248w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/influencer-example.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/influencer-example.png?resize=300,175 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/influencer-example.png?resize=768,449 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/influencer-example.png?resize=680,398 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/influencer-example.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2160754" class="wp-caption-text">Examples of TikTok influencers spreading political messaging (Image credits: Mozilla)</p></div></p>
<p>It similarly found evidence of left-leaning sponsored political messaging being spread without proper disclosures by TikTok influencers, noting that: &#8220;We found some evidence that progressive influencers supported by left-leaning political organizations were posting pro-Biden messages prior to the U.S. presidential election. For instance, The 99 Problems created and funded the Hype House account House of US, where influencers post political messaging.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the report, <em>Th€se Are Not Po£itical Ad$:</em> <em>How Partisan Influencers Are Evading TikTok’s Weak Political Ad Policies</em>, Mozilla calls out the platform for not offering adequate tools for &#8216;influencers&#8217; &#8212; aka users who have amassed a large enough number of followers to become attractive targets for advertisers to target for making paid postings &#8212; to report sponsorships, pointing out that other major social media platforms (like Facebook/Instagram) do offer such tools and can flag influencer content if they&#8217;re found failing to properly report ads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, it’s hard to know exactly how self-disclosure ad policies are being enforced across platforms but TikTok is significantly far behind Instagram and YouTube when it comes to providing tools and enacting clear, strict, and transparent policies,&#8221; Mozilla writes in the report.</p>
<p>Per TikTok&#8217;s rules, content creators are supposed to self-identify any paid content (typically by using the hashtag #ad or #sponsored), in keeping with U.S. Federal Trade Commission guidelines for the disclosure of paid influence.</p>
<p>But, as Mozilla points out, if TikTok isn&#8217;t actively monitoring or scrutinizing influencer ads (as the report suggests) it raises an obvious concern over how the platform can claim to be enforcing its &#8220;trust and safety&#8221; protocols.</p>
<p>Mozilla&#8217;s report also points to rumours that TikTok is testing features that will allow influencers to pay to further promote specific posts &#8212; which could dial up the &#8216;dark money&#8217; political disinformation problem further, i.e. if not combined with active policing and enforcement of sponsorship disclosures.</p>
<p>&#8220;There do not appear to be any safeguards preventing creators from using this feature to promote paid political messages,&#8221; it warns. &#8220;It is unclear how TikTok is monitoring this content to ensure that it complies with their political ad policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another major criticism in the report is the general lack of ads transparency by TikTok vs other social platforms &#8212; with Mozilla&#8217;s report pointing out that it does not offer public, searchable ad databases as others (including Facebook/Instagram, Snap, and Google/YouTube) do. Twitter has also had a searchable ads archive since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/twitter-ads-transparency-center/">2018</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mozilla believes Facebook and Google are doing a poor job on ad transparency, so the fact that <span class="il">TikTok</span> can’t match even them is troubling,&#8221; the report notes.</p>
<p>In recommendations to TikTok (or to policymakers shaping laws aimed at preventing abuse of such platforms) Mozilla suggests that it needs to develop specific mechanisms for content creators to disclose partnerships; invest in comprehensive advertising transparency, including launching an ad database which includes paid partnerships (not just native platform ads); and update its policies and enforcement processes to cover all the ways that paid political influence can happen on its platform.</p>
<p>TikTok was contacted with questions on its approach to ads transparency and sponsored content. It sent this statement:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<div>&#8220;Political advertising is <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=9552" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid%3D9552&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622749936115000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH7j4cYg0zTZuCduvrwSLdLDKWxmA">not allowed on TikTok</a>, and we continue to invest in people and technology to consistently enforce this policy and build tools for creators on our platform. As we evolve our approach we appreciate feedback from experts, including researchers at the Mozilla Foundation, and we look forward to a continuing dialogue as we work to develop equitable policies and tools that promote transparency, accountability, and creativity.&#8221;</div>
</blockquote>

<p>There are signs that TikTok is trying to get ahead of criticisms in the report &#8212; as Mozilla&#8217;s researcher, Becca Ricks, notes that the company has very recently (&#8220;within the past week&#8221;) created a <a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/business-and-creator/creator-and-business-accounts/branded-content-on-tiktok">branded content policy</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;It includes mention of a &#8216;<a href="https://support.tiktok.com/en/business-and-creator/creator-and-business-accounts/branded-content-on-tiktok" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.tiktok.com/en/business-and-creator/creator-and-business-accounts/branded-content-on-tiktok&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1622749321515000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGsgLPwC0knZWuGhcYg31tjPHBPHA">branded content toggle</a>&#8216; to help influencers disclose paid partnerships,&#8221; she went on, adding: &#8220;We’re currently analyzing the feature to learn more. But we’re cautiously optimistic that this could be a (small) step in the right direction, especially after we raised these issues directly with TikTok two weeks ago in the course of our research.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><i>&#8220;</i>That said, Mozilla’s other recommendations &#8212; and the entirety of the problems we uncovered in the research &#8212; remain. So TikTok has a long road to being truly transparent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mozilla&#8217;s report is just the latest black cloud to fall over TikTok&#8217;s platform which is under pressure on a variety of fronts related to its content and wider policies, including around ad disclosures.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/eu-to-review-tiktoks-tos-after-child-safety-complaints/">Last week</a>, EU regulators kicked off what they couched as a formal &#8220;dialogue&#8221; with TikTok following a number of complaints by consumer protection groups which have accused the platform of hidden marketing, aggressive advertising techniques targeted at children and misleading and confusing contractual terms.</p>
<p>Other regional complaints have called out TikTok&#8217;s approach to privacy and user data. And it&#8217;s being <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56815480">sued in the UK</a> over its handling of children&#8217;s data.</p>
<p>Concerns over weak age verification also led to an intervention by Italy&#8217;s data protection regulator earlier this year &#8212; acting on concerns for the safety of underage users. In that case TikTok was forced to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/tiktok-removes-500k-accounts-in-italy-after-dpa-order-to-block-underage-users/">remove over half a million accounts</a> which were suspected of being used by children younger than 13.</p>
<p>In recent months TikTok has been trying to burnish its image with policymakers, announcing what it bills as a &#8216;Transparency Center&#8217; in the U.S. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/11/tiktok-to-open-a-transparency-center-where-outside-experts-can-examine-its-moderation-practices/">last year</a> &#8212; and another for Europe this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/tiktok-to-open-a-transparency-center-in-europe-to-take-content-and-security-questions/">April</a> &#8212; saying these centers would provide a space for outside experts to access information about its content moderation and security policies.</p>
<p>However Mozilla said the centers suffer from a lack transparency vis-a-vis ads, writing in the report that they &#8220;do not provide detailed transparency regarding advertisements&#8221;, and specifying TikTok does not disclose specific data about &#8220;how many or which ads were rejected under TikTok’s ban on political advertisements&#8221;, for example.</p>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s opacity arounds ads looks to be on borrowed time as the issue of online political ads transparency is coming into sharper focus around the world.</p>
<p>In the U.S. a bipartisan bill to try to regulate online platforms that sell ads was introduced in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/19/honest-ads-acts-facebook-google-twitter-ads-regulated/">2017</a> &#8212; although progress stalled as the bill failed to pass ahead of the 2019 US presidential election.</p>
<p>In Europe lawmakers are expected to put forward a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/europe-to-put-forward-rules-for-political-ads-transparency-and-beef-up-its-disinformation-code-next-year/">regulatory proposal</a> this fall that will tighten ad disclosure and reporting requirements on platforms, as part of a wider package of digital reforms that aim to drive safety, transparency and accountability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.NUE.Life">NUE Life Health</a>, a telemedine startup in the USA, is developing what it describes as a “next-generation mental wellness solution” employing treatments such as psychedelic-assisted therapies, combined with a graph database-driven app.</p>
<p>The Miami-based startup has raised a $3.3m Seed round from investors including Jack Abraham (Atomic Ventures, Hims), Shervin Pishevar (Shervin Pishevar (formerly of Sherpa Ventures, UBER), Martin Varsavsky (Prelude Fertility, Overture), and Jon Oringer (Shutterstock, Pareto Holdings), James Bailey (a capstone supporter of the Multidisciplinary Assoc. for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS)) and Christina Getty. All the above are part of the recent diaspora from Silicon Valley to Miami.</p>
<p>NUE Life Health is currently operating in California, Texas, and Florida, with plans for expansion across the United States. The platform will offer at-home ketamine therapy, considered the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/behind-the-buzz-how-ketamine-changes-the-depressed-patients-brain/">fastest-acting</a> anti-depressant in the market, combined with music therapies and a data-led approach.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>NUE Life says research from Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and Imperial College in London on MDMA and psilocybin assisted psychotherapy appears to indicate that these are “safe alternatives” in treating mental illness.</p>
<p>Juan Pablo Cappello, NUE Life’s CEO said: “We view ketamine therapy and psychedelic therapy simply as catalysts for change.  While helping patients reset is important, we at NUE Life are committed to helping our members find community and connection through our digital platform well after the effects of any psychedelic therapies have faded.”</p>
<p>NUE Life’s digital platform will leverage “Knowledge Graphs and AI to deliver personalized evidence-based therapies that approach patient care in a holistic manner,” said Demian Bellumio, co-founder and CTO of NUE Life Health. Its enterprise HIPPA-compliant health platform plans to launch in the late summer of 2021.</p>
<p>Christina Getty a co-founder and investor in NUE Life Health said: “With one of five women in the United States relying on an antidepressant to get through the day, and with our losing 22 veterans a day to suicide, we felt compelled to launch a different kind of mental wellness company.”</p>
<p>NUE Life comes as players in psychedelic medicine such as MindMed and ATAI are going public.</p>
<p>Bellumio added: “The mental wellness platform leverages Knowledge Graphs and AI to deliver personalized evidence-based therapies that approach patient care in a holistic manner.  Our platform also rigorously measures outcomes and improves over time,”</p>
<p>He said the platform creates a detailed “knowledge graph” of the patient. This allows it to understand everything about them in order to diagnose and treat their mental health condition, using an approach called integrated psychiatry. AI algorithms are then deployed to personalize recommendations, from what treatments use, what supplements to take, and what music to listen to during therapy. A proprietary music streaming service will be part of the offering.</p>
<p>Bellumio formerly worked on graph databases while at Accenture (where he ran the Knowledge Graph Center of Excellence for 2 years) and at NEORIS. The approach is also employed by United Healthcare, user its “<a href="https://neo4j.com/blog/connected-healthcare-data-challenges-graphconnect/">Connected Healthcare</a>” platform.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">European Union lawmakers have asked tech giants to continue reporting on efforts to combat the spread of vaccine disinformation on their platforms for a further six months.</p>
<p>&#8220;The continuation of the monitoring programme is necessary as the vaccination campaigns throughout the EU is proceeding with a steady and increasing pace, and the upcoming months will be decisive to reach a high level of vaccination in Member States. It is key that in this important period vaccine hesitancy is not fuelled by harmful disinformation,&#8221; the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/reports-april-actions-and-continuation-monitoring-programme-fighting-covid-19-disinformation">Commission</a> writes today.</p>
<p>Facebook, Google, Microsoft, TikTok and Twitter are signed up to make monthly reports as a result of being participants in the bloc&#8217;s (non-legally binding) Code of Practice on Disinformation &#8212; although, going forward, they&#8217;ll be switching to bi-monthly reporting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Publishing the latest batch of platform <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/reports-april-actions-and-continuation-monitoring-programme-fighting-covid-19-disinformation">reports for April</a>, the Commission said the tech giants have shown they&#8217;re unable to police &#8220;dangerous lies&#8221; by themselves &#8212; while continuing to express dissatisfaction at the quality and granularity of the data that is being (voluntarily) provided by platforms vis-a-via how they&#8217;re combating online disinformation generally.</p>
<p>“These reports show how important it is to be able to effectively monitor the measures put in place by the platforms to reduce disinformation,&#8221; said Věra Jourová, the EU&#8217;s VP for values and transparency, in a statement. &#8220;We decided to extend this programme, because the amount of dangerous lies continues to flood our information space and because it will inform the creation of the new generation Code against disinformation. We need a robust monitoring programme, and clearer indicators to measure impact of actions taken by platforms. They simply cannot police themselves alone.”</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/europe-to-press-the-adtech-industry-to-help-fight-online-disinformation/">Last month</a> the Commission announced a plan to beef up the voluntary Code, saying also that it wants more players &#8212; especially from the adtech ecosystem &#8212; to sign up to help de-monitize harmful nonsense.</p>
<p>The Code of Practice initiative pre-dates the pandemic, kicking off in<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/26/tech-and-ad-giants-sign-up-to-europes-first-weak-bite-at-fake-news/"> 2018</a> when concerns about the impact of &#8216;fake news&#8217; on democratic processes and public debate were riding high in the wake of major political disinformation scandals. But the COVID-19 public health crisis accelerated concern over the issue of dangerous nonsense being amplified online, bringing it into sharper focus for lawmakers.</p>
<p>In the EU, lawmakers are still not planning to put regional regulation of online disinformation on a legal footing, preferring to continue with a voluntary &#8212; and what the Commission refers to as &#8216;co-regulatory&#8217; &#8212; approach which encourages action and engagement from platforms vis-a-vis potentially harmful (but not illegal) content, such as offering tools for users to report problems and appeal takedowns, but without the threat of direct legal sanctions if they fail to live up to their promises.</p>
<p>It will have a new lever to ratchet up pressure on platforms too, though, in the form of the Digital Services Act (DSA). The regulation &#8212; which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/europe-lays-out-its-plan-to-reboot-digital-rules-and-tame-tech-giants/">proposed at the end of last year </a> &#8212; will set rules for how platforms must handle illegal content. But commissioners have suggested that those platforms which engage positively with the EU&#8217;s disinformation Code are likely to be looked upon more favorably by the regulators that will be overseeing DSA compliance.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In another statement today, Thierry Breton, the commissioner for the EU&#8217;s Internal Market, suggested the combination of the DSA and the beefed up Code will open up &#8220;a new chapter in countering disinformation in the EU&#8221;.</span></p>
<p>“At this crucial phase of the vaccination campaign, I expect platforms to step up their efforts and deliver the strengthened Code of Practice as soon possible, in line with our Guidance,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Disinformation remains a tricky topic for regulators, given that the value of online content can be highly subjective and any centralized order to remove information &#8212; no matter how stupid or ridiculous the content in question might be &#8212; risks a charge of censorship.</p>
<p>Removal of COVID-19-related disinformation is certainly less controversial, given clear risks to public health (such as from anti-vaccination messaging or the sale of defective PPE). But even here the Commission seems most keen to promote pro-speech measures being taken by platforms &#8212; such as to promote vaccine positive messaging and surface authoritative sources of information &#8212; noting in its <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/mex_21_2843">press release</a> how Facebook, for example, launched vaccine profile picture frames to encourage people to get vaccinated, and that Twitter introduced prompts appearing on users&#8217; home timeline during World Immunisation Week in 16 countries, and held conversations on vaccines that received 5 million impressions.</p>
<p>In the April reports by the two companies there is more detail on actual removals carried out too.</p>
<p>Facebook, for example, says it removed 47,000 pieces of content in the EU for violating COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation policies, which the Commission notes is a slight decrease from the previous month.</p>
<p>While Twitter reported challenging 2,779 accounts, suspending 260 and removing 5,091 pieces of content globally on the COVID-19 disinformation topic in the month of April.</p>
<p>Google, meanwhile, reported taking action against 10,549 URLs on AdSense, which the Commission notes as a &#8220;significant increase&#8221; vs March (+1378).</p>
<p>But is that increase good news or bad? Increased removals of dodgy COVID-19 ads might signify better enforcement by Google &#8212; or major growth of the COVID-19 disinformation problem on its ad network.</p>
<p>The ongoing problem for the regulators who are trying to tread a fuzzy line on online disinformation is how to quantify any of these tech giants&#8217; actions &#8212; and truly understand their efficacy or impact &#8212; without having standardized reporting requirements and full access to platform data.</p>
<p>For that, regulation would be needed, not selective self-reporting.</p>

<p>Technology to address disasters and resilience is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/02/data-was-the-new-oil-until-the-oil-caught-fire/">a key area of venture capital investment these days</a>, and now another startup in the space is proving that there is widespread interest in this growing market.</p>

<p><a href="https://oneconcern.com/en/">One Concern</a>, which builds a platform to model and simulate community resilience and response to earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters, announced this morning that it has raised $45 million from SOMPO Holdings, the venture wing of Japan’s SOMPO, one of the country’s largest insurers. The investment is part of a total $100 million, multi-year deal that will plug One Concern’s platform into the Japanese market.</p>
<p>Japan has been something of a gem in One Concern’s market development the past few years. The startup hired Hitoshi Akimoto as <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/one-concern-hires-cfo-cpo-and-japan-country-manager-300974286.html">country manager for Japan in late 2019</a> before <a href="https://oneconcern.com/en/about/updates/one-concern-formally-expands-into-japan/">formally announcing</a> that it was expanding to Japan in February 2020. In August last year, it <a href="https://oneconcern.com/en/about/updates/one-concern-forms-strategic-partnership-with-sompo-for-resilience-solutions-in-japan/">announced a strategic partnership with SOMPO</a>, and the insurer’s venture wing invested $15 million. Today’s deal expands that partnership further.</p>
<p>According to its press release, One Concern will sell its platform to six or more Japanese cities as part of the tie-up.</p>
<p>Previously, One Concern had raised three rounds of capital <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/oneconcern">according to Crunchbase</a> and SEC filings: a seed round in October 2015, a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001744497/000114036118032276/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">$33 million Series A round</a> led by NEA in 2017, and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744497/000156761919022632/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">a $37 million round also co-led by NEA</a>. The company was founded in 2015.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">United Airlines is the first official U.S. customer for Boom Supersonic, a company focused on making supersonic commercial flight a reality once again. Boom unveiled its supersonic sub-scale testing aircraft last year, and intends to start producing its Overture full-scale commercial supersonic passenger jet beginning in 2025, with a planned 2029 date for the beginning of commercial service after a few years of flight testing, design refinement and qualification.</p>
<p>United agreed to purchase 15 of the Overture aircraft, provided they meet United&#8217;s &#8220;safety, operating and sustainability requirements,&#8221; and the agreement also includes an option for the airline to purchase an additional 35 after that. United is obviously interested in the benefits of supersonic flight, which aims to reduce travel times by half, but it&#8217;s also looking to boost its sustainability profile with this deal with Boom.</p>
<p>Boom&#8217;s goal is to be the first commercial aircraft that runs on net-zero carbon footprint fuel right from day one. The company is focused on sourcing and using 100% sustainable aviation fuel, and part of the arrangement between the two companies includes United working in collaboration with the startup to develop and improve production sources for that sustainable fuel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>U.S. airlines committed jointly to a goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and as part of that they agreed to partner with government and other stakeholders to accelerate the development and commercialization of sustainable aviation fuel, so this team-up with Boom could be a key driver of those aims for United long-term.</p>
