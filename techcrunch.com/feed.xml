										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Honda&#8217;s new goal is to achieve 100% EV sales in North America by 2040 as part of its broader target of being carbon neutral by 2050. CEO Toshihiro Mibe announced planned shift away from internal combustion engines at a news conference on Friday, his first since taking over executive leadership of the company in early April.</p>
<p>This is the latest in a stream of pledges from legacy car manufacturers to introduce high percentages of zero-emissions vehicles into their fleets and achieve carbon neutrality. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/28/general-motors-electric/">General Motors plans to eliminate gas and diesel light-duty cars and SUVs by 2035</a> and be carbon neutral by 2040, and Mazda, Mitsubishi and Nissan have all said they plan to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Honda&#8217;s goals are also in alignment with Japan&#8217;s electrification strategy, which aims for a 46% cut in emissions by 2030.</p>

<p>Honda will start on this road immediately, expecting EVs to account for 40% of sales by 2030, and 80% by 2035 in all major markets. By the second half of 2020, Japan&#8217;s second-largest automaker will launch a series of new electric models in North America based on the company&#8217;s in-house e:Architecture platform, which &#8220;increases the commonality of the body and three primary EV components (battery, motor and invertor) while also featuring high space efficiency and battery mounting efficiency,&#8221; according to a Honda spokesperson.</p>
<p>Honda, and its subsidiary Acura, will also introduce two large-sized EV models using GM&#8217;s Ultium batteries by 2024. The company will further its collaboration with GM by using fuel cell technology for a range of vehicles and applications, like commercial trucks and power sources.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">This past year has brought many new developments to a historically traditional process: taking a company public. Many of the standard levers in an initial public offering (IPO) are being redefined as we write.</p>
<p>The emergence of direct listings is just one example. Even in more traditional IPOs, we have seen unique lock-up provisions, different auction approaches, virtual and rapid roadshows become the norm, and company-centric approaches to investor allocations.</p>
<p>But clearly the most disruptive trend of the past 12 months has been the predominance of the Special Purpose Acquisition Company, commonly known as SPAC. A SPAC is a company with no commercial operations that is formed strictly to raise capital through an IPO for the purpose of acquiring an existing, private company.</p>
<p>Also known as &#8220;blank check companies,” these entities typically have 24 months to find a company to buy or merge with.</p>
<p>That process essentially makes the acquired company a publicly traded one. SPACs can, and generally do, raise additional capital in the form of a PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) in order to reaffirm the SPAC valuation and raise additional capital with the identified target company.</p>
<p>SPACs have been around for decades, but they took the 2020 IPO market by storm. For some context: 2020 had more than 248 SPACs — more than the sum of the SPACs in the previous decade. And while SPACs and the general sentiment around them continue to evolve, 2021 started off strong with 298 newly formed blank-check companies to date that have raised a collective $95 billion (vs. $83 billion in 2020). It’s worth noting that there has since been some slow down in new SPAC formation and an uptick in regulatory caution. We expect such shifts to continue in these early days.</p>
<p>For a SPAC, finding a company to merge with in 24 months might sound like a good amount of time, but in reality, the diligence and SEC process can easily consume six months or more. So identifying the target company relatively quickly becomes critical. As a result of this new trend, many private companies are being approached and courted by a number of newly formed SPACs.</p>

<p>At Madrona, we invest in companies early in their journey (often Day One), and walk with them through the years of opportunities, challenges and financing goals. As such, for many of our companies, the conversation around raising capital via a SPAC transaction has come up, and more than once.</p>
<p>How to evaluate the pros and cons of SPACs relative to other financing options can be convoluted and confusing, to say the least.</p>
<h2>Are you ready to be a public company?</h2>
<p>The fundamental thing to remember about the SPAC process is that the result is a publicly traded company open to the regulatory environment of the SEC and the scrutiny of public shareholders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://hawkeventures.com/team/">Hawke Ventures</a>, the investment arm of marketing consultancy <a href="https://hawkemedia.com/">Hawke Media</a>, is announcing that it has closed its first $5.6 million venture fund.</p>
<p>Managing Partner Drew Leahy acknowledged that the firm&#8217;s focus on marketing technology isn&#8217;t exactly in high demand among other VCs right now.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are running away from martech [&#8230;] but that&#8217;s our circle of confidence,&#8221; Leahy told me. &#8220;If you look at the biggest companies in the world, even Walmart now, they are all martech companies at the end of the day.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While some might quibble with that description, it&#8217;s hard to deny the central role that marketing and advertising play for the internet&#8217;s biggest platforms. As for how that translates to Hawke&#8217;s strategy, Leahy said the firm is writing checks of between $100,000 and $250,000, with the possibility of follow-on investments.</p>
<p>Leahy, who was previously co-founder and CMO at SnapSuits.com, said that the fund has its roots in the strategic angel investing that he was doing for Hawke Media, ultimately working with the company&#8217;s CEO Erik Huberman and COO Tony Delmercado to raise a fund to make bigger bets.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="RB7G4QGsF6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/postscript-raises-35m-to-give-shopify-stores-sms-superpowers/">Postscript raises $35M to give Shopify stores SMS superpowers</a></p></blockquote>

<p>He added that beyond writing checks, the firm can offer access to a network of 51 limited partners who invested in the fund. Those LPs include Deathwish Coffee founder Michael Brown, MVMT Watches founder Jack Kassan, former VaynerMedia executive Jeff Nicholson, husband-and-wife Holly (an actress and actress) and Rodney Pete (a former NFL player), Jill Zarin of &#8220;The Real Housewives of New York City,&#8221; Video Genome Product founder Xavier Kochhar and MarketShare founder Jon Vein.</p>
<p>And while most firms would say that they&#8217;re trying to fund the next Facebook or Google, Leahy said he has a slightly different focus: &#8220;We’re trying to build a different venture firm, that’s not about what we think next the big idea is, but is focused on building actual technology that we can use ourselves.</p>
<p>That also means the firm is mostly focused on products that can be used by small and medium businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re not an enterprise martech fund, we’re a small- and medium-sized business martech fund,&#8221; Leahy said. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking for pieces of technology that hundreds of thousands of users can be a part of.&#8221;</p>
<p>Early investments include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/postscript-raises-35m-to-give-shopify-stores-sms-superpowers/">SMS marketing company Postscript</a> and analytics company Yaguara (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/24/chord-series-a/">acquired by Chord</a>).</p>
<p>&#8220;As one of the earliest investors in Postscript, Hawke Ventures has worked with us since the beginning,&#8221; said Postscript President Alex Beller in a statement. &#8220;The entire Hawke org has been value-add since day one, and we&#8217;re proud to continue our partnership with Hawke as we build the definitive platform for Conversational Commerce.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Origin stories are satisfying because we already know the hero will overcome the odds — and in doing so, they&#8217;ll reveal their core strengths.</p>
<p>This week, we published <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/klaviyo-ec1/">a four-part series</a> about how Klaviyo co-founders Andrew Bialecki and Ed Hallen bootstrapped their startup into an e-commerce marketing automation platform now valued at $4.15 billion.</p>
<p>Neither founder was bitten by a radioactive spider or received a serum that enhanced their entrepreneurial skills; instead, they focused on outreach to prospective customers to find out what they were willing to pay for and largely ignored the competition.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Bootstrapping Klaviyo, it came out of this: &#8216;Hey, if we are super disciplined about finding a problem that someone will pay us to solve, we have a real company,'&#8221; said Hallen.</p>

<p>Several micromobility companies once operated in my city, but consolidation has reduced that to a small handful.</p>
<p>Now that many consumers are buying their own e-bikes and e-scooters, shared dockless micromobility &#8220;just hasn’t proven itself to be a profitable line of business,&#8221; Puneeth Meruva, an associate at Trucks Venture Capital, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only one dockless electric moped provider in my town, so price is no longer a consideration. Instead, my first priority is to find a vehicle with the best-charged battery. (San Francisco has a lot of hills, and you never know where the day might take you.)</p>
<p>Larger players like Lime and Bird have vertically integrated tech stacks for fleet management features like this, but there are also opportunities for startups — imagine a &#8220;phantom scooter&#8221; that drives itself to a neighborhood with high demand or a moped that alerts drivers if there&#8217;s traffic ahead.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/micromobilitys-next-big-business-is-software-not-vehicles/">This in-depth industry analysis</a> shows how increased regulation on the local level and changing consumer habits are pushing micromobility providers to adapt and innovate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether you want to stack regulatory compliance on the vehicles, do safety features like ADAS or add mapping content, you kind of need this platform where you can actively develop and launch new apps on the vehicle without having to bring it back to the factory,&#8221; Meruva said.</p>

<p>If the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome, then one might say the cybersecurity industry is insane.</p>
<p>Criminals continue to innovate with highly sophisticated attack methods, but many security organizations still use the same technological approaches they did 10 years ago. The world has changed, but cybersecurity hasn’t kept pace.</p>

<p>By 2025, 463 exabytes of data will be created each day, according to some estimates. It’s now easier than ever to translate physical and digital actions into data, and businesses of all types have raced to amass as much data as possible in order to gain a competitive edge.</p>
<p>However, in our collective infatuation with data (and obtaining more of it), what’s often overlooked is the role that storytelling plays in extracting real value from data.</p>
<p>The reality is that data by itself is insufficient to really influence human behavior. Whether the goal is to improve a business’ bottom line or convince people to stay home amid a pandemic, it’s the narrative that compels action, not the numbers alone.</p>
<p>As more data is collected and analyzed, communication and storytelling will become even more integral in the data science discipline because of their role in separating the signal from the noise.</p>

<p>We all need to be taking precautionary measures, not just in light of COVID, but to ensure our firms can continue to thrive when faced with unexpected tragedy.</p>
<p>So ask yourself this question: “What would happen if I or my partner(s) checked into the hospital tomorrow and had no phone and/or was too sick to call anyone, and that went on for two or three weeks (or longer)?”</p>
<p>If the answer is “I’m really not sure,” then you don’t have a business continuity plan.</p>

<p>After years of sustained growth, the pandemic supercharged the outdoor recreation industry. Startups that provide services like camper vans, private campsites and trail-finding apps became relevant to millions of new users when COVID-19 shut down indoor recreation, building on an existing boom in outdoor recreation.</p>
<p>Startups like Outdoorsy, AllTrails, Cabana, Hipcamp, Kibbo and Lowergear Outdoors have seen significant growth, but to keep it going, consumers who discovered a fondness for the great outdoors during the pandemic must turn it into a lifelong interest.</p>

<p>Typically the IT team bears that burden — on top of countless other demands. IT teams move mountains for their organizations while scaling the tech platform as fast as possible, putting out the latest infrastructure fire and responding to countless day-to-day requests.</p>
<p>The most helpful gift any chief information officer or chief technology officer can give their IT teams is more time. Many people think that means adding another team member. But it could be as simple as introducing a low-code integration platform.</p>

<p>A stunning first quarter in venture capital funding was not restricted to the United States; Europe also had one hell of a start to the year.</p>
<p>The venture capital world kicked off its 2021 European investing cycle with enough activity to set the continent on the path that would crush yearly records.</p>
<p>Inside the data, there’s lots to unpack, including which sectors of European startups stood out in terms of capital raised, rising seed and late-stage deals, and dollar volume. We’ll also need to discuss exits — the Deliveroo IPO and its various woes was not the only transaction from the period worth understanding.</p>
<p>We’ll keep in mind that all venture capital data lags reality somewhat, as many deals from a particular period are not disclosed or discovered until long after they actually occurred.</p>
<p>In this case, it makes the numbers all the more impressive.</p>

<p>Robotic process automation unicorn UiPath went public this week, concentrating our focus on its value.</p>
<p>UiPath raised its last private round when the markets were most interested in public offerings and is now going public in a slightly altered climate.</p>
<p>In numerical terms, UiPath raised its IPO range from $43 to $50 per share to $52 to $54 per share. That’s a 21% jump in the value of the lower end of its range and an 8% gain to the value of the upper end of its per-share IPO price interval.</p>
<p>UiPath is also selling more shares than before, which should make its total valuation slightly larger at the top end than a mere 8% gain. So let’s go through the math one more time.</p>

<p>The investment landscape for insurtech startups is off to a hot start in Q2 2021. Since the end of the first quarter, we’ve seen several players in the broad startup category announce new capital.</p>
<p>But, as anyone who’s familiar with startups that offer insurance-related products and services knows, the sector is enough of a mixed bag that one needs to segment down to get clarity on how constituent companies are performing.</p>
<p>Let’s discuss insurtech’s 2020 as a whole, peek at some preliminary 2021 venture data and then dive deep into what we’ve collected regarding growth among insurtech marketplace players.</p>
<p>Covering longitudinal progress of specific startup categories is one of our favorite things to do. So, please, walk with us!</p>

<p>With strict privacy laws such as GDPR and CCPA already listing big-ticket penalties — and a growing number of countries following suit — businesses have little option but to comply.</p>
<p>It’s not just bigger, established businesses offering privacy and compliance tech; brand-new startups are filling in the gaps in this emerging and growing space.</p>
<p>Privacy isn’t dead, as many would have you believe. New regulations, stricter cross-border data transfer rules and increasing calls for data sovereignty have helped the privacy startup space grow thanks to an uptick in investor support.</p>

<p>UiPath is <em>not</em> worth $36 billion, as we might have expected, but at a figure below $30 billion.</p>
<p>At $29.1 billion, UiPath has a roughly 35x run-rate multiple. That just about ties it for eighth-best overall. Among all public cloud companies. That means that UiPath is insanely valuable, just not <em>that</em> insanely valuable.</p>
<p>So what went wrong with the company’s final private round? The Exchange&#8217;s hunch is that UiPath’s final private investors expected the market to stay as hot as it once was, but it has cooled since the first two months of the year. So, instead of UiPath coming to the market in the expected climate, the company instead had to price where it did because the weather predicted by its final private price had already chilled.</p>
<p>Those investors gambled, in other words, hoping that a last-minute, pre-IPO round could snag them a rapid return on a company going public in a hot market. That didn’t work out.</p>
<p>And how bad is that? Not very! UiPath’s IPO is more a meeting of private-market exuberance and modestly more conservative public markets. It’s nothing to cry about.</p>

<p>The second half of 2021 will bring incredible growth, the likes of which we haven’t seen in a long time.</p>
<p>Here’s how marketing in tech will shift — and what you need to know to reach more customers and accelerate growth this year.</p>
<p>First and foremost, differentiation is going to be imperative. It’s already hard enough to stand out and get noticed, and it’s about to get much more difficult as new companies emerge and investments and budgets balloon in the latter half of the year.</p>
<p>Additionally, tech companies need to be mindful not to ignore the most important part of the ecosystem: people. Technology will only take you so far, and it’s not going to be enough to survive the competition.</p>
<p>Tactically, the most successful tech companies will embrace video and experimentation in their marketing — two components that will catapult them ahead of the competition.</p>
<p>Ignoring these predictions, backed by empirical evidence, will be detrimental and devastating. Fasten your seatbelts: 2021 is going to be a turbocharged year of growth opportunities for marketing in tech.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m a female entrepreneur who created my first startup a few months ago.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Once my startup gets off the ground — and as COVID-19 gets under control — I’d like to visit the United States to test the market and meet with investors. Which visas would allow me to do that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—Noteworthy in Nairobi</strong></p>

<h2>As UiPath closes above its final private valuation, CFO Ashim Gupta discusses his company’s path to market</h2>

<p>Despite a somewhat circuitous route, UiPath closed its first day as a public company worth more than it was in its Series F round — when it sold 12,043,202 shares at $62.27576 apiece, per SEC filings. More simply, UiPath closed on Wednesday worth more per-share than it was in February.</p>
<p>How you might value the company, whether you prefer a simple or fully diluted share count, is somewhat immaterial at this juncture. UiPath had a good day.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with UiPath CFO Ashim Gupta, curious about the company’s choice of a traditional IPO, its general avoidance of adjusted metrics in its SEC filings and the IPO market’s current temperature.</p>

<p>The global venture capital market had a cracking start to the year. Coming off a 2020 high, VC totals in the United States, in Europe, and among competitive verticals like insurtech and AI are on pace to set new records in 2021.</p>
<p>The rapid-fire deal-making and trend of larger venture checks at higher valuations that The Exchange has tracked for some time require private-market investors to make decisions faster than ever. For venture capitalists, the timeline for reaching conviction around a startup’s thesis and executing due diligence has become compressed.</p>
<p>Some venture capitalists are turning to data to move more quickly. Some are spending more time preparing to be vetted themselves. And some investors are simply doing the work beforehand.</p>
<p>We were tipped off to the concept of pre-diligence during the reporting process for a look into recent fundraising trends in the AI/ML space. Sapphire investor Jai Das, when asked about how he was handling a competitive and swiftly moving market for AI startup investments, said that “most firms are completing their due diligence way before the financing actually happens.”</p>
<p>How does that work in practice?</p>

<p>Your clients might not demand 24/7 customer service yet, but they’re certainly hoping for it.</p>
<p>But how can a startup with a lean staff provide round-the-clock customer care? There are several options available, but more than ever, outsourcing is one of them.</p>
<p>When should your startup consider outsourcing its customer care? And what should you look for in a provider?</p>
<p>Here are some insights on what customer care as a service (CCaaS) can do for you, and how fast-growing startups have been leveraging this new class of partners to boost customer satisfaction.</p>

<p>The clock begins ticking on a startup the day the doors open. Regardless of a young company’s struggles or success, sooner or later the question of when, how or whether to sell the enterprise presents itself. It’s possibly the biggest question an entrepreneur will face.</p>
<p>For founders who self-funded (bootstrapped) their startup, a boardroom full of additional factors comes into play. Some are the same as for investor-funded firms, but many are unique.</p>
<p>After 18 years of bootstrapping a BI software firm into a business that now serves 28,000 companies and 3 million users in 75 countries, here’s what I’ve learned about myself, my company, about entrepreneurship and about when to grab for that brass ring.</p>
<p>Put happiness at the center of the decision, and let your intuition — the instincts that made you the person you are today — be your guide.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Last year was a record 12 months for venture-backed biotech and pharma companies, with deal activity rising to $28.5 billion <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q1-2021-pitchbook-analyst-note-biotech-went-to-work-as-the-world-stayed-home">from $17.8 billion in 2019</a>. As vaccines roll out, drug development pipelines return to normal, and next-generation therapies continue to hold investor interest, 2021 is on pace to be another blockbuster year.</p>
<p>The median step up in valuations from seed to Series A is now 2x, higher than in all later rounds. As a result, biotech startups will continue to attract more investment at earlier stages from a larger, more diverse pool of venture capitalists.</p>
<p>This may also change the nature of biotech founders themselves: As a blog post from Y Combinator <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library/4L-how-biotech-startup-funding-will-change-in-the-next-10-years">suggests</a>, these founders are trending younger and perhaps less willing to cede control to VCs and hired executives than they might have in years past (i.e., via the “<a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/03/28/venture-creation-model-biotech/">venture creation</a>” model so predominant among early-stage biotech companies).</p>

			Founders are some of the most creative people out there, but legal documentation should be anything but.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>As longtime members of the biotech startup community — as executives, entrepreneurs, advisors and legal counsel — we’ve seen our fair share of founder missteps early in the fundraising journey result in severe consequences.</p>
<p>In this exciting moment, when younger founders will likely receive more attention, capital and control than ever, it’s crucial to avoid certain pitfalls.</p>
<h2>Clarity trumps creativity</h2>
<p>Founders are some of the most creative people out there, but legal documentation should be anything but. Keep it as simple and clear as possible. That means using National Venture Capital Corporation documents that everyone knows and understands, as well as keeping organized documentation for employee intellectual property (IP) assignment and NDAs, option grants, independent contractor agreements, tax documents and other key contracts and paperwork.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since I read this</span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/how-to-go-viral-on-tiktok-like-megan-thee-stallion-play-the-app-s-game"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg story</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about how songs are engineered to go viral on TikTok, I’ve had one thought in my head, if you can call it that &#8212; it’s more of a noise, or impression:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, it’s the sound of internally screaming. Just when I thought I understood how deeply social media algorithms have hijacked our desires, tastes and preferences &#8212; WHAM! Another jab straight to the nose. I have to admit, I was blindsided by this one. It knocked me out.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, I understand that I work for a website called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tech</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crunch, emphasis on the tech, but if this story doesn’t make you feel at least a teensy bit like a Luddite, well, I don’t know what to tell you. You’re probably like that character in the Matrix, Cypher, who </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">wants</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be plugged in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is that harsh? I mean, companies are going to company, and partnerships with major record labels is a common sense move for a social media app all about honing the art of short, clever combinations of sound and video. And fair dues to the creators, many of them in college or high school, for jumping at the chance to make some money and get a little bit of fame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it’s probably not too harsh when you consider what else is possible when catchiness is weaponized. Here’s </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221297912_Detecting_and_Tracking_Political_Abuse_in_Social_Media"><span style="font-weight: 400;">what</span></a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2756406.2756941"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we know</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: whether it’s internet memes or political slogans or Megan Thee Stallion’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Savage</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, what drives information dissemination is not the truthfulness of the content or the credibility of the speaker but 1) how easy it is to remember and 2) how quickly it sparks conversations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And would you look at that! Those are exactly the variables music producers optimize for today. What the Bloomberg story highlights, inadvertently or not, is how a No. 1 pop hit and a piece of political disinformation are not all that different, aesthetically. Everyone’s an entertainer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now read to the end of the Bloomberg story. Get to the part where it’s revealed that ByteDance (the Chinese company that owns TikTok), in response to threats of a U.S. ban on the app, recruited creators to orchestrate a seemingly grassroots lawsuit against the proposed ban. And I think: damn. Attention really is the most precious commodity in the world. And we’re just…giving it away.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cryptocurrency prices continued to tumble Friday with Bitcoin leading the charge, with prices for the internet currency dipping below $50,000 for the first time since early March.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is down roughly 20% week-over-week, around 30% from its all-time high of nearly $65,000 early last week. The market cap of the coin has dipped below $1 trillion. The tumble has been less severe for Ethereum, which hit an all-time high just yesterday but has since dropped 13% as the broader market has crawled back.</p>
<p>Plenty of altcoins have also taken a beating. Dogecoin erased the breakneck gains of the week and then some, nearly halving its price after a meteoric climb last weekend. XRP is down 35% week-over-week, Stellar is down 30% and Polkadot is down 25% since last week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Overall, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">Coinmarketcap</a> estimates the global crypto market has shrunk around 10% in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Crypto prices have been on a tear for the past several months, but the past week has been the clearest sign of a correction to climbing prices, though many see news of President Biden&#8217;s adjustment to the hikes on the capital gains tax as the most apparent reason for the market&#8217;s slide as investors cash out hoping their gains won&#8217;t be reached by a retroactive application of the rules.</p>
<p>Coinbase, which went public last week via direct listing, shaved about 10% off its share price this week, but was largely unaffected Friday in intraday trading.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A biotech company that has spent 11 years researching supplements to increase human longevity plans to launch its supplements later this year. Longevica says it has attracted a total of $13 million from investors, including <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexanderchikunov/?originalSubdomain=uk">Alexander Chikunov</a>, a longevity investor, who is also president of the company.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.longevica.com">Longevica</a> says it created a biotechnology platform for longevity after researching the life-span of laboratory mice. It now aims to produce medicines, dietary supplements and food products.</p>
<p>The longevity space is a growing sector for tech startups. Google backed the launch of <a href="https://www.calicolabs.com">Calico</a> in the space. Late last year Humanity Inc. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/20/humanity-inc-raises-funding-to-allow-us-to-monitor-and-affect-our-rate-of-aging/">raised</a> $2.5 million in a round led by Boston fund One Way Ventures for its longevity company that will leverage AI to maximize people’s health span.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Longevica’s CEO Aynar Abdrakhmanov, backing up his company’s aim to tap the desire for people to live longer, said: “According to the WHO, by 2050, 2 billion people will be 60+ years old. By 2026, the sales of services and products for this audience will be around $27 trillion&#8230; By comparison, it was only $17 trillion in 2019.”</p>
<p>According to CB Insights, life-extension startups raised a record total of $800 million in 2018 alone. And there are some high-profile investors in the space.</p>
<p>PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel invested in <a href="https://unitybiotechnology.com">Unity Biotechnology</a>, which is developing drugs to treat diseases that accompany aging. And Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin invested $2.4 million worth of Ether into the nonprofit <a href="https://www.sens.org">SENS Research foundation</a>, where famed longevity research Aubrey de Grey is chief science officer, to develop rejuvenation biotechnologies.</p>
<p>Longevica is basing its platform on the work of scientist Alexey Ryazanov, who holds 10 U.S. patents in the space, and is a longtime researcher into the regulation of protein biosynthesis cells.</p>
<p>Chikunov said: “I gathered scientists known in this field to discuss their approaches to the problem. Then Alexey Ryazanov proposed the innovative idea of large-scale screening of all known pharmacological substances on long-lived mice in order to find those that prolong life.”</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Ryazanov, Longevica says it used 20,000 long-lived female mice and 1,033 drugs representing compounds from 62 pharmacological classes to find five substances that statistically significantly increased longevity by 16-22%: Inulin, Pentetic Acid, Clofibrate, Proscillaridin A, D-Valine.</p>
<p>From this work, they formed a view about the elimination of certain heavy metals from the body and improved the body’s ability to remove toxins.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Raising capital for a new fund is always hard. But should you give preferential economics or other benefits to a seed anchor investor who makes a material commitment to the fund?</p>
<p>These “VCs for investment management companies” are also known as <a href="https://pitchbook.com/blog/what-is-gp-stakes-investing">GP stake investors</a> or fund platforms. According to <a href="https://docsend.com/view/7qrk4rpbkajg4uyc?utm_campaign=Email%20%7C%202019-11-22%20DocSend%20Newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=107534303&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9iuVvGitQQ7lHTXwcxpkYwXc-JrKQ8mt-CmSwyTNolQadtSK4d0p40fHTBtpt3NQxJzlych_LFBE46WEbb9QzQtM60Og&amp;utm_content=107534303&amp;utm_source=hs_email">DocSend</a>, “About half the VC firms in our survey had an anchor LP for their fund, and the average percentage that an anchor LP took in a first-time fund was 25%. The prevalence of anchor LPs among both early-stage and more established firms in our data suggests that securing an anchor investor can be crucial for signaling a firm’s credibility to other potential LPs.”</p>
<p>However, data about whether those anchors received preferential terms are very hard to obtain.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">

			It ultimately may come down to timing.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>“In the hedge fund world, fund platforms are common and therefore more transparent,” Ha Duong, the investment principal at Ocean Investment, a single-family office based in Berlin, told me. “In venture, I haven&#8217;t seen many fund platforms.”</p>
<p>A number of firms provide infrastructure for emerging VCs, including <a href="http://capria.vc">Capria</a>,<a href="https://www.oper8r.io/"> Draper Venture Network</a>, <a href="https://www.oper8r.io/">Oper8r</a> and<a href="https://www.recastcapital.com/"> Recast Capital</a> and may provide capital or assistance in raising capital.</p>
<p>However, this ecosystem is much more built out in the private equity and hedge fund spaces. Examples include <a href="https://archeancapital.com/">Archean Capital Partners</a>, <a href="https://www.gatewoodcapital.com/">Gatewood Capital Partners</a>, <a href="https://www.lafayettesquare.com/">Lafayette Square</a>, <a href="https://www.nesvold.com/">Nesvold Capital Partners</a> and <a href="https://reservoircap.com/">Reservoir Capital Group</a>. Certain family offices also make these investments on an ad-hoc basis. As do some VCs: <a href="http://www.lunex.com/">LuneX.com</a> notes it is a dedicated blockchain and cryptocurrency fund that partners with a Southeast Asia-based VC, Golden Gate Ventures.</p>
<p>A GP stake investor brings some significant advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Meaningful upfront initial capital</strong>, usually greatly shortening the lengthy fundraising process. This can be particularly helpful for founders who do not come from a wealthy background and may not be able to forgo an income for an 18-month fundraising period.</li>
<li><strong>Credibility</strong>. This is proportionate to the stake investor’s credibility. Everyone else will assume the GP stake investor did extensive due diligence.</li>
<li><strong>Assistance in business development, marketing, risk management and governance.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ability to access </strong>LPs who require meaningful assets under management (AUM) before they’ll consider you.</li>
<li><strong>Back office</strong>, in some cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>There can also be meaningful disadvantages to working with a GP stake investor:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India’s central bank has restricted American Express and Diners Club from adding new customers starting next month, it said Friday, citing violation of local data-storage rules.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=51471">statement</a>, the Reserve Bank of India said existing customers of either of the two card companies will not be impacted by the new order, which goes into effect May 1.</p>
<p>This is the first time India’s central bank has penalized any firm for noncompliance with local data-storage rules, which was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/india-data-localisation-exclusive-idINKBN1K20K6">unveiled in 2018</a>. The rules require payments firms to store all Indian transaction data within servers in the country.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Visa, Mastercard and several other firms, as well as the U.S. government, have previously requested New Delhi to reconsider its rules, which is designed to allow the regulator “unfettered supervisory access.”</p>
<p>Visa, Mastercard and American Express had also lobbied to either significantly change the rules or completely discard it. But after none of those efforts worked, most firms began to comply.</p>
<p>In a statement Friday evening (local time), an Amex spokesperson said the company was “disappointed that the RBI has this course of action,” but said was working with the authority to resolve the concerns “as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>With about 1.5 million customers, American Express has amassed the highest number of customers among foreign banks in India.</p>
<p>“We have been in regular dialogue with the Reserve Bank of India about data localization requirements and have demonstrated our progress towards complying with the regulation. [&#8230;] This does not impact the services that we offer to our existing customers in India, and our customers can continue to use and accept our cards as normal.”</p>
<p>Diners Club, which is owned by Discover Financial Services and offers credit cards in India through a partnership with the nation&#8217;s largest private sector bank (HDFC), said in a statement that India remains an important market for the firm and it is working with the central bank to reach a resolution so that it can &#8220;continue to grow in the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last year, India&#8217;s central bank ordered HDFC Bank to not add new credit customers or launch digital businesses after the bank&#8217;s services were hit by a power outage.</p>
<p>Friday’s order comes as Citigroup, another key foreign bank in India, has announced plans to exit most of its Asian consumer business as it looks to boost its profitability. The consumer operations of the bank in 13 countries is up for sale.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Don’t let procrastination slow your roll. Yeah, we’re looking at you, early-stage founders. At TechCrunch, we love to reward action with savings. Want to save a cool $100? <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/#tickets">Buy your Early Stage 2021: Marketing &amp; Fundraising pass</a> <strong>before </strong><strong>April 30, at 11:59 p.m. (PT)</strong>, and you’ll keep a cool $100 in your pocket.</p>
<p>Take action, reap savings and get ready to join your community of early-inning startup founders for a two-day bootcamp (July 8-9) dedicated to helping you build a firm foundation for entrepreneurial success. We’re talking a day packed with highly interactive presentations, breakout sessions and plenty of time for Q&amp;As with top-tier industry leaders and experts — plus a thrilling day-long pitch competition.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-1/">Part one of TC Early Stage 2021</a>, which took place in April, featured folks like entrepreneur and VC Melissa Bradley, who delivered advice on nailing a virtual pitch meeting; Alexa von Tobel lead a discussion on finance for founders; and Fuel Capital’s Leah Solivan revealed 10 things not to do when you start a company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Here’s just one example of the quality topics and guidance you can expect at TC Early Stage 2021 in July.</p>
<p>Plenty of founders struggle to find, or even define, product-market fit. And let’s face it, without the proper product-market fit, you basically have two chances of raising a unicorn: slim and fat. That’s why you won’t want to miss out on what Superhuman founder, CEO and product-market fit master <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/superhuman-ceo-rahul-vohra-is-coming-to-techcrunch-early-stage-in-july/">Rahul Vohra</a> has to say on the subject. Bring your questions and take advantage of his invaluable advice.</p>

<p>Wondering whether attending TC Early Stage 2021: Marketing &amp; Fundraising is worth your time and money? Here’s what two founders shared about their experience at last year’s event.</p>
<blockquote><p>Early Stage 2020 provided a rich, bootcamp experience with premier founders, VCs and startup community experts. If you’re beginning to build a startup, it’s an efficient way to advance your knowledge across key startup topics. — Katia Paramonova, founder and CEO of Centrly.</p>
<p>Sequoia Capital’s session, Start with Your Customer, looked at the benefits of storytelling and creating customer personas. I took the idea to my team and we identified seven different user types for our product, and we’ve implemented storytelling to help onboard new customers. That one session alone has transformed my business. — Chloe Leaaetoa, founder, Socicraft.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The best venture capitalists take moonshot risks based on due diligence, support portfolio companies through ups and downs and find focus through noise.</p>
<p>When you look at the job description of the best founder, you’ll find nearly the exact same list of characteristics (except, of course, instead of a portfolio, the founder is supporting a team of employees). The shared ethos is almost uncanny &#8212; and includes a slew of strategic synergies both sides of the table can exploit.</p>
<p>That’s why we’re excited to announce that Lisa Wu, a partner at Norwest, is joining us at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?display=true">TechCrunch Early Stage in July</a> to talk tactics, and how founders can think like a VC in all facets of their business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Wu focuses on seed to late-stage companies with a specific interest in consumer internet, digital commerce and next-generation marketplaces. Her portfolio includes Calm, Ritual, Plaid and the recently public Opendoor.</p>
<p>With the inside scoop on these iconic companies, Wu will use her experience to illustrate how the best founders can leverage the language of venture capital in the pitch and beyond. The goal is to give the audience a list of actionable insights to implement immediately &#8212; and lean heavily on anecdotes found in Wu’s impressive work in the industry.</p>
<p>Tickets for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-early-stage-2021-part-2/?display=true">TC Early Stage: Marketing &amp; Fundraising</a> are available at the early-bird rate, which gives you an instant $100 savings if you book before next week!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While there&#8217;s been plenty of attention and money lavished on virtual event platforms over the past year, <a href="https://www.introvoke.com">Introvoke</a> co-founder and CEO Oana Manolache predicted that we&#8217;re only at the beginning of a &#8220;third wave of digital transformation.&#8221;</p>
<p>In her framing, the first wave came at the beginning of the pandemic, when everyone was using video conferencing tools like Zoom for their virtual events. Next came conference platforms like Hopin (which has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/hopin-confirms-400m-raise-at-5-65b-valuation/">raising money at a mind-boggling clip</a>). But Manolache argued that even Hopin represents a &#8220;Band-Aid&#8221; that customers are hoping will tide them over until in-person events can resume — particularly when organizers have to point attendees to a third-party platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;One size does not fit all,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The Band-Aid solution that was only supposed to last for a couple months has had big benefits as companies grew their customer base and revenue targets. Now we&#8217;ve reached the third wave, as organizations want to bring solutions to their own universe and own their relationship with the audience.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>San Francisco-based Introvoke is a Techstars Accelerator graduate aiming to provide this third-wave solution. It&#8217;s announcing today that it has raised $2.7 million in funding led by Struck Capital, while Comcast, Social Leverage, Great Oaks, V1vc, Time CTO Bharat Krish and Resy co-founder Mike Montero also participated.</p>
<p>The startup offers components like virtual stages, chat rooms and networking hubs, all customizable and embeddable on a customer&#8217;s website. Manolache said Introvoke (the name comes from the idea of &#8220;thought-provoking introductions&#8221;) is designed for a hybrid future, which will take multiple forms: &#8220;Hybrid is going to mean virtual-only events, in-person only events and events that have in-person and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> virtual elements.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Introvoke charges customers based on live event minutes, a model that it says is accessible to companies large and small. Its components can be embedded on websites built with WordPress, Squarespace, Wix, Splash and other platforms, but also on a customer&#8217;s internal intranet.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been so impressed by the way customers are using the technology — conferences, career fairs, employee engagements,&#8221; Manolache said.</p>

<p>She added that as customers like Comcast, Wharton and Ritual Motion have used the platform in private preview mode, they&#8217;re beginning to break free of the in-person model. For example, Introvoke events can allow for attendees to chat with each other over weeks or months, not just a few days.</p>
<p>In a statement, Struck Capital founder and Managing Partner Adam B. Struck suggested that virtual events &#8220;will continue far beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, virtual experiences, from conferences and concerts to company all-hands, are generally hosted on third party platforms, which creates a disjointed experience for the brand or organization hosting the event,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;Virtual enablement should be native to the website and platform of the enterprise itself, and it’s the role of technologists like the <span class="il">Introvoke</span> team to make these experiences as seamless as any in-person event.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After spending much of his career in mission-critical environments, including the Israeli Air Force, Israeli Intelligence and leading development of a cybersecurity product at Microsoft, Amit Rosenzweig turned his attention to autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>It was a technology <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">that he soon recognized would need what every other mission-critical system requires: humans. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;I understood that there are so many edge cases that will not be solved purely by AI and machine learning, and there must be some kind of human-in-the-loop intervention,&#8221; Rosenzweig said in a recent interview. &#8220;You don&#8217;t have any mission-critical system on the planet — not nuclear power plants, not airplanes — without human supervision. A human must be in the loop or present in some way for autonomous mobility to exist, even in 10 or probably 20 years from now.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That &#8220;human in the loop&#8221; conclusion led Rosenzweig to found teleoperations startup <a href="https://ottopia.tech/">Ottopia</a> in 2018. (His brother, Oren Rosenzweig is also in the autonomous vehicle business via the lidar company he co-founded, Innoviz.) Ottopia&#8217;s first product is a universal teleoperation platform that allows a human operator to monitor and control any type of vehicle from thousands of miles away. Ottopia&#8217;s software is combined with off-the-shelf hardware components like monitors and cameras to create a teleoperations center. The company&#8217;s software also includes assistive features, which provide &#8220;path&#8221; instructions to the AV without having to remotely control the vehicle.</p>
<p>Since launching, the small 25-person company has racked up investors and partners such as BMW, fixed-route AV startup <a href="https://maymobility.com/">May Mobility</a> and <a href="https://bestmile.com/">Bestmile</a>. Ottopia said Friday that it has raised $9 million from Hyundai Motor Group as well as Maven and IN Venture, the Israel-focused venture capital arm of Sumitomo Corporation. Existing investors MizMaa and Israeli firm NextGear also participated.</p>
<p>Hyundai and IN Venture also gained board seats. Woongjun Jang, who heads up Hyundai&#8217;s autonomous driving center, and IN Venture managing partner Eyal Rosner, are now on Ottopia&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>Ottopia has raised a total of $12 million to date, and Rosenzweig has already set his sights on a larger round to help fund the company&#8217;s growth.</p>
<p>For now, Rosenzweig is focused on doubling his workforce to 50 people by the end of the year and opening an office in the United States. Rosenzweig said the company is also expanding into other applications of its teleoperations software, including defense, mining and logistics. However, most of Ottopia&#8217;s resources will continue to be dedicated to automotive, and specifically the deployment of autonomous cars, trucks and shuttles.</p>
<p>&#8220;The motivation is really simple — it&#8217;s simple but it&#8217;s hard to do — and that&#8217;s to make affordable autonomous transportation closer to reality,&#8221; Rosenzweig said. &#8220;The problem of course is that when an AV does not have any kind of backup or any kind of safety net in the form of teleoperations and it gets stuck, passengers are going to get anxious, &#8216;what&#8217;s going on, why, why is this not moving&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other problem, Rosenzweig noted, is that AVs need to be combined with an efficient transit service. That&#8217;s where he sees his newest partner, on-demand shuttle and transit software company Via, coming in.</p>
<p>Under the partnership, which was also announced this week, Via will offer autonomous vehicle fleets that combine its fleet management software with Ottopia&#8217;s teleoperations platform. Via is not developing its own self-driving software system. In November 2020, Via <a href="https://maymobility.com/may-mobility-and-via-announce-partnership-that-will-integrate-on-demand-avs-into-public-transit/">announced it had partnered</a> with May Mobility to launch an autonomous vehicle platform that integrates on-demand shared rides, public transportation and transit options for passengers with accessibility needs.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This is why I only buy index funds. No one knows what anything (interesting) is worth.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">To close out the week, a short meditation on value, or, more precisely, how assets are valued in today&#8217;s markets.</p>
<p>Do you recall the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/coinbases-monster-q1-in-context/">pre-direct-listing hype</a> Coinbase enjoyed? After reporting its estimated first-quarter financial performance, interest in the domestic cryptocurrency trading giant ran red-hot.</p>
<p>When Coinbase set a $250 per-share direct listing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/coinbase-sets-direct-listing-reference-price-at-250-share-valuing-the-company-at-as-much-as-65b/">reference price</a>, it was broadly viewed as modest, if not downright low. Of course, a reference price is just that &#8212; a reference &#8212; so it wasn&#8217;t too big a deal. But it also wasn&#8217;t surprising that Coinbase shares traded as high as $429.54 on their first day, according to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/COIN/history?p=COIN">Yahoo Finance data</a>.</p>
<p>Coinbase equity hasn&#8217;t topped $400 in any following day and is now under the $300 mark, with more declines set to arrive as trading commences. Its reference price looms, and suddenly a price that felt intensely conservative before Coinbase began to trade is starting to look nearly reasonable.</p>

The Exchange has watched with something akin to polite confusion as the value of Root, a neoinsurance company, fell to a third of its public-market highs <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/3-lessons-from-roots-ipo-pricing/">after going public</a>, even though it <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3666921-root-eps-misses-0_07-beats-on-revenue">beat growth expectations</a> in its most recent quarterly report.</p>
<p>We could toss UiPath into our trend of wildly meandering value. The company&#8217;s initial IPO price range targeted a price <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/uipaths-first-ipo-pricing-could-be-a-warning-to-late-stage-investors/">as low as $43 per share</a>. Today it&#8217;s worth $76.75 per share in pre-market trading.</p>
<p>No one knows what anything is worth, again. This is the feeling I get while watching the markets work to determine how to value assets as diverse as startups crossing the private-public divide to the value of Bitcoin, which was supposed to keep going up. Until it suddenly reversed gear.</p>
<p>Frankly, we&#8217;re still dealing with new-enough models &#8212; or big-enough guesses about the future baked into business models &#8212; that it&#8217;s hard to really value the most uncertain (and therefore most exciting) companies, let alone cryptocurrencies. Let&#8217;s discuss.</p>

<p>A labor market built on degree requirements has little hope of correcting course.</p>

	</p>
<p>Looking past the college experience, the unemployment rate for Black Americans stands at <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t02.htm">nearly 10%</a>, compared with 5.5% for white Americans, while the typical Black American family has<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/disparities-in-wealth-by-race-and-ethnicity-in-the-2019-survey-of-consumer-finances-20200928.htm"> eight times less wealth</a> than a white family. This is coupled with the fact that Black people make up just <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.issgovernance.com_library_2019-2Dus-2Dboard-2Ddiversity-2Dtrends_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=aJN_B9lxV3XtoOYQqya_Bpi9ZKtvuy549O8avEZxzXs&amp;m=Rc7R0N-0O8dJS1R0h99qNS10uYJA1v_dXeFVdgp71fE&amp;s=PfcAR6_TIWImSrTh9QiOLvKp787HGKVfd0FMfp8tHg4&amp;e=">4.1% of Russell 3000 board members</a> &#8212; compared to 13.4% of the population.</p>
<p>This isn’t just a matter of grave injustice. The racial wealth gap costs the U.S. economy<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/the-economic-impact-of-closing-the-racial-wealth-gap"> $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion </a>in GDP output each year. There is a financial and moral imperative to do something about it.</p>
<p>Then there’s the skills gaps: For all the belated changes made to academic programs and curricula, and while colleges and universities do as good a job as they’ve ever done at preparing students with the cognitive and critical thinking skills they’ll need to be successful in the long run, the college system just isn’t providing the right training for jobs in 2021. Ten years ago, <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.pwc.com_gx_en_ceo-2Dsurvey_2019_Theme-2Dassets_reports_talent-2Dtrends-2Dreport.pdf&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=aJN_B9lxV3XtoOYQqya_Bpi9ZKtvuy549O8avEZxzXs&amp;m=Rc7R0N-0O8dJS1R0h99qNS10uYJA1v_dXeFVdgp71fE&amp;s=Px6UX8tOH7wrQTn-nDiQhQ_BiFfHZT46JXgDZAHnYbA&amp;e=">56% of CEOs were “extremely” or “somewhat” concerned by the lack of talent for digital roles</a>. By 2019, this had <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.pwc.com_gx_en_ceo-2Dsurvey_2019_Theme-2Dassets_reports_talent-2Dtrends-2Dreport.pdf&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=aJN_B9lxV3XtoOYQqya_Bpi9ZKtvuy549O8avEZxzXs&amp;m=Rc7R0N-0O8dJS1R0h99qNS10uYJA1v_dXeFVdgp71fE&amp;s=Px6UX8tOH7wrQTn-nDiQhQ_BiFfHZT46JXgDZAHnYbA&amp;e=">jumped to 79%</a>. This is why well <a href="https://www.burning-glass.com/wp-content/uploads/permanent_detour_underemployment_report.pdf">over 50% of new and recent graduates are underemployed</a> in their first jobs out of college (two-thirds of whom will be underemployed five years later, and half a decade later).</p>
<p>There must be a better way. A way that empowers young people to achieve in-demand skills while avoiding the decades-long burden of student loans. A way that doesn’t discriminate based on socioeconomic background while exposing talent-hungry employers to a new pool of qualified, driven individuals.</p>
<p>In the explosion of edtech businesses with new approaches, we are in danger of overlooking an established model that can be adapted to solve these challenges. That model is apprenticeships.</p>
<h2>The apprenticeship movement</h2>
<p>There’s a lingering perception in America that apprenticeships are the province of construction and building trades, or even medieval guilds like smithing and glass-blowing. Well, not anymore. While we’ve been focused on edtech, or despairing over the widening skills gap, apprenticeships have been rebooted. Modern, tech-driven apprenticeships are emerging as a faster, cheaper and more impactful alternative to higher education.</p>
<p>In Europe, tech companies — and nontech companies <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/ibm-salaries-jobs-training-new-collar-covid-economy/">increasingly hiring entry-level workers</a> with discrete tech skills — are already leveraging<a href="https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/ibm-salaries-jobs-training-new-collar-covid-economy/"> apprenticeships</a> to provide a direct route into the labor market for diverse talent. From software engineers to data analysts, the apprentice of the 21st century is as likely to wield a keyboard as a wrench.</p>
<p>Fully employed from day one, apprentices earn a wage while they learn on a program that is entirely free to the individual. Their training is delivered alongside their role, with this applied learning approach ensuring relevant skills are tested and embedded right away.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="iz2bt8UmN9"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/12-investors-say-lifelong-learning-is-taking-edtech-mainstream/">13 investors say lifelong learning is taking edtech mainstream</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;13 investors say lifelong learning is taking edtech mainstream&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/12-investors-say-lifelong-learning-is-taking-edtech-mainstream/embed/#?secret=iz2bt8UmN9" data-secret="iz2bt8UmN9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Part of the challenge presented by the existing system is that college provides a single shot of learning at the start of a career, with a focus on knowledge rather than skills. Instead of time-consuming traditional education models, we should be encouraging companies to focus on training individuals for highly skilled jobs and adapting training as roles shift through a lifelong learning journey.</p>
<p>Against a college system churning out graduates armed with knowledge of limited applicability in the workplace, apprentices have real-work experience and transferable skill sets in the tech and digital spaces.</p>
<p>As we write this, tech <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.dol.gov_agencies_eta_apprenticeship_about_statistics&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=aJN_B9lxV3XtoOYQqya_Bpi9ZKtvuy549O8avEZxzXs&amp;m=Rc7R0N-0O8dJS1R0h99qNS10uYJA1v_dXeFVdgp71fE&amp;s=lh-GS1bPsHrzsbzOgSkhYGdgop6VmM2MpUREk013alE&amp;e=">apprenticeships represent less than 1% of American apprenticeships </a>, while <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.dol.gov_agencies_eta_apprenticeship_about_statistics&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=aJN_B9lxV3XtoOYQqya_Bpi9ZKtvuy549O8avEZxzXs&amp;m=Rc7R0N-0O8dJS1R0h99qNS10uYJA1v_dXeFVdgp71fE&amp;s=lh-GS1bPsHrzsbzOgSkhYGdgop6VmM2MpUREk013alE&amp;e=">78% of apprentices are white</a>. But change is in the air. In recent weeks, the Biden administration has gone out of its way to highlight tech as a growth area for apprenticeships.</p>
<p>The president also announced <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.whitehouse.gov_briefing-2Droom_statements-2Dreleases_2021_02_17_fact-2Dsheet-2Dbiden-2Dadministration-2Dto-2Dtake-2Dsteps-2Dto-2Dbolster-2Dregistered-2Dapprenticeships_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=aJN_B9lxV3XtoOYQqya_Bpi9ZKtvuy549O8avEZxzXs&amp;m=Rc7R0N-0O8dJS1R0h99qNS10uYJA1v_dXeFVdgp71fE&amp;s=iRWri3Hob0ohVZ8HwRyyF3b9musmHkEyUmPWiFdtUlo&amp;e=">his commitment to raising apprenticeship standards</a>, starting with casting off industry-recognized apprenticeship programs lacking in quality and training rigor.</p>
<p>These aren’t just words, either. The apprenticeship reboot will be powered by a new <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/447">National Apprenticeship Act </a>. This proposed legislation commits $3 billion over the next five years to expanding registered apprenticeship programs across a range of industries. If it’s done right, tech will be front and center.</p>
<h2>The benefit to businesses</h2>
<p>All this is welcome good news for businesses desperate to close skills gaps. As roles evolve at an ever-faster pace, it’s becoming more and more difficult to know what a college degree actually says about an individual’s ability. Yes, they went to a “good” school. But when <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/half-of-young-americans-say-college-isnt-necessary-2019-08-06">half of Americans say their degree is irrelevant to their current role</a>, how does prestige translate to jobs, let alone ability to perform in the workplace?</p>
<p>Increasingly operating in the dark, tech businesses and nontech managers hiring for tech roles are competing with each other to poach experienced talent into senior roles. It’s continuing to fish in a very limited, homogeneous pool and an expensive short-term solution.</p>
<p>Professional apprenticeships allow business leaders to be more strategic and proactive in their hiring practices. They can mold apprentices to the roles they actually need to fill while focusing on their organization’s specific requirements. It beats relying on uniform, outdated education models.</p>
<p>Better still, by training apprentices from the start of their career, companies inspire loyalty and eliminate the tricky transition phase recent grads and external hires usually need. Once converted to full-time employees, apprentices tend to persist for twice as long as traditional direct hires.</p>
<p>While skills gaps are created by the future racing toward us, racial inequalities are rooted in our past. Professional apprenticeships help break down entrenched structural barriers to careers in industries like tech.</p>
<p>Most important, they look beyond the degree requirements that screen out 67% of Black and 79% of Hispanic Americans. Because apprenticeships are paid pathways to economic opportunity, they truly level the playing field and allow companies to make genuine advances toward racial equality &#8212; beyond a few neatly crafted Instagram posts. Meanwhile, by tapping into diverse talent pools early, businesses can develop individuals and build real, recognizable routes to the boardroom.</p>
<p>They would be right, too. A 2020 report by McKinsey found companies with the highest diversity <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.mckinsey.com_business-2Dfunctions_organization_our-2Dinsights_why-2Ddiversity-2Dmatters&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=aJN_B9lxV3XtoOYQqya_Bpi9ZKtvuy549O8avEZxzXs&amp;m=Rc7R0N-0O8dJS1R0h99qNS10uYJA1v_dXeFVdgp71fE&amp;s=nkaIrANwm3SsODk5tOu6CCoL5GD9gNjXTD2GnkuxMPo&amp;e=">earned 35% more than their industry average</a>. Similarly, the share returns of the most diverse companies in the S&amp;P 500 outperformed the least diverse by a staggering 240%.</p>
<p>The time for change is now. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.insidehighered.com_quicktakes_2020_02_18_41-2Drecent-2Dgrads-2Dwork-2Djobs-2Dnot-2Drequiring-2Ddegree&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=aJN_B9lxV3XtoOYQqya_Bpi9ZKtvuy549O8avEZxzXs&amp;m=Rc7R0N-0O8dJS1R0h99qNS10uYJA1v_dXeFVdgp71fE&amp;s=j38_kYCF6Jer06vbpAMLko-hKZj7SVnEu38MpfpEdsk&amp;e=">41% of grads end up in roles that don’t require a degree</a>. With COVID-19 hitting young workers particularly hard, this figure is set to rise unless we embrace new approaches, including professional apprenticeships. In creating a direct and meaningful career pathway for young adults, they can help businesses close skills gaps and hit their much-vaunted diversity targets.</p>
<p>There’s no single solution to these challenges. But the professional apprenticeship can be education’s biggest contribution.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5IEYLip3eDppcOmy5DmphC?si=bjgo57TCQ-uFC38-iTy6HA">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>First and foremost, Equity was nominated for a Webby for &#8220;Best Technology Podcast&#8221;!!! Drop everything and go <a href="https://vote.webbyawards.com/PublicVoting#/2021/podcasts/general-series/technology">Vote for Equity</a>! We&#8217;d appreciate it. A <em>lot</em>. And even if we lose, well, we&#8217;ll keep doing our thing and making each other laugh.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cgates123">Chris</a> got together to chat through the week&#8217;s biggest news. And like every other week in recent memory, it was a busy one. But we did our best to hit some M&amp;A news, some unicorn news and some funding news from smaller startups.</p>
<p>Now, onto the show rundown; here&#8217;s what we discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/discord-ipo-microsoft-deal/">Discord-Microsoft deal is done</a>, and Danny has a hot take. Namely, in his view, the deal was mostly banker chatter more than a real possibility. More chaff than wheat, in other words. Agree or not, we&#8217;re stoked for the Discord IPO in a few years (quarters?) time.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/mastercard-is-acquiring-identity-verification-company-ekata-for-850m/">Mastercard bought Erkata</a>, and Danny was on hand to explain why we care about the deal. Sure, it was $825 million in value, but some venture data from <a href="https://finledger.com/2021/04/19/mastercard-purchases-identity-verification-company-ekata-its-6th-known-acquisition-to-exceed-a-100m-purchase-price/">Finledger helped explain just how much capital is flowing into similar companies</a>. Let&#8217;s see how <em>that</em> math works out.</li>
<li>Clearbanc rebranded itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/clearbanc-unicorn-clearco/">into a fintech unicorn,</a> providing services along with sweet, sweet capital.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/a-cooling-trend-in-public-markets-makes-uipaths-down-round-ipo-a-win-for-the-company/">UiPath IPO finally priced</a> and started to trade. It had a good first day, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/as-uipath-closes-above-its-final-private-valuation-cfo-ashim-gupta-discusses-his-companys-path-to-market/">you can check out</a> what we learned talking to its CFO here.</li>
<li>Over in China, a country that we&#8217;ve not covered enough lately, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/laiye-rpa-50-million-funding/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Laiye raised $50 million more</a>. Like UiPath it competes in the RPA world.</li>
<li>Deel, for one, had a good 2020. It hit 20x growth in revenue last year, and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/remote-hiring-startup-deel-raises-156m-at-a-1-25b-valuation-after-20x-growth-in-2020/"> recently raised at a $1.25 billion valuation.</a></li>
<li>And then we closed with two seed rounds raised by recent Y Combinator grads: Here&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/queenly-raises-2-3m-for-its-dress-marketplace/">the Queenly round</a>, and here&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/satellite-imagery-startup-albedo-closes-10m-seed-round/">the Albedo deal</a>!</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">The black curtain pulls aside and a character straight out of the movies waves hello. This is not an uncommon occurrence when I’m around Imagineers, but this time is special. The character isn’t a costume, it’s a robot. And, unlike the m​any animatronic figures you’ve seen in the parks, it’s not stuck in one place. No, this character is walking toward me, attached only by a thin cable used for programming.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">The gait is smooth, the arms swing in a lifelike manner and the feet plant realistically. The body sways exactly as you’d expect it to. There’s no other way to say it, it’s ambling. This is Project Kiwi, a small-scale, free-roaming robotic actor — the first of its kind for Disney and a real robotics milestone.</p>
<p class="p1">The Holy Grail of themed entertainment has been established for decades now: a fully mobile, bipedal character that matches the appearance, personality and scale of the original. Various non-mobile levels of this vision have been achieved at parks around the world, including the incredibly lifelike <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/17/disney-showed-us-the-inner-workings-of-its-avatar-robot-and-its-just-incredible/">Na’Vi Shaman</a>, The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/how-disney-built-star-wars-in-real-life/">A1000 figure</a> that powers characters like Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge’s Hondo Ohnaka and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJtNxaTwgz0">smoothly expressive Belle</a> from Beauty and the Beast at Tokyo Disneyland. There have also been some cool mobile experiments like <a href="https://twitter.com/panzer/status/918301474404175874?s=20">the self-piloting droid “Jake”</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p class="p1">The pint-sized character has accurately rendered textures on its face, hands and feet. It’s dressed in a distressed red flight suit that you may remember from the films. And its eyes are expressive as it looks at me and waves. This is the moment, the one that Disney Imagineers and park goers alike have been waiting decades to realize. This is a real, walkaround character that is at the proper scale, kid scale.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">A couple of weeks ago at Walt Disney Imagineering in Southern California, I saw just how close they finally are to making that dream come true. A bipedal platform, developed completely in house over the past three years by WDI researchers and roboticists — dressed up to look like a roughly two and a half foot tall Groot.</p>
<p class="p1">Even though the version of Kiwi that I’m looking at is Groot-flavored, it’s important to stress that this is a platform first and foremost, which means that it could take this form when it gets to the parks, or another form entirely. It’s important while developing a character to have a target character that can tell you whether or not you’re hitting an established mark of believability.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Kiwi also is still very much a work in progress. I wouldn’t expect to see this in the wild soon; there is still a lot of work to be done on the way that Kiwi works and interacts with people, and WDI does not have immediate plans to put it in the parks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">But even at this stage it’s an incredible feat of engineering that genuinely radiates that elusive characteristic that Disney always searches for with its figures: presence.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/6spi7nBqrro?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<h2 class="p1">How did we get here?</h2>
<p class="p1">I was able to speak to the lead on Project Kiwi, R&amp;D Imagineer Principal Scott LaValley, as well as Advanced Development Studio Executive SVP Jon Snoddy, about how the platform came together over the past few years.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">“Project KIWI started about three years ago to figure out how we can bring our smaller characters to life at their actual scale in authentic ways,” LaValley says. “It’s an exciting time for bipedal robotics and with an incredible team and our combination of technology, artistry and magic, we are bringing characters to life that could not have happened anywhere but Disney.”</p>
<p class="p1">I’ve talked a bit about the unique Imagineering process in my previous pieces on how Disney <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/08/disney-has-begun-populating-its-parks-with-autonomous-personality-driven-robots/">builds reactive robotics</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/disney-imagineering-has-created-autonomous-robot-stunt-doubles/">autonomous stuntbots</a> and even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/27/how-disney-built-star-wars-in-real-life/">entire lands</a>. Imagineering works a lot like a startup in the way that it comes up with a problem to solve and then goes about pulling in other departments to help it get a solution. There is a remarkably ego-free nature to much of the way that WDI actually finds those solutions, too. They are as likely to find a key component off the shelf as they are to design, develop and patent it in house.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">The interconnected nature of Imagineering departments like ride design, show systems, special effects, animatronics department, Tech Studio R&amp;D and Disney Research means that they share solutions across the stack as well.</p>
<p class="p1">The guiding thread to all of it, of course, is storytelling. This guiding force exists at all levels of the process, keeping the project moving in the right direction — toward a better way to tell stories and transport guests.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">With Kiwi, the end goal was clear, a character that could walk on its own and interact with park guests. Unfortunately, due to the scale and complexity of the figure and the requirements for interaction and walking, no &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; platforms would do. The fact is that there are actually only a handful of truly viable bipedal robotics platforms anywhere in the world and the vast majority of them are being created for industrial applications, with a handful of &#8220;human-scale&#8221; solutions that are designed as marketing set pieces rather than truly autonomous systems.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">So to hit that goal, Imagineering turned to R&amp;D and LaValley’s team. LaValley came to Disney from Boston Dynamics, where he worked on the first version of its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQni8Uz3Q0I">biped robot Atlas</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">The project scope was that they needed a biped robot that was battery powered and could be programmed to handle autonomous interactions with park guests and striped gestures and emotes. The team would take the next three years to build what they needed — much of which was custom for reasons we’ll get into shortly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">It’s clear at a glance that Kiwi has no operator inside. The human brain is pretty good at instinctually understanding whether a space is just too small to have a person in it. In order to achieve the small size, the team had to first build a custom skeleton that had room for every motor and actuator Kiwi would need to achieve 50 degrees of freedom, all while keeping it humanoid in shape so that it could be &#8220;dressed up&#8221; as any number of characters.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">First came the frame. Prototypes were built from custom-printed polymer and then eventually custom metal parts using industrial printers. The armatures and segments that they needed to house the critical components were just too complex to mill or cast. The cleverly printed metal skeleton is hollow throughout, allowing a &#8220;marrow conduit&#8221; for air which rushes through the body cooling the motors and actuators. In the current Kiwi prototype the air comes in through the collar area of the suit, flows throughout the body, propelled by fans embedded in the skeleton and exhausts near the bottom of the unit. Eventually it will use the clothing as a shroud to help air flow out near the feet.</p>
<p class="p1">Though there is some audible noise, even in this early state it is <i>very</i> low, allowing audio playing out of a speaker to enable conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">As you can see in the exclusive progress video embedded above, the lower sections were built first. Early testing around the office shows the legs and torso sneaking, bouncing, shuffling and strutting through Imagineering. This is probably the only workplace in the world where the bottom half of a torso can tiptoe past your office while you’re eating lunch and it doesn’t even merit a pause between bites.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">An enormous amount of completely custom robotics work went into the Kiwi platform. In the demonstration I saw, young Groot had a safety tether and control cable for live programming, but nothing on the rig itself needed support, it was free roaming with on-board battery power that LaValley says hits around the 45 minute mark currently, with more longevity hoped for in the final version. In fact, a next-generation skeleton is already under development that is lighter and more efficient.</p>

<p class="p1">The legs use a system that offers a kinetic counter-balance, allowing the force of having to move and plant a foot to be off-set, making motions more power efficient and quicker. Think of a spring-loaded heavy gate that makes it easier for you to swing open — but no springs, and a robotic limb instead of a gate.</p>
<p class="p1">The feet plant realistically for the very simple reason that they must actually support the figure. This gives it an additional layer of believability that just doesn’t happen with externally supported characters that “fake” a foot plant. LaValley demonstrated that the figure could easily stay afoot even if it was shoved gently or if a hand was rested on its shoulder. This kind of self-balancing is something that humans do unconsciously and continuously, but it must be built and programmed in to an ambulatory robot.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">Many <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200369333A1">patentable inventions</a> went into this creation. One of them is a clever system of gears that translates energy across joints, allowing them to share motors with one another even across a joint like a knee or wrist. This means fewer components and the ability to keep motor and actuator packages small and compact enough to fit underneath theming.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">In order to minimize the amount of wiring throughout Kiwi — since wires are always the biggest points of failure — the team created a set of origami-like circuit boards joined by integrated flex cabling. Think of your standard computer circuit board but sliced into segments and mounted to the exterior of the hollow &#8220;bones.&#8221; They wrap around the limbs and other body parts, binding the control systems and motors being controlled into a local group that reduces the amount of harnessing that needs to be spread across joints and throughout the structure.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">No actuators — the components that decide how to move a limb — that exist had the capabilities that the team needed, so they built them from scratch. At one point, LaValley handed me a ring holding iteration after iteration of a dozen actuator elements. I was holding years&#8217; worth of engineering, experimentation, failure and progress on a simple bit of wire twisted together at the end.</p>
<p class="p1">Up next for Project Kiwi is a new set of actuators that can dynamically apply torque plus added sensing capabilities for more stability and reaction to uneven ground or interactions. You can imagine that, as a free-roaming character people will want to take pictures with it and I doubt kids would be able to resist running up for a hug. The skeleton must be able to sense and react quickly and smoothly to those sudden external inputs in order to stay upright and keep looking natural.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">Moving from a pure IK system to a fully torque-sensing system will allow for the platform to make on the fly adjustments that compensate for terrain or interaction with other performers or guests.</p>
<p class="p1">All of the work the team put into custom gearing, motors and actuation has paid off in spades with the ridiculously smooth and natural-looking movements of Kiwi’s arms and legs. Quick waves, shrugs, dance moves and even boxing jabs all look like a real — if slightly gentle — creature is performing them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">The team also demonstrated the custom-built performance software that they designed, which allows Kiwi to have different kinds of gaits with personality layered on top. The bottom layer is an IK-style gait system that keeps Kiwi upright and walking, but then layering the personalities on top adds character to the walk while still maintaining stability. Bouncy, jaunty walks, limps, sad or downhearted walks, all with the other motions of arms and head contributing to a constantly shifting center of mass and momentum. The paddling duck&#8217;s feet under the water is that gait system that takes the external inputs and integrates it into the walk naturally.</p>

<p class="p1">The current prototype software has a series of set behaviors, with a timeline that allows them to program new behaviors and actions by toggles or adjusting curves that control movement. With a series of tweaks in the software the changes become evident immediately, with Groot’s “mood” becoming immediately evident in his walk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">One moment he is bouncing along swinging his arms jauntily, clearly happy to be there. Then the next moment his arms are slumped, his head is hung and he is slowly plodding — clearly sad to be leaving the fun behind. It’s a remarkable bit of performance software.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">And even though the expressive eyes are already impressive — the team is not done. Up next on the agenda is a sensory package that allows Kiwi to more fully understand the world around it and to identify people and their faces. This becomes important because eye contact is such an emotive and powerful tool to use in transporting a participant.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Even without the sensing software, I can tell you that the experience of this 2.5ft Groot locking eyes with me, smiling and waving was just incredibly transportive. Multiple times throughout my interaction I completely forgot that it was a robot at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

<p class="p1">As I mentioned at the top, the Project Kiwi platform still has a lot of work left to do before it makes any appearances in the parks. But it’s already well on the road to being viable for things like stage performances, photo ops and eventually free-roaming deployment in the parks.</p>
<p class="p1">That is really the vision. Snoddy says that the goal is to move the characters we love from across Disney’s pantheon into the spaces of the guests, elevating the entirety of the park to a live transportive experience, rather than a single ride or dark room. And to do it <i>at the proper scale</i> to make them genuine and capable of making guests believe. With these kinds of platforms, the possibilities are there to make the entire parks themselves a living, breathing home for the characters, rather than the tightly controlled environments of the rides themselves.</p>
<p class="p1">The arc of history in this Imagineering journey is drawn in robots. From Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln, to incredibly expressive characters like the Na’Vi Shaman anchored inside a dark ride, to characters that hold up in bright, well-lit spaces. Project Kiwi is the next frontier, allowing them to step off of the pedestal and right into the world of the guest.</p>
<p class="p1">One of the most fascinating fields in robotics currently is HRI, or human-robot interaction. This multidisciplinary effort to help humans and robots communicate better is often focused on safety and awareness in industrial settings. But I’ve long said that the most incredibly interesting work in this space is being done in Imagineering R&amp;D. More than 100 million people pass through Disney’s parks per year, and the number of opportunities that they have to react to and interact with robotic characters grows yearly. And with projects like Kiwi on the horizon, this field is going to explode with new kinds of data and learnings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">And, of course, we’ll get to meet some of our favorite characters looking and acting as real as we’ve ever seen them in our world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Union&#8217;s lead data protection supervisor has called for remote biometric surveillance in public places to be banned outright under incoming AI legislation.</p>
<p>The European Data Protection Supervisor&#8217;s (EDPS) intervention follows a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">proposal</a>, put out by EU lawmakers on Wednesday, for a risk-based approach to regulating applications of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>The Commission&#8217;s legislative proposal includes a partial ban on law enforcement&#8217;s use of remote biometric surveillance technologies (such as facial recognition) in public places. But the text includes wide-ranging exceptions, and digital and humans rights groups were quick to warn over loopholes they argue will lead to a drastic erosion of EU citizens&#8217; fundamental rights. And last week a cross-party group of MEPs urged the Commission to screw its courage to the sticking place and outlaw the rights-hostile tech.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The EDPS, whose role includes issuing recommendations and guidance for the Commission, tends to agree. In a <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/press-publications/press-news/press-releases/2021/artificial-intelligence-act-welcomed-initiative_en">press release</a> today Wojciech Wiewiórowski urged a rethink.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EDPS regrets to see that our earlier calls for a moratorium on the use of remote biometric identification systems &#8212; including facial recognition &#8212; in publicly accessible spaces have not been addressed by the Commission,&#8221; he wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EDPS will continue to advocate for a stricter approach to automated recognition in public spaces of human features &#8212; such as of faces but also of gait, fingerprints, DNA, voice, keystrokes and other biometric or behavioural signals &#8212; whether these are used in a commercial or administrative context, or for law enforcement purposes.</p>
<p>&#8220;A stricter approach is necessary given that remote biometric identification, where AI may contribute to unprecedented developments, presents extremely high risks of deep and non-democratic intrusion into individuals’ private lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wiewiórowski had some warm words for the legislative proposal too, saying he welcomed the horizontal approach and the broad scope set out by the Commission. He also agreed there are merits to a risk-based approach to regulating applications of AI.</p>
<p>But the EDPB has made it clear that the red lines devised by EU lawmakers are a lot pinker in hue than he&#8217;d hoped for &#8212; adding a high-profile voice to the critique that the Commission hasn&#8217;t lived up to its much trumpeted claim to have devised a framework that will ensure &#8220;trustworthy&#8221; and &#8220;human-centric&#8221; AI.</p>
<p>The coming debate over the final shape of the regulation is sure to include plenty of discussion over where exactly Europe&#8217;s AI red lines should be. A final version of the text isn&#8217;t expected to be agreed until next year at the earliest.</p>
<p>&#8220;The EDPS will undertake a meticulous and comprehensive analysis of the Commission’s proposal to support the EU co-legislators in strengthening the protection of individuals and society at large. In this context, the EDPS will focus in particular on setting precise boundaries for those tools and systems which may present risks for the fundamental rights to data protection and privacy,&#8221; Wiewiórowski added.</p>
