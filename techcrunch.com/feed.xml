The funding comes from two separate equity rounds, a Series C and Series D, which are being disclosed simultaneously.</p>
<p>Its Series C funding was led by 5Y Capital, with participation from Sequoia Capital China, Source Code Capital, VMS, Walden International and Scheme Capital while the Series D round was led by Capital Today along with existing investors including Sequoia Capital China, 5Y Capital, Source Code Capital, Legend Star and 01VC.</p>
<p>The latest fundings, which come after its $15 million Series B+ round in March this year, will be used to bolster its robot fleet with technological upgrades, penetrate further to the global market, hire talent, and support its supply chain management.</p>
<p>Hai Robotics, founded in 2016, has five overseas subsidiaries in Hong Kong SAR, Japan, Singapore, the U.S. and the Netherlands with international customers in more than 30 countries. <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hai-robotics-enters-australia-market-boosts-largest-online-book-retailer-booktopia-s-efficiency-by-800--825474720.html">The company entered Australia in this year</a> by deploying HAI’s warehouse robots at Australia’s largest online bookstore Booktopia to handle packing and dispatch orders.</p>
<p>“Our major future orientation will center on expanding the overseas market and localize our service,” said Richie Chen, Hai Robotics co-founder and CEO.</p>

<p>Hai Robotics develops an autonomous case-handling (ACR) system that provides warehouse automation solutions via robotics technology and AI algorithms for the logistics warehouse industry. The company said it has more than 400 global patents in areas like robot control and warehouse management, based on its statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The global warehouse automation market is projected to increase to $30 billion by 2026, at a CAGR of 14%, from $15 billion in 2019, based on <a href="https://www.thelogisticsiq.com/research/warehouse-automation-market/">a report by Logistics IQ</a>.</p>
<p>There are a number of startups and larger technology companies building warehouse robotics these days &#8212; industrial applications more generally being one of the earliest and most successful use cases for robots. Others include Fetch Robotics, NextShift Robotics and Alog Tech.</p>
<p>Chen also said the company differs from other global peers in many aspects including project costs and customization capability. Hai Robotics has been running over more than 200 projects globally with 2,000 ACR robots deployed. Its ACR system can be applied in various industries like apparel, e-commerce, retail, manufacturing, 3PL, electronics, pharmaceutical, energy, and automotive.  It has partnered with global logistics and supply chain firms including <a href="https://www.lgcns.com/EN/Home">LG CNS</a>, <a href="https://mujin-corp.com/">MUJIN</a>, <a href="https://www.bps-group.net/en/">BPS Global</a>, and <a href="https://www.savoye.com/en">Savoye</a>.</p>
<p>In 2015, the company launched its first ACR system (called HAIPICK A42), which can pick and place totes and cartons on storage shelves up to 5-7 meters high and carry up to 9 loads to conveyors.</p>
<p>Hai Robotics has several other models in that line.</p>
<p>“The case-handling robot is riding on the market trend that shifts towards smaller workflows, such as from pallet-picking to totes-picking. We’re very pleased to see the company’s fast growth with good innovation,” Guo Shanshan, a partner of Sequoia Capital China said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in July, British “axial-flux” electric motor startup <a href="https://www.yasa.com/">YASA</a> was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/acquired-by-mercedes-benz-yasas-revolutionary-electric-motor-is-set-for-big-things/">acquired</a> by Mercedes-Benz for an undisclosed amount. YASA’s electric motors generated considerable EV industry interest because of their efficiency, high power density, small size and low weight.</p>
<p>Indeed, Rolls-Royce, best known in aviation for its jet engines, employed YASA engines in its all-electric airplane “Spirit of Innovation” which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/17/rolls-royces-all-electric-aircraft-completes-15-minute-maiden-voyage/?cx_testId=6&#038;cx_testVariant=cx_undefined&#038;cx_artPos=0#cxrecs_s">recently completed</a> a 15-minute test flight.</p>
<p><img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/821d4e30-17b9-11ec-b3f9-f0dd9fabce24.cf_-1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>But it’s emerged today that there was, to put it mildly, more to the deal than met the eye.</p>
<p>It turns out that a new company, <a href="http://www.evolito.co.uk/">Evolito</a>, was spun out of YASA <em>before</em> its acquisition by Mercedes Benz, taking with it an electric motor it describes as ultra-high performance, low-weight, and most suitable for the aerospace industry.</p>
<p>The prospect now is that Evolito will pick up in the aerospace world where YASA left off in the automotive world. Evolito’s investors lead are Waypoint Capital and Oxford Science Enterprises (OSE).</p>
<p>The implication is that because YASA’s technology has proven itself in high volume production in the automotive industry, Evolito could have particular advantages in aerospace.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Acquired by Mercedes-Benz, YASA&#8217;s revolutionary electric motor is set for big things&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/acquired-by-mercedes-benz-yasas-revolutionary-electric-motor-is-set-for-big-things/embed/#?secret=pixLWsnTXg" data-secret="pixLWsnTXg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Evolito claims its motors are “ultra high-performance, low-weight axial-flux motors&#8221; and its power electronics are &#8220;smaller, lighter and more robust than any other competing technology” with wide potential applications in Electric Vertical Take-off and Landing (eVTOL), Fixed Wing and distributed electric propulsion applications such as Urban Air Mobility (UAM).</p>
<p>Gareth Morris, Managing Director, Evolito said: “Electrification in aerospace is some ten years behind that of the automotive industry, but the market potential is huge. Electric Vertical Take-off and Landing, Electric Helicopter, Fixed-Wing, and Urban Air Mobility aircraft need high power density, low weight electric powertrains with inherently high safety factors &#8211; a combination of attributes that are unique to our axial-flux electric motor and power electronics. By leveraging YASA’s unique IP in the aerospace market, Evolito will fast-track the commercialization of electric flight and transform mobility as we know it.”</p>

<p>Many of these claims appear to ring true. After personally visiting the YASA factory and having the advantages of the “topology” of its engine explained in great detail, I would be extremely hard-pressed to argue against the claims made for it. It’s this technology that Evolito is now taking forward into the aerospace industry, and it looks like it will be a very bright future indeed.</p>
<p>Cyrus Jilla, Partner and Board Director, Waypoint Capital said: “At Waypoint, one of our thematic interests is in energy transition and sustainability, including electrification. We look to invest in businesses with unique disruptive technology led by outstanding teams. Evolito is a perfect fit for us and we look forward to backing the team as they develop their game-changing electrification solutions for the aerospace market, making emissions-free flight a reality.”</p>
<p>Alexis Zervoglos, Senior Partner, OSE added: “The electrification of flight is one of the most exciting market opportunities of our time. Realizing this potential will require innovative new technology and an ability to scale to meet the fast-emerging demand. OSE is delighted to be supporting Evolito on its mission to accelerate the adoption of electric flight.”</p>
<p>The market for electric drive solutions for urban applications is forecast to grow to $90 billion and 160,000 vehicles by 2050, according to some industry experts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tag, a one-year-old startup that offers banking and financial services to users in Pakistan, has raised over $12 million in what is now the largest seed financing round in the South Asian market.</p>
<p>Liberty City Ventures, Canaan Partners, Addition, Mantis and Banana Capital and others financed the round, which brings YC-backed Tag’s to-date raise to over $17.5 million. This is the firm time many of these investors, including Lee Fixel’s Addition, have invested in a startup in Pakistan.</p>
<p>The round values Tag at $100 million, two people involved in the deal told TechCrunch. The new funding took just two weeks to close, Tag founder and chief executive Talal Gondal told TechCrunch in an interview. He declined to comment on the valuation.</p>
<p>The investor’s excitement to Tag comes as the startup builds one of the crucial railroads for users in Pakistan. “We are trying to become both Revolut and Paytm in Pakistan,” the 29-year-old founder said.</p>
<p><a href="https://tagme.pk">Tag</a> partners with public and private firms to offer their employees banking services including getting their salaries on the Tag account and Visa-powered virtual and physical cards. Signing up on Tag &#8212; which includes some verification of an individual’s identity &#8212; just takes three minutes, he said.</p>
<p>It also provides a range of B2C offerings such as the ability to pay others online and top up utility bills that are available to any user in Pakistan who signs up to the platform.</p>
<p>“We eventually want to offer the complete set of banking and financial services to users in Pakistan,” he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Before starting Tag, Gondal worked as an investor for seven years in Europe. He said he had long decided to return to Pakistan and start a firm to serve people in his home nation, but was waiting for the right moment.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s startup ecosystem has received a major boost this year with the arrival of high-profile investors including those backing Tag as well as Harry Stebbings’ 20 VC and Josh Buckley’s Buckley Ventures.</p>
<p>A group of very young startups have made splashy funding announcements in recent weeks. Quick-commerce startup Airlift unveiled <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/pakistans-airlift-raises-85-million-for-its-quick-commerce-startup-eyes-international-expansion/">a record $85 million Series B last month</a>, followed by business-to-business Bazaar’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/pakistans-b2b-marketplace-and-digital-ledger-platform-bazaar-raises-30-million/">record $30 million Series A round</a>. Last week, the digital freight marketplace BridgeLinx <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/digital-freight-marketplace-bridgelinx-raises-10-million-in-pakistans-largest-seed-funding/">announced a $10 million seed round</a>, which at the time was the nation’s largest. Wednesday&#8217;s announcement also makes Tag one of the most valued firms from Y Combinator&#8217;s recent batches.</p>
<p>Gondal said startups are finally having a moment in the South Asian market. “Each country’s startup ecosystem goes through various waves. In India, we saw e-commerce firms like Flipkart flourish in the first wave. Firms like Ola, Zomato and Swiggy and fintech firms like PhonePe and Paytm made inroads in the waves after that,” he said, adding that he saw a similar trend in Berlin.</p>
<p>“I had the conviction that a similar thing would play out in Pakistan.”</p>
<p>Gondal said the startup is now working to broaden its product offerings and hire talent to win the trust of the market.</p>
<p>“Liberty City Ventures is proud to support a visionary leader like Talal in his efforts to expand financial inclusion for the underserved and underbanked,” said Murtaza Akbar, Managing Partner at Liberty City Ventures, in a statement. “We expect the world class team he has assembled at TAG to build a regional Fintech powerhouse.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This news is notable for a few reasons. For one, it’s a staggering sum for any startup, much less one based in Latin America. Also, news of this raise comes just five months after Kavak <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/mexican-unicorn-kavak-raises-a-485m-series-d-at-a-4b-valuation/">raised $485 million in a Series D at a $4 billion valuation</a>. The investment also marks the second time this year that Kavak has doubled its valuation. (The company only achieved unicorn status last October.) And lastly, the round makes Kavak the second most valuable startup in all of Latin America &#8212; the first being Brazilian fintech Nubank, which </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/fintech-all-star-nubank-raises-a-750m-mega-round/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">earlier this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was valued at $30 billion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cambridge, Massachusetts-based General Catalyst led Kavak’s Series E, which brings the company’s total raised to over $1.5 billion since its 2016 inception. Tiger Global, Spruce House, D1, SEA, Founders Fund, Ribbit Capital, SoftBank and others also participated in the latest financing.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why global investors are flocking to back Latin American startups&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/why-global-investors-are-flocking-to-back-latin-american-startups/embed/#?secret=yOqjjWzKBJ" data-secret="yOqjjWzKBJ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Put simply, Kavak is an online marketplace that aims to bring transparency, security and access to financing to the used car market. It promises to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ensure “reliable” transactions that mitigate fraud and aims to raise used car standards from a mechanical and safety point of view by using artificial intelligence and data technology. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company also offers its own financing through its fintech arm, Kavak Capital, which it launched about 18 months ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I like to describe it as if Spotify, Amazon, Toyota and Citibank had a kid, then something like Kavak would be born,” said Kavak co-founder and CEO Carlos García Ottati in an interview with TechCrunch.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, the company&#8217;s business model seems to be working. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kavak has been doubling its revenue every three to five months, according to García Ottati. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And over the last 14 months, it’s no surprise &#8212; considering the increase in its valuation and all the capital it has raised &#8212; that Kavak has grown exponentially &#8212; from 300 to more than 5,000 employees in Latin America, to meet what </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">García Ottati describes as strong demand.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The startup currently has 40 logistic and reconditioning hubs in Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. That compares to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> more than 2,500 employees and 20 logistics and reconditioning hubs in Mexico and Argentina at the time of its last raise in April.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Over the years, it has served &#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What excites me about this raise is a reflection of Kavak’s ambition we have and what we want to build, and less so about need,” he said. “Most importantly, it’s going to allow us to think long term and build a true generational company.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial inclusion is a big part of Kavak’s mission in addition to wanting to make it easier for people to own cars, and thus improve their professional and personal lives, added García Ottati, who was inspired to start the company after his own challenges selling a car in Colombia and trying to buy one in Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we do our job well, in the next 20 years, the middle class should grow up by 30% in emerging markets just by granting financing products to a huge amount of people that are excluded today, giving them a tool that can definitely enhance their lives,” he said. &#8220;We want to be a s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">uper app, or an ecosystem of services, that empowers mobility and financial health and do more than just help people buy and sell cars.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Kavak plans to use its new capital in part to expand across Latin America, with plans to begin operating in several other markets over the next 12 months. Longer term, it is eyeing an expansion into “other emerging markets” globally. It also plans to continue hiring &#8212; particularly engineers and product folks &#8212; as well double down on product development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">García Ottati is also excited about the impact Kavak&#8217;s raise has on the Latin American startup scene as a whole.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wonderful bringing in new funds who had not previously invested in the region to see how LatAm looks and works,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They can see that we are addressing deep and big issues.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Catalyst Managing Director Adam Valkin believes the startup </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has established itself as “the clear leader” in Latin America&#8217;s pre-owned car market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The company has developed a playbook for providing a transformational customer experience with a compelling and efficient economic model,” he said in a written statement. “We are excited for Kavak to expand into other emerging markets where a similar opportunity exists to drive financial inclusion and empower the middle class through access to car ownership.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ZestMoney, a Bangalore-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/18/zestmoney-goldman-sachs/">buy now, pay later platform</a>, said on Wednesday it has raised $50 million in a new financing round from Australia’s Zip as the Indian firm looks to double down on a trend that has shown early signs of traction in several global markets.</p>
<p>The eight-year-old Australian firm, which has a presence in 12 markets across five continents, is acquiring a minority stake in ZestMoney as part of the new Series C financing round, the two said.</p>
<p>ZestMoney said in a statement the new financing round hasn’t closed as existing investors will be participating in it as well. The startup, which has raised over $110 million to date, counts Goldman Sachs, Quona Capital, PayU, and Xiaomi among its early backers.</p>
<p>The buy now, pay later market remains at a nascent stage in India, where only a fraction of the population has a credit card. But a handful of startups including ZestMoney, Capital Float, and LazyPay are beginning to show traction in a market largely dominated by traditional giant Bajaj Finance.</p>
<p>The low penetration of credit cards in India has meant that very few people in the nation have a traditional credit score that banks heavily rely on to establish one’s credit worthiness before issuing them a loan. Moreover, small loans don’t generate lucrative returns for banks, giving them less incentive to write such cheques.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2206447" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2206447" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2206447 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/zestmoney.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="255" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/zestmoney.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/zestmoney.jpg?resize=150,37 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/zestmoney.jpg?resize=300,75 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/zestmoney.jpg?resize=768,192 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/zestmoney.jpg?resize=680,170 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/zestmoney.jpg?resize=1536,383 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/zestmoney.jpg?resize=50,12 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2206447" class="wp-caption-text">Image credits: Bernstein Research</p></div></p>
<p>ZestMoney says it assesses other data points and uses AI to help these people build a profile and become credit-worthy.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup, which said it has amassed over 11 million users and has 25 banking and non-banking financial partners, works with large merchants such as Amazon, Flipkart, Google Pay, Apple and Xiaomi to offer its BNPL services to customers. ZestMoney has presence across over 75,000 physical stores and more than 10,000 online sites, it said.</p>
<p>The startup’s offering starts at as low as 50 Indian rupees (68 cents) to $6,777 and the duration of the payback period ranges between a month to two years.</p>
<p>“This is a deep validation of our position as market leader in the Buy Now Pay Later category in India. The shift towards Pay Later solutions is a global phenomenon and represents young digital consumers looking for transparency, honesty and no hidden charges in financial products,” said Lizzie Chapman, co-founder and chief executive of ZestMoney, in a statement.</p>
<p>“We believe India will leapfrog traditional products like credit cards, along with many other emerging markets, going straight to digital payment solutions. Over the last year we have seen applications for BNPL go up by 5X on our platform. We continue to invest in deepening partnerships with our merchant network and hiring the best talent. We strongly believe India will emerge as the largest BNPL market in the world over the next 5 years.”</p>

<p><a href="https://evermos.com/home/">Evermos</a> is an Indonesian social commerce startup with two goals: to let people earn extra income by opening online stores without spending capital and to help small brands grow into household names. The company, which focuses on halal products and other items for Muslim customers, announced today it has raised a $30 million Series B, led by UOB Venture Management’s Asia Impact Investment Fund II. Other participants included IFC, MDI Ventures, Telkomsel Mitra Innovation (TMI) and Future Shape, along with returning investors Jungle Ventures and Shunwei Capital.</p>
<p>The funding will be used on hiring, enhancing Evermos&#8217; recommendation engine and other AI-based tech, and entering new regions in Indonesia. The company says it currently has 100,000 active resellers in more than 500 Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, mostly in Java. Its goal is to reach more than one million resellers throughout Indonesia over the next five years.</p>
<p>On the supply side, Evermos works with more than 500 brands, primarily small Indonesian businesses, and sells fashion, halal health and beauty products, and food and beverages. The company says its total transaction volume has increased by more than 60 times over the last two years.</p>
<p>Evermos was founded in November 2018 by Ghufron Mustaqim, Iqbal Muslimin, Ilham Taufiq and Arip Tirta. Mustaqim told TechCrunch that the team was motivated by its dissatisfaction with many retail practices in Indonesia. For example, this includes multiple layers of distribution that hike up prices and the proliferation of fake products online, which makes many people wary of buying from e-commerce marketplaces.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Super, an Indonesian hyperlocal social commerce startup, raises $28M led by SoftBank Ventures Asia&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/super-an-indonesian-hyperlocal-social-commerce-startup-raises-28m-led-by-softbank-ventures-asia/embed/#?secret=JeUlRN5Zr4" data-secret="JeUlRN5Zr4" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“We’re trying to solve these problems by innovating with the social commerce model, so resellers can help customers pick the right products in a more efficient way,” Mustaqim said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Almost 90% of Indonesians are Muslim, so “when you say we target the Muslim market, we are targeting almost all of Indonesia,” he added. “We carefully curate the products onboarded to our platform, and one of the most important aspects is whether it’s relevant to the Muslim market. For example, it has to be halal, if it’s fashion it has be modest fashion.”</p>
<p>Evermos does not require resellers to buy inventory. Instead, resellers market items picked from Evermos’ catalog to their social circles, including family, friends and neighbors, through WhatsApp, Facebook and other apps. Resellers have an online landing page created on Evermos&#8217; app and can send links about products to customers, but Mustaqim says most sales happen through chat.</p>
<p>Evermos handles inventory, logistics and customer support. Like many other social commerce startups in Indonesia, including Super, KitaBeli and ChiliBeli, Evermos focuses on smaller cities, where e-commerce penetration is lower because of factors like higher shipping costs. To keep shipping costs down, Evermos resellers often group their customers’ orders into batches. Products are usually sent to them from the brands’ own warehouses via third-party logistics providers, but Evermos is currently building inventory analytics and a network of warehouses to stock products closer to resellers.</p>
<p>Mustaqim says brands usually pay 30% commission on products sold through Evermos, and the company shares most of that with resellers. Evermos’ top resellers earn about $200 USD a month, or about the monthly minimum wage in most Indonesian provinces.</p>
<p>Since most of Evermos’ resellers are selling online for the first time, it provides in-app training modules (and occasional offline training events, too). This includes advice on curating inventory, how to use Evermos’ platform to make orders and use its promotional programs and product copywriting.</p>

<p>So far, Evermos has focused primarily on Java, but plans to expand into other regions of Indonesia. Its strategies for reaching one million resellers in five years include running ads and a program where resellers get one-time commissions for referring new sellers to the platform. Mustaqim says over-penetration won’t be a problem because resellers usually focus on a handful of product categories, so even people located in the same community won’t necessarily be competing with one another.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Taiwan-based smartphone manufacturing giant Foxconn and national Thailand oil supplier PTT PLC are moving forward with an agreement to start an electric vehicle manufacturing facility in Thailand. The facility is expected to begin rolling out vehicles by 2023. Foxconn had previously reported plans to begin building factories in both Thailand and the U.S. next year.</p>
<p>Foxconn and PTT signed a memorandum of understanding to cooperate on EV production in June, with PTT owning 60% of the joint venture and Foxconn owning the remaining 40%. The initial production capacity of the Thailand facility will be around 50,000 units, which Foxconn says will increase three-fold by 2030. The Thailand plant officially marks Foxconn as an automaker in its own right, but the company is also working with EV maker Fisker on a U.S. manufacturing plant, which should also start production in 2023. The two companies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/13/fisker-and-foxconn-sign-deal-to-build-electric-vehicles/">signed a joint agreement, called Project PEAR</a>, in May.</p>

<p>“Thailand is fairly new in terms of supply and demand with limited manufacturers producing in the country,&#8221; said Bakar Sadik Agwan, senior automotive analyst at GlobalData, a data and analytics consulting company, in a statement. &#8220;With conducive policies and heritage in auto manufacturing, Thailand offers much more value to Foxconn compared to other markets. The company also has a manufacturing partnership in China with Byton, but it is reportedly on hold now. While China may be the largest EV market, it faces overcapacity issues due to the EV market being fragmented, which will affect many automakers’ ability to make enough margin.”</p>
<p>Thailand&#8217;s government has become a major supporter of Foxconn because it hopes to be a future &#8220;EV hub&#8221; and increase its EV share in total capacity to 30% by 2030 by incentivizing local production.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Real-time supply chain visibility company project44 has acquired last-mile tech platform Convey for $255 million. Together, the two companies will combine forces to provide end-to-end supply chain visibility, from the raw materials to the front door.</p>
<p>The acquisition will bolster project44&#8217;s &#8220;Real-time Transportation Visibility Platform&#8221; (RTTVP), which provides information on shipments in transit across all modes and geographies, as well as precise ETAs for deliveries, with enhanced last-mile, direct-to-consumer delivery experiences. With the acquisition, project44 will have access to Convey&#8217;s global customer base, including over 200 major brands like The Home Depot, Nieman Marcus and Ferguson Enterprises.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“project44 is solving today’s most critical business challenge &#8211; how to deliver on continuously evolving customer expectations while remaining operationally efficient during unprecedented uncertainty and growing complexity,” said Jett McCandless, CEO and founder of project44, in a statement. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The stakes are high for companies to not only fulfill and ship orders but to make the right promises about availability and delivery. However, volatile conditions, overwhelming complexity and blind spots in the supply chain make this difficult to achieve.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Supply chain management is a hot topic the world over, with more customers relying on e-commerce for goods and experiencing unprecedented delays. The global supply chain management market size was valued at $15.85 billion in 2019, and it&#8217;s expected to reach $37.41 billion by 2027, according to an <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/supply-chain-management-software-market">Allied Market Research report from 2020</a>. As manufacturers around the world are still reeling from supply chain disruptions due to the pandemic, it&#8217;s not hard to see why. In a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1182233/impact-covid-19-supply-chain/">2020 survey</a>, 35% of respondents said cross-border transportation delays had an impact on their business.</p>
<p>The Convey acquisition now allows project44 to connect over 880 global shippers and third-party logistics providers with a network of 113,000 carriers, 2.6 million assets and more than 9 billion last-mile shipment events, according to the company. The outcome for clients should be optimized costs, growth in revenue, faster shipping and service and a better delivery experience overall.</p>
<p>Convey also brings the ability to resolve parcel delivery issues through its automated customer communication service, so project44 customers can spend less time dealing with customer service manually and more time focused on core business capabilities.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With thousands of shipments in-flight at any point in time and the details around those orders living in many disparate systems across our organization, it can be difficult to figure out which ones need our immediate attention,” Devin Van Hout, vice president of digital commerce at Ferguson Enterprises, said in a statement. “Convey’s solution gives our team all the information we need to go from reactive to proactive, while also providing us with the tools to communicate with all relevant parties within the same view. The result is a simple, consistent customer experience in the face of massive B2B complexity.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This is project44&#8217;s third acquisition this year, including Ocean Insights and ClearMetal. With each acquisition, project44 has been able to integrate new tech stacks in order to create a much shorter turnaround time for customers, according to the company. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.project44.com/blog/why-google-selected-project44-as-its-first-strategic-supply-chain-visibility-partner">Google chose project44</a> as its first strategic visibility partner for its Google Cloud Supply Chain Twin solution, an initiative designed to help organizations solve complex supply chain challenges.</p>
<p>With a $1.2 billion valuation status achieved earlier this year, project44 is quickly becoming one of the largest real-time logistics companies and a leader in the space.</p>
<p><em>Update: A previous version of this article stated the Convey acquisition was worth $225 million. It has been updated to reflect the accurate amount. </em></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello from day one of Disrupt. I just hopped out of watching Battlefield companies pitch &#8212; more on them below! &#8212; to write this for you. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">Disrupt</a> is looking smooth, impressive and <em>very</em> TechCrunch so far.</p>
<p>I know it’s cliche, but I’m incredibly proud of what the TechCrunch crew managed for this year’s Main Event. A big hug to the TechCrunch <strong>events team</strong>, the <strong>sales team</strong>, the <strong>tech crew</strong>, <strong>editors</strong> and <strong>everyone else</strong> that makes this publication work but that you don’t see.</p>
<p>Now, the news! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/the-iphone-13-pro-goes-to-disneyland/"><strong>Matthew takes the new iPhone to Disneyland:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If you were curious what the platonic ideal of a Matthew Panzarino post is, it’s this. <a href="https://twitter.com/panzer">Panz</a> is our editor-in-chief, one of our Apple reviewers, a photog and a Disney fan. So, he brought all of that together to get some real-world testing done on the latest flagship iPhone. Enjoy!</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/instacart-shopper-activist-group-asks-customers-to-delete-the-app-until-demands-for-better-conditions-are-met/">Gig workers protest Instacart:</a> </strong>The history of leading boycotts of gig-work platforms is spotty in terms of impact, but that isn’t stopping thousands of Instacart shoppers from raising their voices as a collective. This time ‘round the Gig Workers Collective is asking “that customers refrain from reinstalling the app until five demands are met.” Those demands include a higher default tip and changes to commissions.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/paypal-launches-its-super-app-combining-payments-savings-bill-pay-crypto-shopping-and-more/"><strong>PayPal rolls out financial “super app:”</strong></a> Super apps are like other apps, but more stuffed with features and capabilities. Perhaps best known as major players in various Asian economies’ digital realms, PayPal wants to bring the model to the United States. It’s new Super Duper Excellent App will include “direct deposit, bill pay, a digital wallet, peer-to-peer payments, shopping tools, crypto capabilities and more” TechCrunch reports.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Let’s start with a host of Battlefield companies, coming straight from pitching at Disrupt earlier today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Built by a refugee, <strong>Enlight’s</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/built-by-a-refugee-enlights-edtech-tool-bets-it-can-help-students-hope-harder/">edtech tool bets it can help students hope harder.</a></li>

<p>And then there was everything else:</p>
<ul>
<li>French marketplace startup <strong>Mirakl</strong> has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/marketplace-platform-mirakl-raises-555-million-at-3-5-billion-valuation/">landed a $555 million round at a $3.5 billion valuation</a> &#8212; a huge check for its SaaS play. Silver Lake led.</li>

<li><strong>Just</strong> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/just-insure-raises-8m/">raised $8 million to make better car insurance</a>, a model that takes lots of capital and patience.

</ul>
<h2>Seth Rogen explains how Houseplant promotes cannabis without breaking the rules</h2>
<p>Many celebrities have turned their personal interests into thriving commercial concerns: Ryan Reynolds owns Aviation Gin, Jessica Alba founded nontoxic goods startup The Honest Company, and George Clooney will earn as much as $1 billion for selling his tequila company.</p>
<p>This year, actor Seth Rogen co-founded Houseplant, which sells pottery, cannabis and related accessories.</p>
<p>“We’ve sold house goods in all 50 states at this point,” Rogen explained. “That’s us, developing a relationship and trust with customers in places where weed is not legal yet.”</p>
<p>In a conversation with Managing Editor Matt Burns at TechCrunch Disrupt, Rogen, CEO Mike Mohr and chief commercial officer Haneen Davies discussed some of the challenges of brand-building within the confines of a strict regulatory environment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the merger of House and Plant is what’s going to help us establish a brand name that goes beyond the limiting restrictions you have to abide by to communicate cannabis,&#8221; said Davies.</p>

But that isn’t stopping Facebook’s hardware team from releasing new gear.</li>

In a different life (iteration?), Yahoo was busy snapping up companies of all sorts. One such company it plunked down a mint for was Tumblr. Now Tumblr is owned by Automattic, after Verizon sold it. And then Verizon sold the rest of its media assets &#8212; TechCrunch included &#8212; to a private equity firm. Anyhoo, Tumblr’s push into the creator economy is now in open beta. Enjoy.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Smart fitness gear is often limited by being static and non-portable. (And, well, eye-wateringly expensive.) Think <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/peloton-launches-new-bike-and-tread-smart-home-gym-equipment-both-at-2495/">Peloton</a>&#8216;s stationary bike for spin classes or wall-mounted strength training rig <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/tonal-adds-live-classes-to-its-strength-training-workouts/">Tonal</a>. Great if you&#8217;re at home and can afford to shell out thousands on a fancy home gym, but what if you want to take your workout with you wherever you go?</p>
<p>Meet <a href="https://en.straffr.com">Straffr</a>, a German startup that&#8217;s exhibiting at the TechCrunch Disrupt <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/">Startup Alley</a> this week. The company sells a smart fitness band that you can just pop in your backpack and take with you when you hit the road.</p>
<p>Originally opting for a crowdfunding route via <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/straffr/meet-straffr-your-gym-and-personal-trainer-to-go">Kickstarter</a> last year, the hardware startup has gone on to sell &#8220;a few thousand&#8221; bands since getting the product to market in March this year. They&#8217;ve also bagged backing from business angels and have just closed a second seed round with an international investor as they gear up to expand their fledgling fitness business.</p>
<p>Straffr&#8217;s smart resistance band, which comes in either medium or strong strength grades, connects to the companion app using Bluetooth and starts tracking soon as you start stretching and flexing &#8212; providing feedback on your training session, not just on reps but on &#8220;quality&#8221; of exercise, per CEO Stefan Weiss.</p>
<p>The whole band is actually a sensor &#8212; made of an expandable rubber that&#8217;s electrically conductive. Straffr&#8217;s team developed the material and has some patents on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really hard to find and develop a material that stretches over 200% or 300% … and not break and not measure anything,&#8221; Weiss tells TechCrunch. &#8220;When you stretch [the Straffr fitness band] the electrical resistance changes and therefore we can say how much you&#8217;ve stretched the band for a specific exercise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anyone who&#8217;s tried to do strength training using a (non-smart) resistance band knows it can be pretty tricky to keep focused and engaged without professional guidance. Basically it&#8217;s hard to know if you&#8217;re performing the movements in an optimal way or just mindlessly twanging a piece of rubber. So a sensing element looks like it could add a lot of value to this particular bit of fitness kit.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Straffr&#8217;s smart band clocks your reps, power and velocity as you pull, with the app providing real-time feedback through the workout &#8212; offering verbal cues if you&#8217;re pulling &#8220;too fast&#8221; or nudges to keep things &#8220;slow and even.&#8221; It&#8217;ll also show you overall results of the workout if you&#8217;re a fan of fitness stats.</p>
<p>The app features a selection of workout videos which let you follow along to pre-recorded fitness band sessions, such as HIIT-focused workouts, total body strength training or quick home-office exercises.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2203676" style="width: 1316px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2203676" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2203676 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-16-at-13.04.18-e1632011078926.png" alt="Straffr is a smart resistance band that helps you exercise on the go" width="1306" height="998" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-16-at-13.04.18-e1632011078926.png 1306w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-16-at-13.04.18-e1632011078926.png?resize=150,115 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-16-at-13.04.18-e1632011078926.png?resize=300,229 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-16-at-13.04.18-e1632011078926.png?resize=768,587 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-16-at-13.04.18-e1632011078926.png?resize=680,520 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2021-09-16-at-13.04.18-e1632011078926.png?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1306px) 100vw, 1306px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2203676" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Straffr</p></div></p>
<p>Weiss says the startup is building a premium on-demand offer, too &#8212; and has recently onboarded five personal trainers so it can offer one-to-one training sessions. That will be for a future Pro feature. The basic app is free, as the startup is charging for the hardware.</p>
<p>Straffr&#8217;s band costs just over $100 (€99.99), which is very pricey if you&#8217;re comparing it to a non-smart alternative (a basic resistance band can cost just a few dollars). But that&#8217;s a fairly poor comparison, because here you&#8217;re getting a whole fitness package versus just a piece of elastic. So those extra dollars are for relevant exercise content and in-app personalization along with workout quantification and the added motivation of live feedback.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that Straffr&#8217;s smart band is considerably cheaper than shelling out for a Peloton or other high-end connected home-gym kit, which is now aiming to lighten people&#8217;s wallets by targeting their workouts.</p>
<p>So, seen from that perspective, Straffr&#8217;s spin on smart fitness kinda looks like a bargain.</p>
<p>Typical buyers so far tend to be either fitness-focused men who are very into the &#8220;quantified self&#8221; trend, per Weiss, or middle-aged women wanting an alternative to fitness classes at the gym. But a humble (but smart) fitness band really could offer something for everyone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where really we see a future of training with resistance bands is with personal trainers directly,&#8221; Weiss adds. &#8220;One-on-one digital training, on-demand, with personal trainers, with pro athletes, with Olympians that talk you through the whole workout routine, what it does, they&#8217;re training with you, it&#8217;s sweaty training, it&#8217;s motivating for people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, if resistance band workouts really aren&#8217;t your jam, Straffr does have plans to develop additional bits of a smart fitness kit. Although Weiss won&#8217;t be drawn on exactly what other connected hardware they&#8217;re cooking up.</p>
<p>&#8220;We do have a product in the pipeline now that we&#8217;re developing internally right now &#8212; and we&#8217;re really excited about it,&#8221; he says, adding: &#8220;I can say it&#8217;s not going to be just a jumping rope which counts.</p>
<p>&#8220;For us it&#8217;s always the combination of functional, really portable training with the component of tracking quality &#8212; the quality of your training. Like how good are you? Are you actually effective? Because if you&#8217;re just counting reps and steps and stuff there&#8217;s obviously a good motivational aspect to it … but we want to also see are these reps really good, are they good quality, are you doing the best you can for the condition you&#8217;re in right now?&#8221;</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">There&#8217;s a real chance you&#8217;ll need proof of a COVID-19 vaccination to enter certain venues, and Apple is hoping it can save you the hassle of digging up an email or carrying a physical card in your pocket. The company is bringing verifiable COVID-19 vaccination cards to Wallet as part of a future <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">iPhone</a> software update. The feature will take advantage of the international SMART Health Cards standard (already in use in several states) to produce proof of vaccination, sign it with a private key and create a public key to verify your info.</p>
<p>The just-released iOS 15 already lets you store verifiable vaccination and test results in the Health app using the same standard. You&#8217;ll receive your records through QR codes, downloadable files or healthcare providers who use Health Records on iPhone.</p>
<p>Apple is promising strict privacy for all your data. The company won&#8217;t have access to your imported or shared records, and all info must be encrypted and securely stored when transferred elsewhere. The tech giant also can&#8217;t see your vaccination card or how you&#8217;ve used it. You can share information with &#8220;approved&#8221; third-party apps, but only on a one-time basis.</p>
<p>Apple didn&#8217;t say when it might release the card update. This won&#8217;t thrill you if you&#8217;re anxious about the very concept of sharing your vaccination status with a concert venue or restaurant. However, it should at least streamline the process — important when you&#8217;re already running late for a show.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Brynn Putnam has stepped down as CEO of Mirror. The news <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/21/mirror-founder-brynn-putnam-to-step-down-as-ceo-lululemon-says.html">arrives via a leaked memo to staff</a> also viewed by TechCrunch that notes her exit from the top spot at the connected fitness startup she founded back in 2016. Putnam will continue on as an advisor through next July.</p>
<p>This comes a little over a year after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/lululemon-set-to-acquire-home-fitness-startup-mirror-for-500m/">fitness lifestyle brand Lululemon purchased the company</a> at the height of a pandemic-fueled shift toward home fitness.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/mirror-founder-brynn-putnam-on-life-with-lululemon-and-whether-or-not-she-sold-too-soon/">we spoke to her in November</a>, the professional ballet dancer-turned chief executive noted, “Mirror was not for sale. We were not looking for an acquirer. But it’s really your responsibility as a founder to always be weighing your vision, your responsibility to your team and your responsibility to your shareholders. And so when the opportunity presented itself — before COVID actually — it felt like really just too good an opportunity to pass up.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1836228" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1836228" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1836228" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1027978842.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="681" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1027978842.jpg 4051w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1027978842.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1027978842.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1027978842.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1027978842.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1027978842.jpg?resize=1536,1022 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1027978842.jpg?resize=2048,1363 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-1027978842.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1836228" class="wp-caption-text">SAN FRANCISCO, CA &#8211; SEPTEMBER 06: Mirror Founder and CEO Brynn Putnam (L) and moderator Lucas Matney speak onstage during Day 2 of TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2018 at Moscone Center on September 6, 2018 in San Francisco, California.

<p>In her stead, a trio of Mirror executives &#8212; Tess Hales, Olivia Lange and Kristie D’Ambrosio-Correll &#8212; will serve as co-heads of the brand, reporting to Lululemon CEO Calvin McDonald, as the company searches for a replacement for Putnam.</p>
<p>In quarterly earnings posted earlier this year, Lululemon forecasted up to $700 million in revenue by 2023, for the brand it purchased for $500 million last year. The figure is based on a potential 600,000 subscribers &#8212; though Mirror&#8217;s parent doesn&#8217;t break out specific hardware figures. COVID-19 has been a major driver for the category at large, while questions remain as to how much of that spending will regress as gyms around the country reopen.</p>
<p>Lululemon currently offers Mirror in 150 of its retail locations, with plans to expand to another 50 by end of year &#8212; the retail footprint is a clear bid to compete with Peloton&#8217;s successful storefront model. The company is also eyeing expansion into Canada.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;ve all been there &#8212; you&#8217;re watching a horror movie, and you know that the main character definitely shouldn&#8217;t go into that creepy house, but no matter how much you yell at your TV, you can&#8217;t change his fate. But what if you told the guy on screen to steer clear of the house, and he actually listened?</p>
<p>This could become possible with the latest venture from entertainment entrepreneur Devo Harris, a Grammy winner and longtime business collaborator of artists like Kanye West and John Legend.</p>
<p>After launching in beta in August 2020, <a href="https://adventr.io/">Adventr</a> created a user-friendly interface where anyone can drag and drop elements to make interactive videos. Thousands of users have built interactive experiences, from space-themed children&#8217;s education modules to promotional videos for luxury fashion clients like Marc Jacobs and LVMH.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.adventr.io/index.html?link=https%3A%2F%2Fd252srr1zuysk4.cloudfront.net%2Fclients%2F7%2F186%2Fpublished%2F7-marc-jacobs-v3-27475913.data" width="960px" height="540px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>But at TechCrunch Disrupt, where Adventr is one of 20 startups competing in Disrupt&#8217;s Startup Battlefield, founder and CEO Harris unveiled an element of the product that will set Adventr apart: a patented voice-control technology that lets users dictate the course of a video.</p>
<p>Specifically, the patent is on the technology that uses voice recognition to change the course of a video in the middle of a stream. It can also connect to other databases and applications to look up answers and respond to questions in real time.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not about &#8216;turn up the volume,&#8217; this is about, &#8216;don&#8217;t go into that room,'&#8221; Harris told TechCrunch. &#8220;If I can talk to my TV, if I can talk to my phone, why can&#8217;t I talk to my video? Our technology allows these videos to use your microphone to understand and respond in real time to what that viewer wants. The vast majority of the internet is video, so we&#8217;re enabling video to perform like the rest of these smart devices.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2201501" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2201501" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2201501" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adventr-Editor-Canvas.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="406" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adventr-Editor-Canvas.png 2480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adventr-Editor-Canvas.png?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adventr-Editor-Canvas.png?resize=300,179 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adventr-Editor-Canvas.png?resize=768,458 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adventr-Editor-Canvas.png?resize=680,406 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adventr-Editor-Canvas.png?resize=1536,917 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adventr-Editor-Canvas.png?resize=2048,1222 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adventr-Editor-Canvas.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2201501" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adventr</p></div></p>
<p>Though Harris emphasizes that he and his team &#8212; which is currently just five strong &#8212; are creatives first, he thinks that Adventr has exciting applications in e-commerce. He references a scene in the 2002 movie &#8220;Minority Report,&#8221; where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlX_F1VKIdo">Tom Cruise encounters a hologram</a> at the GAP that asks him about his personalized shopping experience.</p>
<p>In an example video of how the voice-control technology works, a shopper goes to Target to find a pajama set. As the viewer, you can use voice commands like &#8220;show me the green one&#8221; or &#8220;find a size large&#8221; to determine what item to purchase. If you decide to buy the pajama set, you&#8217;ll be taken to Target&#8217;s website, where you can manually make the purchase, but Harris hopes that down the road, the entire experience will be completely native to Adventr.</p>
<p>Currently, Adventr&#8217;s tools are available on a subscription basis, but a free plan lets users experiment with the product before they pay for a pro ($29 per month) or business ($99 per month) plan. Adventr isn&#8217;t necessarily an e-commerce, or education, or entertainment platform &#8212; it&#8217;s a tool with a variety of applications that businesses and artists alike can use.</p>
<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:15107,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;4&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:16750848},&quot;11&quot;:4,&quot;12&quot;:0,&quot;14&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:0},&quot;15&quot;:&quot;Open Sans&quot;,&quot;16&quot;:11}"> <div embedded-video-placeholder="614a54e98d2a440b0abd41f6" post-id="2206236"></div> </span></p>
<p>&#8220;Think of Adventr as a video-based API, like Twilio meets Vimeo,&#8221; Harris said. &#8220;Essentially, what our users will be able to do is to put in phrases or keywords that would trigger certain video clips to play.&#8221;</p>
<p>Adventr launched with a $1 million seed round, but hasn&#8217;t yet announced further financing. But the startup is already selling its product to subscribers, offering it an income stream at an early stage. Though Harris did not disclose specific financials, he said that without spending on customer acquisition, Adventr&#8217;s revenue has increased 80x from the beginning of 2021 until now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If your house has a wooden deck, keeping it in good shape is costly and time consuming. If you don&#8217;t keep up with the regular maintenance, it becomes even <em>more</em> costly and time consuming to fix — or, eventually, it all just starts to rot and fall apart. We&#8217;ve got robots that can clean our floors and mow our lawns. There&#8217;s got to be a robot for deck maintenance, right?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what Gal Frenkel thought, too. After spending weeks hunting for something that could help keep his deck in check, he decided to build it himself. Thus, <a href="https://www.robo-deck.com/">RoboDeck</a>!</p>
<p>RoboDeck is one of 20 companies competing in this week&#8217;s TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield competition, one of which will go home with $100,000 and the coveted Disrupt cup.</p>
<p>The quickest way to capture what RoboDeck is building might be to just say &#8220;Roomba, but for resealing your deck&#8221; — but Frenkel tells me that barely scratches the surface of what they&#8217;ve had to figure out.</p>
<p>Because they&#8217;re laying down a sealant, they&#8217;ve had to come up with solutions to be ultra precise and consistent about how they&#8217;re spraying and applying — and because every deck is different, they&#8217;ve had to come up with their own mapping/routing tech to make sure they can cover an entire deck without rolling right through a section that just got sealed. Like a robot vacuum, it needs to know where the edges and drops are and avoid them accordingly … but it also needs to be smart enough that it doesn&#8217;t think every little gap between boards is actually the beginning of a step. They&#8217;ve also formulated their own sealant to allow for more coverage with less product and built custom spray nozzles that fit their needs while keeping costs low.</p>
<p> <div embedded-video-placeholder="614a4eaf8d2a440b0abd28eb" post-id="2206213"></div> </p>
<p>Frenkel tells me that RoboDeck is meant to be sold as a subscription. Instead of buying the bot outright, you pay them a regular fee for the bot and a steady supply of stain cartridges. The cost varies based on how much stain you need, which is determined by the size of your deck, weather patterns in your area (you won&#8217;t run the bot when your deck is covered in snow, for example) and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>He also tells me that this prototype can currently maintain a deck of up to 500 square feet on one cartridge/charge. For decks larger than that, they&#8217;re working on a docking station that will recharge the bot and automatically refill a staining cartridge up to three times.</p>
<p>One thing to note: RoboDeck can&#8217;t take a beat-up/weathered deck and make it new again. It&#8217;s meant to be used to keep a new deck looking good or to maintain an existing deck after a pro does their thing. As such, the spray used here is transparent; it won&#8217;t darken or otherwise change the color of your deck, instead maintaining the clear protective coat on the wood over time. RoboDeck estimates that running its robot will cost 50% less than calling in a pro for annual maintenance.</p>
<p>Frenkel tells me that their product is currently in the late prototype stages, and that the company has raised $500,000 primarily from SOSV&#8217;s HAX.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 is underway! Tickets are still available for the three-day virtual event, which encompasses everything from Ryan Reynolds' lessons on "fast-vertising" to Startup Battlefield.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Yesterday, Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski admitted to a reporter that this didn&#8217;t feel like the right moment to take his buy now, pay later company public.</p>
<p>“I think it would be nice to IPO when it’s a little bit more sound,&#8221; he told CNBC’s Karen Tso. &#8220;And right now, it doesn’t feel really sound out there.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/21/really-this-market-isnt-good-enough/">This caught Alex Wilhelm by surprise</a>. In his view, &#8220;the public market for BNPL companies actually feels pretty damn strong at the moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell, at one-third of Affirm’s present-day GMV run-rate multiple, Klarna is worth around $80 billion. That’s much more than the sub-$50 billion valuation the company secured earlier this year,&#8221; Alex writes.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, what’s driving Klarna to be afraid of going public?&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2021</a> is underway!</p>
<p>Tickets are still available for the three-day virtual event, which encompasses everything from Ryan Reynolds&#8217; lessons on &#8220;fast-vertising&#8221; to Startup Battlefield, where early-stage companies will compete for a chance to win a slice of equity-free funding.</p>
<p>And, if you&#8217;re free tomorrow at 9:05 a.m. PT, I&#8217;m moderating &#8220;The Path for Underrepresented Entrepreneurs,&#8221; a discussion with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hana Mohan, founder &amp; CEO, MagicBell</li>
<li>Leslie Feinzaig, founder &amp; CEO, Female Founders Alliance</li>
<li>Stephen Bailey, co-founder &amp; CEO, ExecOnline</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you&#8217;ll join the conversation! Have a fantastic week, and thanks very much for reading.</p>

<p>Zoom’s pandemic-induced growth was so explosive, the company’s name is now a verb.</p>
<p>Last quarter, the company&#8217;s revenue grew 54%, a sharp drop-off from 191% in its previous quarterly earnings report.</p>
<p>Now, “Zoom has recognized that it must expand into other areas,” writes Ron Miller, who interviewed Gartner analyst Mike Fasciani and Oded Gal, Zoom’s chief product officer, about what’s ahead for the platform.</p>

<p>After taking a hiatus from covering SaaS multiples, Alex Wilhelm took a closer look at software revenue and noted that &#8220;the upward charge has plateaued&#8221; in recent months.</p>
<p>Last year, these companies were racing up the charts.</p>
<p>Today, &#8220;we’re seeing the value of low, mid and high-multiples SaaS companies each find a comfortable trading range after a bull run since early 2016, albeit one with caveats,&#8221; he writes.</p>

<p>Warby Parker&#8217;s brick-and-mortar revenue now exceeds its online sales, PipeCandy co-founder Ashwin Ramasamy notes, while Allbirds, though opening stores, still talks about its digitally native status in the present tense.</p>
<p>&#8220;If a company’s customer acquisition, fulfillment and retention need a physical presence, no matter what percentage of revenue comes from digital channels, it is a DTC company (beyond digital channels),&#8221; says Ramasamy.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if a company’s customer acquisition, fulfillment and retention can happen without a physical presence, it is a DNVB (digitally native vertical brand).&#8221;</p>

<p>Boston-based software-and-fintech firm Toast raised its IPO price range on Monday, ticking up to $34 to $36 per share from a previous range of $30 to $33.</p>
<p>“The so-called ‘vertical SaaS’ model, in which startups build software tailored to one particular industry or another, has become a somewhat two-part business effort; many startups today are pursuing both the sale of software along with fintech revenues,” Alex Wilhelm writes.</p>
<p>“Toast’s IPO, then, could operate as a bellwether of sorts for a host of startups.&#8221;</p>

<p>Last Friday, Alex Wilhelm delved into GitLab’s IPO filing and took a detailed look at the DevOps firm’s revenue and valuation.</p>
<p>“GitLab [could] be worth $10.46 billion. Which is more than $6.0 billion, so we can see a path for the company to surpass its final private-market valuation,” Alex writes.</p>
<p>“However, we are not saying that the company is worth 11 figures. Investors may decide that the pace of its losses make it less valuable than some of its peers, or that its growth rate is decelerating too quickly to receive a market-leading multiple.”</p>

<p>Given edtech&#8217;s explosive growth over the last two years, expectations are higher than ever for founders.</p>
<p>Rhys Spence, head of research at European edtech-focused fund Brighteye Ventures, says many companies in the space are leaning into international expansion to drive growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going international later in the journey or when more funding is available, possibly due to a VC round, seems to make facets of expansion more feasible,&#8221; he writes in a guest post.</p>
<p>Analyzing responses from 57 early-stage edtech startups, Spence examined their marketing strategies, listed founders&#8217; top priorities and identified &#8220;gateway&#8221; markets where these companies hope to make inroads.</p>

<p>For The Exchange, Alex Wilhelm listed which funds will rake in major coin when the developer toolkit firm goes public:</p>
<ul>
<li>August Capital: 14,931,200 Class B shares, or 11.1% of that equity class.</li>
<li>GV: 8,888,776 Class B shares, or 6.6% of that equity class.</li>
<li>ICONIQ: 15,472,204 Class B shares, or 11.6% of that equity class.</li>
<li>ICONIQ: 1,150,784 Class A shares, or 100% of that equity class (to be diluted in IPO).</li>
<li>Khosla: 19,028,320 Class B shares, or 14.1% of that equity class.</li>
</ul>
<p>“Given that GitLab was valued at $6 billion earlier this year in a secondary transaction, the percentages above convert to huge sums,” he writes.</p>

<p>Software-as-a-service platform Freshworks raised its expected IPO price range this week. It&#8217;s now planning a per-share range between $32 and $34, a significant bump from $28 to $32.</p>
<p>&#8220;That would put Freshworks in the same tier of public SaaS companies as UiPath and Okta, heady company given their historically rich valuations,&#8221; writes Alex Wilhelm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Freshworks, then, is set to go public at a valuation that it must find attractive.&#8221;</p>

<p>Demand Curve’s Nick Costelloe unpacks the importance of leveraging social proof to grow your startup.</p>
<p>“When people are uncertain, they look to others for behavioral guidance,” he writes. “This is called social proof, which is a physiological effect that influences your decisions every day, whether you know it or not.”</p>
<p>Costelloe&#8217;s research determined that marketers were able to boost conversion rates as much as 400% by leveraging social proof.</p>

<p>In an excerpt from “AI 2041: Ten Visions For Our Future,” author Kai-Fu Lee makes the case that recent advances in artificial intelligence are starting to transform healthcare.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that AI is as good as humans when it comes to diagnosing disease, but the pandemic has accelerated the digitization of patient records and data.</p>
<p>“Over the coming decades, we can expect medical diagnosis to evolve from an AI tool that provides analysis of options to an AI assistant that recommends treatments,” writes Lee.</p>
<p>Lee identifies several areas where AI will improve outcomes in drug discovery, complex surgeries and monitoring, but also looks at potential concerns, such as legal liabilities.</p>
<p>“AI healthcare is not just a market — it represents a tidal wave of transformations that will change the entire industry.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Traditional meat production is about as far from a sustainable process as we&#8217;ve got, but our chances of getting everyone to give up &#8220;real&#8221; meat are lean. Animal Alternative is one of several companies looking to make meat indistinguishable from the animal-based kind using bioreactors and cultured cells, and it aims to empower local producers to do so with a customizable process powered by data and AI.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.animalalternativetechnologies.com/">Animal Alternative</a>, which presented today at TechCrunch Disrupt Startup Battlefield, is the brainchild of two Cambridge grads who repeatedly encountered each other during their studies in biotech there. Clarisse Beurrier and Yash Mishra found that they shared a conviction that meat production desperately needs a reboot, and their skills complemented each other as well. They decided to start a company to pursue a new, data-heavy approach that could make cultured meat production as much a software problem as a hardware one.</p>
<p>Cell-cultured meat, in case you&#8217;re not familiar, is where cells derived from animal tissue are grown in an artificial environment until they are numerous enough to be considered what might generally be considered &#8220;a piece of meat.&#8221; But you can&#8217;t just shave some beef off into a nutrient tank and hope it grows into a 12-ounce ribeye — recreating tissue the way it grows in nature is remarkably difficult. Animal Alternative believes data is the answer.</p>
<p>Mishra hails from a lab that was doing bioelectric monitoring of cells and tissues for research and medical purposes, and it occurred to him and Beurrier that the same technique could be applied to meat production.</p>

<p>&#8220;We created these bioreactors, smaller than my thumb, that let us use minimal resources and get lots of information, so we can find the best process for making meat in a sustainable way,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Monitoring cells for any reason is a complex proposal, often involving slow and outdated techniques like stains and collecting samples to test elsewhere. Beurrier explained that their innovation is in both improved real-time cell-monitoring tech and the instant feedback it enables to guide the whole process of cell growth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything has to work together. If, for example, our clients want to make a piece of lamb, there are all these parameters. It&#8217;s a very dynamic process,&#8221; she said. Although they were wary of revealing too much about the patent-pending bioreactor, the two explained that it provides powerful monitoring and AI-powered feedback.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of parameters, such as nutrients, flow rates, pH, temperature, etc., have a major impact on the taste, texture and quality of meat produced. Our proprietary bioelectronic analytics give us unprecedented insights into these,&#8221; Mishra explained. &#8220;Our revolutionary platform also includes AI-driven software that uses all the data we have to help us reduce costs and improve efficiency. This has already reduced costs and energy requirements by over 92% compared to where we started.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just like testing a field-based crop to see if it needs more water or nitrogen, cultured cells have to be monitored in real time to make sure they&#8217;re developing in line with expectations. Beyond just maintaining the growth and health of the tissue, this can be used to differentiate it proactively, producing fat or vascular tissue where it would likely be in a real cut of meat. The plan is to build a one-of-a-kind database for cultured meat, from which can be trained or deployed numerous AI agents that specialize in lamb, pork, or even different breeds like Wagyu or Angus beef.</p>
<p> <div embedded-video-placeholder="614a4c4e8d2a440b0abd2010" post-id="2206211"></div> </p>
<p>All this is being demonstrated right now at a small scale, but the team has planned for scaling up by going from large to small rather than vice versa. &#8220;The design for the bioreactor is for the large scale, and the microscale system has been deliberately designed and purposely built to be a model of that system, recreating it down to a molecular scale with microfluidics and bioelectronic monitoring,&#8221; Mishra said.</p>
<p>In other words, if they can do it at the bench-top scale they&#8217;re currently prototyping in, they should be able to do it at a much greater scale. And it&#8217;s the larger bioreactors, which they call Renaissance Farm, that they plan to make available to meat producers as a more or less turnkey process.</p>
<p>Meat is a global industry, but not all countries and regions have the space, resources or infrastructure to support it. Yet every country consumes it — which means many must import meat at great cost and expense. What if a country rich in minerals or oil but not in pasture could produce its own meat with its own resources? That&#8217;s what Animal Alternative wants to enable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to provide a viable alternative to the largest commercial factory farms,&#8221; said Beurrier. By their estimates, a 1,000-liter bioreactor should be able to make a million kilograms of meat per year for about the price of traditional farming, at only 5% of the land, water and emissions cost.</p>
<p>Animal Alternative would provide the hardware, and customers would need to buy new supplies of stem cells (which are taken without harming live animals, they noted) on a regular basis. The main costs at the production facility would be raw materials in the form of liquid growth media and growth hormones, both sourced from non-animal sources. Revenue sharing for sold product would be the main revenue source.</p>
<p>The decision not to fund its own network of factories and make their own product came down to the scale of the problem.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t do this on our own,&#8221; said Mishra. &#8220;This is a huge challenge to take on — we&#8217;re ambitious, but we have to work with the other great companies in the ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Partnering with the food industry giants in positions to supercharge this process is the natural way forward if they want to achieve their goal of decarbonizing and democratizing meat production as fast as possible. Once there&#8217;s a commercial-scale process for creating cultured meat, it should sell itself as a sustainable way to get a product indistinguishable from the original.</p>
<p>Just how indistinguishable? We&#8217;ll know for sure after their first tasting coming up soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">LaVonda Brown developed an interest in eye-tracking during her time at Georgia Tech. The fascination with all the information that can be derived by scanning the so-called &#8220;windows to the soul&#8221; formed the foundation of <a href="https://www.eyegage.com/">EyeGage</a>, one of the 20 companies competing at this year’s Disrupt Startup Battlefield.</p>
<p>The startup’s entry into the TechCrunch competition arrives as EyeGage launches its first product: an app designed to let users know if they’re sober enough to drive. If not, they’ll get a big red “Do Not Drive” warning and a link to call either an Uber or Lyft. The application is free and serves a dual purpose. In addition to the obvious consumer-facing purposes, it doubles as an opt-in for EyeGage’s growing dataset of eyes.</p>
<p>“Consumers can download the app, take pictures of their eyes and then we can suggest whether or not they should use ride-share. Essentially not driving, based on their eyes,” explains Brown. “That is free. I like to call it a barter subscription service. They give us pictures and videos of their eyes and we give them access to the technology so they can make a responsible decision.”</p>
<p>The app is the most forward-facing aspect of EyeGage’s business at the moment — and like most of what the company does, it will go toward building out its dataset of eyes. The company will start with measuring the impact of alcohol on various aspects of the eyes, including studies it’s currently conducting with participants in a federally approved testing facility. Those who sign forms to participate will drink booze, while the company collects images and videos of their eyes, along with a blood sample.</p>
<p>Marijuana is next on the list, given its current legal status in certain states. Other drugs like opioids, amphetamines and benzodiazepines will be more difficult to gather, though hospitals and clinics that mete out legal versions of these substances could prove a good source for collecting that data — with the proper consent.</p>
<p> <div embedded-video-placeholder="614a4c488d2a440b0abd1ffc" post-id="2206201"></div> </p>
<p>Brown says workplace environments are a logical next step, as well. Law enforcement is also on the list, though there are various hurdles to attaining those sorts of partnerships. “We’re targeting high-risk workplaces like construction, manufacturing and transportation. In those industries in particular they have a high rate of drug and alcohol use,” she tells TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There may also be a potential use for the company’s dataset beyond its immediate use for detecting substances in the body.</p>
<p>“Monitoring eye behavior can be used for so many domains,” Brown adds. “And, of course, you can identify someone by their eyes. It can be used to diagnose certain illnesses, concussions or diabetes, and it can be used in different market segments. Your eyes are so informative about what’s going on in your body. They can tell if you’ve had caffeine, depending on how it responds to light. If it’s too fast, it’s some kind of stimulant. If it’s too slow, it’s some kind of depressant.”</p>
<p>EyeGage has raised $142,455 to date. That includes $42,455 in pre-seed from friends and family, as well as a recent award of $100,000 from Google Black Founders Fund.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://verdiag.com/">Verdi</a>, which launched today at TechCrunch&#8217;s Startup Battlefield, refers to its smart valve clusters as “swarms.” The term denotes the kind of high-density implementation the company is looking to roll out in farms across North America. Retrofitted with existing irrigation technology, the aim of its system is to give farmers more control over the irrigation they send to their crops.</p>
<p>The system utilizes third-party data collected by satellites (and, in the future, drones) to determine which parts of a specific crop aren’t receiving enough water. The system breaks the crops up into small zones and utilizes machine learning to help the proper amount of water to get to where it needs to be.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2203939,2203940,2203941,2203942,2203938"]</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of variations in the way that plants grow, and that&#8217;s due to variations in soil and climate, which can happen over just a few meters in a field,” co-founder and CEO Arthur Chen tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>“Their existing infrastructure really only allows them to do these one-size-fits-all treatments, treating every plant in the same way, even though they all have unique growing requirements. What we&#8217;re trying to do here is to give farmers the ability to customize water and, say, fertilizer application for individual groups of plants, or even single plants in a field.”</p>
<p>The company started life in 2019 as a spinout of the University of British Columbia. Fittingly, most of their original tech has been rolled out locally in B.C., owing in part to COVID-19-related travel restrictions.</p>
<p>For now, installing the system requires a representative to be in attendance, so Verdi has kept much of its trials in its own province, since rolling out in early January. There are, however, systems being piloted in California and Washington State, as well.</p>
<p> <div embedded-video-placeholder="614a49b237969837d310ae4f" post-id="2206198"></div> </p>
<p>Per its numbers, the system is capable of reducing irrigation costs by up to 80% and offering up to 10 times more precision than more traditional methods. The company’s primary pitch to farmers is more accurate irrigation, though the company would do well to lean on the potential water reduction while pitching to potential investors, who are almost certainly looking for more green companies for their portfolio. Certainly drought-plagued California could do well to look at more potential water-saving solutions.</p>
<p>To date, the team of four full-time employees has raised $1.08 million in pre-seed funding, courtesy of Startup Haven, Rarebreed Ventures and Alchemist Accelerator.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">ViacomCBS announced a new <a href="https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbscidmt=showtimebundle&amp;ftag=PPM-00-10ahd6f">streaming bundle</a> today for U.S. subscribers, offering access to both Paramount+ and Showtime. If you subscribe to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/paramount-will-launch-a-4-99-monthly-ad-supported-subscription/">ad-supported Paramount+ Essential</a> plan, the bundle will cost $9.99 per month. But if you don&#8217;t want to watch ads when you&#8217;re laser-focused on the &#8220;iCarly&#8221; reboot (yes, that <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2021-06-17/new-icarly-reboot-paramount-plus-miranda-cosgrove-explained">exists</a>), you can pay $12.99 per month to bundle Showtime with Paramount+ Premium. The Premium plan also includes support for 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, mobile downloads and livestreams of local CBS affiliates in 200 U.S. markets.</p>
<p>This deal will run through October 20, a representative from the company told TechCrunch, and those who subscribe with this discounted pricing will be locked in at that price even after the deal expires. Each bundle will cost about 38% less than if you were to subscribe to Paramount+ and Showtime separately. Showtime alone costs $10.99 per month, so the bundle could motivate Showtime subscribers to check out the newer Paramount+, which includes shows like &#8220;RuPaul&#8217;s Drag Race,&#8221; which <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/rupaul-emmy-record-most-wins-black-performer-1235015916/">broke records</a> at the Emmy&#8217;s this week, &#8220;Star Trek: The Original Series&#8221; and &#8220;The Good Fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Parent company ViacomCBS added 6.5 million global streaming subscribers across its various services in Q2, bringing the conglomerate to over <a href="https://ir.viacomcbs.com/news-releases/news-release-details/viacomcbs-reports-q2-2021-earnings-results">42 million</a> subscribers total. The company said that Paramount+ helped fuel its 82% year-over-year growth in streaming revenue.

<p>In August 2020, Apple TV+ launched a similar bundle, offering CBS All Access Ad-Free and Showtime for just $9.99 a month on top of Apple TV+&#8217;s $4.99 monthly fee. After the rebrand to Paramount+, existing Apple TV+ subscribers were allowed to keep their plan, but a payment processing issue in July of this year <a href="https://thestreamable.com/news/paramount-plus-showtime-9-99-bundle-on-apple-tv-plus-isnt-going-away-just-a-technical-glitch-for-subscribers">led customers to worry</a> that the deal had expired. Meanwhile, Paramount+ subscribers were previously able to subscribe to Showtime at a $3 discount. But today&#8217;s announcement offers an even better deal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The consequences are mounting for gaming giant Activision Blizzard after the company became the subject of a landmark state investigation into discriminatory workplace practices and sexual harassment this summer.</p>
<p>Now, Activision Blizzard confirms that it is the subject of a federal investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/app-annie-and-co-founder-charged-with-securities-fraud-will-pay-10m-settlement/">ramping up enforcement efforts against tech companies</a> in recent months.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-is-investigating-activision-blizzard-over-workplace-practices-disclosures-11632165080">The Wall Street Journal</a> reported Monday that the SEC has subpoenaed Activision Blizzard and a number of the company&#8217;s key executives, including CEO Bobby Kotick. Activision Blizzard confirmed the SEC investigation Tuesday in a <a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-provides-update-workplace-initiatives">statement to investors,</a> noting that it &#8220;continues to productively engage with regulators&#8221; including the SEC, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the National Labor Relations Board and the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing.</p>
<p>The SEC requested documents from the company, including &#8220;minutes from Activision board meetings since 2019, personnel files of six former employees and separation agreements the company has reached this year with staffers,&#8221; according to the WSJ. The paper also reported that the agency is seeking any records between Kotick and other executives discussing sexual harassment and discrimination allegations at the company.</p>
<p>The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/07/22/california-activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexism/">sued Activision Blizzard in July</a> over allegations that it created a hostile &#8220;frat house&#8221; environment in which gender-based harassment and discrimination were routine.</p>
<p>Following an inflammatory response from the company&#8217;s leaders, who dismissed the lawsuit as the actions of &#8220;unaccountable state bureaucrats,&#8221; a group of employees <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/blizzard-walkout-activision-lawsuit/">staged a high-profile walkout</a>. The protest attracted solidarity from many corners of the gaming world and drew more attention to the workplace environment in whuch many Blizzard workers allegedly suffered for years.</p>
<p>Activision Blizzard publishes some of the biggest titles in gaming, including the Call of Duty franchise, World of Warcraft, Overwatch and Starcraft. The flurry of regulatory interest in allegations of a toxic, hostile work environment at the company could have far-reaching implications for workplace culture not just at Activision Blizzard, but for the gaming industry at large.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After the state lawsuit became public, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack">former president of Blizzard Entertainment, J.
