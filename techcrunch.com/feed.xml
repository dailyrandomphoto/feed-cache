										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Activist investor <a href="https://www.starboardvalue.com/">Starboard Value</a> is clearly. fed up with Box and it let the cloud content management know it in no uncertain terms in a <a href="https://www.starboardvalue.com/wp-content/uploads/Starboard_Value_LP_Letter_to_Box_Stockholders_05.03.2021.pdf">letter published yesterday</a>. The firm, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/03/starboard-value-takes-7-5-stake-in-box/">bought a 7.7% stake in Box</a> two years ago claims the company is underperforming, executing poorly and making bad business decisions &#8212; and it wants to inject the board of directors with new blood.</p>
<p>While they couched the letter in mostly polite language, it&#8217;s quite clear Starboard is exasperated with Box. &#8220;While we appreciate the dialogue we have had with Box&#8217;s management team and Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) over the past two years, we have grown increasingly frustrated with continued poor results, questionable capital allocation decisions, and subpar shareholder returns,&#8221; Starboard wrote in its letter.</p>
<p>Box as you can imagine did not take kindly to the shot across its bow and <a href="https://www.boxinvestorrelations.com/news-and-media/news/press-release-details/2021/Box-Responds-to-Starboard-Value-and-Reiterates-the-Boards-Unified-Commitment-to-Stockholder-Value-Creation/default.aspx">responded in a press release</a> that it has bent over backwards to accommodate Starboard including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/23/activist-investor-starboard-value-taking-three-box-board-seats-as-involvement-deepens/">refreshing the board last year</a> when they added several numbers, whom they point out were approved by Starboard.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Box has a diverse and independent Board with directors who bring extensive technology experience across enterprise and consumer markets, enterprise IT, and global go-to-market strategy, as well as deep financial acumen and proven track records of helping public companies drive disciplined growth, profitability, and stockholder value. Furthermore, seven of the ten directors on the Box Board will have joined the Board within the last three years,&#8221; the company wrote in a statement. In other words, Box is saying it already has injected the new blood that Starboard claims it wants.</p>
<p>Box recently got <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/kkr-hands-box-a-500m-lifeline/">a $500 million cash injection from KKR</a> widely believed to be an attempt to bulk up cash reserves with the goal generating growth via acquisition. Starboard was particularly taken aback by this move, however. &#8220;The only viable explanation for this financing is a shameless and utterly transparent attempt to &#8220;buy the vote&#8221; and shows complete disregard for proper corporate governance and fiscal discipline,&#8221; Starboard wrote.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="xB8uJCCrzS"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/kkr-hands-box-a-500m-lifeline/">KKR hands Box a $500M lifeline</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Alan Pelz-Sharpe, founder and principal analyst at Deep Analysis, a firm that closely tracks the content management market, says the two sides clearly aren&#8217;t aligned and that&#8217;s not likely to change. &#8220;Starboard targeted and gained a seat on the board at Box at a difficult time for the firm, thats the modus operandi for activist investors. Since that time there has clearly been a lot of improvements in terms of Box’s financial goals. However, there is and will remain a misalignment between Starboard&#8217;s goals, and Box led by Levie as a whole. Though both would like to see the share price rise, Starboard&#8217;s end goal is most likely to see Box acquired, sooner rather than later, and that is not Box&#8217;s goal,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Starboard believes the only way to resolve this situation is to inject the board with still more new blood, taking a swipe at the Box leadership team while it was at it. &#8220;There is no good reason that Box should be unable to deliver improved growth and profitability, at least in-line with better performing software companies, which, in turn, would create significant shareholder value,&#8221; Starboard wrote.</p>
<p>As such the firm indicated it would be putting up its own slate of board candidates at the company&#8217;s next board meeting. In the tit for tat that has been this exchange, Box indicated it would be doing the same.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Box vigorously defended its results. &#8220;In the past year, under the oversight of the Operating Committee, the company has made substantial progress across all facets of the business &#8212; strategic, operational and financial &#8212; as demonstrated by the strong results reported for the full year of fiscal 2021,&#8221; the company wrote, pointing to its revenue growth last fiscal year as proof of the progress with revenue of $771 million up 11% year over year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear how this standoff will play out, but clearly Starboard wants to take over the Board and have its way with Box, believing that it can perform better if it were in charge. That could result ultimately, as Pelz-Sharpe suggested, in Box being acquired.</p>
<p>We would appear to heading for a showdown, and when it&#8217;s over, Box could be a very different company, or the current leadership could assert control once and for all and we could proceed with Box&#8217;s current growth strategy still in place. Time will tell which is the case.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As cybersecurity continues to grow in profile amid an increasingly complex and dangerous landscape of malicious activity, a cyber security vendor that specializes in &#8220;all-in-one&#8221; services covering the many aspects of security IT has closed a big round of funding to grow.</p>
<p>Acronis has raised $250 million in equity, and co-founder and CEO Serguei Beloussov said in an interview the company plans to use the financing both to grow organically, as well as for acquisitions to bring more &#8220;proactive&#8221; technology into its portfolio. The funding is being led by CVC and values Acronis at over $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>Originally a spinoff from the parent company of virtualization giant Parallels, Acronis initially made its name in data recovery and backup but has over time, and to better differentiate itself from competitors like Commvault, Veeam and Barracuda (among others), it has expanded to provide an all-in-one package of services to include continuous data protection, patch management, anti-malware protection and more.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Integrating with a range of popular enterprise <a href="https://solutions.acronis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">software packages and platforms</a> and service providers, its business is now profitable, with some 10,000 managed service providers and 500,000 businesses (SMBs and bigger) among its customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn’t need the money, but now we will invest it to grow faster and capitalise on our leadership,&#8221; Beloussov said in an interview.</p>
<p>New-wave revenues, based on its newer (not legacy) products such as Acronis Cyber Protect, grew 100% during the pandemic, he added. &#8220;We are s<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">pending they money on engineers and M&amp;A to complement our cyber protection,&#8221; he said. &#8220;</span>We have a single mission, which is to protect all data applications, providing privacy and security in one package. We protect about 10 million workloads today and we are aiming to grow that to 100x. There is a lot to do in terms of making that protection easier and deeper for our customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that while the company is continuing to remain private, it&#8217;s also starting to think about its next steps, which could involve a public listing or a sale, in the next 12-24 months.</p>
<p>&#8220;With private equity investors like Goldman Sachs [which led its previous round in 2019] and CVC, they definitely expect liquidity at some point,&#8221; Beloussov said.</p>
<p>The funding and Acronis&#8217;s strategy to double down on growing its business comes at a key moment in the world of cybersecurity. The bigger landscape in the world of business has seen a huge shift in the last year to more people working remotely and across a wider set of geographies and devices. Although that shift was pushed along by the Covid-19 pandemic, many believe that the longer-term effect will be a very different working environment, with a greater acceptance that less people in will be spending all of their time in their offices, and that it won&#8217;t necessarily impact productivity.</p>
<p>What it has impacted is how IT provisions and manages networks and the device that run on them, and specifically has exposed some of the loopholes in company&#8217;s cybersecurity policies. Malicious hackers, who were hard at work well before the pandemic, have jumped on this and exploited it.</p>
<p>Acronis has been one of the companies that has seen a growing demand for its services as a result of all that, with   Acronis&#8217;s software sold via managed service providers seeing a particular lift.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;Last year definitely pushed customers to understand that IT is mission critical and that is for every business,&#8221; Beloussov said, with security coming along with that by association. With security, though, organizations have realized that &#8220;managing by in-house resources is not always ideal so outsourcing to special service providers can guarantee service levels. With internal IT people, you can only shout at them, and that is okay because they are used to it.&#8221; Third parties, by contrast, operate with service-level agreements that are easier to enforce if something goes wrong.</p>
<p class="p1">“Acronis’ talented management and R&amp;D teams have invested significant resources developing an innovative cloud-native ‘MSP in a box’ solution, with integrated backup, disaster recovery, cybersecurity, remote management, and workflow tools,” said Leif Lindbäck, Senior Managing Director of CVC Capital Partners. “Acronis provides mission-critical solutions to more than 10,000 MSPs and half a million small and medium businesses. CVC has a strong track record in cybersecurity and partnering up with successful entrepreneurs, and we are looking forward to teaming up with Serguei Beloussov and the Acronis team to accelerate the company’s growth.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian telecom ministry on Tuesday said it has granted several telecom service providers permission to conduct a six-month trial for the use and application of 5G technology in the country. New Delhi has granted approval to over a dozen firm spanning multiple nationalities &#8212; excluding China.</p>
<p>Among the telecom operators that have received the grant include Jio Platforms, Airtel, Vodafone Idea, and MTNL. These firms, the ministry said, will work with original equipment manufacturers and tech providers Ericsson, Nokia, Samsung, and C-Dot. Jio Platforms, additionally, has been granted permission to conduct trials using its own homegrown technology.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=1715927">press note</a>, the Department of Telecommunications didn&#8217;t specify anything about China, but a person familiar with the matter confirmed that Chinese giants Huawei and ZTE aren&#8217;t among those who have received the approval.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Indian government branch said it gave permission to telecom service providers, who chose their own priorities and technology partners. The experimental spectrum is being given in various bands which include the mid-band (3.2 GHz to 3.67 GHz), millimeter wave band (24.25 GHz to 28.5 GHz) and in Sub-Gigahertz band (700 GHz). Technology service providers will also be permitted to use their existing spectrum owned by them (800 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2500 MHz) to conduct of 5G trials.</p>
<p>&#8220;The permission letters specify that each TSP will have to conduct trials in rural and semi-urban settings also in addition to urban settings so that the benefit of 5G Technology proliferates across the country and is not confined only tourban areas. The TSPs are encouraged to conduct trials using 5Gi technology in addition to the already known 5G Technology,&#8221; the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The objectives of conducting 5G trials include testing 5G spectrum propagation characteristics especially in the Indian context; model tuning and evaluation of chosen equipment andvendors; testing of indigenous technology; testing of applications (such as tele-medicine, tele-education, augmented/ virtual reality, drone-based agricultural monitoring, etc.); and to test 5G phones and devices.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last year, Airtel had said that it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/reliance-jio-platforms-says-it-will-roll-out-5g-in-india-in-second-half-of-2021/">open to the idea of collaborating with global firms for components</a>. “Huawei, over the last 10 or 12 years, has become extremely good with their products to a point where I can safely today say their products at least in 3G, 4G that we have experienced is significantly superior to Ericsson and Nokia without a doubt. And I use all three of them,” Sunil Mittal, the founder of Airtel, said at a conference last year. In the same panel, then U.S. commerce secretary Wilbur Ross had urged India and other allies of the U.S. to avoid Huawei.</p>
<p>The geo-political tension between India and China escalated later in the year with skirmishes at the shared border. India, which early last year amended a rule to make it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/18/to-avoid-hostile-takeovers-amid-covid-19-india-mandates-approvals-on-chinese-investments/">difficult for Chinese firms to invest in Indian companies</a>, has since banned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">over 200 apps including TikTok, UC Browser, and PUBG Mobile</a> that have affiliation with China.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like everyone and their mother is trying to reinvent the Brazilian banking system. Earlier this year we wrote about </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/fintech-darling-nubank-raises-blockbuster-400m-series-g-at-25b-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nubank’s $400 million Series G</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, last month there was the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/picpay-the-brazilian-mobile-payments-platform-files-for-an-ipo-on-nasdaq/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PicPay IPO filing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and today, </span><a href="https://www.altbank.com.br/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">alt.bank</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Brazilian neobank, announced a $5.5 million Series A led by Union Square Ventures (USV).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s no secret that the Brazilian banking system has been poised for disruption, considering the sector’s little attention to customer service and exorbitant fee structure that’s left most Brazilians unbanked, and alt.bank is just the latest company trying to take home a piece of the pie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following Nubank’s strategy of launching a bank with colors that are very un-bank-like, signaling that they do things differently, alt.bank similarly launched its first financial product in 2019 &#8212; a fluorescent-yellow debit card which the locals have endearingly dubbed, “o amarelinho,” meaning, “the little yellow card.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, founded by serial entrepreneur Brad Liebman, follows the founder’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$480 million exit of Simply Business, which was acquired by U.S. insurance giant Travelers in 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike many fintechs, alt.bank has a strong social mission and pays commissions for referrals that last for the customer&#8217;s lifetime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most fintechs just help wealthy people get wealthier, so I thought let’s do something with a social mission,” Liebman told TechCrunch in an interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To drive home the mission, and really target the unbanked, Liebman and his team of 80 employees have designed an app that can be used by the illiterate. Instead of words, users can follow color-coded prompts to complete a transaction. The company also plans to launch credit products soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the company, close to a million people have downloaded the android app since launch, but Liebman declined to disclose how many active users the company actually has.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the company’s core offerings include the debit card, a prepaid credit card, Pix (similar to Zelle), a savings account and even telemedicine visits via a partnership with Dr. Consulta, a network of healthcare clinics throughout the country. The prepaid credit card is key because online stores in Brazil don’t accept debit card purchases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the perk of ongoing commissions, alt.bank has also partnered with three major drugstores, allowing their users to get 5-30% off any item at the stores, including medication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the company is based in São Paulo and São Carlos, Liebman and his family are currently based in London due to regulations around the pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment in alt.bank marks USV’s first investment in South America, solidifying a trend by other major U.S. investors such as Sequoia who only in the last several years have started looking to LatAm for deals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The bar was high for our first investment in South America,” said Union Square Ventures partner John Buttrick. “The combination of the alt.bank business model and world-class management team enticed us to expand our geographic focus to help build the leading digital bank targeting the 100 million Brazilians who are currently being neglected by traditional lenders,” he added in a statement. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa is the last frontier for </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">basically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> anything. Mobile gaming is no exception. For a continent that is home to more than 1 billion millennials and Gen Zers, mobile gaming has never </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> picked up, despite the continent witnessing rapid economic growth and smartphone adoption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two issues have proved detrimental to this growth: distribution and payments. With fragmented and unresolved distribution and digital payments ecosystems, game studios have found it difficult to serve African consumers and make a ton of money doing so. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.carry1st.com/">Carry1st</a> is a mobile games publishing platform fixing this problem, and today it is announcing the close of its $6 million Series A round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This month last year, we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/carry1st-has-4m-to-invest-in-african-mobile-gaming/">reported</a> that the company had </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised a $2.5 million seed investment. CRE Ventures led that round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but this time, the company, which has offices in Cape Town and New York, brought in a blue-chip group of investors spanning gaming, media and fintech.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. VC firm <a href="https://konvoy.vc/">Konvoy Ventures</a> led the Series A round. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is known</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for its investment in the video gaming industry&#8217;s infrastructure, technology, tools and platforms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/">Riot Games</a> (developer of League of Legends), Tokyo&#8217;s Akatsuki Entertainment Technology Fund (the company behind Dragon Ball Z), Raine Ventures and fintech VC TTV Capital participated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carry1st </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was founded by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cordelrc/">Cordel Robbin-Coker</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucyhoffman08/">Lucy Hoffman</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinotenda-mundangepfupfu-3333b915/">Tinotenda Mundangefupfu</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018. The company started as a game studio, developing and launching its own mobile games. But a projection on what it could be in the long run made the company switch tactics.</span></p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Carry1st has $4M to invest in African mobile gaming&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/carry1st-has-4m-to-invest-in-african-mobile-gaming/embed/#?secret=d00wkNZiJ0" data-secret="d00wkNZiJ0" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead of the studio model (quite popular among gaming companies in Africa), Carry1st sought to become a regional publisher, thereby opening the continent to international studios. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the company helps local studios that find it difficult to create games with a global appeal by pairing them with strong operators</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We learned that African users don’t need their own games; they want to play the best games in the world,&#8221; CEO Robbin-Coker told TechCrunch</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">COO Hoffman said that the company provides a full-stack publishing platform for its partners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also handles localization, distribution, user acquisition, monetization, customer experience for studios and licenses their games on exclusive, long-term contracts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We fund user acquisition so that the games </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are played by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as many users as possible, and then send our partners a royalty in return for the ability to leverage their IP,&#8221; Hoffman said.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is somewhat akin to how Tencent-backed Sea Limited (parent company of Garena) took off. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company was the publisher of League of Legends across Southeast Asia but launched its own game, Free Fire</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, the company has built out the largest consumer payments and e-commerce platform in the region, which is now worth over $130 billion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Carry1st aspires to do the same for Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although there aren&#8217;t many details about its e-commerce activity, Carry1st is tackling payments and difficult monetization issues by partnering with some fintechs like Paystack, Safaricom, and Cellulant. These partnerships have been pivotal to developing its in-house payments platform Pay1st, which allows customers to pay in their preferred way. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For global studios, this is the difference between making money and not,&#8221; Robbin-Coker added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand for Carry1st has grown </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rapidly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its seed round last year, the company has signed seven games with well-known mobile gaming studios</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They include Sweden&#8217;s Raketspel (the company has more than 120 million downloads across its portfolio), Cosi Games and Ethiopia&#8217;s Qene Games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All these signups happened in 2020 and the catalyst for this growth has pandemic-induced lockdowns written all over it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The African mobile gaming market has always pointed toward a strong growth market, but </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">being forced</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> indoors </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">surely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> skyrocketed mobile usage and gaming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who might not have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> needed a mobile phone have now come to rely on them to keep in touch with family and friends</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the average user using a smartphone for the first time, there&#8217;s a natural tendency to explore the fun things available on their device</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the first things people do when they get their first smartphone is to chat with friends and play games</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is the same all over the world &#8212; Africa is no different. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For that reason, we are seeing more and more mobile gamers across Africa,&#8221; remarked Robbin-Coker</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has also grown its team from 18 to 26 across 11 countries with recruits from Carlyle, King, Jumia, Rovio, Socialpoint, Ubisoft and Wargaming &#8212; a testament to the company&#8217;s global ambitions to be a top gaming publisher. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Expanding the team, which cuts across product, engineering and growth departments, is one way Carry1st will put the new investment </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to use</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company also plans to secure new partnerships with global gaming studios while launching and scaling its existing games like Carry1st Trivia and All-Star Soccer.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2147098" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2147098" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2147098" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/User-Screenshot-1.jpeg?w=680" alt="Carry1st" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/User-Screenshot-1.jpeg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/User-Screenshot-1.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/User-Screenshot-1.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/User-Screenshot-1.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/User-Screenshot-1.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/User-Screenshot-1.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2147098" class="wp-caption-text">User playing a Carry1st game</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this investment, Carry1st has raised a total of $9.5 million. On the caliber of investors brought on, Robbin-Coker said their investment in the company would put them in a place to “delight millions of users across Africa and the globe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carry1st is Konvoy Ventures <a href="https://konvoy.vc/portfolio">first foray</a> into the African gaming market (same can be said for Riot Games), and representatives from both teams (Konvoy managing partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacksonvaughan">Jackson Vaughan</a> and Riot Games head of corporate development <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tuxedobear">Brendan Mulligan</a>) believe the company is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">unequivocally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solving the continent&#8217;s distribution and gaming experience problems. Vaughan will also join the company’s board.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Africa&#8217;s gaming industry has</span> lacked innovation in times past. While we&#8217;ve seen companies try to change the narrative, most have operated as studios. Carry1st is one of the few companies to operate a hybrid model, but the endgame for the company really is to be one of the region&#8217;s dominant consumer internet companies.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> social games and payments is the best first step to doing so, but we have very large ambitions. If we execute this, we will catalyze massive growth in the digital ecosystem across the region, creating tons of high-quality jobs in the process. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We think</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">all of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the ingredients are in place &#8212; we want to be the catalyst,&#8221; Hoffman said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.workboard.com/">WorkBoard</a>, a software startup that sells software designed to help other companies plan, announced that it has raised a $75 million Series D. Softbank Group led the investment, which saw participation from prior investors including Microsoft&#8217;s M12 venture capital arm, a16z, GGV and Workday Ventures. Per the company, three new investors also took part: SVB Capital, Capital OneVentures and Intel Capital.</p>
<p>More precisely, a host of strategic and venture investors joined up with SoftBank to greatly expand WorkBoard&#8217;s capital base in a single investment. Prior to its new round, WorkBoard had raised $65 million, according to its co-founder and CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/day_dree?lang=en">Deidre Paknad</a>. Its new round, then, is larger than all of its prior funding combined.</p>
<p>The new funding values WorkBoard at $800 million on a post-money basis, a huge step up from its Series C post-money valuation of $230 million, per <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook data</a>.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;What can the OKR software sector tell us about startup growth more generally?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/what-can-the-okr-software-sector-tell-us-about-startup-growth-more-generally/embed/#?secret=RyDsWwMNQt" data-secret="RyDsWwMNQt" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>WorkBoard, like a number of startups that have raised recently, didn&#8217;t need more capital to keep operating. Paknad told TechCrunch in an interview that her OKR-focused business still had $35 million in the bank from its preceding rounds. So, what will WorkBoard do with its now $100 million or $105 million bank account? Invest like heck, it appears.</p>
<p>In a sense that should not surprise &#8212; TechCrunch included WorkBoard in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/what-can-the-okr-software-sector-tell-us-about-startup-growth-more-generally/">roundup of OKR-centered software startups last week</a>, a piece that included the fact that it had grown by 90% from Q1 2020 to Q1 2021, and that Paknad expected her company to &#8220;more than double&#8221; this year.</p>
<p>Chatting with Paknad, TechCrunch wanted to know why her firm had picked up more capital &#8212; so very much new capital &#8212; at a time when it didn&#8217;t really need the funds. Per the CEO, the company sees the economy and its market at inflection points that make it the right time to deploy capital aggressively.</p>
<p>The company is already at it, adding 82 people in the first 100 days of the year, and expecting to scale from its current employee base of 250 to 400 this year.</p>
<p>What is this moment on which the company is intent to double-down? The economic inflection point is a rapidly scaling economy, with Paknad noting that the Federal Reserve expects the U.S. economy to grow by 6.5% this year, the fastest pace in decades. That figure could imply a ripe moment for software companies to grow at an outsized pace; warm economic waters are great for already hot companies and sectors.</p>

<p>And the second turning point is that after 2020, a year in which many if not most companies had to plan, re-plan and re-re-plan, the CEO said, many firms want to accelerate their planning cadence. And as OKRs are built around a roughly four-times-yearly pace, they are inherently more rapid-fire than the traditional yearly planning to which many companies still hew. So they could be a great fit.</p>
<p>Lots of growth, then, and lots of demand could make for an attractive growth moment for WorkBoard and its OKR-derived startup brethren.</p>
<p>WorkBoard also wants to grow its international footprint; Paknad noted customers in Asia and Europe and a desire to invest more in those markets. And the company wants to keep putting capital to work into its community efforts, something that we&#8217;re hearing from a number of aggressively growing startups in recent quarters.</p>
<p>WorkBoard could have raised more capital than it did, with Paknad telling TechCrunch that investors used a number of techniques to reach her in the last year, including some that pushed the boundaries of the word tenuous. In short, growthy SaaS companies of the sort that WorkBoard is proving to be are staring down a buffet of funding sources in today&#8217;s market. We forgot to ask her if SPACs were also reaching out, but we&#8217;d be surprised if the answer was no.</p>
<p>TechCrunch was also curious about the services side of the WorkBoard business. The company offers coaching, certification and other human-powered services in addition to software. Paknad said that while that part of her company&#8217;s services revenue is only around 10% of its aggregate, it&#8217;s key to landing customers who want or need the help. So, if we presume that the company is selling human time at around a breakeven rate, we can infer that whatever hit the company takes to its blended gross margins is worth it in terms of implied, if somewhat opaque from a raw-numbers-perspective, revenue growth.</p>
<p>And the CEO said that the services team has a direct line to her product group. That means that whatever its human interactions derive in terms of hints and notes about what might need changing, or building, can be iterated on rapidly.</p>
<p>WorkBoard has delivered rapid growth for years, as TechCrunch reported earlier this year when we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/rapid-growth-in-2020-reveals-okr-software-markets-untapped-potential/">put together a compiled list of historical growth rates of companies in its space</a>. Paknad&#8217;s company grew its top line by 350% in 2018, 300% in 2019, around 100% in 2020, and the expectation of another double in 2021. That&#8217;s smackingly close to the (in)famous triple-triple-double-double-double model of startup growth that gets companies to $100 million in recurring revenue at a venture-ready pace. At which point an IPO is a foregone conclusion that hinges merely on market timing and the maturity of internal controls.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll hit up all the OKR startups in a few months for their Q2 2021 numbers, so expect to hear more about WorkBoard and Ally.io and Perdoo, and Gtmhub and Koan and WeekDone shortly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The market remains very hot for startups building e-commerce empires by consolidating independent third-party merchants that have gained traction on Amazon&#8217;s Marketplace, and in the latest development, <a href="https://razor-group.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Razor Group</a> &#8212; a Berlin-based startup buying up promising Amazon sellers and scaling them into bigger, multi-channel businesses &#8212; has closed financing of $400 million to scale its own efforts in the space.</p>
<p>Around $25 million is coming in the form of equity to grow its business and $375 million is in debt to make acquisitions, with target businesses typically already pulling in between $1 million and $15 million in annual revenues.</p>
<p>Razor Group itself is not even a year old but has been building out its business at a fast pace. Founded in August 2020, in the last eight months, CEO Tushar Ahluwalia said the startup has grown to 107 employees across four offices and is currently on track to cross $120 million (€100 million) in sales from the 30 brands it has already amassed in its stable in categories like personal wellness, sports and home and living. Assuming the debt capital it&#8217;s now raised is put to use, Ahluwalia believes Razor Group will cross $480 million (€400 million) in sales in the next 12 to 15 months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As a point of comparison, Thrasio, one of the older players in this current market, was founded in 2018 and has 100 brands in its stable.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are, as you might have seen, a lot of others in the market pursuing the &#8220;FBA rollup&#8221; model &#8212; consolidating businesses that have been built on the back of <a href="https://services.amazon.co.uk/services/fulfilment-by-amazon/features-benefits.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fulfillment by Amazon</a>, with the pitch being they can apply more sophisticated economies of scale, analytics and management to grow great cottage industries into high rises, so to speak. But Razor believes its point of differentiation is its focus on technology to improve its responsiveness to the market, both when it comes to identifying and buying brands, and then growing them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a big opportunity. By <a href="https://www.feedbackexpress.com/amazon-1029528-new-sellers-year-plus-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one estimate</a> there are about 5 million third-party sellers on Amazon today, and their ranks are growing exponentially, with more than 1 million sellers joining the platform in 2020 alone. Thrasio has in the past <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/thrasio-raises-100m-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play-appoints-retail-cfo-heavyweight-for-its-next-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated to me</a> that there are probably 50,000 businesses selling on Amazon via FBA making $1 million or more per year in revenues.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s perfectly acceptable to build an FBA-based business, but at some point you can move beyond that,&#8221; Ahluwalia said in an interview. &#8220;We want to transform what we see as the levers of business operations in this space. We don&#8217;t see ourselves as the next P&amp;G, but a new version of it, building microchampions in micromarkets, identifying underpriced digital real estate. Just thinking about it as abritrage is not enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>The funding, a mixture of equity to invest in the startup itself and debt to use for acquisitions (and it is mostly debt), is being led by funds and accounts managed by BlackRock and Victory Park Capital (“VPC”) as well as its existing shareholders, a list that includes a number of individuals as well as VCs such as Redalpine, FJ Labs and Global Founders Capital, the VC firm co-founded by the Samwer Brothers, also behind the well-known Berlin e-commerce incubator Rocket Internet.</p>
<p>Ahluwalia and Razor&#8217;s head of finance Christoph Gamon &#8212; who together co-founded Razor with CTO Shrestha Chowdury &#8212; are both Rocket Internet alums, and Ahluwalia and Chowdury also worked on a previous e-commerce business in India called StalkBuyLove (a clone of Wanelo &#8212; short for &#8220;Want Need Love&#8221; &#8212; for India, I think) that <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/online-retailer-stalkbuylove-runs-out-of-cash-as-funding-tap-goes-dry/articleshow/71089917.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ran out of cash and shut down</a>.</p>
<p>All of that speaks to both the inroads that the founders may have had into gaining some early financing from other Rocket alums and others, as well as their experiences, both good and bad, of what it takes to grow and scale e-commerce businesses.</p>
<p>Including the $25 million in this latest tranche, the funding brings the total raised in equity by Razor Group to about $40 million &#8212; with the previous money being used to get the ball rolling and &#8220;validate the model&#8221;, Ahluwalia said. It&#8217;s not disclosing its valuation today but he confirmed it&#8217;s also raising another, larger equity round when it will be speaking more about that.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the huge injection of debt financing it is getting for acquisitions &#8212; doubled after its original plan to raise $200 million got a lot of interest &#8212; is a sign not just of what investors and Razor Group itself see as an opportunity, but also of the encroaching competition from other roll-up players that are also well capitalized also setting their sights on buying up the most promising independent businesses selling via Amazon and other marketplace providers.</p>
<p>That list of competitors is getting longer by the day. It includes <a href="https://www.thrasio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thrasio</a>, one of the first startups to identify and build out this space, which has raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/10/thrasio-raises-750m-more-in-equity-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very large rounds</a> in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/thrasio-raises-100m-for-its-amazon-roll-up-play-appoints-retail-cfo-heavyweight-for-its-next-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rapid succession</a> totaling hundreds of millions of dollars in the last year, and is profitable; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/target-global-leads-150m-round-for-amazon-marketplace-consolidator-branded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Branded</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/heroes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heroes</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/sellerx-raises-118m-to-buy-up-and-grow-amazon-marketplace-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SellerX</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/perch-raises-123-5m-to-grow-its-stable-of-d2c-brands-that-sell-on-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perch</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/berlin-brands-group-commits-302m-to-acquire-d2c-and-amazon-merchants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berlin Brands Group</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/berlin-brands-group-raises-240m-to-buy-and-scale-up-third-party-amazon-marketplace-brands/">X2</a>); <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/benitago-group-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Benitago</a>; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/valoreo-raises-50m-to-roll-up-latam-e-commerce-brands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valoreo</a> (with its backers including Razor&#8217;s CEO).</p>
<p>The opportunity is also breeding other e-commerce startups like <a href="https://www.junglescout.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jungle Scout</a>, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/jungle-scout-raises-110m-acquires-downstream-impact-to-help-3rd-parties-sell-on-marketplaces-like-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also raised $110 million recently</a>, providing tools to some of those third-party sellers to help them stay, in fact, independent (or at least grow more to be more valuable to acquirers)</p>
<p>Razor believes that its ability to stand out in this crowd will not just be based on how much money it has to spend, but on the technology that it is using to identify the best third-party sellers faster in order to roll them up first, and then to leverage that early move by giving those companies better tools to grow faster.</p>
<p>Chowdhury describes the platform that she has built as &#8220;M&amp;A 2.0&#8221;, a system that performs &#8220;massive due dilligence&#8221; at machine scale by evaluating some 1 million companies each week as they perform on platforms like Amazon&#8217;s. &#8220;Technology runs through the whole business,&#8221; she said, started with the acquisitions, where Razor is identifying the most interesting companies faster than others, she said. &#8220;We look at thousands of data points,&#8221; building algorithms, she continued, &#8220;to flag what we want to acquire. It means that our acquisitions funnel is 99% sourced directly and we don&#8217;t rely on brokers.&#8221; Brokers, she said, are something of a unspoken part of this area, but bypassing them means less competition and better pricing.</p>
<p>Being early also means building better relationships with the owners of these businesses, with less time pressure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dealmaking is something extremely personal,&#8221; Ahluwalia said. &#8220;A seller needs to like you. Our calculations have allowed us to be the first in these deal conversations&#8221;</p>
<p>Further along, that data will also help Razor build those businesses and figure out where else brands can be sold beyond Amazon and how to sell them better.</p>
<p>That is a plan that has yet to be proven out, given the age of the company, but investors &#8212; adding up the numbers and track record of these founders, and the tech they have built &#8212; are willing to bet on this one.</p>
<p>“We are excited to partner with Tushar, Chris, and the rest of the Razor Group team. The ability to identify, underwrite, integrate and ultimately create tangible value across a broad suite of eCommerce assets is a real competitive advantage in the marketplace,” said Tom Welch, partner at VPC, in a statement.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to make this investment in Razor Group to support the company’s strong growth momentum as it continues to diversify its portfolio of brands and expand into new markets,” added Dan Worrell, MD at BlackRock.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arrival, the electric vehicle manufacturer that’s attempting to do away with the assembly line in favor of highly automated microfactories, is partnering with Uber to create an EV for ride-hail drivers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arrival expects to reveal the final vehicle design before the end of the year and to begin production in the third quarter of 2023. Uber drivers have been invited to contribute to the design process to ensure the vehicles are built to suit their needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber is trying to make good on a promise it made last year to become a fully electric mobility platform by 2025 in London, 2030 in North America and Europe and platform-wide by 2040. The company recently launched Uber Green, which gives passengers the opportunity to select an EV at no extra cost and drivers a chance to pay a lower service fee, part of an</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/committing-to-a-fully-zero-emission-fleet-by-2040-uber-is-dedicating-800-million-to-electrifying-its-drivers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> $800 million initiative to get more drivers in EVs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To reach its aims of doubling the number of EV drivers by the end of 2021, Uber is kicking its incentives for drivers into gear by helping them purchase or finance new vehicles. The Arrival Cars might be among those recommended to Uber drivers who want to make the switch to electric, especially drivers in London who are eligible for “EV Assistance” via the company’s </span><a href="https://www.uber.com/gb/en/u/drive-journey-to-electric/#cleanairplan"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clean Air Plan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which launched in 2018, but an Uber spokesperson declined to confirm how the Arrival Cars will be made available. Last September, <a href="https://plants.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2020/sep/0908-uber.html">Uber partnered with General Motors</a> in a similar deal to provide drivers in the United States and Canada discounted prices for the 2020 Chevrolet Bolt. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uber is committed to helping every driver in London upgrade to an EV by 2025, and thanks to our Clean Air Plan more than £135m has been raised to support this ambition,” Jamie Heywood, Uber’s regional general manager for Northern and Eastern Europe said in a statement. “Our focus is now on encouraging drivers to use this money to help them upgrade to an electric vehicle, and our partnership with Arrival will help us achieve this goal.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">London, where Arrival is based, <a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/transport/green-transport#:~:text=This%20includes%20delivering%20central%20London,London%2Dwide%20zone%20by%202050.&amp;text=In%20central%20London%2C%20all%20double,zero%20exhaust%20emissions%20by%202020.">aims for its entire transport system to be zero emission by 2050</a>, and will create zero emissions zones in central London and town center from 2025, expanding outward to inner London by 2040 and city-wide by 2050. If Uber drivers want to be able to work in the hottest parts of the city, they’ll have no choice but to go electric. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The partnership with Uber marks Arrival’s first foray into electric car development. Because Arrival focuses on the commercial space rather than commercial sales, its existing vehicle models are vans and buses. The British EV company already has an order from UPS for </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/arrival-to-open-a-second-us-microfactory-to-build-electric-vans-for-ups/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10,000 purpose-built vehicles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Arrival wants to change the way commercial electric vehicles are designed and manufactured. By designing its own batteries and other components in-house and building vehicles through multiple microfactories, which are much smaller than traditional manufacturing facilities, Arrival says it produces vehicles quicker, cheaper and with far fewer environmental costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company began publicly trading in March following a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/arrival-becomes-latest-electric-vehicle-startup-to-test-the-public-markets-with-a-spac/">SPAC merger with CIIG</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/12/the-station-the-biggest-spac-ever-and-reading-the-micromobility-permit-tea-leaves/">one of many EV companies</a> to hit the markets via the SPAC route as opposed to the traditional, and slower, IPO route.</span></p>

I, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">your friend Alex</a>, will be writing and collecting the main sections from here on out. We’ll also have input from <a href="https://twitter.com/YourProtagonist">Walter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/annie-siebert-4990b123/">Annie</a> on the Extra Crunch side of things (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/will-fintech-unicorn-flywires-proposed-ipo-reach-escape-velocity/">like today’s Exchange column</a>!), along with community notes from <a href="https://twitter.com/yoda">Drew</a> and more. It’s going to be great.</p>
<p>But with the news out today that TechCrunch’s parent company’s parent company is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/private-equity-firm-apollo-agrees-to-buy-verizon-media-assets-for-5-billion/">selling our parent company</a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to a new parent company, we can’t do anything but admit that our newsletter shakeup is hardly the biggest news story of the day.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>You can read more of TechCrunch’s coverage of the deal <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/verizon-ceo-memo-apollo-to-focus-on-commerce-content-and-betting-with-new-yahoo-business/">here</a>. We will have more on the matter in the coming weeks. You’ll learn more about it as we do.</p>
<p>I am beyond excited about getting the chance to write to you every day. A big thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/anthonyha">Anthony Ha</a>, who ran this fine newsletter for so long. But there is a <i>lot</i> of startup and tech news to get through today, so let’s put aside private equity buyouts of legacy media assets for the moment and get into the stuff we care about the most.</p>
<h2>The big story: The Duolingo EC-1</h2>
<p>TechCrunch has covered the explosive edtech sector extensively over the last year (some examples <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/29/lambda-school-lays-off-65-employees-amid-restructuring/">here</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/24/what-the-masterclass-effect-means-for-edtech/">here</a>), largely thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_?lang=en">Natasha’s</a> work. She joined the TC team just before the pandemic, making her focus on education technology instantly prescient as the world went into lockdown. Remote education became the default, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/is-2020-bringing-more-edtech-rounds-than-ever-or-does-it-simply-feel-that-way/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">several billion dollars in venture capital</span></a> quickly chased the trend.</p>
<p>Now, on perhaps the other end of the COVID era, Natasha just published a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1/">deep dive</a> into one of the most fascinating companies in the edtech arena: Duolingo. Per her reporting in her brand-new EC-1 investigating the company, Duolingo has scaled to 500 million users and $190 million in 2020 bookings.</p>
<p>Edtech is now big business, and after a history of being a place where venture capital goes to die, it’s instead a red-hot sector with a . I’m still chewing on the 10,000+ words that we just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/duolingo-ec1-origin/">shipped on Duolingo</a>, but it’s clear already that Natasha crushed this particular assignment.</p>

<h2>Startups and venture capital: Either NFTs are the next big thing or a lot of people are very wrong</h2>
<p>Let’s talk startups, yeah? Turning to the day’s news, I found a few gems for your delectation.</p>
<p>We’ll start with Zoomo, an Australian e-bike company (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/with-11-million-in-fresh-capital-bolt-bikes-rebrands-to-zoomo/">formerly Bolt Bikes</a>) that wants delivery folks to snag a subscription to its two-wheeled zoomers. As TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/zoomo-raises-12-million-expand-e-bike-subscription-offerings/">recently reported</a>, you may have heard of the company after it “made a name for itself through partnerships with Uber Eats and DoorDash to help delivery workers access e-bikes through weekly subscriptions at discounted rates.”</p>
<p>It has since expanded to 10,000 bikes internationally and wants to work with companies of all sorts on getting their workers kitted about with its hardware. And it just raised $12 million. Let’s see how far its new capital allows the company to, er, scoot ahead.</p>
<p>Next up is Gatheround, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/gatheround-raises-millions-from-homebrew-bloomberg-and-stripes-coo-to-help-remote-workers-connect/">just raised $3.5 million in a seed round</a>. The company, formerly known as Icebreaker, helps remote teams conduct engaging video meetings. Which is not a bad idea, as sometimes you need a little help to break the damn ice.</p>
<p>Per our own <a href="https://twitter.com/bayareawriter">Mary Ann Azevedo</a>, “Homebrew and Bloomberg Beta co-led the company’s latest raise, which included participation from angel investors, such as Stripe COO Claire Hughes Johnson, Meetup co-founder Scott Heiferman, Li Jin and Lenny Rachitsky.”</p>
<p>Finally, it is impossible to cover startups in 2021 without NFTs cropping up somewhere, so let’s allow <a href="https://twitter.com/lucasmtny?lang=en">Lucas Matney</a> to tap our brains into the cryptoverse:</p>
<blockquote><p>The creators behind CryptoPunks, one of the most popular NFT projects on the web, just revealed their latest project called Meebits. The project boasts 20,000 procedurally generated 3D characters that are tradeable on the Ethereum blockchain.</p></blockquote>
<p>I won’t lie, why not procedurally generate 200,000? Or 2,000,000? Or 20? A lot of my friends are tweeting about <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub">bored apes</a> and <a href="https://zed.run/">breeding digital horses</a>. Meanwhile, I sit around a stack of paper books feeling at once like a caveman and an oracle able to see what won’t last. Either way, it’s the year of non-fungible digital ownership of proof of digital ownership of fungible images.</p>

<h2>The tech giants: Twitter vs. Clubhouse</h2>
<p>Turning to the Big Tech companies, there was a good chunk of news today, the most important of which is that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/twitter-expands-spaces-to-anyone-with-600-followers-details-plans-for-tickets-reminders-and-more/">Twitter’s push into live audio is no joke</a>. Nor is it some sort of side project that never really gets the full attention of the social giant’s product team. Instead, Twitter announced today that “it’s making Twitter Spaces available to any account with 600 followers or more, including both iOS and Android users,” <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahintampa?lang=en">Sarah</a> reports.</p>
<p>Even more, the company also “officially unveiled some of the features it’s preparing to launch, like Ticketed Spaces, scheduling features, reminders, support for co-hosting, accessibility improvements and more.” Get hype, kids; Twitter versus Clubhouse is now in its second round and we’re pretty hype about it.</p>
<p>Two more things for your reading pleasure: When it comes to the biggest tech companies, a key topic &#8212; and the current theme of a lawsuit between <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/epic-cries-monopoly-as-apple-details-secret-project-liberty-effort-to-provoke-fortnite-ban/">Team Fornite and Team Dongle</a> &#8212; has been the cut of revenues that app stores of all stripes get to take. Long stuck at 30%, a rate that Apple is apparently determined to stick to regardless of how poorly it makes them look, there’s movement on the matter.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/epic-games-buys-artist-community-artstation-drops-commissions-to-12/">Epic Games bought ArtStation</a> and instantly cut its commission rate from the 30% that it was to the 12% that Epic now charges on its own games store. Microsoft previously reduced its cut to 12%. That sound you hear is Apple screaming as some of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/todays-big-tech-earnings-in-a-mere-700-words/">record net income</a> is slowly eroded by more creator-friendly business practices.</p>
<p>Finally, in the world of Big Tech, Dell is selling Boomi to help cover the debts it accrued by buying EMC. <a href="https://twitter.com/ron_miller?lang=en">Ron Miller</a> has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/dell-dumps-another-big-asset-moving-boomi-to-francisco-partners-and-tpg-for-4b/">the details</a>.</p>

<p>As KPIs go, return on experience (RoX) ranks near the top of the list. Unfortunately, many startups have no way to measure RoX — doing so requires a holistic approach that exceeds the capacity of most growth-focused, early-stage companies.</p>
<p>Startups that need to develop a data strategy while conserving engineering resources are driving growth in the analytics-as-a-service (AaaS) market. If you&#8217;re looking for insights into winning customers over strategically, cutting technical costs and making better decisions faster, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/analytics-as-a-service-why-more-enterprises-should-consider-outsourcing/">AaaS can help you set realistic expectations</a>.</p>

<p>A changing regulatory environment and pandemic-fueled growth has created a lot of new wealth and increased interest in direct investing.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/how-to-attract-large-investors-to-your-direct-investing-platform/">In a guest post for Extra Crunch</a>, investor David Teten examined several online platforms that serve as market-makers to get a better sense of how they attract investors and increase engagement.</p>
<p>These companies play for high stakes, says Teten, because a competent direct-investing platform must be able to operate as seamlessly as a traditional fund.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon&#8217;s free, ad-supported streaming service IMDb TV is getting its own mobile app. The company announced the news today at its first-ever NewFronts presentation to advertisers, where it also shared that its over-the-top streaming businesses combined &#8212; meaning, IMDb TV, Twitch, live sports like Thursday Night Football, Amazon&#8217;s News app and others &#8212; have now grown to more than 120 million monthly viewers.</p>
<p>This over-the-top business, or Amazon OTT as it&#8217;s called, includes anywhere ads show up alongside content on the IMDb TV app, Twitch&#8217;s game streaming site, during live sports Amazon streams through Prime Video, its 3P network and broadcaster apps and its Amazon&#8217;s News app for Fire TV.</p>
<p>IMDb TV viewership, in particular, jumped 138% year-over-year, Amazon noted.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The ad-supported service, which likely benefited from the same pandemic bump that drove streaming service viewership higher across the board last year, is something of a rival to other free, ad-supported streamers, like Fox&#8217;s Tubi, ViacomCBS&#8217;s Pluto TV or Roku&#8217;s The Roku Channel. However, more like Roku&#8217;s hub, Amazon leverages IMDb TV to help it sell its own media devices by promising users easy access to free, streaming content.</p>
<p>Today, that&#8217;s resulted in the IMDb TV app seeing the majority of its usage on Fire TV. But over the past several months, the app has become more broadly available, with launches on Roku, Chromecast with Google TV, PlayStation 4 consoles, Xbox One and Series X devices, LG Smart TVs, Nvidia, Sony Android TV and TiVo Android TV devices, Amazon says.</p>
<p>Now it will get its own dedicated mobile app, as well, instead of only a small section inside the IMDb app where the service&#8217;s content can be found today on smartphones. The new standalone app will arrive this summer on both iOS and Android, says Amazon.</p>
<p>Amazon also told advertisers about IMDb TV&#8217;s current user base, noting that 62% were in between ages 18 and 49. And they spend 5.5 hours per week on the app, on average.</p>
<p>The forthcoming mobile launch was one of several announcements Amazon made today at its Newfronts presentation today.</p>
<p>The company also detailed its upcoming IMDb TV slate, including unscripted series &#8220;Luke Bryan: My Dirt Road Diary,&#8221; &#8220;Bug Out&#8221; and &#8220;Untitled Jeff Lewis Project&#8221; as well as scripted releases &#8220;Blessed and Highly Favored,&#8221; &#8220;Greek Candy,&#8221; &#8220;Primo,&#8221; &#8220;The Fed,&#8221; and &#8220;The Pradeeps of Pittsburgh, PA.&#8221; Music duo <a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/tegan-sara-high-school-clea-duvall-imdb-tv-1234965060/">Tegan and Sara’s memoir &#8220;High School&#8221; will be adapted</a> as an original series for IMDb TV. IMDb TV also announced a new crime drama, &#8220;Leverage: Redemption,&#8221; and police drama, &#8220;On Call.&#8221;</p>
<p>IMDb TV parent company Amazon, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/amazon-nfl-deal-thursday-night-football-prime-video-will-begin-year-early-run-11-seasons/">expanded its deal with the NFL for Thursday Night Football,</a> which now runs 11 seasons, starting with the 2022 season instead of the following year.</p>

<p>Solid state battery systems have long been considered the next breakthrough in battery technology, with multiple startups vying to be the first to commercialization. Automakers have been some of the top investors in the technology, each of them seeking the edge that will make their electric vehicles safer, faster and with increased range.</p>
<p>Ford Motor Company and BMW Group have put their money on battery technology company Solid Power.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Louisville, Colorado-based SSB developer said Monday its latest $130 million Series B funding round was led by Ford and BMW, the latest signal that the two OEMs see SSBs powering the future of transportation. Under the investment, Ford and BMW are equal equity owners, and company representatives will join Solid Power’s board.</p>
<p>Solid Power received additional investment in the round from Volta Energy Technologies, the venture capital firm spun out of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne National Laboratory.</p>
<p>Solid state batteries are so named because they lack a liquid electrolyte, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/can-solid-state-batteries-power-up-for-the-next-generation-of-evs/">as Mark Harris explained in an Extra Crunch article</a> earlier this year. Liquid electrolyte solutions are usually flammable and at risk of overheating, so SSBs are considered to be generally safer. The real value of SSBs versus their lithium-ion counterparts is the energy density. Solid Power says its batteries can provide as much as a 50% to 100% increase in energy density compared to rechargeable batteries. Theoretically, electric vehicles with more energy-dense batteries can travel longer distances on a single charge.</p>

<p>This latest round of investment will help Solid Power boost its manufacturing to produce battery cells with the company&#8217;s highest ampere hour (Ah) output yet. Under separate joint development agreements with Ford and BMW, it will deliver to the OEMs 100 Ah cells for testing and vehicle integration from 2022.</p>
<p>Until this point, the company has been manufacturing cells with 2 Ah and 20 Ah output. “Hundreds” of 2 Ah battery cells were validated by Ford and BMW late last year, Solid Power said in a statement. Meanwhile, it is currently producing 20 Ah solid state batteries on a pilot basis with standard lithium-ion equipment.</p>
<p>As opposed to the 20 Ah pilot-scale cells &#8212; which are composed of 22-layers at 9&#215;20 cm &#8212; these 100 Ah cells will have a larger footprint and even more layers, Solid Power spokesman Will McKenna told TechCrunch. (&#8220;Layers&#8221; refers to the number of double-sided cathodes, McKenna explained &#8212; so the 20 Ah cell has 22 cathodes and 22 anodes, with an all-solid electrolyte separator in between each, all in a single cell.)</p>
<p>Unlike Solid Power’s manufacturing, traditional lithium-ion batteries must undergo electrolyte filling and cycling in their production processes. Solid Power says these additional steps account for 5% and 30% of capital expenditure in a typical GWh-scale lithium-ion facility.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time Solid Power has landed investments from the automakers. The company’s $20 million Series A in 2018 attracted capital from BMW and Ford, as well as Samsung, Hyundai, Volta and others. It’s part of a new wave of companies that have attracted the attention of OEMs. Other notable examples include Volkswagen-backed QuantumScape and General Motors, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/general-motors-leads-139-million-investment-into-lithium-metal-battery-developer-ses/">which has put its money on SES</a>.</p>
<p>Ford is also independently researching advanced battery technologies and is planning to open a $185 million R&amp;D battery lab, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/ford-to-open-new-lab-to-develop-next-gen-lithium-ion-and-solid-state-batteries/">the company said last week</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sony and Discord have <a href="https://www.sie.com/en/blog/announcing-playstations-new-partnership-with-discord/">announced a partnership</a> that will integrate the latter&#8217;s popular gaming-focused chat app with PlayStation&#8217;s own built-in social tools. It&#8217;s a big move and a fairly surprising one given how recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/discord-ipo-microsoft-deal/">acquisition talks</a> were in the air — Sony appears to have offered a better deal than Microsoft, taking an undisclosed minority stake in the company ahead of a rumored IPO.</p>
<p>The exact nature of the partnership is not expressed in the brief announcement post. The closest we come to hearing what will actually happen is that the two companies plan to &#8220;bring the Discord and PlayStation experiences closer together on console and mobile starting early next year,&#8221; which at least is easy enough to imagine.</p>
<p>Discord has partnered with console platforms before, though its deal with Microsoft was not a particularly deep integration. This is almost certainly more than a &#8220;friends can see what you&#8217;re playing on PS5&#8221; and more of a &#8220;this is an alternative chat infrastructure for anyone on a Sony system.&#8221; Chances are it&#8217;ll be a deep, system-wide but clearly Discord-branded option — such as &#8220;Start a voice chat with Discord&#8221; option when you invite a friend to your game or join theirs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The timeline of early 2022 also suggests that this is a major product change, probably coinciding with a big platform update on Sony&#8217;s long-term PS5 roadmap.</p>
<p>While the new PlayStation is better than the old one when it comes to voice chat, the old one wasn&#8217;t great to begin with, and Discord is not just easier to use but something millions of gamers already <em>do</em> use daily. And these days, if a game isn&#8217;t an exclusive, being robustly cross-platform is the next best option — so PS5 players being able to seamlessly join and chat with PC players will reduce a pain point there.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Hco353duQ3"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/discord-ipo-microsoft-deal/">Discord walked away from Microsoft talks, may pursue an IPO</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Discord walked away from Microsoft talks, may pursue an IPO&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/discord-ipo-microsoft-deal/embed/#?secret=Hco353duQ3" data-secret="Hco353duQ3" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Of course Microsoft has its own advantages, running both the Xbox and Windows ecosystems, but it has repeatedly fumbled this opportunity and the acquisition of Discord might have been the missing piece that tied it all together. That bird has flown, of course, and while Microsoft&#8217;s acquisition talks reportedly valued Discord at some $10 billion, it seems the growing chat app decided it would rather fly free with an IPO and attempt to become the dominant voice platform everywhere rather than become a prized pet.</p>
<p>Sony has done its part, financially speaking, by taking part in Discord&#8217;s recent $100 million H round. The amount they contributed is unknown, but perforce it can&#8217;t be more than a small minority stake, given how much the company has taken on and its total valuation.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The fact that COVID-19 accelerated the need for digital transformation across virtually all sectors is old news. What companies are doing to propel success under the circumstances has been under the spotlight. However, <em>how</em> they do it has managed to find a place in the shadows.</p>
<p>Simply put, the explosive increase in innovation and adoption of digital solutions shouldn’t be allowed to take place at the expense of ethical considerations.</p>
<p>This is about morals — but it’s also about the bottom line. Stakeholders, both internal and external, are increasingly intolerant of companies that blur (or ignore) ethical lines. These realities add up to a need for leaders to embrace an all-new learning curve: How to engage in digital transformation that includes ethics by design.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

		<blockquote>
			Simply put, the explosive increase in innovation and adoption of digital solutions shouldn’t be allowed to take place at the expense of ethical considerations.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>Ethics as an afterthought is asking for problems</h2>
<p>It’s easy to rail against the evils of the executive lifestyle or golden parachuting, but more often than not, a pattern of ethics violations arises from companywide culture, not leadership alone. Ideally, employees act ethically because it aligns with their personal values. However, at a minimum, they should understand the risk that an ethical breach represents to the organization.</p>
<p>In my experience, those conversations are not being held. Call it poor communication or lack of vision, but most companies rarely model potential ethical risks — at least not openly. If those discussions take place, they’re typically between members of upper management, behind closed doors.</p>
<p>Why don’t ethical concerns get more of a “town hall” treatment? The answer may come down to an unwillingness to let go of traditional thinking about business hierarchies. It could also be related to the strong (and ironically, toxic) cultural message that positivity rules. Case in point: I’ve listened to leaders say they want to create a culture of disruptive thinking — only to promptly tell an employee who speaks up that they “lack a growth mindset.”</p>
<p>What’s the answer, then? There are three solutions I’ve found to be effective:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making ethics a core value of the organization.</li>
<li>Embracing transparency.</li>
<li>Proactively developing strategies to contend with ethical challenges and violations.</li>
</ol>
<p>These simple solutions are a great starting point to solve ethics issues regarding digital transformation and beyond. They cause leaders to look into the heart of the company and make decisions that will impact the organization for years to come.</p>
<h2>Interpersonal dynamics are a concern in the digital transformation arena</h2>
<p>Making digital shifts is, by nature, a technical operation. It requires personnel with advanced and varied expertise in areas such as AI and data operations. Leaders in the digital transformation space are expected to possess enough cross-domain competency to tackle tough problems.</p>
<p>That’s a big ask — bringing a host of technically minded people together can easily lead to a culture of expertise arrogance that leaves people who don’t know the lingo intimidated and reluctant to ask questions.</p>
<p>Digital transformation isn’t simply about infrastructure or tools. It is, at its heart, about change management, and a multifunctional approach is needed to ensure a healthy transition. The biggest mistake companies can make is assuming that only technical experts should be at the table. The silos that are built as a result inevitably turn into echo chambers — the last place you want to hold a conversation about ethics.</p>
<p>In the rush to go digital, regardless of how technical the problem, the solution will still be a fundamentally human-centric one.</p>
<h2>Ethical digital transformation needs a starting point</h2>
<p>Not all ethical imperatives related to digital transformation are as debatable as the suggestion that it should be people-first; some are much more black and white, like the fact that you have to start somewhere to get anywhere.</p>
<p>Luckily, “somewhere” doesn’t have to be from scratch. <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3206607/what-is-grc-and-why-do-you-need-it.html">Government, risk and compliance (GRC) standards</a> can be used to create a highly structured framework that’s mostly closed to interpretation and provides a solid foundation for building out and adopting digital solutions.</p>
<p>The utility of GRC models applies equally to startup multinationals and offers more than just a playbook; thoughtful application of GRC standards can also help with leadership evaluation, progress reports and risk analysis. Think of it like using bowling bumpers — they won’t guarantee you roll a strike, but they’ll definitely keep the ball out of the gutter.</p>
<p>Of course, a given company might not know how to create a GRC-based framework (just like most of us would be at a loss if tasked with building a set of bowling bumpers). This is why many turn to providers like IBM OpenPages, COBIT and ITIL for prefab foundations. These “starter kits” all share a single goal: Identify policies and controls that are relevant to your industry or organization and draw lines from those to pivotal compliance points.</p>
<p>Although getting started with the GRC process is typically cloud-based and at least partially automated, it requires organizationwide input and transparency. It can’t be effectively run by specific departments, or in a strictly top-down fashion. In fact, the single most important thing to understand about implementing GRC standards is that it will <em>almost certainly fail</em> unless both an organization’s leadership and broader culture fully support the direction in which it points.</p>
<h2>An ethics-first mindset protects employees <em>and</em> the bottom line</h2>
<p>Today’s leaders — executives, entrepreneurs, influencers and more — can’t be solely concerned with “winning” the digital race. Arguably, transformation is more of a marathon than a sprint, but either way, technique matters. In pursuing the end goal of competitive advantage, the how and why matter just as much as the what.</p>
<p>This is true for all arms of an organization. Internal stakeholders such as owners and employees risk their careers and reputations by tolerating a peripheral approach to ethics. External stakeholders like customers, investors and suppliers have just as much to lose. Their mutual understanding of this fact is what’s behind the collective, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/11/04/five-reasons-why-transparency-is-good-business/">cross-industry push</a> for transparency.</p>
<p>We’ve all seen the massive blowback against individuals and brands in the public eye who allow <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0113/5-most-publicized-ethics-violations-by-ceos.aspx">ethical lapses</a> on their watch. It’s impossible to fully eliminate the risk of experiencing something similar, but it <em>is a risk that can be managed</em>. The danger is in letting the “tech blinders” of digital transformation interfere with your view of the big picture.</p>
<p>Companies that want to mitigate that risk and rise to the challenges of the digital era in a truly ethical way need to start by simply having conversations about what ethics, transparency and inclusivity mean — both in and around the organization. They need to follow up those conversations with action where necessary, and with open-mindedness across the board.</p>
<p>It’s smart to be worried about innovation lag in a time when enterprise is moving and shifting faster than ever, but there is time to make all the proper ethical considerations. Failing to do so will only derail you down the line.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The creators behind CryptoPunks, one of the most popular NFT projects on the web, just revealed their latest project, called <a href="https://meebits.larvalabs.com/meebits/publicsale">Meebits</a>. The project boasts 20,000 procedurally generated 3D characters that are tradeable on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>There have been hundreds of 3D avatar NFT platforms popping up over the past several months hoping to gain momentum and capture the enthusiasm of crypto buyers, but the traction of the Larva Labs team whose pixel portrait CryptoPunks project has netted more than $550 million in lifetime sales will likely make this platform another hit. Meebits arrives at a time of peak hype for their first effort, CryptoPunks, which is weeks away from a Christie&#8217;s auction that many are expecting to see fetch a price in the tens of million of dollars. It also arrives as Ethereum has had one of its best weeks on record, punching through all-time highs nearly every day this week. Ethereum is currently trading at just shy of $3,300.</p>
<p>In a blog post, the Larva Labs creators posit that they hope that Meebits will eventually serve as avatars for &#8220;virtual worlds, games and VR.&#8221; Meebits not only boast a revised art style, but Larva Labs has made some underlying changes to the no-fee marketplace, the most significant of which is likely the ability to customize trades allowing users to swap Meebits with each other in a more complex manner.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/the-cult-of-cryptopunks/">my profile</a> of the company&#8217;s CryptoPunks project last month, the team&#8217;s founders hoped that their new project would lower the barrier of entry; as CryptoPunks prices reached stratospheric heights, it seems that even by doubling the total supply (20,000 avatars versus CryptoPunks&#8217; 10,000 figures) Meebits are poised to still be an expensive affair.</p>
<p>The company is <a href="https://meebits.larvalabs.com/meebits/publicsale">distributing the Meebits</a> avatars through a Dutch auction, meaning the price for buying and minting a Meebit will lower to zero Eth (plus Ethereum gas fees) over the course of a week. Currently users are paying 2.49 Eth to mint a Meebit at random, a nearly $8,500 investment at current prices. Nevertheless, around 2,000 of them have already sold, meaning the creators have already pulled in nearly $20 million worth of Eth after just over two hours on the market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Competitors Volvo AB and Daimler Trucks are teaming up to produce hydrogen fuel cells for long-haul trucks, which the companies say will lower development costs and boost production volumes. The joint venture, which is called cellcentric, aims to bring large-scale &#8220;gigafactory&#8221; production levels of hydrogen fuel cells to Europe by 2025.</p>
<p>While the two companies are teaming up to produce the fuel cells via the cellcentric venture, all other aspects of truck production will remain separate. The location of the forthcoming gigafactory will be announced next year. The companies also did not specify the production capacity of the forthcoming factory.</p>
<p>Even as Volvo AB and Daimler Trucks used ambition-signaling terms like &#8220;gigafactory&#8221; — a term popularized by Tesla due to the giga capacity of its factories — executives added a few cautionary caveats to their goal. Europe’s hydrogen economy will depend in part on whether the European Union can produce a policy framework that further drives down costs and invests in refueling stations and other infrastructure, executives noted in a media briefing. In other words, manufacturers like Daimler and Volvo that are looking to invest in hydrogen face a &#8220;chicken and the egg&#8221; problem: boosting fuel cell production only makes sense if it occurs in tandem with the buildout of a hydrogen network, including refueling stations, pipelines to transport hydrogen and renewable energy resources to produce it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“In the long run, I mean, this must be a business-driven activity as everything else,” Volvo CTO Lars Stenqvist told TechCrunch. “But in the first wave, there must be support from our politicians.”</p>
<p>Together with other European truck manufacturers, the two companies are calling for a buildout of hydrogen refueling stations around Europe of around 300 by 2025 and around 1,000 by 2030.</p>
<p>The Swedish and German automakers suggested policies such as a tax on carbon, incentives for CO2-neutral technologies or an emissions trading system could all help ensure cost-competitiveness against fossil fuels. Heavy-duty trucking will only compose a fraction of hydrogen demand, around 10%, Stenqvist pointed out, with the rest being used by industries such as steel manufacturing and the chemical industry. That means the push for hydrogen-supportive policies will likely be heard from other sectors, as well.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges for the new venture will be working to decrease inefficiencies associated with converting hydrogen to electricity. “That’s the core of engineering in trucking, to improve the energy efficiency of the vehicle,” Stenqvist said. “That has always been in the DNA of engineers in our industry &#8230; energy efficiency will be even more important in an electrified world.” He estimated that the cost of hydrogen would need to be in the range of $3-4 per kilogram to make it a cost-effective alternative to diesel.</p>
<p>Volvo is also making investments in battery electric technologies and Stenqvist said he sees potential use cases for internal combustion engines (ICE) run on renewable biofuels. He is in agreement with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/bosch-sees-a-place-for-renewable-fuels-challenging-proposed-european-union-engine-ban/">Bosch executives who said</a> earlier this month that they see a place for ICE in the future. “I&#8217;m also convinced that there is a place for the combustion engines for a long period of time, I don&#8217;t see any end, I don&#8217;t see any retirement date for the combustion engines,” he said.</p>
<p>“From a political side, I think it would be completely wrong to ban a technology. Politicians should not ban &#8212; should not approve technologies &#8212; they should point out the direction, they should talk about what they want to achieve. And then it&#8217;s up to us as engineers to come up with the technical solutions.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the past several years I&#8217;ve covered my fair share of upstart avatar companies that were all chasing the same dream &#8212; building out a customizable platform for a digital persona that gained wide adoption across games and digital spaces. Few of those startups I&#8217;ve covered in the past are still around. But by netting a string of successful partnerships with celebrity musicians, LA-based <a href="https://genies.com/">Genies</a> has come closer than any startup before it to realizing the full vision of a wide-reaching avatar platform.</p>
<p>The company announced today that they&#8217;ve closed a $65 million Series B led by Mary Meeker&#8217;s firm Bond. NEA, Breyer Capital, Tull Investment Group, NetEase, Dapper Labs and Coinbase Ventures also participated in the deal. Mary Meeker will be joining the Genies board. The company didn&#8217;t disclose the Genies&#8217; most recent valuation.</p>
<p>This funding comes at an inflection point for the four-year-old company, evidenced by the investments from NBA Top Shot-maker Dapper Labs and crypto giant Coinbase. As announced last week, the company is rolling out an NFT platform on Dapper Labs&#8217; Flow blockchain, partnering closely with the startup, which will be building out the backend for a Genies avatar accessories storefront. Like Dapper Labs has leveraged its exclusive deals with sports leagues to ship NFTs with official backing, Genies is planning to capitalize on its partnerships with celebrities in its roster, including Justin Bieber, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and others to create a platform for buying and trading avatar accessories en masse.</p>
<p>In October, the company announced a brand partnership with Gucci, opening the startup to another big market opportunity.</p>

<p>Genies&#8217; business has largely focused on leveraging high-profile partnerships to give its entertainer clients a digital presence that can spice up what they&#8217;re sharing on social media and beyond. As they&#8217;ve rolled out avatar creation to all users through beta mobile apps, Genies has been focusing on one of the more explicit dreams of the avatar companies before it; building out a broad network of avatar users and a broad network of compatible platforms through its SDK.</p>

<p>&#8220;An avatar is a vehicle to be able to showcase more of your authentic self,&#8221; Genies CEO Akash Nigam tells TechCrunch. &#8220;It&#8217;s not limited by real-world constraints, it’s an alter-ego personality.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trends in the NFT world have provided new realms of exploration for Genies, but so have broader pandemic-era trends that have pushed more users to wholly digital spaces where they socialize and connect. &#8220;The pandemic accelerated everything,&#8221; Nigam says.</p>
<p>Nigam emphasizes that despite the major opportunity its upcoming NFT platform will present, Genies is still an avatar company first-and-foremost, not an NFT startup, though he does say he is believes crypto-backed digital goods are going to be around for a long time. He has few doubts that the current environment around digital goods helped juice Genies&#8217; funding round, which he says was &#8220;6-8X oversubscribed&#8221; and was an opportunistic play for the startup, which &#8220;could have gone years without having to raise.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company says their crypto marketplace will launch in the coming months, as early as this summer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter Spaces, the company&#8217;s new live audio rooms feature, is opening up more broadly. The company <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/spaces-is-here.html">announced</a> today it&#8217;s making Twitter Spaces available to any account with 600 followers or more, including both iOS and Android users. It also officially unveiled some of the features it&#8217;s preparing to launch, like Ticketed Spaces, scheduling features, reminders, support for co-hosting, accessibility improvements and more.</p>
<p>Along with the expansion, Twitter is making Spaces more visible on its platform, too. The company notes it has begun testing the ability to find and join a Space from a purple bubble around someone&#8217;s profile picture right from the Home timeline.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2146780" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2146780" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2146780" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HTL_Loop.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2146780" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Twitter says it decided on the 600 follower figure as being the minimum to gain access to Twitter Spaces based on its earlier testing. Accounts with 600 or more followers tend to have &#8220;a good experience&#8221; hosting live conversations because they have a larger existing audience who can tune in. However, Twitter says it&#8217;s still planning to bring Spaces to all users in the future.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it&#8217;s speeding ahead with new features and developments. Twitter has been building Spaces in public, taking into consideration user feedback as it prioritizes features and updates. Already, it has built out an <a href="https://twitter.com/Mr_DannySingh/status/1361791468877324292?s=20">expanded set of audience management controls</a>, as users requested, introduced a way for hosts to <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1385347169620738051?s=20">mute all speakers at once</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1353797113482792961?s=20">added the laughing emoji</a> to its set of reactions, after users requested it.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clubhouse begins externally testing its Android app&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/clubhouse-begins-externally-testing-its-android-app/embed/#?secret=EHArPEvLwk" data-secret="EHArPEvLwk" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Now, its focus is turning toward creators. Twitter Spaces will soon support <a href="https://twitter.com/Mr_DannySingh/status/1369023280259141635?s=20">multiple co-hosts</a>, and creators will be able to better market and even charge for access to their live events on Twitter Spaces. One feature, arriving in the next few weeks, will allow users to schedule and set reminders about Spaces they don&#8217;t want to miss. This can also help creators who are marketing their event in advance, as part of the RSVP process could involve pushing users to &#8220;set a reminder&#8221; about the upcoming show.</p>
<p>Twitter Spaces&#8217; rival, Clubhouse, also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/clubhouse-begins-externally-testing-its-android-app/">just announced a reminders feature</a> during its townhall event on Sunday as well at the start of its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/03/clubhouse-begins-externally-testing-its-android-app/">external Android testing</a>. The two platforms, it seems, could soon be neck-and-neck in terms of feature set.</p>

<p>But while Clubhouse recently launched an in-app donations feature as a means of supporting favorite creators, Twitter will soon introduce a more traditional means of generating revenue from live events: selling tickets. The company says it&#8217;s working on a feature that will allow hosts to set ticket prices and how many are available to a given event, in order to give them a way of earning revenue from their Twitter Spaces.</p>
<p>A limited group of testers will gain access to Ticketed Spaces in the coming months, Twitter says. Unlike Clubhouse, which has yet to tap into creator revenue streams, Twitter will take a small cut from these ticket sales. However, it notes that the &#8220;majority&#8221; of the revenue will go to the creators themselves.</p>

<p>Twitter also noted that it&#8217;s improving its accessibility feature, live captions, so they can be paused and customized, and is working to make them more accurate.</p>
<p>The company will be hosting a Twitter Space of its own today around 1 PM PT to further discuss these announcements in more detail.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">When the iconic American power tools company <a href="https://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620138501085000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHaFg97_Rvbf7VquxXN_UmYwTPX8g">Stanley Black &amp; Decker</a> began looking for ways to improve the pipeline of diverse candidates that the company was reviewing for potential roles, it turned to an Israeli-based startup called <a href="https://www.talenya.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.talenya.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620138501085000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH4jrHr-abaZY3QsiM8wOaTqQhfnw">Talenya</a> for help.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The company wasn’t alone in looking to startups for support in new hiring initiatives. Last year’s social reckoning that occurred in the wake of nationwide protests against systemic racism triggered by the murder of George Floyd pushed companies around the country to reassess their own role in perpetuating inequality.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As part of that assessment, companies came to the realization that the hiring tools they’d been using to simplify the process of recruiting, cultivating and promoting talent weren’t capturing the broadest and most capable applicants.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p dir="ltr">“If we want to claim that it’s a pipeline issue, we would first have to claim that we’ve hired what is available in the pipeline,” Uber Chief Diversity Officer Bo Young Lee <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/examining-the-pipeline-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/examining-the-pipeline-problem/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620138501085000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHFTOneKo2KTItRQCp3OsIzqp15BQ">told TechCrunch</a>. “It’s not a pipeline issue as much as it is a recruiting process challenge.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="hDFGxaDiz9"><p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/examining-the-pipeline-problem/">Examining the &#8216;pipeline problem&#8217;</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Examining the &#8216;pipeline problem&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/14/examining-the-pipeline-problem/embed/#?secret=hDFGxaDiz9" data-secret="hDFGxaDiz9" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p dir="ltr">That’s where tools like Talenya, Textio, TalVista, WayUp, Handshake, The Mom Project, Flockjay, Kanarys, JumpStart and SeekOut have come in. All told, these companies have raised more than $200 million in financing over the past few years to increase diversity and inclusion and help solve tech’s diversity problem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Part of our diversity, inclusion and belonging strategy focuses on having a diverse pipeline to ensure incoming talent better reflects the markets and communities we serve. To accelerate our progress, we started using Talenya’s AI software in 2020 to help increase the candidate pool of women and people of color,” said Suzan Morno-Wade, EVP and chief human resources officer at Xerox, another company using Talenya’s software, in a statement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It seems that women and people of color use fewer keywords and are less effusive when they describe themselves in profiles or on job applications, according <a href="https://www.talenya.com/exploring-the-recruitment-pipline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.talenya.com/exploring-the-recruitment-pipline/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620138501085000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE2XSZCUsZ60vLoOMXwpYqlGUYzkQ">to a recent study published by Talenya</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That’s why startups like Talenya and Textio try to highlight how to improve the screening process for candidates by using broader language in both the text of the job description (Textio) and in the filters used to select qualified candidates (Talenya).</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Keyword search is highly discriminatory to everyone,” said Talenya chief executive and co-founder Gal Almog. “Minorities and women tend to put 20% to 30% less skills on their profiles. That applies not only to women and to minorities. We added an algorithm that can predict and add missing skills.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">In some ways, that functionality seems a lot like tools on offer from companies like SeekOut, the recruiting startup that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/seekout-raises-65m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/seekout-raises-65m/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620138501085000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHnT8bv-d01ZN0NKFzK2bp8rjPFbQ">just landed a whopping $65 million round</a> from investors including Tiger Global, Madrona Group and Mayfield.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“The focus on diversity hiring and our unique approach to finding the talent and offering blind hiring features has super charged the adoption,” chief executive Anoop Gupta said in an interview earlier this year. That same toolkit is something that Talenya pitches its own customers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, businesses like WayUp are attempting to give employers a window into how the funnel narrows after the screening process. The company’s new tool provides an assessment for how diverse applicant pools are slowly winnowed down to a group of candidates that is far less diverse through the testing process.</p>
<p dir="ltr">WayUp co-founder and chief executive Liz Wessel said that the pool of applicants often narrows significantly after a battery of technical assessment and programming tests.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Similar to the SATs, many technical assessments have high correlation to socioeconomics status,” Wessel told TechCrunch.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While some startups focus on the hiring process itself, other companies are taking approaches to diversify-specific jobs or to try to recruit from particular talent pools to help increase diversity in the tech industry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That’s the mission that companies like <a href="https://flockjay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://flockjay.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620138501085000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEpPeBdCHkcyaxjXnhOQFfuU2jweg">Flockjay</a> and <a href="https://themomproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://themomproject.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620138501085000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHOjqXxmawZIxJ77c7up_7kn017dg">The Mom Project</a> have set for themselves.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Most people don’t even know that a job in tech sales is even a possibility,” Shaan Hathiramani, the founder and chief executive of <a href="https://flockjay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://flockjay.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620138501086000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEiH_9zZ6mVEKgMhLTvdK9WrdIBhQ">Flockjay</a>, a company offering a tech sales training curriculum to the masses, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/backed-by-marc-benioff-flockjay-pitches-its-sales-training-service-as-an-onramp-to-tech-careers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/backed-by-marc-benioff-flockjay-pitches-its-sales-training-service-as-an-onramp-to-tech-careers/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620138501086000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGOf7bi5jjiJLrOkcGuYQp33hCF8Q">said earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Hathiramani said his startup could be an on-ramp to the tech industry for legions of workers who have the skill sets to work in tech, but lack the network to see themselves in the business. Just like coding bootcamps have enabled thousands to get jobs as programmers in the tech business, Flockjay helps talented people who had never considered a job in tech get into the industry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s a way for non-coders to leverage soft-skills they’d developed in other industries, including retail and food services, to jump into the higher paid world of tech companies. And it’s a way for those tech companies to find a more diverse pool of workers who can bring different skill sets and perspectives to the table.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A few hundred students have gone through the program so far, Hathiramani said, and the goal is to train 1,000 people over the course of 2021. The average income of a student before they go through Flockjay’s training program is $30,000 to $35,000 typically, Hathiramani said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Upon graduation, those students can expect to make between $75,000 and $85,000, he said.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s obvious that tech needs to “do better” on inclusion, and <a href="https://themomproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://themomproject.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620138501086000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEjC2k05iqaMjKRiHI6bw0eWPFaXg">The Mom Project</a> — a Chicago startup that focuses on connecting women, including parents, with jobs from organizations specifically open to employing people who meet that profile — is one company tackling an aspect of the problem that’s become acute in the pandemic.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Sixty percent of the job losses in the pandemic have been women, and the statistics have been even worse for women of color,” said Mom Project chief executive Allison Robinson. “It’s like a canary in the coal mine.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">While The Mom Project doesn’t have any tools today to surface candidates that meet more diverse profiles on that front, Robinson <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/the-mom-project-raises-25m-for-its-job-site-aimed-at-women-returning-to-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/the-mom-project-raises-25m-for-its-job-site-aimed-at-women-returning-to-work/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1620138501086000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFFLSGdurncK8F-ylnVAKW3BPmocw">told TechCrunch that they are considering it </a>and how to approach that in a way that works.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Ultimately these are considerations that matter for companies of any size, according to Bain Capital Ventures managing director, Sarah Smith.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“No matter what, it’s important that from day one [that] you have an eye on how to build an inclusive culture, where in an ideal world, even that first person you’re bringing onto the team could walk in and feel fairly welcomed. And&#8230; you really want people to bring their best selves and they bring their perspectives and their ideas,” <a href="https://twitter.com/techcrunch/status/1377727469067907074">Smith told the audience at TechCrunch’s Early Stage Conference</a>. “I think it’s pretty common that a team might grow to like four or five from within the network, including the founders, [but] I think once you get to like number six, if you don’t have some type of gender or racial diversity yet… it’s gonna start to get really tough.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What we're looking at here is a fintech unicorn IPO. A great way to kick off the week, to be honest, though I'd thought that Robinhood would be the next such debut.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s a big morning for fintech startups today: <a href="https://www.flywire.com/">Flywire</a>, a Boston-based magnet for venture capital, has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001580560/000119312521146481/d469729ds1.htm#toc469729_16">filed to go public</a>.</p>
<p>Flywire is a global payments company that attracted more than $300 million as a startup, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/flywireco/company_financials">Crunchbase</a>, most recently raising a $60 million Series F last month. We don&#8217;t have its most recent valuation, but <a href="http://pitchbook.com">PitchBook data</a> indicates that the company&#8217;s February 2020, $120 million round valued Flywire at $1 billion on a post-money basis.</p>
<p>So what we&#8217;re looking at here is a fintech unicorn IPO. A great way to kick off the week, to be honest, though I&#8217;d thought that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/robinhood-files-confidentially-to-go-public/">Robinhood</a> would be the next such debut.</p>
<p>Fintech venture capital activity <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/optimism-reigns-at-consumer-trading-services-as-fintech-vc-spikes-and-robinhood-ipo-looms/">has been hot lately</a>, which makes the Flywire IPO interesting. Its success or failure could dictate the pace of fintech exits and fintech startup valuations in general, so we have to care about it.</p>

<p>Regardless, we&#8217;re doing our regular work this morning. First, what does Flywire do and with whom does it compete? Then, a closer look at its financial results as we hope to get our hands around its revenue quality, aggregate economics and growth prospects.</p>
<p>After that, we&#8217;ll discuss valuations and which venture capital groups are set to do well in its flotation. The company had a number of backers, but Spark Capital, Temasek, F-Prime Capital and Bain Capital Ventures made the major shareholder list, along with Goldman Sachs. So, a number of firms and funds are hoping for a big Flywire exit. Let&#8217;s dig in.</p>
<h2>What is Flywire?</h2>
<p>Flywire is a global payments company. Or, as it states in its S-1 filing, it&#8217;s &#8220;a leading global payments enablement and software company.&#8221; And it thinks that its market, and by extension itself, has lots of room to grow. While &#8220;substantial strides [have been] made in payments technology in the retail and e-commerce industries,&#8221; the company wrote, &#8220;massive sectors of our global economy—including education, healthcare, travel, and business-to-business, or B2B, payments—are still in the early stages of digital transformation.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the same logic behind Stripe&#8217;s epic valuation and the rising value of payments-focused companies like Finix.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">One the same day as Fortnite maker <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/03/apple-vs-epic-live-updates/">Epic Games goes to trial</a> with one of the biggest legal challenges to the App Store&#8217;s business model to date, it has simultaneously <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/artstation-is-now-part-of-epic-games">announced</a> the acquisition of the artist portfolio community <a href="https://magazine.artstation.com/2021/04/artstation-is-joining-the-epic-games-family/">ArtStation</a> &#8212; and immediately lowered the commissions on sales. Now standard creators on ArtStation will see the same 12% commission rate found in Epic&#8217;s own Games Store for PCs, instead of the 30% it was before. This reduced rate is meant to serve as an example to the wider community as to what a &#8220;reasonable&#8221; commission should look like. This could become a point of comparison with the Apple App Store&#8217;s 30% <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">commission</a> for larger developers like Epic as the court case proceeds.</p>
<p>ArtStation today offers a place for creators across gaming, media and entertainment to showcase their work and find new jobs. The company has had a long relationship with Epic Games, as many ArtStation creators work with Epic&#8217;s Unreal Engine. However, ArtStation has also been a home to 2D and 3D creators across verticals, including those who don&#8217;t work with Unreal Engine.</p>
<p>The acquisition won&#8217;t change that, the team says in its <a href="https://magazine.artstation.com/2021/04/artstation-is-joining-the-epic-games-family/">announcement</a>. Instead, the deal will expand the opportunities for creators to monetize their work. Most notably, that involves the commission drop. For standard creators, the fees will drop from 30% to 12%. For Pro members (who pay $9.95/mo for a subscription), the commission goes even lower &#8212; from 20% to 8%. And for self-promoted sales, the fees will be just 5%. ArtEngine&#8217;s streaming video service, ArtStation Learning, will also be free for the rest of 2021, the company notes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Games already are social networks&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/25/games-already-are-social-networks/embed/#?secret=qyGwoFnOKF" data-secret="qyGwoFnOKF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The slashed commission, however, is perhaps the most important change Epic is making to ArtStation because it gives Epic a specific example as to how it treats its own creator communities. It will likely reference the acquisition and the commission changes during its trial with Apple, along with <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/about">its own Epic Games Store</a> and its similarly low rate. Already, Epic&#8217;s move had prompted Microsoft to lower its cut on game sales, too, having recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/04/microsoft-follows-epics-lead-lowers-its-cut-of-pc-game-sales-to-12/">announced</a> a similar 30% to 12% drop.</p>
<p>In the trial, Epic Games will try to argue that Apple has a monopoly on the iOS app ecosystem and it abuses its market power to force developers to use Apple&#8217;s payment systems and pay it commissions on the sales and in-app purchases that flow through those systems. Epic Games, like several other larger app makers, would rather use its own payment systems to avoid the commission &#8212; or at the very least, be able to point users to a website where they can pay directly. But Apple doesn&#8217;t allow this, per its App Store guidelines.</p>
<p>Last year, Epic Games triggered Fortnite&#8217;s App Store expulsion by introducing a <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/the-fortnite-mega-drop-permanent-discounts-up-to-20-percent">new direct way to pay on mobile devices, which offered a steep discount.</a> It was a calculated move. Both Apple and Google immediately banned the game for violating their respective app store policies, as a result. And then Epic sued.</p>
<p>While Epic&#8217;s fight is technically with both Apple and Google, it has focused more of its energy on the former because Android devices allow sideloading of apps (a means of installing apps directly), and Apple does not.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Apple&#8217;s argument is that Epic Games agreed to Apple&#8217;s terms and guidelines and then purposefully violated them in an effort to get a special deal. But Apple says the guidelines apply to all developers equally, and Epic doesn&#8217;t get an exception here.</p>
<p>However, throughout the course of the U.S. antitrust investigations into big tech, it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/apples-app-store-commission-structure-called-into-question-in-antitrust-hearing/">discovered</a> that Apple did, in fact, make special deals in the past. Emails shared by the House Judiciary Committee as a part of an investigation revealed that Apple had agreed to a 15% commission for Amazon&#8217;s Prime Video app at the start, when typically subscription video apps are 30% in year one, then 15% in year two and beyond. (Apple says Amazon simply qualified for a new program.) Plus, other older emails revealed Apple had several discussions about raising commissions even higher than 30%, indicating that Apple believed its commission rate had some flex.</p>

<p>Ahead of today&#8217;s acquisition by Epic Games, ArtStation received a &#8220;Megagrant&#8221; from Epic during the height of the pandemic to help it through an uncertain period. This could may have pushed the two companies to further discuss deeper ties going forward.</p>
<p>“Over the last seven years, we&#8217;ve worked hard to enable creators to showcase their work, connect with opportunities and make a living doing what they love,” said Leonard Teo, CEO and co-founder of ArtStation, in a statement. “As part of Epic, we will be able to advance this mission and give back to the community in ways that we weren’t able to on our own, while retaining the ArtStation name and spirit.”</p>
