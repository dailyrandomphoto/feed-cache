										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Blue Origin successfully completed its first crewed launch Tuesday, sending four human passengers to space – including the company’s founder, Jeff Bezos. The result of billions of dollars of investment, dozens of test launches and some petty squabbling amongst ultra-rich founders, the triumph of the New Shepard, along with that of Virgin Galactic earlier this month, undoubtably heralds the dawn of a new age of space tourism.</p>
<p>It was quite the media spectacle. The mission took place at Launch Site One, Blue Origin’s sprawling and secretive facility that sits around thirty miles north of the small town of Van Horn, Texas. Every hotel in Van Horn and nearby towns were sold out of rooms in the days leading to launch as spectators traveled in for the event; meanwhile, a huge gaggle of local, national and online outlets (including yours truly) swarmed the Press Site as early as 2:30 AM CST. Despite some premature calls for rain in the early hours of the morning, the skies stayed clear and things mostly kept to schedule.</p>
<p>The four-person crew – including Bezos, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/jeff-bezos-and-his-brother-will-fly-on-blue-origins-first-human-spaceflight-with-auction-winner/">his brother, Mark</a>, 18-year old student Oliver Daemon, and aviation pioneer and Mercury 13 veteran Wally Funk – emerged from the training center and caught a Rivian R1S electric SUV to the launch pad around 45 minutes prior to launch. (Bezos drove a Rivian R1T pickup to the landing site of the rocket after its last test, a nod to Amazon’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/15/amazon-leads-700m-round-in-electric-automaker-rivian/">sizeable investment</a> in the EV startup). The crew climbed the launch tower and took a brief respite in an adjacent shelter, before climbing into the capsule, dubbed RSS First Step.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There was a brief hold at T-15 minutes, leading to the launch running slightly behind schedule. New Shepard took at 8:11 CST. They passed the Kármán line (more on that later) at 8:15 AM; capsule separation followed, and the booster returned to the launch site autonomously and with a loud boom at 8:19 AM. The crewed capsule floated slowly to Earth via parachute, touching land at 8:22 AM for an eleven-minutes total flight time.</p>

<p>The flight was the result of fifteen tests of the reusable suborbital New Shepard rocket, including a rehearsal launch in April that included a dry run of flight preparations and a mock crew embarked (then disembarked before take-off) into the capsule. Blue Origin now joins rival Virgin Galactic in a very, very small group of commercial space companies to send private citizens to orbit.</p>
<p>Daemon was added to the crew after the anonymous auction winner, who bid <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/12/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-auctions-off-seat-on-first-human-spaceflight-for-28m/">$28 million</a> for the seat, had to bow out due to a scheduling conflict. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/15/blue-origin-reveals-oliver-daemen-flying-to-space-with-jeff-bezos.html">CNBC reported</a> that Daemon’s father, CEO of the Dutch private equity firm Somerset Capital Partners, placed the second-highest bid.</p>
<h2>The route to space</h2>
<p>Bezos founded Blue Origin in 2000, six years after he started ecommerce behemoth Amazon. The company has zeroed in on space tourism, and it sees this flight as the requisite proof of concept it needs to start flying customers. To that end, the New Shepard capsule has large, tourism-friendly windows – the largest in spaceflight history, according to the company. “These windows make up a third of the capsule, immersing you in the vastness of space and life-changing views of our blue planet,” it says on the Blue Origin website.</p>
<p>The launch is also the culmination of weeks of squabbling between Bezos and his billionaire spacefaring rival, Richard Branson, who was aboard his own flight to space 10 days earlier. But despite ostensibly <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/11/virgin-galactic-and-richard-branson-celebrate-launch-of-first-passengers-into-space/">beating Bezos to the punch</a>, much of the fighting was over what actually counts as space – and whether VSS Unity, Virgin Galactic’s rocket-powered spaceplane, actually went there.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2179623" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/blue-origin-flight-8x.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179623" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2179623" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/blue-origin-flight-8x.gif" alt="" width="650" height="365" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2179623" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Blue Origin</p></div></p>
<p>The kerfuffle is over what’s known as the Kármán line, an internationally recognized imaginary boundary of space that’s around 60 miles above Earth. VSS Unity flew to around 51.4 miles – above the boundary recognized by NASA. “From the beginning, New Shepard was designed to fly above the Kármán line so none of our astronauts have an asterisk next to their name,” Blue Origin tweeted two days before the Virgin launch. <a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1413521627116032001">The tweet</a> also included a little infographic throwing further shade at on Virgin flights.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">From the beginning, New Shepard was designed to fly above the Kármán line so none of our astronauts have an asterisk next to their name. For 96% of the world’s population, space begins 100 km up at the internationally recognized Kármán line. <a href="https://t.co/QRoufBIrUJ">pic.twitter.com/QRoufBIrUJ</a></p>
<p>— Blue Origin (@blueorigin) <a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1413521627116032001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 9, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This is just the beginning for Blue Origin. Director of astronaut sales Ariane Cornell said at a pre-mission briefing on July 18 that she’s been “chatting with many of [Blue Origin’s] future customers who have signed for the subsequent flights.&#8221; She added that the company intends on launching two more flights this year, with CEO Bob Smith estimating that a second crewed New Shepard flight could take place in September or October.</p>
<p>What does this mean for the rest of us (as in, those that don’t have a couple extra million floating around in our bank accounts)? While the so-called billionaire space race is a petty squabble, both Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic’s respective launches are the likely heralds of a new age of space travel for consumers and scientists alike. It will be limited to the wealthy at first, but as TechCrunch’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/eat-the-rich-but-let-them-build-rockets-in-the-meantime/">Alex Wilhelm argues</a>, costs will go down and more humans will go to space – including scientists and researchers, maybe even me or you.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[As its name suggests, venture firm Pillar VC is focused on building "pillar" companies in Boston and across the Northeast.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As its name suggests, venture firm <a href="https://www.pillar.vc/">Pillar VC</a> is focused on building &#8220;pillar&#8221; companies in Boston and across the Northeast.</p>
<p>The Boston-based seed-stage firm closed a raise of $192 million of capital that was split into two funds, $169 million for Pillar III and $23 million for Pillar Select. More than 25 investors are backing the new fund, including portfolio founders.</p>
<p>Jamie Goldstein, Sarah Hodges and Russ Wilcox are Pillar VC&#8217;s three partners, and all three lead investments for Pillar. The trio all have backgrounds as entrepreneurs: Goldstein, who has spent the past two decades in VC, co-founded speech recognition company PureSpeech, which was acquired by Voice Control Systems; Hodges was at online learning company Pluralsight; and Wilcox was CEO of electronic paper company E Ink, which he sold in 2009.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Pillar typically invests in a range of enterprise and consumer startups and aims to target Pillar III at startups focused on biology, enterprise SaaS, AI/ML, crypto, fintech, hardware, manufacturing and logistics. The firm will make pre-seed investments of $50,000 to $500,000 and seed-round investments of $2 million to $6 million.</p>
<p>One of the unique aspects of the firm is that it will buy common stock so that it will be aligned with founders and take on the same risks, Goldstein told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The firm, founded in 2016, already has 50 portfolio companies from its first two funds — Pillar I, which raised $57 million, and Pillar $100 million. These include cryptocurrency company Circle, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/cryptocurrency-company-circle-to-go-public-in-spac-deal/">announced a SPAC</a> earlier this month, 3D printing company Desktop Metal that went public, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/desktop-metal-going-public-in-spac-led-deal-that-could-value-3d-printer-company-at-2-5b/">also via SPAC</a>, last year, and PillPack, which was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/28/amazon-buys-pillpack-an-online-pharmacy-that-was-rumored-to-be-talking-to-walmart/">bought by Amazon</a> in 2018.</p>

<p>“Pillar is an experiment, answering the question of &#8216;what would happen if unicorn CEOs came in and helped bootstrap the next generation&#8217;,” Wilcox said. “The experience is working, and Pillar does what VCs ought to do, which is back first-of-its-kind ideas.”</p>
<p>In addition to leading investments, Hodges leads the Pillar VC platform for the firm&#8217;s portfolio companies. Many of the portfolio companies are spinouts from universities, and need help turning that technology into a company. Pillar provides guidance to recruit a CEO or partner on the business side, leadership development, recruit talent and makes introductions to potential customers.</p>
<p>Pillar also intends to invest a third of the new fund into that biology category, specifically looking at the convergence of life science and technology, Wilcox said.</p>
<p>In its second fund, the firm started Petri, a pre-seed bio accelerator focused on biotech, and brought in founders using computation and engineering to develop technologies around the areas of agriculture, genetics, cell and gene therapies, medical data and drug discovery. The third fund will continue to support the accelerator through both pre-seed and seed investments.</p>
<p>The first investments from Pillar III are being finalized, but Hodges expects to infuse capital into another 50 companies.</p>
<p>“We are super bullish on Boston,” she added. “So many companies here are growing to be household names, and an exciting energy is coming out.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Fabric8Labs this morning announced that it has raised $19.3 million. The Series A was led by Intel Capital and features Lam Capital, TDK Ventures, SE Ventures, imec.xpand, Stanley Ventures and Mark Cuban. It follows $4 million in seed funding raised in mid-2018.</p>
<p>The San Diego-based startup specializes in metal 3D printing. It’s a hot category, of late, as evidenced by Desktop Metal and Markforged’s decisions to go public via SPAC over the past two years. Fabric8Labs says lower cost and less energy consumption are among the benefits to its process.</p>
<p>“Our process is inherently different and does not utilize powder nor thermal processes. Instead, it is based on electrochemical deposition, which operates at room temperature, has a significantly lower power demand, and utilizes an aqueous (water-based) solution made from low-cost metal salts,” CEO Jeff Herman tells TechCrunch. “In combination, the commodity priced raw materials and power-efficient process enable a step change in reducing the total cost of ownership and cost per-part.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Desktop Metal going public in SPAC-led deal that could value 3D printer company at $2.5B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/26/desktop-metal-going-public-in-spac-led-deal-that-could-value-3d-printer-company-at-2-5b/embed/#?secret=rkkRk1FC3s" data-secret="rkkRk1FC3s" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company says the funding will go toward doubling its headcount before the end of the year, increase development of its existing technology and showcase its ability to print high-resolution copper pieces. The company plans to bring the technology to market, but notes that goals of hitting a general market will be a multiyear process.</p>
<p>Scalability is always one of the biggest question marks around any kind of additive manufacturing. Herman says 3D printing for manufacturing is firmly in Fabric8Labs’ sights.</p>
<p>“Our technology is extremely scalable,” the executive says. “The vision we share with our partners is to deploy our technology at a massive scale in the factories of the future, with process capabilities and economics uniquely positioned to tackle high-volume manufacturing. A Fabric8Labs-enabled factory could easily consist of 50+ automated systems sharing large feedstock reservoirs, similar to other large-scale electrochemical processes in operation today.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Commercial real estate has been slow to embrace technology, with most deals still paper-heavy and complicated.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Commercial real estate has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/this-is-a-good-time-to-start-a-proptech-company/">slow to embrace technology</a>; though it has an addressable financing market of more than $40 billion, putting together a deal is still mostly manual, paper-heavy and complicated.</p>
<p>New York-based <a href="https://www.levcapital.com/">Lev</a> is taking on this problem by automating workflows online and gathering hundreds of millions of data points into machine learning software to ensure financing accuracy. To do this, the commercial real estate financing transaction platform raised $30 million to give it a $130 million valuation just two years into its inception.</p>
<p>The latest financing comes four months after the company raised $10 million in seed funding led by NFX. Greenspring led the latest round, with participation from First American Title. Existing investors NFX, Canaan Partners, JLL Spark, Animo Ventures and Ludlow Ventures also joined in to give Lev total investments of more than $34 million, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lev/company_financials">Crunchbase data</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Lev founder and CEO Yaakov Zar previously co-founded Boston-based Dispatch, which built tools for home services businesses. It was when he and his wife went through the homebuying process — and their mortgage fell through — that Zar decided to look at real estate financing.</p>
<p>He channeled his frustration into becoming a licensed mortgage loan originator. After relocating to New York, Zar was helping a friend at a nonprofit organization refinance their building and got a firsthand look at what he said was a fragmented commercial real estate mortgage industry.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/16/digital-lending-platform-blend-valued-at-over-4b-in-its-public-debut/">Companies like Blend</a> are addressing the problem of real estate lending, Zar told TechCrunch, but very few are focusing on commercial real estate, where lending is sensitive to interest rates and total amortization. In addition, property owners have a burden of refinancing every five to 10 years.</p>
<p>“Legacy businesses like JLL, which is an investor, Cushman Wakefield and CBRE work on lending, but they are much more ‘relationship focused’ than tech focused,” Zar said. “We think that it is a necessary part because the deals are so large and complex that you need a relationship for them, but transactions less than $1 billion are pretty straightforward. On experience and product, no one is close to us.”</p>

<p>Initially, Zar and his team wanted to build the “Rocket Mortgage of commercial real estate lending,” but found that to be difficult because real estate brokers are putting together their own pitch books for lenders. Instead, Lev is building a technology platform of more than 5,000 lenders with information on what projects they like to finance. It then analyzes a customer’s portfolio and connects them in minutes with the right lender, taking 1% of the loan amount for each transaction as payment. Lev is also working to be able to close deals online.</p>
<p>Zar wasn’t looking for funding when he was approached by investors, but said he was introduced to some people who liked the company’s growth and trajectory and decided to accept the funding offer.</p>
<p>He intends to use the new funding on product development, with the aim of giving a term sheet in seconds and closing a loan in seven days. Right now it can take a week or two to get the term sheet and 45 to 90 days to close a loan.</p>
<p>The company has about 40 employees currently in its New York headquarters, Miami R&amp;D center, Los Angeles outpost and remotely. Continued investments will be made to expand the team.</p>
<p>Lev grew 10 times in volume in the past year, closing approximately $100 million of loans in 2020. Zar expects to close over $1 billion in 2021.</p>
<p>“Customers come back to us repeatedly, and there are a ton of referrals,” Zar said. “We want to be the platform on which capital market transactions are processed. You need an advantage to network and find great deals. I don’t want to mess with that, but when you find it, bring it to us, we will close it and provide the asset management with the best option to close online and manage the deal from a single platform.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pete Flint, general partner at NFX, told TechCrunch that he got to know the Lev team over the last 18 months, checking in on the company during various stages of the global pandemic, and was impressed at how the company navigated it.</p>
<p>As co-founder of Trulia, he saw firsthand the problems in the real estate industry over search and discovery, but as that problem was being solved, the focus shifted to financing. NFX is also an investor in Tomo and Ribbon, which both focus on residential financing.</p>
<p>Wanting to see what opportunities were on the commercial real estate side, Flint heard Lev’s name come up more and more among brokers and industry insiders.</p>
<p>“As we got to know the Lev team, we recognized that they were the best team out there to solve this problem,” Flint said. “We are also among an amazing group of people complementing the round. The folks that are deep industry insiders will put a helpful lens on strategy and business development opportunities.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In May, Path Robotics announced a $56 million Series B. It was a sizable raise, as far as robotics rounds go. But the Columbus, Ohio-based startup is already back for more, raising a “pre-emptive” Series C a mere two and a half months later.</p>
<p>And it’s a biggie. The firm has raised $100 million, led by Tiger Global and featuring participation from Silicon Valley Bank, an existing investor. The deal brings the robotic welding firm’s total funding to $171 million.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2179596" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179596" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2179596" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Computer-Vision.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Computer-Vision.jpg 4800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Computer-Vision.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Computer-Vision.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Computer-Vision.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Computer-Vision.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Computer-Vision.jpg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Computer-Vision.jpg?resize=2048,1151 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Computer-Vision.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2179596" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Path Robotics</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Path cites a longstanding shortage of skilled welders as a primary driver in interest around its tech. The problem dates back before the global pandemic (though that’s likely only exacerbated the issue, as it has with so many other labor issues). Once again, it notes a study by the American Welding Society that says the U.S. alone will experience a shortage in the welding workface of around 400,000 by 2024.</p>
<p>From the sound of it, the company is already looking beyond welding. After all, construction is a huge business, with massive opportunities for the right robotics organization. And, of course, having an infusion of $100 million certainly doesn’t hurt your growth plans.</p>
<p>“Most robots merely repeat what they are told, with no ability to improve themselves. The future of manufacturing hinges on highly capable, flexible robotics,” CEO Andrew Lonsberry said in a statement. “Robots that can truly see and learn.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2179597" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2179597" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2179597" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Creating-a-path.png" alt="" width="1000" height="1000" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Creating-a-path.png 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Creating-a-path.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Creating-a-path.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Creating-a-path.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Creating-a-path.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Creating-a-path.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Creating-a-path.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Creating-a-path.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Creating-a-path.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Creating-a-path.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2179597" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Path Robotics</p></div></p>
<p>What, precisely, those future plans are, the company doesn’t say, but it plans to build them atop of its imaging and AI, presumably to build a sort of modular ecosystem for the construction robotics category.</p>
<p>Tiger Global partner Griffin Schroeder hints at those plans in a statement. &#8220;Path’s innovative approach to computer vision and proprietary AI software allows robots to sense, understand and adapt to the challenges of each unique welding project. We believe this breakthrough technology can be adopted for many other applications and products beyond just welding, to serve their customers holistically.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Electric fat tire bike manufacturer Rad Power Bikes has unveiled the latest model of its flagship RadRover, and at $1,999, it appears to be cheaper than its predecessor, which goes for $1,699. The updates on the RadRover 6 Plus are emblematic of the company&#8217;s mission to enhance rider experience, especially for those who don&#8217;t identify as bike riders but are looking for a more eco-friendly way to travel.</p>
<p>&#8220;We develop powerful, reliable bikes, bikes that are confidence-inspiring and easy to use,&#8221; Redwood Stephens, chief product officer of Rad Power Bikes, told TechCrunch. &#8220;We&#8217;ve completely redesigned the system to have a new user interface, big buttons, big text illuminated. The power button is in Rad orange, so when you walk up to the bike it says, &#8216;I&#8217;m the power button!&#8217; to you. You don&#8217;t even have to tell somebody how to turn on the bike. The same with the power assist levels. You&#8217;ve got big up and down arrows which are super easy to use.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stephens said the company&#8217;s goal is to get people out of cars. Rad Power&#8217;s main customers aren&#8217;t urban bikers, and at 73 pounds a bike, it&#8217;s not hard to see why – Try lugging that up your third floor walkup. Rather, they&#8217;re people over 50 in suburban or rural areas who want another travel option besides their four-wheeled vehicle and would definitely benefit from letters symbols on their e-bike that are as large as those on their cell phones, according to data collected by the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In February, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/rad-power-bikes-raises-150-million-as-electric-bike-sales-boom/">Rad Power Bikes raised $150 million</a> from investors like Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Counterpoint Global Fund and Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company. It used the funds, one of the largest of a U.S. electric bike startup, to scale globally, expanding beyond the $100 million in sales it generated in 2019.</p>
<p>Now, with over 350,000 bikes on the roads, Rad Power Bikes is settling into its direct-to-consumer approach with a thoughtful strategy, one that integrates everything from the design and robustness of the vehicle to the price point to the delivery and packaging.</p>
<p>&#8220;So in a nutshell it&#8217;s about reducing friction of the user experience throughout the whole lifetime of the product,&#8221; said Stephens. &#8220;It starts with the information that we have on our website to the box arriving with your bike in it and a QR code on a box that says, &#8216;Here&#8217;s the link to the unpackaging video,&#8217; and then thinking about how to make that as smooth as possible for the end user.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stephens says the company is so concerned with a smooth customer experience, right down to how you take the bike out of its box, that Rad Power&#8217;s packaging and designing engineers work right alongside the bike designers so that the direct-to-consumer experience is considered throughout the design process. In other words, nothing is an afterthought.</p>
<p>In North America, customers who don&#8217;t want to unbox the bike themselves can opt for a white glove delivery service, complete with bike assembly.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Rad Power Bikes raises $150 million as electric bike sales boom&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/rad-power-bikes-raises-150-million-as-electric-bike-sales-boom/embed/#?secret=wVs8g5NT1H" data-secret="wVs8g5NT1H" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h3>What&#8217;s new with the RadRover 6 Plus?</h3>
<p>Rad Power&#8217;s newest model is the first of its kind to feature hydraulic brakes and ceramic brakepads, which means riders will need to apply less pressure to slow down or stop, and they can expect brakepads to have a longer lifespan and require less maintenance. There&#8217;s also been some updates to the battery, which was designed in-house and lives directly in the frame of the bike, which not only looks kind of cool but it&#8217;s also easy to remove for indoor charging.</p>
<p>The frame itself has been re-engineered to accommodate shorter people, and the center of gravity has been lowered, which the company says should improve handling. The geared hub motor has 750 wattage of power, which is the same as the RadRover 5, but the company says the 6 Plus can handle hills 25% faster.</p>
<p>The suspension has also changed, but perhaps not for the better. The last model had 80 mm of travel, and the 6 Plus has 60 mm, which might mean there&#8217;s less space for the wheel to move before bottoming out, but according to the vehicle specs, the spring preload can be adjusted to suit various rider weights and terrain.</p>
<p>Finally, like the last model, this one comes with front, rear and brake lights, but it has the added benefit of activating the lights when the bike turns on and a new fender-mounted tail light.</p>
<h3>Sounds great. Why is it so cheap?</h3>
<p>Honestly, this seems like a steal. Where <a href="https://www.specialized.com/us/en/shop/bikes/turbo-e-bikes-its-you-only-faster/c/ebikes">some e-bikes</a> go for a cool $9,000, this one is surprisingly affordable at $1,999. Stephens says he doesn&#8217;t always know why other manufacturers are as expensive as they are.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our batteries use state-of-the-art Panasonic or Samsung cells, which are the same providers for the electric car industry, and so our packs are bigger,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our motors and speed controllers are top notch, and our bikes are very reliable in the industry. Our motors last a long time. We see many of our riders with over 10,000 miles on their bike and still going.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stephens speculates that the biggest differentiator between Rad Power and many other e-bike providers is the supply chain. Rad Power designs its bikes from the ground up, so it doesn&#8217;t buy off-the-shelf products, like motors, displays and batteries, from a company like Bosch.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are less middlemen, less people in the manufacturing supply chain for us marking up systems,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And because we&#8217;re direct-to-consumer, there&#8217;s no markup from the retail shop to the consumer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rad Power has manufacturing locations in China, Taiwan and Thailand that make the components the company designs and sends them at a very large scale, which also helps to keep the price down.</p>
<p>The company has four retail stores in Seattle, San Diego, Vancouver and Europe where it also sells its bikes, and it has also set up a partner network with local bike shops that are certified to work on its bikes and even assemble them from the box at customers&#8217; homes. Stephens said the company is on track to have 75% of its U.S. customers have rad service available to them this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founded in 2014 as an in-person rowing studio, CityRow was relatively early to adopt the at-home connected model. The New York-based company launched a digital platform in 2018, two years before the pandemic completely transformed the way many of us work out. Of course, things have been trending that way a while, but 2020 accelerated home fitness in ways few thought possible.</p>
<p>CityRow says it experienced a 375% revenue growth last year, largely on the strength of rowing machine sales and platform subscriptions. Today, it’s announcing that it has raised a $12 million Series A, led by JW Asset Management, with help from Sol Global and K2. The company says it has a number of plans for the money, but first and foremost is the addition of livestreaming classes to its current on-demand content selection.</p>
<p>“All of this capital is really about us hyper growing the company in the ways we know our consumers want us to grow,” founder and CEO Helaine Knapp tells TechCrunch. “First up is launching live classes, and we just signed a lease. We’re moving into a space in Midtown (Manhattan), to be able to launch these live classes, as soon as this fall. That’s a massive undertaking that we’ve been excited about launching for some time.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The studio is an upgrade for CityRow, which has thus far recorded its content at one of its corporate locations. Knapp says the company doubled its headcount in the past year (currently at 14 full-time corporate employees) and is on track to double that in the next year.</p>
<p>CityRow offers a pair of connected Rowers, the Go Classic and the recently launched Go Max, which retail for $1,295 and $2195, respectively. They work with the company’s mobile app, which also offers off-rower exercise courses. It currently operates 11 locations &#8212; two corporate-owned and nine franchises. The company says it has sold 64 franchises in all, with plans to launch 12 in the next year.</p>
<p>Obviously some of those plans were paused during the pandemic.</p>

<p>“It’s still early days, in terms of comeback,” says Knapp. “But I’m very proud of how our franchisees weathered the storm, with a lot of them being very new studios. And I think that’s a testament to the power of the brand and the community with the franchises.”</p>
<p>Knapp points out that everyone who belongs to one of the locations also gets free access to CityRow’s app, which may have incentivized customers to maintain their membership during closures.</p>
<p>“Digital fitness was already growing like crazy before the pandemic,” explains Knapp. “And it just accelerated us, if I had to guess, a couple of years faster. Digital fitness is still only a fraction of the market, but in-person is still the majority by a landslide”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ensuring food safety compliance can be challenging at one restaurant, let alone across thousands of restaurants. <a href="https://www.zenput.com/">Zenput</a> has developed technology aimed at making sure operating procedures are quickly adapted so that businesses maintain quality.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based operations execution company raised $27 million in Series C financing, led by Golub Capital, to continue developing its application to automate operation procedures like tracking food safety, public health protocols and changing market conditions.</p>
<p>Restaurants, convenience stores and grocery chain customers can use Zenput to update all of their locations — at the same time — with new processes, promotional campaigns and key initiatives while also gathering data and insights from those locations to find opportunities for improvement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Joining Golub in the round were existing investors, including Jackson Square Ventures, MHS Capital and Goldcrest Capital. This brings the company’s total funding to more than $47 million, co-founder and CEO Vladik Rikhter told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Greg Gretsch, founding partner and managing director at Jackson Square Ventures, led Zenput’s Series A round in 2016 and had met Rikhter a year prior. At the time, Rikhter was in the early stages of developing what Gretsch called an organization task manager. While he didn’t invest then, he kept in touch with Rikhter and saw “how much of a grinder he was” in expanding the platform.</p>
<p>“When he sees a problem, he works and works to solve it,” Gretsch said. “Whenever you have a multilocation business, you have a remote management problem. You’re trying to manage everything so your weakest link can perform as best as the best link, but you need a platform to manage that so that you can hold stores accountable to improve the end product.”</p>
<p>Front-line workers use Zenput’s mobile app for onboarding at the beginning of the day and to track safety compliance and fresh food checks, something Rikhter said was historically challenging once a business had thousands of locations. The app can also alert when food has been left out too long to assist in lowering food waste rates.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 2012, Zenput is currently used by customers like Chipotle, Domino’s, P.F. Chang’s, Five Guys, Smart &amp; Final and 7-Eleven in over 60,000 locations across more than 100 countries.</p>
<p>The Series C round comes as the company saw 100% revenue growth over the past year. At the same time, product usage more than doubled at stores, and to date, 1.5 billion questions were answered through Zenput, a figure Rikhter expects to double over the next 12 months as locations aim to find ways to do more things remotely.</p>
<p>“The pandemic inadvertently helped us,” he added. “Initially, it was rough, but then a lot of the brands we dealt with needed to expedite technology and saw an opportunity to invest in our technology. We have more products coming because there is more that can be done to make sure every meal is a safe meal.”</p>
<p>Much of the new funding will go toward building those new products and capabilities and into marketing to expand the customer base. The company recently launched an expansion of its Zenput for Franchisors tool and updates to its food prep labeling and temperature monitoring functions.</p>
<p>Rikhter also plans to double Zenput’s employees over the 16 to 18 months, especially in the product engineering and marketing areas.</p>
<p>All of that is to be ready for customer demand as restaurants, convenience stores and grocery chains do more to change up the way they do business in the future.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised to show up at a restaurant and see changes made daily on protocols, which will drive a lot more of the journey than before,” Rikhter said. “We see more operators flexing muscles they didn’t know they had, as it relates to promotions and products, so they can grow faster and run totally different operational features and offer more options for customers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electric scooter operator Superpedestrian has announced its acquisition of Navmatic, a startup that helps micromobility operators locate vehicles and correct their movements in real time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The companies did not reveal the details of the buy, which was finalized last month, but those close to the deal say the number is not far off from Navmatic&#8217;s last funding round, which was $4 million raised in seed funding last June. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Navmatic purchase means Superpedestrian can apply the startup&#8217;s Super Fusion technology to enhance its vehicle safety systems. Pedestrian Defense, as the new system is called, can detect unsafe riding behaviors – like riding the wrong way down a one-way, aggressively swerving, sidewalk riding or repeated hard braking – and either notify the rider or correct the rider’s behavior in real time by slowing or stopping the scooter. Riders receive a safety rating at the end of the ride that is used to deliver customized safety training, to incentivize good behavior via discounts or to blacklist chronically unsafe riders.</span><b></b></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20210630-france-to-crack-down-on-e-scooters-after-two-riders-knock-down-and-kill-woman"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As more stories surface about scooter-related accidents,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> picking on the shiny, new tech amid the commonplace majority of car-related road collisions, <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2020/12/17/spin-on-vehicle-artificial-intelligence-platform.html">Spin</a> and <a href="https://www.voiscooters.com/blog/voi-launches-e-scooter-trial-of-computer-vision-technology-designed-to-prevent-pavement-riding/">Voi</a> have also tacked on additional tech meant to keep riders in line and protect pedestrians. Rather than focus on positioning software like Navmatic’s, they’ve turned to computer vision startups Drover AI and Luna. Given an unobstructed camera, Spin and Voi vehicles can, unlike Superpedestrian’s, actually detect pedestrians with some degree of accuracy. But where they fall short is actually stopping the rider or correcting behavior in the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The current challenge is how to protect the more vulnerable people around a scooter, meaning pedestrians, people with disabilities, a man or a woman with a stroller,” Assaf Biderman, CEO of Superpedestrian, told TechCrunch. “For that you need a very precise location, you need characterization of the rider&#8217;s behaviour and you need context awareness, like is the rider blocking the right of way? You don’t need a camera if you train your data right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biderman says Superpedestrian runs a microprocessor with Navmatic’s software on its LINK scooters&#8217; operating systems, which is where all of Superpedestrian’s maps live. That software is trained on a variety of sensors, including vision for ground truth and high definition maps. During a ride, real time computations analyzing data picked up from the scooter are done on the edge of the microprocessor, combining raw GPS data, multiple dimensions of inertial sensing and vehicle dynamics to calculate very precise location and movements of the vehicle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With Navmatic’s software, location detection significantly improved, and all of a sudden you can really do this kind of analysis of the minute motions of someone on a scooter or small vehicle,” said Biderman. “Our response time is now about 0.7 seconds.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Paul White, director of development and public affairs at Superpedestrian, the vehicle’s location accuracy improvement ranges from 70% to 90% depending on local conditions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both companies say such precise location data, coupled with the ability to control the vehicle’s movements, is a superior solution to vision, one that is potentially cheaper but definitely more scalable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re not gonna put a $1,000 or $2,000 lidar on a scooter, right?&#8221; said Biderman. &#8220;What you&#8217;re able to do through sensor fusion helps you to overcome the limitations of vision alone, which is bad at night, can get dirty and can fail a lot, or GPS alone, which can suffer from reflection and shadows. When you combine as many sensors as you can, you benefit from the best of all worlds, and it just keeps learning and improving.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Superpedestrian has boasted its ability to better control its vehicles by owning the full stack, from operating system to hardware, compared to other operators that buy off-the-shelf operating systems.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Superpedestrian positions itself as the go-to partner for cities with new e-scooter safety upgrades&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/superpedestrian-positions-itself-as-the-go-to-partner-for-cities-with-new-e-scooter-safety-upgrades/embed/#?secret=hHHP4jaIb6" data-secret="hHHP4jaIb6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;We had a lot of challenges trying to integrate our tech with other companies because every time they needed to change a line of code, they had to contact the manufacturer which could take a week to make any changes,&#8221; Boaz Mamo, CEO and founder of Navmatic, told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Superpedestrian&#8217;s software-first approach to this acquisition was also attractive to one of the company&#8217;s current investors, Dan Herscovici, partner at Edison Partners.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most other acquisitions by scooter companies are usually a play for market share,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not as typical to see micromobility companies really leaning on IP and tech to really enhance the vehicle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Herscovici said Superpedestrian looked at many solutions in the marketplace to solve for the problem of pedestrian safety and city compliance, and even considered developing its own tech. Balancing time-to-market and the need to move quickly, the ever-present threat of losing city permits looming over their head, acquiring Navmatic seemed like the right decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way I generally like to think about the micromobility space is that there are three major constituencies,&#8221; said Herscovici. &#8220;The first is the rider, and that&#8217;s what most micromobility companies think about. How do you attract them and keep them riding? The next is the city or municipality, and the next and most forgotten about is the non-rider, the ones sharing the road. I think the industry has been searching for a way to modify rider behavior based on safety regulations and this acquisition unlocks that capability.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mamo also pointed out that Pedestrian Defense unlocks the capability for cities to get some insights into how riders are traveling and how they might be able to make better infrastructure decisions.</p>
<p>Biderman said Superpedestrian is building around 50,000 scooters this year, with every new vehicle the company builds containing this new technology starting December. Next year, the company will begin deploying the upgraded vehicles in the new cities it&#8217;s moving to, as well as switching out older models in cities Superpedestrian has an existing presence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">MIT CSAIL spinout Inkbit this week announced that it has raised $30 million. The Series B, led by Phoenix Venture Partners LLC, brings the firm’s total funding up to $45 million. PVP joins existing partners like industrial 3D printing giant Stratasys, DSM Venturing, Ocado, 3M, IMA and Saint-Gobain.</p>
<p>Inkbit was founded in 2017, building on technology developed with a financial assist from DARPA. The company currently holds the exclusive licensing rights to that technology. Its primary differentiator from the slew of existing 3D printers is a vision and AI system designed to identify and correct mistakes during the printing process.</p>
<p>Mistakes can be quite frequent &#8212; and costly &#8212; in additive manufacturing. Inkbit&#8217;s technology uses imaging to scan each printed layer, compare it against the original plan and then adjust accordingly to correct errors on the fly. The latest round of funding follows the February release of the company’s Vista printer, which builds on Inkbit’s Vision-Controlled Jetting (VCJ) closed-loop feedback technology.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Inkbit is currently experiencing significant growth and we are excited to have the opportunity to continue to build our talented team and scale the company to meet customer demand,” co-founder and CEO Davide Marini said in a statement. “The opportunities for additive manufacturing are growing as adoption of 3D printing for full-scale production increases. We look forward to using our raised capital to continue evolving and innovating within this dynamic industry.”</p>
<p>The round will be used to expand the sales reach of its new printer, both in the U.S. and into additional markets, including Asia and Europe/Middle East/Africa.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Almost overnight, platforms that offer non-dilutive capital for recurring revenue businesses have become white-hot. It was only in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/19/pipe-raises-250m-at-a-2b-valuation/">March</a> that Pipe — which aims to be the “Nasdaq for revenue” — raised $150 million, but two months later had raised $250 million at a $2 billion valuation.</p>
<p>This fever is now reaching Europe, where today <a href="http://Capchase.com">Capchase</a> raises an additional $280 million in new debt and equity funding, led by i80 Group, following a $125 million round in June. But unlike Pipe, Capchase is playing both in the US and in Europe, where it has made €100m available to more than 50 companies in its first month of operation on the continent.</p>
<p>Right now it’s live in the UK and Spain but expects to expand across Europe this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Spanish-American company is also now launching ‘Capchase Expense Financing’ to enable companies to manage their largest expenses – such as legal bills, cloud hosting services, payroll and bonus payments, and recruitment fees &#8211;  without depleting their cash reserves, in either 3, 6, 9, or 12-month increments.</p>
<p>Miguel Fernandez, co-founder, and CEO of Capchase said: “Our new expense financing solution is a first in the industry, and we believe it will be a game-changer. Since we launched just over a year ago, we’ve seen first-hand the challenges that companies face when securing the financing they need to grow their business. Managing large expenses and having to make difficult decisions over how they spend their cash is one of the most consistent and trying issues that our clients face. There’s also a great opportunity to reduce costs by making use of the upfront discounts that vendors provide. Now Capchase users can pay upfront with Capchase, get a discount, and pay Capchase monthly over the following months.”</p>
<p>At interview Fernandez told me their main competitor is venture debt: “That is the one that we constantly keep winning against.”</p>
<p>He said: “We&#8217;re not limited to just monthly or quarterly subscriptions, we can work with any revenue. We apply intelligence to it and work with customers. It’s not just the ability to pull forward revenues to find the growth, but also what is the implied schedule in order to achieve a business goal.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://sundae.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sundae</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a residential real estate marketplace that pairs sellers of dated or damaged property with potential buyers, has raised $80 million in a Series C funding round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> co-led by Fifth Wall and General Global Capital.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">QED Investors, Wellington Management, Susa Ventures, Founders Fund, First American Financial, Prudence Holdings, Crossover VC, Intersect Capital, Gaingels and Oberndorf Ventures also participated in the financing. The round marks San Francisco-based Sundae’s third financing in a 13-month time frame, bringing its total raised since its August 2018 inception to $135 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The San Francisco-based company declined to reveal at what valuation its Series C was raised. It also declined to provide hard revenue figures, saying only that it saw a 600% year-over-year increase in revenue from June 2020 to June 2021.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup aims to help people who need to sell dated or “damaged” properties for a variety of reasons &#8212; such as job loss, illness or divorce. In some cases, according to CEO and co-founder Josh Stech, such vulnerable sellers get taken advantage of by &#8220;predatory fix and flippers” seeking to capitalize on their misfortune. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since sellers in these situations don’t typically have the funds to fix up their properties before selling, Sundae lists the property for them on its platform &#8211; serving as an intermediary between sellers and investors. There, it is visible to about 2,600 qualified off-market buyers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company essentially aims to aggregate demand from “fix and flippers,” who use the marketplace to bid against each other for distressed properties. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the seller accepts and an inspection is completed, the company offers a $10,000 cash advance before closing to help homeowners with moving costs or other expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our goal is to displace wholesalers who exploit desperate or uninformed sellers and lock them into a contract which they turn around and assign to a property investor at a steep profit,” Stech said. “The tens of thousands of dollars in lost equity that goes to a wholesaler could mean the difference between paying off debts, or having enough money to retire.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sundae claims that on average, sellers receive 10 offers within three days on its marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its launch in January 2019, the startup has slowly been expanding its marketplace geographically. It went from operating in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">four markets in California at the end of last year to now operating in 14 markets across Florida, Colorado, Georgia, Texas and Utah. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sundae makes money by charging buyers in its investor marketplace a fee when it “assigns” them a property. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first quarter of this year, the startup launched a dedicated online marketplace for investors, where they can view properties and submit offers. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once an investor signs up to join the marketplace, they can access the full inventory of properties, including information such as photos, floor plan, 3D walkthrough and a third-party inspection report. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, the company plans to use its new capital to expand to new markets, invest in its platform and “build brand awareness.” It also, of course, plans to boost its current headcount of 180 mostly remote employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vik Chawla, a partner at Fifth Wall, believes Sundae is serving a segment of the residential real estate market that has historically been overlooked. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Their marketplace model simultaneously solves a crucial pain point for sellers by disrupting the wholesale industry, while delivering a platform that property investors can count on for reliable investment opportunities,” he said.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://t.co/z9hNHQ0TmU?amp=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a $60M early-stage fund co-founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/joshbuckley">Josh Buckley</a>, Product Hunt’s current CEO along with writer, founder and designer <a href="https://twitter.com/dcurtis">Dustin Curtis</a>. Two ex-Sequoia operators are part of the team at launch as well. <a href="https://twitter.com/MalikaCantor">Malika Cantor</a> as Partner and GM and Ashton Brown as Head of Program. The fund launches today and is self-described as ‘inspired by the Product Hunt community’. </span></p>
<p><strong>The Now</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement today is the Hyper the fund, and the fact that they’re opening applications to a small cohort of 25 companies. The applications are planned to open for roughly 4 weeks every quarter and the deadline for this tranche is August 10th, 2021 at midnight PT. The second cohort will open in November 2021. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund is launching as a straight up venture effort, with a bit of gas added by the Product Hunt association. The team will be writing $300k checks for 5% of very early companies in any arena that seems promising to the partnership in a fixed deal structure that mirrors Y-Combinator.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund is taking applicants worldwide though notes that some countries present legal complexities for investment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund will exist as a ‘sister company’ to Product Hunt (though it’s going to technically own it). Product Hunt, however, is the first of what the team says will be many companies it will own, create and operate in order to provide ‘direct value’ to its portfolio companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had a chat with Buckley, Curtis and Cantor about the new fund and company and the way that they hoped to differentiate Hyper in a world of aggressively service-oriented venture firms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hyper concept sounds fresh in combination, if not in components.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A short list of some of the people involved as advisors, mentors or investors themselves includes Alexis &amp; Serena Williams, Alfred Lin of Sequoia, Garry Tan of Initialized, Harry Stebbings, Jeffrey Katzenberg, Naval Ravikant, Owen van Natta, Ryan Hoover, Ryan Tedder of OneRepublic and Sriram Krishnan of a16z. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a pretty eclectic group, but if you squint you can see the shape of the ambitions that Hyper has reflected in the parties involved. A mix of media, venture and product figures is probably the right way to go if you want to back yourself into a media empire funded by venture capital returns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyper itself is trying to establish two lines of business. A portfolio of wholly owned companies like Product Hunt (which still counts AngelList as a majority investor and Ravikant on its board) and other new media brands. And the other component which includes the portfolio of Hyper funds (plural theirs) and a founder program that includes mentorship, twice-a-year-events, and other future efforts &#8212; eventually. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mentorship component that Hyper hopes to add for founders in the fund is an 8-week founder program that includes individuals from “partners” like Andreessen Horowitz, AngelList, Sequoia Capital, the Twenty Minute VC Podcast and Product Hunt helping founders to solve ‘key challenges’. Some of the participants are investors in Hyper, though none of the funds participated themselves The group includes some close to home figures as well, in Product Hunt GM Ashley Higgins and founder Ryan Hoover.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The program will also offer office hours with experts, an exclusive Product Hunt launch event and a Public Hyper Demo Day and Investor Demo Day to participate in within a year of being in the program.</span></p>
<p><strong>The Later</strong></p>
<p>Though the current plans center around small cohorts with a founder program, the ambitions for long term include adding a layer of differentiation that goes beyond fixed checks and partner access.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The short version is: distribution. It’s hard to argue with the overall assumption that the Hyper team is working under &#8212; capital is majorly commoditized. Frankly, sometimes that’s all you want from an investor whose value add is more of a thorn in your side than anything. But, especially at the early stage there are a few funds and firms that offer a strong value outside of writing checks in the form of, say, hiring, sales introductions or board members that have relevant operational experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where Hyper differs, says Buckley, is that they see distribution as the biggest value add for a nascent startup at the stages where the firm hopes to invest. Product Hunt is one opportunity that he points to as an example. It’s an established launch pad to an audience of extreme early adopters that can provide a seed of a real user base &#8212; Hyper itself is </span><a href="https://t.co/xFChlu7aG6?amp=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">launching via a post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the platform. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll let the Hyper team’s words spell out what they say is its thesis:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyper believes that every company (B2B or B2C) needs access to distribution channels to find customers, users, and talented employees to join their teams. Hyper works with early-stage companies at three key junctures in a startup&#8217;s journey:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initial customer acquisition and validation (often at the pre-Seed stage)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First product/company launch and hiring (often at the Seed stage)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scaling customer acquisition and fundraising (before the Series A)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founders who go through the program will remain a part of the tight-knit Hyper founder community long past their Series A.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few months, Buckley says that Product Hunt has grown headcount by around 50% in part to boost its ability to act as an enhanced distribution channel. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’ll be building additional media products as well, especially ones that focus on areas of hyper growth and high interest in order to both generate deal flow and to feature companies in the portfolio. Interestingly, unlike many marketing-operations-disguised-as-journalistic-enterprises, Curtis says that they want these to be real, functioning media companies and that startups funded by Hyper will be presented on those sites and platforms in clearly defined sections that make it clear that they are part of the program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an example, the team is careful to state that Product Hunt will remain a ‘neutral platform’ for launching products and that Hyper companies will get clearly marked slots on the site. </span></p>
<p>Long term &#8212; the team stresses that these are not immediate and will take time to implement &#8212; the team plans to sustainably fund the media entities using the firm&#8217;s management fees and profits which will be split between investment partners and the media apparatus. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Curtis says that there could be other ways to obtain capital to speed up this process that is allowed by the unique structure of Hyper like debt or equity financing. That could be important given that carry does not kick in for a while in a traditional fund. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An enormous amount of ink has been spilled on the spinning up of the VC media apparatus as a bullhorn for a tech-optimism POV. But most of that content is understood to be talking the firm’s book and not intended to be seen as journalism. Though the media publications that Hyper is planning on forming have yet to be realized, there is enough of a differentiating spark here that could make it a unique play that attempts to straddle the worlds of editorial and venture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have thoughts about the way that venture and media interact, as you might imagine given what I do and <em>waves hands at the masthead</em> where we are having this little chat. Combining a media and investing apparatus is not a new concept &#8212; as TechCrunch </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/technology/michael-arrington-techcrunch-blogger-to-invest-in-start-ups.html?_r=1&amp;ref=technology"><span style="font-weight: 400;">readers will know</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But it’s not without its complexities. Enthusiast media that works does so for a couple of major reasons, in my opinion:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Genuine obsession with the subject matter.</strong> The writers, editors and even business people involved must have a crazy thirst to understand and contextualize the subjects that they write about. There can be no in-between here, as they are speaking every day to an audience that is just as obsessed with it as they are and can detect any level of commitment to it that is less than 100%. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A patina of either trust or candor built over time.</strong> You can go into it with some bona-fides that you buy with a big name hire or series of them, and the reputations that they’ve built elsewhere. But if you’re full of shit, you’re going to lose &#8212; no matter how well positioned and funded you are. You may ‘win’ long term by turning what you’re doing into something else, a broad interest publication in niche clothing, for instance. But you won’t win at the enthusiast level.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>An intense, punishing commitment to momentum.</strong> The further you delve into any niche, the more knowledgeable your audience will be. This means that you must produce uniquely insightful, crisp, well-researched content every day and you must do it with a level of granularity that surpasses anyone else in your niche. Your audience lives and breathes this stuff so if you’re telling them things they’ve already read on 3 message boards, in private texts or in their work slack then you’ve lost. You’ve got to get subcutaneous and not just superficially so. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And when you add in a layer of complexity that is proudly announcing your vested interests in the success of particular companies, it just ups the level of difficulty massively. I don’t think that it’s at all </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">impossible</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to run a fund that feeds a media arm, but it’s definitely a ‘doing a really hard thing while also on fire’ kind of operation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which doesn’t mean that Hyper can’t pull it off. Product Hunt is the model for what they’re trying to do, creating close-to-the-ground media that attracts as many operators and investors as it does early adopters. Duplicating that in a variety of publications and events, however, is not easy at all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will say that a bet on distribution as value add is still one of the better stabs that I’ve seen lately. The capital is, as Buckley told me, readily and generically available. And having your calling card be “we can help the first 10, 20 or 30 thousand people know that you even exist” isn’t a bad situation at all. It works.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is, after all, what we do at TechCrunch, we just don’t take a cut. </span></p>

<p>Four months after announcing its last round, <a href="https://employmenthero.com/">Employment Hero</a> has closed another $140 million AUD (about $103 million USD) in funding. The Series E was led by <a href="https://www.insightpartners.com/">Insight Partners</a>, the venture capital firm known for its ScaleUp program to help tech companies accelerate their growth.</p>
<p>Employment Hero is an automated human resources, payroll and benefits platform for SMEs. Founded in Sydney in 2014, the company is now expanding into Southeast Asian and Western European markets. Its previous funding announcement was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/australia-based-employment-hero-raises-45m-aud-for-its-global-expansion/">a $45 million AUD Series D announced in March</a>, led by online job platform SEEK, at the company&#8217;s previous valuation of about $250 million AUD.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Now Employment Hero has bumped up its valuation $800 million in less than six months by reaching 133% year-on- recurring revenue growth. Co-founded by Ben Thompson, its chief executive officer, and chief technology officer Dave Tong, Employment Hero is used by 6,000 businesses, with a total of 250,000 employees. Over the past 12 months, the company says $14 billion in gross wages was processed through the platform.</p>

<p>“We always thought Insight Partners would be a great partner,” Thompson told TechCrunch. “We had been speaking with them for years, so when they asked if we would consider raising, we agreed it was definitely worth exploring. As it turned out all the stars were aligned, and we reached a deal that made sense and allowed us to keep scaling without having to switch back into capital raising mode.”</p>
<p>Over the past year, Employment Hero grew its headcount by 65% to 325 full-time employees and now has a permanent remote-first work model. The new capital will be used to hire for its engineering teams and for the company’s continuing international expansion.</p>
<p>Employment Hero began entering new markets in October 2020, launching localized versions of the platform in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Malaysia and Singapore.</p>
<p>Thompson said Employment Hero will continue focusing on Malaysia and Singapore until the end of this year, while looking at ways to cross-promote SEEK’s products and services in Asia. After that, it plans to localize Employment Hero for Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Hong Kong and Vietnam.</p>
<p>To localize the platform, Employment Hero starts with employment contracts, policies, leave rules and pay rules. Then it integrates with tax authorities and pension funds, before focusing on local benefits providers to get discounts on non-discretionary expenses for users, like health insurance and mortgages.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, Thompson said Employment Hero’s teams shifted their focus to help companies adapt to a distributed workforce. Some of the services it launched include Global Teams, a professional employer organization (PEO) solution that pushes job openings to more than 1,700 career boards and helps companies onboard and manage remote workers. Employment Hero is also working with recruitment agencies that will help employers find remote workers.</p>

<p>Thompson said, “while it’s still early days for Global Teams, it’s definitely popular,” with dozens of companies in Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand using it to employ people in 21 countries.</p>
<p>Employment Hero’s Remote Work Report, released in June, found that 94% of respondents want to continue working remotely at least one day a week, up from 2% a year ago. Meanwhile, 74% of employers surveyed told Employment Hero that they plan to keep flexible working arrangements after COVID restrictions are lifted, up from 64% in 2020.</p>
<p>“We are seeing employers embrace remote work as a competitive advantage because it broadens their available talent pool and helps retain and engage their employees,” Thompson said. “Employers are now asking, how should we do things differently if we want to continue working remotely forever? This requires real intention and education, but it’s a whole lot better than losing great employees by forcing them back to office five days a week.”</p>
<p>In a statement about the investment, Insight Partners managing director Rachel Geller said, “We have been following Employment Hero’s journey for four years and have seen the impressive and consistent growth experience by the company. Its customer-centric solutions have been embraced globally by the small and medium business community and we are looking forward to supporting them through this next phase of their expansion journey.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This morning <a href="https://www.mural.co/">Mural</a>, a startup that builds digital collaboration software with a focus on visual presentation, announced that it has closed a $50 million Series C. The new capital, co-led by prior investors Insight Partners and Tiger Global, values the startup at more than $2 billion.</p>
<p>Previously, Mural was valued at around $500 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/visual-collaboration-startup-mural-raises-huge-118m-series-b/">when it closed a $118 million round last August</a>. Mural also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/27/mural-raises-23m-series-a-after-history-of-capital-efficient-growth/">raised a $23 million Series A</a> at the start of 2020.</p>
<p>Mural&#8217;s product focuses around a visual collaboration space, akin to a digital whiteboard. Given its product focus, it&#8217;s not hard to see why the startup had a good COVID cycle; the world&#8217;s companies moved to remote work en masse, leaving offices empty and physical whiteboards un-scribbled. Services like Mural helped fill that, and similar voids. TechCrunch caught up with Mural CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/batmelon">Mariano Suarez-Battan</a> and Insight managing director <a href="https://twitter.com/nikhilsachdev">Nikhil Sachdev</a> to learn more about deal mechanics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new unicorn also disclosed that customers generating $100,000 in ARRR tripled to more than 100 organizations in the last year, and that it now has seven customers bringing in at least $1,000,000 in ARR apiece. That second figure is up from a &#8220;couple&#8221; seven-figure deals at the start of 2020, a figure that the company disclosed at the time of its Series A.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TvZJU8FtjB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/visual-collaboration-startup-mural-raises-huge-118m-series-b/">Visual collaboration startup MURAL raises huge $118M Series B</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Visual collaboration startup MURAL raises huge $118M Series B&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/visual-collaboration-startup-mural-raises-huge-118m-series-b/embed/#?secret=TvZJU8FtjB" data-secret="TvZJU8FtjB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Per Suarez-Battan, Mural has continued the torrid pace of growth that made it a breakout company in 2020. In the last year the company has tripled its annual recurring revenue (ARR), he said. That&#8217;s the same pace of growth that the company disclosed when it raised its Series B in Q3 2020. As the company has now disclosed that it has tripled in each of the last two years, we can infer that the company has reached material top line scale.</p>
<p>Mural &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/10/mural-ly-opens-its-web-based-creative-collaboration-platform-to-the-public/">known as Mural.ly through 2019</a> &#8212; however, was growing before the pandemic, and doesn&#8217;t appear to think that the eventual conclusion of the pandemic will be too deleterious to its growth rates. In a discussion concerning the company&#8217;s path after COVID-19, Suarez-Battan noted that many of his company&#8217;s customers have multiple offices in disparate locations. Those concerns, even if they returned to a fully in-office setup in time, would still have need for Mural and its software, goes the argument.</p>
<p>With more companies flipping to hybrid-friendly work environments, part-time office cultures, or fully remote organization structures, Mural&#8217;s market is moving toward its vision of collaboration at scale sans the need to be sitting next to the people with whom you are trying to be creative. Underscoring the point, Sachdev told TechCrunch that COVID was a &#8220;huge pull forward&#8221; in a trend that was long underway: remote work. He believes that companies executing collaborative, or creative work at a distance was a reality merely accelerated by COVID, not created by it.</p>
<p>The dollar amount of the Series C may seem a bit odd. Why did Mural raise less in its Series C than it did in its preceding Series B? Mural still had most of its previous round on its books, Sachdev said. Our read from that fact is that Mural simply didn&#8217;t need to raise another huge round. So, it didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Insider demand led to the funding event, which for Mural represents incredibly modest dilution (it sold around 4% of its shares at its new valuation) and a massive upsizing in its valuation (a little under 4x). Effectively, Mural was just handed the ability to go out into the market and buy whatever smaller companies and talent it wants, without worrying about dilution or cash concerns, respectively.</p>
<p>Quick growth wasn&#8217;t the only reason that Tiger and Insight wanted to buy more of Mural. According to the Insight MD, the startup has retained strong levels of efficiency as it has scaled, venture-speak for an ability to rapidly expand revenues while not similarly boosting the pace at which cash is consumed. It&#8217;s the venture equivalent of crowing about operating leverage, essentially.</p>
<p>Suarez-Battan also emphasized during his interview with TechCrunch that his company&#8217;s net dollar retention, or NDR, is strong. NDR is a key metric for modern software companies, as marginal revenue gains from existing customers are cheaper to secure than net-new accounts. Again, the theme that the metric details is efficient growth.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s lots to Mural worth our chewing on in time. The loop of consultants using its service, leading to new customers. How the firm works with consultants, period. The list goes on. Let&#8217;s see how quickly Mural can keep growing in the second half of 2021. The next time we chat with the firm it will be time to harangue it for hard revenue figures. Let&#8217;s see how that goes!</p>

Founded in India, <a href="https://www.healthifyme.com/">HealthifyMe</a> is betting that users around the world will prefer its range of customizable health programs. The Bangalore-based company announced today it has closed a $75 million Series C from LeapFrog and Khosla Ventures, with plans to grow its user base in India, Southeast Asia and North America.</p>
<p>HealthifyMe is the first Indian health tech startup LeapFrog has invested in, and Khosla Ventures’ largest investment in India to date. The company did not disclose its post-money valuation, but co-founder and chief executive officer Tushar Vashisht told TechCrunch it is now at “soonicorn” status.</p>
<p>Unilever Ventures, Elm and Healthquad also participated in the round along with returning investors Chiratae Ventures, Inventus Capital and Sistema Asia Capital. HealthifyMe has now raised more than $100 million in total.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Vashisht said HealthifyMe is India’s top health and fitness app, but its long-term goal is to become the global leader. In North America, it is popular among Indian expat and Indian American communities, and now it will target other customer segments, too.</p>

<p>HealthifyMe’s products include HealthifySmart, which uses AI-based tech to customize diet plans for users, and HealtifyCoach, which also includes live conversations with coaches. During the pandemic, it launched two products: HealthifyPlus, for people who are managing chronic conditions like diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, high cholesterol or hypertension, and HealthifyStudio, with live workout classes.</p>
<p>The app also has a AI-based nutritionist called Ria that is trained for cuisines in different markets through a combination of user-tracked data, guidance from local nutritionists and databases from sources like the United States Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>HealthifyMe will work with LeapFrog’s research and development hub, ImpactLabs, to develop more programs for people with chronic health conditions.</p>

<p>HealthifySmart and HealthifyStudio, its newest products, already contribute 25% to the company’s line. HealthifyMe also says it doubled its user base and revenue over the last year, recently surpassing 25 million downloads, and is currently on target to reach $50 million in annualized recurring revenue within the next six months. It has about 1,500 trainers and coaches on the platform, with plans to add 1,000 more to support its expansion.</p>
<p>Since HealthifyMe began operating first in cost-sensitive markets, it started using AI early on to scale efficiently, Vashisht said. As a result, it is able to offer products at lower prices than its competition.</p>
<p>“Today in the U.S., you have free DIY calorie counting solutions like MyFitnessPal and expensive human-assisted coaching and diet solutions like Noom and WeightWatchers,” said Vashisht. “But nothing in the middle exists that allows one to track nutrition and calories while getting advice at an affordable price point.”</p>
<p>About 25% of HealthifyMe’s revenue comes from outside of India, including Singapore and Malaysia. When it enters a new market, the company localizes its services using a playbook.</p>

<p>“We begin by building a food database with local foods. We also tailor our search algorithms and app language to ensure accurate food searches take place in the app,” Vashisht said. “Next, we hire 50 diet and fitness coaches locally to cater to the region’s population via the platform and launch HealthifyCoach locally. Once we have sufficient data, we were able to retrain and refactor our AI to suit local preferences.” That is how the company launched HealthifySmart in Singapore and Malaysia, and it plans to do the same thing in North America.</p>
<p>The company measures the efficacy of its program through user-reported statistics and working with researchers like Sridhar Narayan, a professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, to verify and analyze its data. Vashisht said average paying subscribers lose about 8 pounds in 180 days, while the top 10% lose more than 20 pounds.</p>
<p>For its HealthifyPlus customers, the company has seen a statistically significant impact on their Hemoglobin A1C (Hb1AC), LDL cholesterol and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. Vashisht added that HealthifyMe plans to publish its results in the coming months, and also hopes to integrate with diagnostics providers in the future to track clinical indicators.</p>
<p>Part of the new funding will be used to double HealthifyMe’s current engineering and design teams, including through acqui-hires, with the company looking for digital health and wellness companies to buy.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been a wild 2021 for NFT auction marketplace <a href="https://opensea.io/">OpenSea</a>. The startup was exceedingly well-positioned in a niche space when NFTs exploded earlier this year seemingly out of nowhere. Since then, the startup has found its user base expanding, the total volume of sales skyrocketing and more investor dollars being thrown at them.</p>
<p>The startup announced in March, it had closed a $23 million Series A, and now some four months later, the company tells TechCrunch it has raised another $100 million in a Series B round led by Andreessen Horowitz at a $1.5 billion valuation. Other investors in the round include Coatue, CAA, Michael Ovitz, Kevin Hartz, Kevin Durant and Ashton Kutcher.</p>
<p>Despite a fall from stratospheric heights in the early summer, the broader NFT market has still been chugging along and OpenSea is continuing to see plenty of action. The startup saw $160 million in sales last month and is on track to blow past that figure this month, CEO Devin Finzer tells TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Pi2mk0twDn"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/nft-marketplace-opensea-raises-23-million-from-a16z/">NFT marketplace OpenSea raises $23 million from a16z</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;NFT marketplace OpenSea raises $23 million from a16z&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/nft-marketplace-opensea-raises-23-million-from-a16z/embed/#?secret=Pi2mk0twDn" data-secret="Pi2mk0twDn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>One of the company&#8217;s clearer growth roadblocks has been infrastructure issues native to the Ethereum blockchain that its marketplace has been built around. The Ethereum blockchain, which has a number of network upgrades outstanding, has struggled to keep up with the NFT boom at times, leaving users footing the bill with occasionally pricey &#8220;gas&#8221; fees needed to mint an item or make a transaction. Though these fees have largely cooled down in recent weeks, OpenSea is aiming to make a move towards long-term scalability by announcing that they plan to bring support for several more blockchains to its platform.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re starting with Polygon, a popular Layer 2 Ethereum blockchain which boasts a more energy-efficient structure that will allow OpenSea to entirely eliminate gas fees for creators, buyers and sellers on that blockchain. Losing these fees may give OpenSea a better shot at expanding its ambitions, which include finding a future for NFTs in the gaming world and in the events space, Finzer says.</p>
<p>Beyond Polygon, OpenSea has plans to integrate with Dapper Labs&#8217; Flow blockchain as well as Tezos down the road, the company says.</p>
<p>Operating across multiple blockchains could create some headaches for consumers operating across platforms with differing levels of support for each network. Some NFT investors are also more hesitant to buy items on blockchains they see as less time-tested than Ethereum, worrying that newer chains may lose support over time. But overall, the user-friendly changes will likely be well-received by the wider NFT community which has seen the explosion in new interest stress-test its systems and highlight need for user interface and user experience improvements.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The “subscribe to your car” movement has been taking off in recent years, with the appearance of Fleks in the UK (Europe), Cazoo (after its acquisition of Drover), Care by Volvo Hertz, to name just a few.</p>
<p>Into this space has appeared <a href="https://imove.no/en">imove</a> out of Norway, with what appears, at least, to be a new twist on the whole thing: a white-label platform offered to industry to enable it to offer these car subscription services under their own brands. imove’s platform allows users to subscribe to electric vehicles from eighteen different manufacturers and over 50 different models.</p>
<p>The startup has now closed a €19M / $22.3M Series A round led by pan-European online car market AutoScout24. It was joined by the VCs Norselab and Idekapital, as well as the Norwegian state climate investment company Nysnø. Existing owner Hedin Automotive also joined. The round consists of a new equity issue of €13M combined with a €6M secondary sale of shares.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Founded in 2018, imove allows a company in automotive, finance, insurance, or even electricity and telecoms, to offer car subscriptions as an alternative to car ownership or leasing.</p>
<p>The team is led by co-founders Hans Kristian Aas (CEO) and Gunnar Birkenfeldt (CPO), who are jumping on a trend whereby (according to some estimates) some 20-30% of new car sales globally are predicted to be switched to car <em>subscriptions</em> by 2025.</p>
<p>Hans Kristian Aas, co-founder, and CEO said: “Amazing customer feedback, strong unit economics, and an industry ripe for change told us that the timing was right for pushing the ‘Scale button’.”</p>
<p>AutoScout24 is a large, pan-European online car market, and will act as a distribution channel for imove’s electric vehicle subscription service.</p>
<p>“With this investment, AutoScout24 clearly positions itself at the forefront of supporting new ownership models for consumers and customers, and makes a decisive step in supporting the EV introduction,” said Chief Strategy Officer at AutoScout24, Borja Muller.</p>
<p>While imove is clearly moving fast in Europe, there are several players offering technology for car subscription and fleet management. These include <a href="https://ridecell.com">Ridecell</a> (US-based), Clutch (US-based, owned by Cox Automotive), <a href="https://fleetonomy.io">Fleetonomy</a> (Israel) and <a href="https://vulog.com">Vulog</a> (France). So there&#8217;s plenty to play for in this race yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The global Covid-19 pandemic had a chilling effect on a number of industries and their workforces, resulting in mass furloughs and layoffs. But now, with countries now taking steps back to &#8220;normal&#8221;, that has been leading, in many cases, back to a hiring surge. Today, <a href="https://www.smartrecruiters.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SmartRecruiters</a>, one of the companies that has built software to handle that process more smoothly, is announcing $110 million in funding to seize the moment.</p>
<p>The funding, a Series E, is coming in at a $1.5 billion valuation, the company confirmed. Silver Lake Waterman is leading this round, with previous backers Insight Partners, and Mayfield Fund also participating.</p>
<p>The investment will be used in two areas. First, SmartRecruiters plans to continue expanding business &#8212; its primary customers are large enterprises with Visa, Square, McDonald’s, Ubisoft, FireEye, Biogen, Equinox and Public Storage among them, and the plan will be to bring on more of these globally. Jerome Ternynck, SmartRecruiters&#8217; CEO and founder, pointed out that one of its clients, <a href="https://pilotflyingj.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://pilotflyingj.com/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1626864422076000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFvcCWW0t7BEq0qrmIGecJMXxzP8g">Pilot Travel Centers</a>, made a move recently in which it had to swiftly ramp up by 10,000 people in 90 days.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;That is the scale of the great rehire that we are aiming to serve,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>And second, it plans to hire and invest more in product. Specifically, Ternynck said the company is looking to build more intelligence into its platform, so that it can help customers find ideal matches for roles and provide them with tools to automate and reduce the busy work of managing a recruitment process.</p>
<p>This is a notable area for growth, and one that smaller startups have also identified and are building to fix: just yesterday, one of them, Dover, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/dover-raises-20m-to-bring-the-concept-of-orchestration-to-recruitment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a Series A</a>.</p>
<p>Ternynck likes to describe SmartRecruiters as &#8220;the Salesforce of recruiting&#8221;, by which he means that it provides a system of record for large enterprises who can manage 100% of the process of recruitment, from sourcing candidates to hire.</p>
<p>&#8220;In recruiting tech, we are the mothership,&#8221; he said, with some 600 vendors integrated into its platform &#8212; a mark of how fragmented the wider industry really is.</p>
<p>(Salesforce, incidentally, is an investor in SmartRecruiters, and while right now it&#8217;s not directly working with its portfolio company to build recruitment into what it operates as essentially a massive CRM behemoth, it&#8217;s an interesting prospect and seems like a no-brainer that it might try to some day. Ternynck would not comment&#8230;)</p>
<p>There are already a lot of application tracking systems in the market that can handle the basics of logging candidates and managing their progress through the screening, interview, references, and hiring/rejection cycle &#8212; Ternynck, in fact <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerometernynck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded and sold</a> one of the pioneers in that space, But the problem with these is that they are limited and often work within their own silos. He refers to these ATS systems as &#8220;the first generation&#8221; of recruitment software, a generation that is now getting replaced.</p>
<p>There are some big changes driving that evolution, and specifically SmartRecruiters&#8217; growth. One key area is the bigger shift in &#8220;digital transformation&#8221;, precipitated by the pandemic but also a bigger shift to cloud-based computing and evolutions in big data management. Fragmentation is rife in recruiting, but we now are equipped in the world of IT with many, many ways of navigating that and using the wide amount of information out there to our advantage.</p>
<p>But there is another, more epistemological shift, too. Recruitment, and talent in general, has become a critical part of how a company conceives of its future success. Get the right people on board and you will grow. Fail to hire correctly and you will not, and you might even fail.</p>
<p>&#8220;This round and our progression signals the fact that CEOs have been forced to care more about recruiting,&#8221; he said. They want want to hire the best, he added, but that is fundamentally different from how recruiting has traditionally been approached, which is focused on cost per hire.</p>
<p>&#8220;This means recruiting is coming out of the administration function and into value add and sales and marketing,&#8221; he added. (That&#8217;s another interesting parallel with Dover which has gone so far as to conceive of its recruitment approach as &#8220;orchestration&#8221;, a word more commonly associated with sales software.)</p>
<p>The pandemic has had an impact here, too: employees and &#8220;hires&#8221; today are not what they used to be. It has become more acceptable to work remotely, and what people have come to expect out of jobs, and what roles they are coming from when applying, are all so different, and that also demands a different kind of platform to engage with them.</p>
<p>Indeed, that bigger area &#8212; sometimes referred to as &#8220;the future of work&#8221; &#8212; is part of what attracted this investment.</p>
<p>“Hiring talent and building human capital is more complex and important than ever, and SmartRecruiters is well positioned to help companies attract and land top talent,” said Shawn O’Neill, Managing Director and Group Head, Silver Lake Waterman, in a statement. “Their scale and customer growth are testament to their strong leadership and industry leading platform. We are excited to help fuel SmartRecruiters&#8217; next growth chapter.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, Ternynck noted that even despite the mass layoffs and furloughs experienced in some industries in the last year and a half, SmartRecruiters has seen business grow, even through some of the worst moments of Covid-19. Over the last 12 months, bookings have grown by 70%, he said. That&#8217;s a mark of how recruiting priorities are indeed changing, regardless of whether it&#8217;s a SmartRecruiters, or another kind of company entirely &#8212; and there are many, from Taleo and Cornerstone, through to smaller hopefuls like Dover, and even Salesforce &#8212; who might reap the spoils longer term.</p>
