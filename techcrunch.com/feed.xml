										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a world of copycat companies and investment firms that also increasingly operate in similar ways, Jack Abraham stands out a bit.</p>
<p>His venture firm, <a href="https://atomic.vc/">Atomic</a>, only writes checks to startups it spins up itself. It&#8217;s launching a <em>lot</em> of startups, too. Since founding and selling a company called Milo to eBay in 2010 at the age of 24, Abraham has cofounded dozens of companies with Atomic in recent years. Among them: the tele-health company Hims &amp; Hers, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/21/telehealth-startup-hims-fell-in-its-public-trading-debut-and-thats-fine-with-its-ceo/">went public</a> last year through a blank-check company; Bungalow, a online marketplace for residential real estate that closed on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-24/bungalow-valuation-soars-over-600-million-as-deer-park-invests?sref=gni836kR">$75 million in funding</a> at a post-money valuation of $600 million in August; and OpenStore, an eight-month-old startup that acquires e-commerce businesses that sell on Shopify and which just today announced <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/11/17/openstore-keith-rabois-raises-75-million-shopify/?sh=7a9e7ffa3bea">$75 million in fresh funding</a> in a deal that<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2021/11/17/openstore-keith-rabois-raises-75-million-shopify/?sh=7a9e7ffa3bea"> reportedly</a> values the company at $750 million.</p>
<p>Altogether, Atomic has produced 14 companies over the last 12 months, and that&#8217;s on top of nine that it formed the year earlier. Notably, it has done this with not enormous amounts of funding (it closed a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/atomic-which-only-funds-the-startups-it-launches-just-closed-its-newest-fund-with-260-million/">$260 million fund</a> earlier this year). Atomic doesn&#8217;t have a sprawling team, either, though it has made some key hires recently that bring its headcount to 50. (It was previously run by roughly 15 people.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235876" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Little wonder that traditional venture firms are starting to wonder if Abraham might be on to something. To get insight into his playbook for their benefit &#8212; and our own &#8212;  we sat down with him late <a href="https://strictlyvcinsf.splashthat.com/">last week</a> while he was in town from Miami, where he relocated from the Bay Area last year. Excerpts from our conversation, edited for length and clarity follow. (You can also catch the full conversation below.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235885" style="width: 2058px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235885" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2235885 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51674493462_5b5b16d0b2_k.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1365" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51674493462_5b5b16d0b2_k.jpg 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51674493462_5b5b16d0b2_k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51674493462_5b5b16d0b2_k.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51674493462_5b5b16d0b2_k.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51674493462_5b5b16d0b2_k.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51674493462_5b5b16d0b2_k.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51674493462_5b5b16d0b2_k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235885" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dani Padgett /</p></div></p>
<p><strong>TC: With valuations soaring so high, so fast, more and more VCs are talking about incubating companies in order to own more for a lot less capital. For their benefit, how is the sausage made at Atomic?</strong></p>
<p>JA: I think in reality, it&#8217;s actually pretty difficult to do venture capital and building companies at the same time. You see some firms doing it, where partners might start a company once every two years or three years, and that&#8217;s because when you&#8217;re operating in venture capital, you&#8217;re in a receiving mode. You&#8217;re getting so much email, you&#8217;re getting deal flow, your job is to source, you&#8217;re in meetings all the time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>At Atomic, we show up every day and play offense with our cofounders to build companies. We&#8217;ve also really worked on scaling up our team [including to bring in experts in marketing, finance, healthcare, and recruiting because] you have to build a team of builders to be able to do this.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You don&#8217;t have a billion dollar fund; how do you pay for all that headcount? </strong></p>
<p>JA:  A lot of venture capital funds take the fees from the fund and distribute them just to the partners. We&#8217;re really trying to invest in our team to grow the team and support our companies. We have an amazing legal team at Atomic, for example, and rather than get billed $1,200 for talking to someone at a corporate law firm, we have someone who is equal to them who will get charged that cost to the company. There are some resources that are billed at utilization based on how much our companies use them, but completely at cost, and that helps offset some of the costs of those services where our companies might have spent that money elsewhere.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w_lZAWf0hS0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;e also saving money obviously by building companies in house and thus avoiding paying a lot for small stake in someone else&#8217;s startup. How do you generate an idea, and how do you think about Atomic&#8217;s ownership percentage over time?</strong></p>
<p>JA: We&#8217;re strong believers that it&#8217;s much better to observe problems in the world and come up with solutions for them . . . rather than doing brainstorming exercises. Sometimes those can lead to contrived ideas. So we try really hard across our portfolio to find patterns of things that are broken, problems that exist in industries we operate in, where whitespaces could exist, and note those problems. And we now have a list of well over 600 different company ideas that we can draw from. And we have a process for whittling those ideas down, testing them, getting smarter about them them, engaging experts, and ultimately choosing which of them we want to build.</p>
<p>One advantage of our model [is] proprietary deal flow. Every company we create, our LPs get to invest in at predefined ownership levels. So by the time our companies come out and raise from venture capitalists, the ownership levels are much higher than most investors would have, which gives us room to play around with other investors and bring them in. We like collaborating with people. We have a lot of repeat customers that like working with us. We&#8217;re happy to be good citizens and figure out the right way to make that work.</p>
<p><strong>TC: It looks from past deals that Founders Fund is one of them. You even cofounded a company this year with Keith Rabois called OpenStore. Before we get to that, I wanted to ask about telemedicine. Atomic&#8217;s first big hit was Hims, which came together in anticipation of ED drug patents expiring, making it possible to sell generic versions. I wonder how replicable that model is and how closely you&#8217;re tracking the many other drugs falling off the patent cliff. Could those be 50 of the 600 business ideas?</strong></p>
<p>JA: [Hims was created in part from] an observation around &#8216;How do you find painful things people are suffering from, and get them treated online for [that condition]?&#8217; And &#8216;are there medications that are under-penetrated that could help those conditions?&#8217; . . . rather than some master strategy of observing when all drugs are coming off of patent and then tracking them all and seeing what we could build businesses off of. There are still a lot of opportunities in that space, but no, they do not comprise 50 of the 600 ideas.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You have a wide range of companies. Do you think in terms of sectors?</strong></p>
<p>JA: From the outset, in building Atomic, a lot of people told me, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you specialize? Why don&#8217;t you just do one kind of company? Why don&#8217;t you just do e-commerce companies, for example?&#8221; In some ways that would be a lot easier, right? You can build common infrastructure, you can rinse and repeat, and everything can be cookie cutter. [But] Marc Andreessen is one of our investors, and he told me when I was starting Atomic that there are 15 companies that are produced each year that matter.</p>
<p>The odds that those big ideas are going to occur in the same sector over and over again is very, very low. So by definition, we chose to be agnostic. And that has led us into basically everything: healthcare, fintech, education, prop tech, commerce, AI, SaaS, consumer products. Nothing is off limits for us. Nothing really scares us. And the world&#8217;s changing so quickly that I actually think you need to have that mindset to catch the next big thing.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How do you find &#8212; and financially motivate &#8212; the founders who you need to lead these companies?</strong></p>
<p>JA:  Thee two ways that we go about it. We can either start with the person or the people, or we can start with the idea. In the case where we&#8217;re starting with the person or people, we just want to work with them as an individual. We&#8217;re kind of totally agnostic to the idea. So we&#8217;re just like, &#8216;We&#8217;ll work on anything with you. Let&#8217;s find something that we&#8217;re both excited about, and let&#8217;s keep going.&#8217; We&#8217;ll also form companies sometimes where we start with the idea and we build the company up to millions of dollars of revenue, and then bring in the perfect person to run it, and we&#8217;ll still make them a cofounder and we still want to give them a huge amount of equity because we want them to be incentivized, but based on where they&#8217;re coming in and how much value they&#8217;re adding that equity split can vary quite a bit.</p>
<p><strong>TC: You&#8217;ve founded many more companies than are listed on your website. Are some operating in stealth mode?</strong></p>
<p>JA: Yeah. Unfortunately, with some of the success comes copycats. And some of our companies that we&#8217;ve launched, we&#8217;ve had people in other studios literally rip off everything down to the fonts, the copy, the photos, the ad units, the messages in the ads, the pricing, everything. So we kind of have to keep our companies stealth because otherwise people will just copy them early on.</p>
<p>Now that we have a large fund and we can fund the company long enough where it can kind of hopefully hit escape velocity, we would like to do that and then bring it out to market and make it more public once it&#8217;s really hard to copy and it&#8217;s really working and scaling. So we have a few dozen companies that we&#8217;ve started at this point of which maybe half are public and half are still in stealth and crossing that chasm period where they&#8217;re growing, they&#8217;re accelerating, but we just don&#8217;t want to run into those situations if we can avoid them.</p>
<p><strong>TC: It seems like you are more involved with OpenStore than other companies. Why?</strong></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235966" style="width: 2057px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235966" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2235966 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676172510_d6c0700ebe_k.jpg" alt="" width="2047" height="1365" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676172510_d6c0700ebe_k.jpg 2047w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676172510_d6c0700ebe_k.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676172510_d6c0700ebe_k.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676172510_d6c0700ebe_k.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676172510_d6c0700ebe_k.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676172510_d6c0700ebe_k.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/51676172510_d6c0700ebe_k.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2047px) 100vw, 2047px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235966" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dani Padgett /</p></div></p>
<p>JA: Keith [Rabois] and I have a great history. Keith was an investor in my first company, Milo. I&#8217;ve known him forever. I think the world of him, and I had this idea for OpenStore [because] there&#8217;s no liquidity for merchants that are creating e-commerce stores outside of Amazon. There are a lot of companies that are buying companies within Amazon. But if you&#8217;re a merchant on Shopify  or  any of these other players in the ecosystem, there tends to be no one who will acquire your company. You have to first cross a massive chasm and maybe get to $50 million in revenue before you get any offers like that.</p>
<p>So there&#8217;s this big liquidity gap in that market, and with OpenStore, we built a website that&#8217;s kind of like [the residential real estate company] Opendoor [which Rabois also cofounded] where you can [plug] in your house and get an offer. With OpenStore, you can [provide it] with your store, information on your store, [and] just your Shopify login, and we will underwrite your business and actually give you an offer that same day to sell your company. And we think it can totally change the game in that space. And Keith and I [share the vision] of how big OpenStore can become.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why I was more involved with that one is it was being built up my house, so I literally couldn&#8217;t escape it. It was it was in the downstairs area, and it was all hours of the day. Eventually, my girlfriend told me that had to stop [laughs], and we stopped that, but now we have our own office and the company&#8217;s doing great.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Any Web3 type ideas percolating?</strong></p>
<p>JA: I think Web3 is a massive opportunity . . . I think the thing you have to be a little bit careful about with Web3 is it&#8217;s one thing to be an investor in Web3 and it&#8217;s another thing to be a builder because the laws are kind of gray in the United States. And we always want to be careful around that. I think it&#8217;s a little bit easier to create a company with equity than create something in pure crypto. [So] we will be doing that more; It&#8217;s just a question of the degree of our going to do it.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PST, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for November 17, 2021! The tech world was abuzz today with news that a crypto startup was buying the naming rights to a stadium that was previously named after an office supply company. You can read that as crypto getting mature or 2021 losing the plot. Regardless, we have lots to talk about! — <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/beginning-next-year-apple-will-mail-you-parts-and-tools-to-fix-your-iphone-and-mac-at-home/">Apple will now let you fix your own gadgets:</a> </strong>We’re surprised but stoked by news that Apple announced a “new program designed to let users perform common repairs on devices at home.” It’s called Self Service Repair, and, frankly, it’s a bit weird to digest such consumer-friendly news from a megacorp.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/waymo-via-expands-ups-partnership-to-include-autonomous-freight-with-class-8-trucks/"><strong>Waymo extrends freight partnership:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Given how lovely it would be to live in a world where cars would drive us instead of the other way around, I am paying close attention to self-driving news of all sorts. Today’s update that parcel-delivery concern UPS and Alphabet’s Waymo division are extending their partnership was therefore right up my alley.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/unicorns-braze-and-usertesting-begin-public-life-in-diverging-ways/"><strong>Braze, UserTesting go public:</strong></a><strong> </strong>There were <em>two</em> unicorn IPOs today. Braze, a customer engagement software company, and UserTesting, which does what it says on the tin. TechCrunch dug into their respective IPO prices and economics to celebrate. We also caught up with Braze’s CEO, but more on that later.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we get into <em>startup</em> news, let’s talk about some unicorns. Instacart’s growth rate is reportedly slowing, leading to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/are-rivals-snacking-on-instacarts-core-grocery-delivery-market/">TechCrunch wondering if its rivals are nibbling on its market share</a>. Instacart, worth tens of billions of dollars, is an obvious 2022 IPO candidate.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236018" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/alltrails-raises-150m-after-covid-accelerates-peoples-interest-in-exploring-the-outdoors/"><strong>Tech company makes money on “outside:&#8221;</strong></a><strong> </strong>Depending on where you are in the world today, going outside might sound like a lark or like sheer drudgery. But no matter, because the business of helping people get outside is booming. AllTrails just banked $150 million for its work in helping walkers and bikers and hikers get out and, well, about.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/jiko-announces-partnership-to-a-launch-banking-app-for-the-transgender-community/"><strong>Niche neobanks continue to raise:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Building a neobank tuned for one part of the population or another is an increasingly popular activity. The gist is that building a basic banking service is not <em>that</em> hard in 2021, given the number of off-the-shelf parts. This means that we can have more &#8212; and more specific &#8212; digital banks. For example, Jiko is partnering with Euphoria, “a technology suite for the transgender community that helps alleviate the struggles associated with gender transition, to launch a banking app called Bliss.” I dig it.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/with-new-tech-and-3-6m-seed-divigas-aims-to-clean-up-hydrogen-production/"><strong>DiviGas raises $3.6M to clean up hydrogen production:</strong></a><strong> </strong>With a new method of hydrogen diversion under its belt, DiviGas says that it has raised money to keep up with customer demand for its “hollow fiber polymeric membrane” technology. Keep an eye on this company in case it really has cracked a notable tech issue.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/in-game-creation-platform-overwolf-raises-75m-series-d-led-by-andreessen-horowitz/"><strong>Overwolf raises huge capital to help you make in-game content:</strong></a> If you play a game that has a serious modding community, you’re aware that not only big studios can make neat stuff for games. Regular folks can, too. Overwolf, which wants to help individuals make items for games, just raised $75 million for its work. The company’s round is a bet on gaming &#8212; and creators themselves.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/the-anoma-protocol-raises-26m-for-its-work-to-undefine-money/"><strong>The group building the Anoma protocol raises $26M:</strong></a> Skipping all the technical details, the Anoma protocol will launch in around a year and will allow for individuals to trade digital assets without using money as an intermediary. It’s a ways off, but the tech sounds rather cool.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/autonomous-tractor-maker-monarch-raises-61-million/"><strong>Monarch crowns itself with second funding round in less than a year:</strong></a><strong> </strong>It turns out that the market for autonomous electric agricultural tractors is booming. Monarch raised $20 million earlier this year and just added $61 million more to its accounts. With labor in short supply, the company may have found the perfect time for its four-wheeled creation.</li>

<p>E-commerce platform founders may be tempted to set transaction fees just a little higher than they initially planned, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/4-strategies-for-setting-marketplace-take-rates/">greed isn&#8217;t always good. </a></p>
<p>Boosting take rates by a point or two could boost early revenue when it&#8217;s needed most, but there&#8217;s an opportunity cost, since &#8220;a higher take rate typically leads to lower transaction volume,&#8221; according to angel investor and product manager Tanay Jaipuria.</p>
<p>Take rates should directly reflect the stage of your business, he advises, since platforms with higher rates see lower transaction volumes. To learn how different companies use this lever, Jaipura studied take rates for more than 25 marketplaces, including Apple, Shutterstock and OpenSea.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s important for founders to remember that maximizing the take rate of the platform is not the goal,&#8221; he says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook, errr Meta, showed off a new prototype haptic feedback glove yesterday, which they detailed could eventually bring a new generation of AR/VR users closer than they&#8217;ve ever been to digital content. Today, a VR startup with that same mission called <a href="https://haptx.com/">HaptX</a> (which we&#8217;ve covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/haptx-grabs-12-million-to-build-a-glove-crammed-with-sensors/">here</a> before) released a fairly aggressive statement accusing Meta of showing off a prototype that was &#8220;substantively identical&#8221; to their own patented technology.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://haptx.com/meta-glove-prototype-response/">statement</a> from HaptX CEO Jake Rubin further detailed that his startup has shown off their technology over the years to &#8220;many engineers, researchers, and executives from Meta,&#8221; and that they were not consulted by the company on this latest project. &#8220;While we have not yet heard from Meta, we look forward to working with them to reach a fair and equitable arrangement that addresses our concerns and enables them to incorporate our innovative technology into their future consumer products,&#8221; Rubin notes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236117" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236117" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2236117 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-1.32.35-PM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="624" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-1.32.35-PM.png 1628w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-1.32.35-PM.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-1.32.35-PM.png?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-1.32.35-PM.png?resize=768,468 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-1.32.35-PM.png?resize=680,414 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-1.32.35-PM.png?resize=1536,936 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-17-at-1.32.35-PM.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236117" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> HaptX</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236087" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment.</p>
<p>Both HaptX and the recently unveiled Meta prototype use a technology called microfluidic feedback. While your phone or game controller have haptic feedback that uses small motors to simulate buzzing or rumbling, when it comes to simulating deeper sensations across a user&#8217;s entire hand, microfludic feedback behave differently using actuators that control airflow through a network of tubes in a way that can sophisticatedly mimic sensations associated with picking up objects or even feeling unique textures that are all rendered digitally.</p>
<p>Facebook has also showcased a number of AR/VR prototypes over the years showcasing complex technologies that often don&#8217;t end up making their way to the final products but test the cutting edge of a certain technology. HaptX has been building haptic-feedback gloves for enterprise clients for years miniaturizing the tech that has required a backpack-sized pneumatic box that helps manage the sensory feedback of the gloves. It&#8217;s still a very complicated technology that is probably many years of development away from reaching the same mainstream audience that Facebook, now Meta, has been pursuing with the Quest 2.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that Meta&#8217;s team has also made some substantial advances to the technology. In their <a href="https://tech.fb.com/inside-reality-labs-meet-the-team-thats-bringing-touch-to-the-digital-world/">research blog post</a>, Meta detailed that they had created &#8220;the world’s first high-speed microfluidic processor,&#8221; a chipset in the glove that controls these feedback controls. One of the company&#8217;s researchers detailed that his &#8220;goal is to invent soft, lightweight haptic gloves that address both sides of the AR/VR interaction problem — helping the computer to accurately understand and reflect the wearer’s hand movements, and reproducing a range of complex, nuanced sensations for the wearer such as pressure, texture, and vibration to create the effect of feeling a virtual object with your hands.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Facebook has taken plenty of criticism over the years from startups who say their products were unfairly copied by the major tech giant. They have also garnered some major scrutiny from regulators who say they&#8217;ve engaged in anti-competitive behavior.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the full statement from HaptX&#8217;s Rubin:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the last decade, HaptX has pioneered the field of microfluidic haptic feedback. Our award-winning technology has been widely covered in the popular and technology press, and we’ve worked tirelessly to develop and promote the unique benefits of microfluidics as an approach to high-fidelity haptic feedback. With the longstanding dedication of our engineers, developers, and investors, we have also secured an industry-leading patent portfolio to protect our technology and products.</p>
<p>In interacting with other companies in the VR industry, we have always believed that cooperation is paramount to the development of the industry as a whole. Over the years, we’ve hosted many engineers, researchers, and executives from Meta to demonstrate our groundbreaking haptic technology.</p>
<p>Today, Meta announced their own prototype microfluidic haptic feedback glove. The core components of this prototype, including the silicone-based microfluidic tactile feedback laminate and pneumatic control architecture, appear to be substantively identical to HaptX’s patented technology. We welcome interest and competition in the field of microfluidic haptics; however, competition must be fair for the industry to thrive.</p>
<p>While we have not yet heard from Meta, we look forward to working with them to reach a fair and equitable arrangement that addresses our concerns and enables them to incorporate our innovative technology into their future consumer products.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">E-commerce and other online businesses are becoming increasingly global in their operations and customer bases, and a startup called <a href="https://www.airwallex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airwallex</a> &#8212; which has built a banking solution that addresses the opportunity to provide cross-border financial services &#8212; has been seeing a massive surge of activity. To capitalize further on that opportunity, today the company is announcing growth funding.</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Melbourne-based Airwallex has raised $100 million, capital that it will be using to continue building out its banking and payments businesses into more markets, and to invest expanding its products.</p>
<p>The funding &#8212; which is being led by Lone Pine Capital, and joined by 1835i Ventures (the venture arm of <a href="https://www.anz.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ANZ</a>, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group) and Sequoia Capital China, all previous investors &#8212; is an extension to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/airwallex-raises-200m-at-a-4b-valuation-to-double-down-on-business-banking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company&#8217;s Series E that it announced only in September</a>; and it brings the total of the round to $300 million.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235602" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The valuation is also being extended with this latest injection: Airwallex is now worth $5.5 billion (compared to $4 billion in September). From what we understand, the company was getting term sheets as high as $7 billion from outside investors (that outside interest was what prompted the round in the first place).</p>
<p>Airwallex today has around 20,000 customers spanning areas like e-commerce, tech/SaaS companies and professional services. It also has 500 large platform customers (Papaya Global and GOAT are two examples) that have embedded Airwallex&#8217;s services within their own services to power transactions for their own customers.</p>
<p>That business has seen a big boost of activity as a result of a few key developments in the world.</p>
<p>For starters, the Covid-19 pandemic has led to a big shift towards more e-commerce among both consumers and businesses. In turn, businesses have needed to extend their financial infrastructure to accommodate more customers. And because e-commerce has broken down the barriers of where you can do business, they&#8217;ve also had to extend their financial reach to touch customers in ever-wider geographies. Covid-19 has also massively disrupted supply chains, so businesses have also had to become more enterprising in how they manage these: they may now have to work with more partners, and potentially be agile enough to pay different people month-to-month.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All of these present the kinds of use cases that speak to the kinds of services that Airwallex offers. Jack Zhang, Airwallex&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, said that revenues at the company grew 100% in Q3 over Q2. Its annualized revenues in that most recent quarter were $100 million. &#8220;We had a target to achieve that at the end of the year, but we delivered it a quarter earlier,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It also means a number of other companies are also looking to serve this need: competitors to Airwallex across its different services include Stripe, PayPal, Revolut (via Revolut Business), and more.</p>
<p>Airwallex built its company originally around business banking &#8212; its thesis was that companies had a lot of banking options when it came to doing business in their own markets, but for those who worked across borders, it offered domestic and international accounts that worked as easily as domestic ones, along with card issuing, transfers and foreign exchange, payouts and so on. More recently, the company has moved into payments to complement that. The plan will be to add more services natively to that stack, as well as integrate with third-party providers by way of an app store that it is now developing. That will launch potentially next year.</p>
<p>Zhang also said some of the funds will be used for M&amp;A, as part of the inevitable consolidation that we&#8217;re going to continue seeing in fintech.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve now raised $800 million in the last 6 years, with $600 million in the last two years, and we still have $600 million in the bank right now,&#8221; he told TechCrunch. &#8220;A very large part of that is going to be used for M&amp;A purposes.&#8221; Features that Airwallex wants to have as a native part of its stack it might buy instead of building itself include subscription payments; software to automatically calculate stamp duty depending on the market where items are being sold; and more data analytics to help customers analyze their revenues better. &#8220;I think there will be consolidation in the next period. But it won&#8217;t be just two players. The [fintech] space is big enough for a dozen winners.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it looks like Airwallex is setting itself up to be one of those winners. Zhang confirmed to me that Stripe &#8212; which today is a key competitor of Airwallex&#8217;s &#8212; approached the company to acquire it around 2018/2019, when Airwallex was significantly smaller but already developing a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/03/airwallex-raises-80m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong presence</a> in Asia Pacific, which is still its biggest market, even as Airwallex moves deeper EMEA and North America. (It would have been a big step for Stripe into the region, which is has instead taken on its own steam.)</p>
<p>Zhang said that another big fintech, currently valued at around $20 billion, also approached Airwallex more recently. Nothing has come of that, either &#8212; partly because Airwallex is now too expensive, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we are probably to big for others to buy us,&#8221; Zhang added.</p>
<p>As for what is coming next on the liquidity front, an IPO &#8220;is not on the agenda,&#8221; but is something that the company will think about potentially for 2023 or 2024.</p>
<p>“Airwallex’s achievements in the last quarter alone showcase the strength of the company’s business model and its unique ability to meet their customers’ evolving needs in a competitive digital payments market,” said David Craver, co-chief investment office at Lone Pine Capital. “The future is bright for Airwallex, and we look forward to helping its team unlock greater growth opportunities.”</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I run operations at an early-stage startup, and I’ve been tasked with hiring and other HR responsibilities. </strong><strong>I’m feeling out of my depth with hiring and trying to figure out visa issues for prospective hires. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any advice?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Doubling Down in Daly City</strong></p>
<p>Dear Doubling,</p>
<p>I hear a lot from people like you who are in the same situation at early-stage startups. This came up when I chatted recently with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erin-teter-sphr-1757623/">Erin Teter</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lydia-buurma-00693a47/">Lydia Buurma</a> for my <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/">podcast</a>. Teter and Buurma are experienced HR professionals who I’ve known for years. They’re currently working in HR at <a href="https://www.linq.com/">LINQ</a>, an edtech company that provides cloud-based administration and finance solutions for states, districts and schools.</p>
<p>“HR is a full-time job,” Buurma said. “When you talk about creating company culture, setting the company’s mission and values, you want to include people in that discussion and you want to get buy-in from core employees and figure out what characteristics future employees that you want to bring in should have.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2100312" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="1024" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<h2>The next best option</h2>
<p>If your startup cannot afford to bring on a full-time HR person right now, Teter recommends that your company at least bring in an HR consultant to help evaluate your company’s situation, set up practices and assist with issues.</p>
<p>“Usually consultants are connected with immigration attorneys and other experts who can help you work through the process,” she said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Waldo, a photo-sharing platform that has historically targeted businesses, schools, camps, sports leagues, and other organizations, is capitalizing on the growing anti-Facebook sentiment to promote its newly launched consumer product.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://waldophotos.com/">Waldo</a>, a photo-sharing platform that has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/21/waldo-raises-5-million-for-a-photo-finding-platform-targeting-professional-photographers-events/">historically</a> targeted businesses, schools, camps, sports leagues, and other organizations, is capitalizing on the growing anti-Facebook sentiment to promote its newly launched consumer product. The company today is introducing a service aimed at private photo-sharing among family and friends which it&#8217;s promoting as an &#8220;ad-free, non-toxic&#8221; and private alternative to mainstream social sites, like Facebook and Instagram.</p>
<p>Of course, that&#8217;s just Waldo&#8217;s marketing. Consumers, arguably, already <em>have</em> private, ad-free photo-sharing alternatives outside social media. They can create invite-only photo albums on platforms like Google Photos or share privately via Apple&#8217;s iCloud. They can send photos through encrypted mobile messaging apps. Still, Waldo believes there&#8217;s room for a standalone app that&#8217;s available cross-platform and offers a differentiated feature set.</p>
<p>The Waldo app is available on iOS, Android and the web and includes a wireless DSLR uploading feature aimed at photo enthusiasts. Consumers who want to use the service for private sharing can create galleries for their events and then invite people they want to share those photos with. As others join the shared galleries, they can opt in to have Waldo send alerts about any photos they&#8217;re in through push notifications or text alerts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235982" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The app also offers closed-loop commenting and reactions that allow the photo owner and the commenter to have a private interaction not seen by anyone else in the album.</p>
<p>The new consumer <a href="https://waldophotos.com/pricing/">plans</a> are offered as either a Plus or Premium subscription at $4.99/mo or $9.99/mo, respectively. The former supports up to 5 family members and the latter up to 10, with unlimited invites and contributors. Plus also includes 100 GB of storage while Premium offers 200 GB.</p>
<p>These are more expensive plans than offered by big tech rivals, however. For comparison, a Google One Basic storage <a href="https://one.google.com/about/plans">plan</a> of 100 GB, which includes photos and files, is $1.99/mo, and 200 GB is $2.99/mo.<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201238"> iCloud+</a> is $0.99/mo for 50 GB in the U.S. or $2.99/mo for 200 GB. So Waldo will really need to sell consumers on its feature set of facial recognition-powered smart notifications, private reactions, and custom print options.</p>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6VXDwVXt0qg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Waldo plans to build on its existing partnerships with professional industries, like camps, schools, and churches which use Waldo as a tool to share photos privately with parents others.</p>
<p>Over the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/01/21/waldo-raises-5-million-for-a-photo-finding-platform-targeting-professional-photographers-events/">past five years</a>, Waldo has slowly grown its footprint outside of the consumer space. Today, it has &#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of customers, including a combination of families and employees of the K-12 institutions and businesses its app serves. Its business customers can use the app&#8217;s facial recognition features (with parents&#8217; permission) to automatically identify and tag their students, campers, event-goers, and other attendees. That way, parents don&#8217;t have to look through the hundreds of photos the organization may snap in order to find just those that feature their own child or children.</p>
<p>This paid subscription-based service has been adopted by groups across the U.S. and Canada, but Waldo doesn&#8217;t disclose its revenue.</p>
<p>Waldo tells us the plan is not to pivot from its existing b2b offering, but instead expand to a new group of users.</p>
<p>Because parents and others may already have Waldo installed on their phones, the company sees the potential in shifting them over to its consumer photo-sharing service. And the recipients of the shared photos don&#8217;t necessarily have to download the app to join in &#8212; the service can be used without an app installed from the web browser on any device.</p>
<p>As a user of Waldo through my own child&#8217;s camp, this transition makes sense. Instead of downloading Waldo&#8217;s shared photos to my phone only to then turn around and reshare them with grandparents through another platform, I could see how it may be easier to just join Waldo&#8217;s consumer subscription plan and push a &#8220;camp photos&#8221; albums to a few family members.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue to provide our communities with our Waldo Pro solution as it is an important value add for our families who seek to have all of their families photos, irrespective of who took them, in a single cloud-based, mobile-friendly location, and a huge benefit to our communities who benefit from a safer photo-sharing platform,&#8221; Waldo CEO Rodney Rice told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The launch of Waldo Plus and Premium represents our opening up the platform from only being accessible as a member of one of our &#8216;Waldo-fied&#8217; communities to every consumer being able to use the platform for everyday sharing and all the events in their lives,&#8221; he says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A weird thing has happened in the past two years. After years of decline, <a href="https://www.mic.org/#/newsArticle">motorcycle and scooter sales</a> have bounced back. That&#8217;s good news for BMW&#8217;s Motorrad division and its latest electric scooter, the CE 04.</p>
<p>The two-wheel retro-futuristic bike, which was showcased in Los Angeles this week at an event ahead of the LA Auto Show, will be riding a wave of two-wheeled renaissance which could help usher in larger acceptance of electric scooters.</p>
<p>BMW Motorrrad of America&#8217;s vice president Trudy Hardy believes that the two-wheeled EV could come into its own as more than just a cool-looking bike. &#8220;I think what&#8217;s interesting about having a scooter in this category is I think it will start to solve some transportation challenges.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236017" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Set to arrive in showrooms in early 2022, the CE 04 will start at $11,795. Like all things BMW, it carries a premium price tag. Yet, for the feature set and the fact that it&#8217;s electric, it might actually be a solid deal.</p>
<p>The scooter will seat two, has 42 horsepower and an impressive 45 pound-feet of torque. The 8.9-kWh capacity battery pack is targeted to offer 80 miles of range and it supports level 2 charging up to 6.9 kW.</p>
<p>Plus it has that large 10.25-inch TFT display that when paired with the BMW Motorrrad app offers up turn-by-turn navigation and can track rider data like how far over you&#8217;ve leaned in corners, as well as the typical motorcycle information.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2236032" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bmw-ce-screen.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236032" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2236032 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bmw-ce-screen.jpg" alt="BMW CE 04 electric scooter" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bmw-ce-screen.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bmw-ce-screen.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bmw-ce-screen.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bmw-ce-screen.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bmw-ce-screen.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bmw-ce-screen.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/bmw-ce-screen.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2236032" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Roberto Baldwin</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Still, it&#8217;s an electric scooter in a world where the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/harley-davidson-spins-out-livewire-into-a-standalone-electric-motorcycle-brand/">Harley-Davidson Livewire</a> exists and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/zeros-fxe-offers-electric-motorcycle-fun-in-a-slightly-new-package/">Zero Motorcycle</a> continues to thrive.</p>
<p>Hardy believes that for BMW this is a smart strategy, &#8220;It&#8217;s going to bring new people into the brand that might not have considered a motorcycle, but are going to find this to be a friendly or solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bike maker&#8217;s first foray into the U.S. market with electricity was the C-Evolution. It was essentially a pilot program. &#8220;It was really to test the waters a little bit. This is our first endeavor really going into the electrification market,&#8221; Hardy told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Although Hardy is nervous that people tend to generalize scooters as something less than what they are. New customers also mean those new to motorcycles and scooters in general. There will likely be customers that currently ride electric bicycles that step up to an electric scooter like the CE 04 and not quite understand that it&#8217;s more powerful than it looks. It&#8217;s easy to dismiss scooters and see something that&#8217;s underpowered, the reality is the EV torque that makes electric cars so exhilarating is also here on this scooter.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a toy. Fortunately, BMW Motorrad&#8217;s entire lineup comes standard with anti-lock brakes and other safety features.</p>
<p>For new and experienced riders, the CE 04 is offering something a bit new. A compact but spirited EV two-wheeler that could be the answer to city commutes. Hardy sees it as part of an ongoing move by the company as a whole. &#8220;BMW has always been known for the performance side and the technology side and it&#8217;s nice that we&#8217;re now entering that electrified space from four wheels to two wheels, which is great.&#8221;</p>
<p>It also helps that more and more people in the United States are buying new bikes and EVs. That combination might be a win for the funky CE 04.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Subaru pulled the cover off its first all-electric crossover for the second time in November. This time, the 2023 Subaru Solterra electric crossover — the Toyota bZ4X doppelgänger — made its U.S. debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show.</p>
<p>The first all-electric subcompact crossover is a joint project, like the Subaru BR-Z and the Toyota 86 (formerly the Scion FR-S) was before it, and the crossover is a close sibling, almost twin-like, to the Toyota bZ4X crossover that was announced in April.</p>
<p>The upshot: The Solterra is targeting Americans&#8217; insatiable appetite for crossover and it gives Subaru a foothold in the EV market, with Toyota&#8217;s help.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235913" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The last two years have been very good to Subaru, even with chip shortages crimping the supply chain. The automaker has reported record sales in the U.S.</p>

<p>Known for its all-wheel-drive vehicles, the midsize Forester has been a segment leader in terms of volume, though the company reported that the compact Crosstrek, was the best seller for October of 2021 (by volume). Subaru has said that dealers are having a hard time keeping the more off-road-oriented Wilderness variants of the Outback and Forester on dealer lots, with markups as high as $5,000 above sticker.</p>
<p>Toyota owns 20% of Subaru as of September of 2019, but their partnership goes back to 2005 when GM ended the relationship it had with Subaru. The Toyota-Subaru partnership has been a boon for both companies, as Subaru brings expertise in all-wheel-drive systems to the table while Toyota brings its hybrid and electric powertrains to the smaller automaker. Both Japanese companies tend to be more conservative and considered when pushing into new territory, but the Solterra offers an interesting look into what Subaru thinks the future of electric crossovers with off-road features may look like.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>A shared platform with all-wheel drive</h2>
<p>The Solterra is another joint project that Subaru has done alongside Toyota, which means that some of the design, especially the interior bits, look a lot like Toyota, while the exterior, chassis and the all-wheel-drive system is all Subaru. Toyota also handled the battery sourcing.</p>
<p>That battery is a 71.4 kWh lithium-ion battery pack slung low between the axles and paired to two electric motors, one at the front and one at the rear. Subaru estimates the range to be around 220-plus miles and says that the Solterra can be charged from 0-80% in just about 30 minutes using DC fast chargers.</p>
<p>The powertrain makes 250 horsepower and 246 lb-ft of torque &#8212; much of which is readily available at the low end, potentially making the Solterra a decent soft-roader.</p>

<p>At an offsite unveiling last week, the electric-ute climbed up and over a small rocky path and through a shallow pond before stopping in front of the gathered press for photos, showing off its light off-road prowess.</p>
<p>While this marks Subaru&#8217;s first foray into the EV market, the Solterra will carry Subaru&#8217;s trademark symmetrical all-wheel-drive system, complete with Subaru&#8217;s X-Mode, which offers better traction in low-friction situations. When one wheel is in the air, the system will modulate the brakes to get you up and over the obstacle, according to Subaru, making this a moderately off-roadable EV. The 8.3-inches of ground clearance doesn&#8217;t hurt either, and Subaru made a point at the LA Auto Show unveiling to note that it is better than the VW ID 4 and Tesla model Y.</p>
<p>At last week&#8217;s event, Subaru also ran footage of Solterra testing on off-road obstacles like stairs, and offset ramps, to show just how capable the small-ute could be. It even pitted it against competitors like the Jaguar I-Pace on the same obstacles.</p>
<p>While pricing has yet to be officially announced, Subaru says that buyers can expect it to start around $39,000. Subaru will start selling the 2023 Solterra in mid-2022.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Instacart's growth rate is plateauing. What's going on?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Few companies had as good a pandemic run as Instacart. The company&#8217;s service saw huge demand gains, leading to waves of venture capital interest.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>From a late 2018 funding cycle that valued the U.S. grocery delivery company at around $7.9 billion, <a href="http://pitchbook.com">per PitchBook data</a>, Instacart went on to raise $325 million at a $13.8 billion valuation in July 2020. The pandemic sent many folks home &#8212; and to their phones to order foodstuffs &#8212; to Instacart&#8217;s benefit.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2229732 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/exchange-banner-sq-yllw-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>But that was just the start. PitchBook indicates that Instacart raised again in October 2020, adding $200 million more to its accounts at a $17.7 billion valuation. And then in March 2021, Instacart raised a further $265 million at a valuation of around $39 billion. (You can cross-check the PitchBook data <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/instacart/company_financials">with Crunchbase here</a>, if you&#8217;d like.)</p>
<p>Few startups reach the $1 billion valuation threshold. Far fewer make it to the $5 billion mark before going public. And only a true handful get to $10 billion or more. A nearly $40 billion pre-money valuation is stupendous, and puts immense pressure on the company to generate the sort of numbers that public-market investors will expect from a richly valued tech company.</p>
<p>But it turns out that Instacart is seeing its growth rate plateau in 2021, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/instacart-pushes-off-public-offering-to-focus-on-grocery-services-growth">per reporting at The Information</a>. What&#8217;s going on?</p>
<h2>Instacart&#8217;s growth</h2>
<p>The Information&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/berber_jin1">Berber Jin</a> reports that after Instacart tripled its revenues to $1.5 billion in 2020 when compared to 2019, its growth rate has moderated to around a 10% rate this year. Though, she adds, the company&#8217;s Q3 revenue growth was doing better, up around 20% on a year-over-year basis. <em>[<strong>Update:</strong> This paragraph updated to reflect the correct author of The Information&#8217;s piece.]</em></p>
<p>The Exchange reached out to the company about the various data points, but it declined to comment on the record.</p>
<p>After reading Clark&#8217;s piece, I decided to collect information from the company&#8217;s various competitors. Let&#8217;s talk about Amazon, Walmart, DoorDash and Uber, companies that may be snacking on Instacart&#8217;s core business.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[For this year's STEM toy gift guide we've split out our recommendations by age for easier navigation. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome to TechCrunch’s 2021 Holiday Gift Guide! Need help with gift ideas? We’ve got lots of them. We’re just starting to roll out this year’s gift guides, so check back from now until the end of December for more! </em></p>
<p>For this year&#8217;s STEM toy gift guide we&#8217;ve split out our recommendations by age for easier navigation. The 20+ gift ideas (below) run the gamut from train sets controlled by colorful blocks, to robots that can draw, all the way up to a cute DIY handheld gaming console that&#8217;s really an experimental platform for teens to build on.</p>
<p>Gifts we&#8217;ve selected hit a range of price points &#8212; starting at $15 and topping out at just under $550 (for all the educational LEGO your kid could ever need!), with a spectrum of price points in between.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2232163" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The learn-to-code category as a whole continues to mature, showing a strengthening (and welcome) focus on art and design, not just pure engineering. At the same time, it&#8217;s clear that sustaining a business selling educational gizmos/games is challenging, with a number of players winking out of existence (or taking an exit) since we last checked in. Product novelty also feels like it&#8217;s diminishing, even as maker hardware itself is flourishing (thanks to the likes of the Raspberry Pi). But, in general, the category&#8217;s experimental &#8220;Cambrian explosion&#8221; moment seems to have passed &#8212; and the programmable robots have (mostly) taken over.</p>
<p>Consolidation remains a big theme in the space. As do pivots (see: <a href="https://musically.com/2021/08/25/kanye-west-launches-a-200-donda-stem-player-with-kano/">Kano&#8217;s new jam</a>, for example). After all, kids are fickle and even the fanciest toy can soon be discarded for a newer, shinier thing. Plus, it feels like some of the earlier hype (and loud claims) &#8212; around gizmos that &#8220;teach coding&#8221; &#8212; has faded to a more practical/realistic and less flashy projection of potential educational value.</p>
<p>One extra challenge for STEM toy makers is the (now) high concern over kids&#8217; screen time. Hence lots of products feature marketing that loudly touts &#8220;screen-free&#8221; alternatives to teaching coding (such as by using physical blocks/cards/buttons etc). Meanwhile some others that do require a screen to work are trying to distinguish what they&#8217;re offering as &#8220;good screen&#8221; time versus the addictive &#8220;digital sugar&#8221; of non-learning-focused games and/or social media … whether parents buy that remains to be seen.</p>
<p>For surviving STEM players, increasing amounts of their time and energy are being directed away from the consumer space and toward supplying schools with learning-geared kit and resources directly &#8212; chasing a more reliable revenue stream, although selling to schools is no cake walk, either. Overall, being part of a larger maker marketplace or broader group of educational businesses seems to be where many surviving STEM startups are headed.</p>

<p>LA-based startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/29/codespark-raises-4-1-million-for-games-that-teach-kids-how-to-code/">CodeSpark</a> has been making mobile and web games to teach kids coding for years &#8212; now as part of the <a href="https://learnwithhomer.com/">Homer</a> early learning group after being acquired by its parent company, New York-based <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/begin-acquires-codespark-leading-digital-stem-program-301298304.html">BEGiN</a>, earlier this year.</p>
<p>If your youngster already has access to a tablet, <a href="https://codespark.com/">CodeSpark</a>&#8216;s pitch for its learning games is &#8220;screen time you can feel good about&#8221; &#8212; saying they cover basic concepts of computing coding (such as sequencing, loops, conditional statements, events, boolean logic and sorting, etc.) &#8212; just cunningly disguised as cartoonish characters and fun-looking puzzles and challenges. So kids won&#8217;t even realize they&#8217;re learning.</p>

<h2>Osmo Explorer Starter Kit</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/16/byjus-buys-osmo-for-120m/">Indian edtech giant Byju-owned</a> <a href="https://www.playosmo.com/en/shopping/kits/explorer-starter-kit/">Osmo</a> has been making educational games for tablets for almost a decade. Its big twist is to combine physical (offline) play (pens, blocks, cards, etc.) with digital on-screen content and interactions.</p>
<p>It does this via a dedicated tablet stand that adds a reflector to the iPad&#8217;s front-facing camera so that it gets a view of the physical play area directly below the screen. This means the app is able to mirror/act on what the kids are doing in the physical space. (And the bounded view means the camera only captures tiny hands, not your kids&#8217; faces, so that&#8217;s a plus for privacy.) Osmo calls this blend of physical-digital play &#8220;embodied learning.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <strong>Osmo Explorer Starter Kit </strong>is described as its &#8220;most complete STEAM learning kit yet&#8221; &#8212; with a range of interactive games and art supplies in the bundle (Note: A tablet is not included so you&#8217;ll need your own iPad or equivalent). The kit includes a set of coding-focused games that let kids manipulate on-screen characters to progress by combining (physical) coding blocks into a set of instructions and tapping the screen to execute their (proto)program.</p>

<h2>Robo Sense</h2>
<p>European startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/08/robo-wunderkind-wants-to-build-the-lego-mindstorms-for-everyone/">Robo Wunderkind</a> has built a STEM-learning business, one modular robotic block at a time. Kids get to learn about circuits and engineering concepts by plugging a variety of its smart blocks together &#8212; to build their own robots and make them move or otherwise animate them. Creations can be further extended by adding (actual) LEGO bits and bobs.</p>

<p>As well as pure physical play, Robo Wunderkind has a digital aide in the form of a companion app that expands the learning into on-screen coding. Here it offers tiered complexity &#8212; with three<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> different levels from coding basics, where kids may just be manipulating colorful icons, to doing drag-and-drop block-based coding (based on Scratch) &#8212; which introduces more complex concepts like variables, functions, operators and input/output handling. Python and Arduino APIs are also supported for more advanced programmers. </span></p>
<p>The Robo Sense kit offers a taster of Robo Wunderkind&#8217;s approach, with a handful of sensing blocks to play with plus over 30 projects and tutorials to access online or in-app.</p>

<h2>Artie Max</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.educationalinsights.com/artie-max-the-coding-robot">Artie Max</a></strong> is the latest programmable robot from Educational Insights. Much like its predecessor, <a href="https://www.educationalinsights.com/artie-3000-8482-the-coding-robot">Artie 3000</a>, the STEM toy combines programming and art in a very literal sense: The robot is designed to hold colored marker pens and kids write code that the bot &#8220;draws&#8221; by moving around on a piece of paper.</p>

<p>Artie Max&#8217;s main upgrade versus Artie 3000 is that it can hold a bunch of marker pens, not just a single marker &#8212; allowing for multicolored designs to be coded. Programming Artie&#8217;s movements is done via a drag-and-drop interface in the companion app or web interface. Other coding languages are supported, along with a visual interface where kids can draw a design on screen that they want the bot to ink out on paper.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hydrogen is at the center of many industrial processes and potentially part of major future energy ecosystems, but the process of isolating and storing it is wasteful and expensive. <a href="https://www.divigas.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DiviGas</a>, armed with a $3.6 million seed round, hopes to clean up the hydrogen production industry with a new tech that leapfrogs existing methods, potentially supercharging this piece of the new green economy.</p>
<p>While hydrogen itself is generally considered a clean and extremely useful basic element, its production is married to numerous dirty industrial processes. Oil refineries and plastic production, for instance, may give off various hydrocarbons and other mixed gases and chemicals, and to separate them requires further processing and emissions.</p>
<p>One cleaner and simpler option than chemical reactions uses membranes or filters, which essentially separate the H2 and CO2 gases from each other and from other substances in the input stream. But these filters cannot operate at high temperatures, output some gases at low pressures that must be re-pressurized at cost and rapidly degrade in the presence of common acidic gases.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234175" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Essentially the hydrogen diversion industry — and it&#8217;s big, by the way, billions big — is split between an expensive, emissions-heavy option and a cheap, limited option. After meeting in Singapore at one of SOSV&#8217;s HAX incubators, the founders of DiviGas plan to provide a third option that has none of the aforementioned weaknesses.</p>
<p>The company claims to have engineered a new &#8220;hollow fiber polymeric membrane&#8221; at the angstrom scale, which is to say one-tenth of a nanometer. It&#8217;s not like they designed a filter the size of an atom, but rather that the functional features of the material are at this scale, producing the kind of highly specialized effect desired — in this case, causing hydrogen and carbon dioxide gas to separate at slightly different pressures, allowing them to be diverted and isolated.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235323" style="width: 979px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/divigas-closeup.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235323" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2235323" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/divigas-closeup.jpg" alt="Electron microscope image of the fibers and their internal structure." width="969" height="752" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/divigas-closeup.jpg 969w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/divigas-closeup.jpg?resize=150,116 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/divigas-closeup.jpg?resize=300,233 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/divigas-closeup.jpg?resize=768,596 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/divigas-closeup.jpg?resize=680,528 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/divigas-closeup.jpg?resize=50,39 50w" sizes="(max-width: 969px) 100vw, 969px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2235323" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> DiviGas</p></div></p>
<p>Huge numbers of fibers are bundled together into tubes through which the input gas is forced, with no chemical reactants required. Unlike other membranes, this new one can operate at high temperatures — up to 150 degrees C — and is resistant to common acidic compounds in the gas mix formed from sulfur and chlorine, which means it can handle more caustic and untreated input flows without degrading. And it does so while performing as well or better than the old membranes on basic scales of selectivity (affecting output purity) and permeance (which affects maximum operable pressure).</p>
<p>Because the method is the same in principle as existing membrane techniques, DiviGas&#8217;s tech can be substituted in with minimal fuss and modification. And although manufacturing the new fibers is not a trivial task, they aren&#8217;t particularly exotic and use many existing processes. As co-founder, CTO and creator of the new material Ali Naderi explained, it&#8217;s the result of various cutting-edge innovations but ultimately still easy to manufacture.</p>
<p>&#8220;To make it economically viable, we developed a dual-layer hollow fiber membrane to use the functional materials (i.e. expensive materials) as low as possible on the selective layer (i.e. outer layer) and a cheap/commercially available polymer in the mechanical support layer (i.e. inner layer),&#8221; he wrote in an email to TechCrunch. &#8220;This type of membrane can be fabricated commercially by using a customized spinning line that has the same price as a standard spinning line has.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235277" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/divigas-membrane.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235277" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2235277" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/divigas-membrane.jpeg" alt="Divigas fibers next to an assembled small-scale metal part." width="1024" height="728" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/divigas-membrane.jpeg 1410w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/divigas-membrane.jpeg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/divigas-membrane.jpeg?resize=300,213 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/divigas-membrane.jpeg?resize=768,546 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/divigas-membrane.jpeg?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/divigas-membrane.jpeg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2235277" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> DiviGas</p></div></p>
<p>The prospect of simpler, cleaner hydrogen and CO2 production has been met with extreme enthusiasm by people in the industry, according to co-founder and CEO Andre Lorenceau.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got clients banging down our door, asking us when we can give tens of millions of these things to them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This round is us playing catch-up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The money is going toward building a pilot-scale plant in Melbourne that should be operational in March; currently it takes months to build a single unit (a usable bundle of fibers) for demonstrations, and a given client might want hundreds or thousands on a regular basis. Once the company is able to build them at a rate of around one a week, they can do larger demonstrations and small installations that will secure serious orders — and those proceeds will go toward building out out the full-scale manufacturing process.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s two or three times more expensive right now, but they don&#8217;t care,&#8221; Lorenceau said (though the price will come down with volume, he added). &#8220;They say, &#8216;It&#8217;s a tech I know, a manufacturing process I know — if you can give it to us at that price it&#8217;s Gucci.&#8217; And it&#8217;s a <em>lot</em> of clients, and we haven&#8217;t even been doing sales.&#8221;</p>
<p>The competitive landscape, he added, is conducive to quick action on their part, being full of slow movers and stalled startups.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are these giant lumbering corporations, they have a department for this and they do improve, but it&#8217;s old guard. Same reason why it isn&#8217;t the old PhDs of computer science who build the next generation of software tech — they&#8217;re not trying to build next-gen weird shit all the time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The startups are also research PhD people who aren&#8217;t used to the high-speed VC thing. They have excellent research performance, but in terms of manufacturing, it costs a zillion bucks to make a square inch of the damn stuff. They say, &#8216;we&#8217;ll figure out the manufacturability&#8230;&#8217; and they never do. So we can leapfrog them and the big corporations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The $3.6 million round was led by Mann + Hummel, a German industrial filter company clearly looking to get ahead of the game. Also participating in the round were Entrepreneur First, Albert Wenger (USV), SOSV/HAX, Energy Revolution Ventures, Amasia VC, Volta.vc and Climate Capital, along with several individual investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hyundai announced Wednesday at the 2021 Los Angeles Auto Show a new all-electric SUV concept vehicle that features everything from lounge seating to what Hyundai calls a &#8220;hygienic&#8221; interior, an appropriate feature as we enter the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Concept vehicles are exactly what they sound like — exercises in creativity and technology that can point to some possible future vehicle. Just because a vehicle shows up as a concept at an auto show does not mean that it will ever show up at your local dealer, however. In this case, Hyundai has created a full-size SUV concept, on a real, you-can-buy-it-at-the-dealer platform.</p>
<h2>The Concept: hygienic interiors</h2>
<p>While plenty of other automakers have shown off concepts with similar lounge-like interiors and seats that swivel 360 degrees for the days when fully autonomous driving becomes an actual reality for the masses, the unique feature of the SEVEN concept is its hygienic interior features.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235865" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>First, a &#8220;Hygiene Air Flow&#8221; system can isolate the airflow between front and rear passengers. Air comes in through intakes in the roof rails and exits the vehicle via the wheel vents in what Hyundai terms &#8220;vertical mode.&#8221; In horizontal mode, or what we normally just consider to be typical vehicle ventilation, air moves from front to back. Hyundai says that the system will work whether the vehicle is moving or parked and that it was inspired by the more advanced systems used on airplanes.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235889" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-interior.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235889" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2235889 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-interior.jpeg" alt="hyundai interior concept seven electric vehicle la auto show" width="2000" height="1506" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-interior.jpeg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-interior.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-interior.jpeg?resize=300,226 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-interior.jpeg?resize=768,578 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-interior.jpeg?resize=680,512 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-interior.jpeg?resize=1536,1157 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/hyundai-interior.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2235889" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Abigail Bassett</p></div></p>
<p>In addition to a tailored airflow, Hyundai also showed off its concept for keeping the interior clean between passengers and trips &#8212; since we&#8217;ll all be sharing autonomous vehicles in the future. In the pandemic era, this kind of concern is very real since the COVID-19 virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets and aerosols that can survive for many hours on all kinds of surfaces, including fabric.</p>
<p>The SEVEN concept has a UVC sterilization cycle that runs after passengers exit the vehicle. UVC, or Ultraviolet-C, light is a disinfectant for air, water and non-porous surfaces, and the FDA has reported that it does kill the SARS-CoV-2 virus which is the virus that causes COVID. UVC light can burn eyes and skin, which is why all the passengers need to be out of the vehicle before the program runs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to custom airflow and UVC sterilization, Hyundai has also included interesting touches like copper, which has antimicrobial features, and hygienically treated fabric to further prevent the spread of future viruses. Hyundai has even included a &#8220;shoe refreshing appliance&#8221; that would clean and deodorize your shoes.</p>
<h2>Real charging and range</h2>
<p>The Hyundai SEVEN Concept will sit on Hyundai&#8217;s Electric Global Modular Platform, or E-GMP. That platform already underpins other vehicles in the Hyundai-Kia group, like the new all-electric crossover Ioniq 5, the first production Hyundai vehicle built on the platform. It&#8217;s the same platform that the Kia EV6 is built on and will be the foundation for future electric vehicles coming from the Hyundai-Kia-owned luxury brand, Genesis.</p>
<p>The platform allows EVs to charge at 400-volt and 800-volt speeds, in the case of real vehicles like the Ioniq 5, allowing it to charge from 10% to 80% in less than 20 minutes on a 350 kW DC Fast charger. Hyundai says that it can get upwards of 300 miles of range from the larger 77.4 kWh battery pack they offer.</p>
<p>While concept vehicles are often mostly vaporware, the Hyundai SEVEN concept offers an interesting blend of imagined and real that gives the world a glimpse of what the company thinks the future may hold for transportation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram&#8217;s standalone messaging app <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threads-from-instagram/id1473867767" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Threads</a> is shutting down. The app will no longer be supported by the end of December 2021, the company confirmed to TechCrunch after reports of its impending closure began circulating via social media. Instagram is planning to alert its existing Threads users with an in-app notice beginning on November 23, which will direct them to return to Instagram to message their friends going forward.</p>
<p>Threads was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/instagram-launches-threads-a-close-friends-chat-app-with-auto-status/">introduced</a> in 2019 as a companion app to Instagram shortly after the company shut down its other standalone messaging app, Direct. Instead of focusing solely on the inbox experience, Threads was built as a &#8220;camera-first&#8221; mobile messager designed to be used for posting status updates and staying in touch with those you designated as your &#8220;Close Friends&#8221; on Instagram. The app didn&#8217;t gain mainstream adoption, however. But instead of iterating on the experience, Threads received little attention until a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/instagrams-threads-app-now-lets-you-message-everyone-like-its-direct-app-once-did/">revamp</a> last year, which made it possible to message everyone &#8212; not just &#8220;Close Friends&#8221; &#8212; as Direct had once offered.</p>
<p>Though the app had offered a way to update your Status &#8212; or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/03/instagram-launches-threads-a-close-friends-chat-app-with-auto-status/">even automatically update it</a>, based on your location &#8212; it had been difficult to navigate between the different sections of the app until the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/instagrams-threads-app-now-lets-you-message-everyone-like-its-direct-app-once-did/">2020 redesign</a>. With the update, Instagram attempted to make it easier to switch between friends&#8217; Stories, the Camera interface, and other parts of the experience. It still didn&#8217;t function as a quick way to read through your messages, though, and didn&#8217;t gain significant traction as a result of the changes.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235737" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The app today is ranked No. 214 in the Photo &amp; Video category on the U.S. App Store &#8212; an indication of its continued failure to catch on with a broader audience. It&#8217;s also rated a middling 3.1 stars across 2,500 reviews as users complain about its usability, layout, missing features and glitches. To date, Threads has seen approximately 13.7 million global installs from across the App Store and Google Play, according to estimates from app intelligence firm Sensor Tower.</p>
<p>The closure comes at a time when Meta (formerly, Facebook) is revamping its messaging platforms. Following Threads&#8217; debut, Facebook made Messenger and Instagram interoperable &#8212; meaning <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/facebook-introduces-cross-app-communication-between-messenger-and-instagram-plus-other-features/">Instagram users could message</a> friends on Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/messengers-latest-update-brings-new-features-cross-app-communication-with-instagram/">and vice versa</a>. The updates included a host of new features as well, like ways to co-watch videos, react with emoji, change the chat color and more. Eventually, the company wants to include WhatsApp in this cross-platform messaging experience.</p>
<p>Of course, those changes begged the question as to where that leaves a smaller companion app like Threads.</p>
<p>The app&#8217;s closure message was first spotted by <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1458213024259522563" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi</a>, and subsequently written up by smaller blogs. But Instagram had not yet confirmed the details publicly as the message wasn&#8217;t yet displaying to the app&#8217;s users.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company told TechCrunch its decision to close Threads came about because many of its most-loved features &#8212; like automatic captions and status &#8212; have either rolled out or are now rolling out to Instagram. Instagram also felt it could better focus its messaging efforts by not splitting its attention between two different apps.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that people care about connecting with their close friends, and we&#8217;ve seen this particularly over the past few years with the growth of messaging on Instagram. We&#8217;re now focusing our efforts on enhancing how you connect with close friends on Instagram, and deprecating the Threads app,&#8221; an Instagram spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch. &#8220;We&#8217;re bringing the fun and unique features we had on Threads to the main Instagram app, and continuing to build ways people can better connect with their close friends on Instagram. We hope this makes it easier for people to have all these features and abilities in the main app,&#8221; they added.</p>
<p>The company says it will release new messaging features on the main Instagram app in the months ahead.</p>
<p>On November 23, All Threads users on both iOS and Android will begin seeing the notices that the app will shut down by December, and Instagram&#8217;s Help Center will also display a notice that explains Threads will no longer be supported. When the app&#8217;s support ends, existing users will be logged out and the app will be removed from the App Store and Google Play. When the app closes down at year-end, all Threads features will be available on the main Instagram app.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.practiceignition.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Practice ignition</a>, an Australia-based client engagement and commerce platform for professional service businesses, has raised $50 million (65 million AUD) in a Series C round to accelerate its growth and expand globally. It brings the startup&#8217;s total raised to $75 million, said Guy Pearson, CEO and founder of Practice Ignition.</p>
<p>The fresh funding was led by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/jmi-equity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JMI Equity</a>, marking JMI’s first investment in Australia, with participation from previous backers including Tiger Global and EVP, as well as several strategic investors and family office groups.</p>
<p>Practice Ignition will use the proceeds to double down on growing its core key markets in Asia, North America and EMEA through further development, marketing and sales capabilities. The funding will also be used to fuel its U.S. market expansion through strategic partnerships with Gusto, Intuit and Thompson Reuters.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235560" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The Series C raise comes on the heels of a series of announcements. Practice Ignition recently unveiled <a href="https://www.practiceignition.com/news/practice-ignition-and-gusto-partner-to-launch-first-ever-integration-to-accelerate-people-advisory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a partnership with Gusto</a> to accelerate the adoption and knowledge of people advisory services. It also announced plans to <a href="https://www.practiceignition.com/news/practice-ignition-expands-r-d-in-toronto-to-focus-on-north-american-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set up a new R&amp;D</a> team in Toronto, supporting its innovation and customer expansion goals in North America.</p>
<p>Practice Ignition is on an ambitious path to reshape the professional services industry that does business with its customers through its all-in-one client engagement and commerce solution. Its platform integrates digital proposals, payments and automated workflows via leading business apps such as Gusto, Xero, QuickBooks and Zapier to streamline service-based commerce.</p>

<p>Practice Ignition has experienced tremendous growth since its inception, almost doubling client revenues facilitated via its platform in 2021. The business is on track to drive significant growth in 2022, with more than 1 million clients across six markets and over $2 billion in client revenue under management.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Practice Ignition was founded in 2013 by accounting entrepreneur Guy Pearson and product designer Dane Thomas, who grew frustrated by antiquated manual processes and late payments from clients.</p>
<p>Pearson said its platform was primarily a tool for accountants and bookkeepers, who are still a big part of its customer base. There are a lot of similar workflows in other areas of professional services, such as marketing and consulting, that Practice Ignition believes it can provide value to, he continued. It is continuing to build the platform to suit a broader range of customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are creating a new category with our client engagement and commerce platform, and we&#8217;re only scratching the surface when it comes to market penetration in the global professional services industry,&#8221; according to Pearson.</p>
<p>As the global professional services industry faces mounting pressure to digitize its operations and customer interactions in light of COVID-19, which has accelerated digital transformation globally, Practice Ignition is gearing up for a substantial shift, Pearson said.</p>
<p>“As the world moves online, many accountants and bookkeepers have to rapidly shift their business practices and functions to be fully digital overnight. With the transition of accounting from tax compliance to advisory, this means that the need to deliver engaging, quality customer interactions via technology is critical for closing deals, boosting profitability and winning and retaining clients,” Pearson said.</p>
<p>“Guy, Dane and the team at Practice Ignition have built a category-defining business with a world-class team. We have been impressed by the strength of the product, the engaged and loyal customer base and the enormous potential for growth and scale globally,” said Sureel Sheth, principal at JMI Equity.</p>

<p>The company unveiled the production-intent version of the Fisker Ocean SUV on Wednesday at the Los Angeles Auto Show.</p>
<p>The electric vehicle — Fisker&#8217;s first — will have a distinctive 17.1-inch central screen made by Foxconn that can rotate from portrait mode to landscape, which the automaker has dubbed &#8220;Hollywood mode.&#8221; This Hollywood mode is for the driver and passengers to watch movies or play games when the vehicle is parked and charging.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235779" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2235857" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fisker-screen.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235857" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2235857 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fisker-screen.jpg" alt="fisker ocean electric vehicle foxconn screen" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fisker-screen.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fisker-screen.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fisker-screen.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fisker-screen.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fisker-screen.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fisker-screen.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fisker-screen.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2235857" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Kirsten Korosec</p></div></p>
<p>Henrik Fisker, the company&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, said they&#8217;ve filed a patent on that swiveling screen technology.</p>
<p>Fisker initially unveiled a prototype of the Ocean SUV at CES 2020, the annual tech trade show in Las Vegas. Now, the company is sharing more specs about the vehicle, including range, various trim levels and corresponding prices as well as details like a solar roof for passive charging.</p>
<p>Fisker plans to offer four trims, in 14 possible colors, starting with the base-level Sport priced at $37,499 — before incentives or taxes. The Sport, which has a peak 275 horsepower, will have an estimated range of 250 miles on a single charge using lithium-ion phosphate battery cell chemistry supplied by CATL.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The other trims, both of which are all-wheel, dual motor vehicles, are the Fisker Ocean Ultra that&#8217;s priced at $49,999 and the Extreme trim at $68,999. The first 5,000 vehicles will be the Fisker Ocean One, also at the highest price of $68,999. With those dual motors comes more power and faster acceleration times. The estimated peak horsepower of the Ultra will be 540 hp and a zero to 60 mph acceleration time of 3.9 seconds. The Extreme and Ocean One will have a 550 hp and a 0 to 60 mph acceleration time of 3.6 seconds.</p>
<p>The Ultra, Extreme and first edition will have CATL battery cells with a nickel manganese cobalt battery chemistry. The Ultra will have an estimated range of 340 miles and the Extreme will push the range beyond 350 miles, according to the company.</p>
<p>Fisker has two vehicle programs in the works. The Fisker Ocean SUV, which took center stage at the company&#8217;s stand at the Los Angeles Auto Show, will be assembled by automotive contract manufacturer Magna Steyr in Europe. The start of production is scheduled to begin in November 2022. Deliveries will begin in Europe and the United States in late 2022, with a plan to reach production capacity of more than 5,000 vehicles per month during 2023. Deliveries to customers in China are also expected to begin in 2023.</p>
<p>In May 2021, Fisker signed an agreement with Foxconn to co-develop and manufacture a new electric vehicle. Henrik Fisker said the two companies moved on the design &#8220;fairly quickly,&#8221; and are now diving into the engineering and technical details that include working on a patent for a new way of opening a trunk and other technological innovations.</p>
<p>Curiously, the vehicle manufacturing partnership came out of Fisker&#8217;s conversations with Foxconn to supply a unique infotainment display, Henrik Fisker told TechCrunch in an interview Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The real issue we have in the car industry is the technology in that car is more than three years,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And there&#8217;s something wrong with that because we always feel like our phones are better and smarter and faster than what&#8217;s in our cars.&#8221;</p>
<p>The aim was to move as fast as the iPhone makers, he said in reference to Foxconn.</p>
<p>Fisker began discussions with Foxconn in January and locked in a deal soon after. The vehicle manufacturing deal, known as Project PEAR, soon followed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Just a few months after launching <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/spotifys-podcasts-subscriptions-service-is-now-open-to-all-u-s-creators/">support for podcast subscriptions</a> to U.S. creators, Spotify today is making the service available to creators in global markets. The company says the service, which allows creators to mark episodes as &#8220;subscriber-only&#8221; content, will now become available in 33 new markets worldwide.</p>
<p>When podcast subscriptions publicly launched in the U.S., Spotify had introduced a couple of key changes to how the service worked. Before, creators had only been able to choose from one of three price points for their paid shows. But Spotify heard from creators they wanted more pricing flexibility, so it revamped pricing with the introduction of 20 price point options for creators to choose from, starting as low as $0.49 and increasing to as much as $150.</p>
<p>The company also launched a feature that would allow creators to download a list of their subscribers&#8217; contact information, so they could further develop their direct relationship with their audience.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235784" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As the service rolls out globally, Spotify isn&#8217;t introducing any new features, it says. Instead, the expansion is just about bringing podcast subscriptions to more people.</p>
<p>Spotify&#8217;s podcast subscription platform isn&#8217;t the only one on the market. Apple offers its version of subscriptions, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/">takes</a> a <a href="https://podcasters.apple.com/878-subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30% cut</a> of creator revenue, which drops to 15% in year two &#8212; similar to other subscription apps. Spotify, meanwhile, is hoping to grow its service by waiving its commissions for the first two years. When the free period ends, it then plans to take a much lower commission of just 5%.</p>
<p>Spotify&#8217;s subscription podcasts service is offered via its podcast creation platform Anchor, which notes the subscriptions available to 29 markets today on both iOS and Android. The remaining four markets will roll out next week.</p>
<p>Included in the global rollout are Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Next week Canada, Germany, Austria and  France will be supported.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In other podcast news, Spotify additionally announced a multi-year exclusive agreement with Bad Robot Audio, a new audio-focused division of Bad Robot, the production company formed by J.J. Abrams in 2001.</p>
<p>Bad Robot is behind shows like &#8220;Lost,&#8221; &#8220;Alias,&#8221; &#8220;Fringe,&#8221; &#8220;Person of Interest,&#8221; &#8220;Castle Rock,&#8221; &#8220;Westworld&#8221; and others, as well as films like &#8220;Super 8,&#8221; &#8220;Star Wars: The Force Awakens,&#8221; &#8220;Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker&#8221; and the &#8220;Star Trek,&#8221; &#8220;Mission: Impossible&#8221; and &#8220;Cloverfield&#8221; franchises.</p>
<p>The new division is being led by former Audible and <span class="il">Spotify</span> award-winning executive, Christina Choi, who joins as head of Podcasts at Bad Robot. The company isn&#8217;t yet detailing what shows it may offer on Spotify, but notes that they&#8217;ll include both &#8220;narrative non-fiction and fiction podcast productions.&#8221;</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Every marketplace or platform startup has to decide how much they should charge for transactions on their platform, known as the &#8220;take rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>While there is no formula set in stone, I’ve analyzed the take rates of over 25 private and public marketplaces below. I’ll use these to help shed light on some considerations for founders to guide their decision.</p>
<p>Note that the definition of &#8220;take rate&#8221; used in this piece will be a percentage, which is calculated by dividing the revenue made on the transaction by the platform by the total value of the transaction.</p>
<h2>Maximizing take rate isn’t the goal</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s important for founders to remember that maximizing the take rate of the platform is not the goal.</p>
<p>A higher take rate typically leads to lower transaction volume, and depending on the stage a company is in, it may be advantageous to charge a lower take rate than what you can sustain to gain a strategic advantage.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2235651" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2235651" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2235651 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/take-rate.001.jpeg" alt="platform take rates" width="2000" height="1000" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/take-rate.001.jpeg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/take-rate.001.jpeg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/take-rate.001.jpeg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/take-rate.001.jpeg?resize=768,384 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/take-rate.001.jpeg?resize=680,340 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/take-rate.001.jpeg?resize=1536,768 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/take-rate.001.jpeg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2235651" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tanay Jaipuria</p></div></p>
<p>You can see startups do this when they are going after relatively nascent markets that they are trying to grow. A great example of this is OpenSea, which charges a 2.5% fee on transactions, which is quite low compared to other marketplaces. However, given that NFTs were relatively nascent, their low fees helped reduce friction to trading and grow the size of the market.</p>
<p>This also happens in markets that are extremely competitive and have some winner-take-all dynamics of economies of scale. Here, a marketplace could start with lower take rates to try to grab share or achieve scale.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The more value a marketplace provides via value-added services, the higher the take rate it can charge.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>A general rule of thumb to remember is that the goal is to maximize long-term profit: (take rate x average transaction value &#8211; variable cost) x (number of transactions).</p>
<p>Note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The take rate and number of transactions will often trade off with each other.</li>
<li>A lower take rate in the short term can lead to better outcomes in the long term.</li>
<li>Charging lower take rates than what you can &#8220;get away with&#8221; may lead to higher retention and value creation in the long run.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Understand the nature of your market</h2>
<p>Referring to the chart above, it’s clear that take rates are extremely variable, even within industries. However, certain market-driven factors play a role in determining the ranges in which you can operate.</p>
<p>For instance, certain companies such as Uber have to charge very different take rates in delivery (~10%) versus ride-sharing (~20%).</p>
<p>When trying to understand the nature of the market, founders should consider:</p>
<h3>Is the product being sold digital or physical, and how much margin is available?<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. government, along with counterparts in Australia and the U.K., have warned that Iranian state-backed hackers are targeting U.S. organizations in critical infrastructure sectors — in some cases with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a>.</p>
<p>The rare warning linking Iran with ransomware landed in a <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-321a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">joint advisory</a> Wednesday, issued by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) and the U.K.&#8217;s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).</p>
<p>The advisory said that Iran-backed attackers have been exploiting Fortinet vulnerabilities since at least March and a Microsoft Exchange ProxyShell vulnerability since October to gain access to U.S. critical infrastructure organizations in the transport and public health sectors, as well as organizations in Australia. The aim of the hackers is ultimately to leverage this access for follow-on operations such as data exfiltration, extortion and ransomware deployment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235748" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In May this year, for example, the hackers abused Fortigate gear to access a web server hosting the domain for a U.S. municipal government. The following month, CISA and the FBI observed the hackers exploiting Fortinet vulnerabilities to access the networks of a U.S.-based hospital specializing in healthcare for children.</p>
<p>The joint advisory has been released alongside a separate report from Microsoft on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/11/16/evolving-trends-in-iranian-threat-actor-activity-mstic-presentation-at-cyberwarcon-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the evolution of Iranian APTs, </a>which are &#8220;increasingly utilizing ransomware to either collect funds or disrupt their targets.&#8221; In the report, Microsoft said it has been tracking six Iranian threat groups that have been deploying ransomware and exfiltrating data in attacks that started in September 2020.</p>
<p>Microsoft singles out one particularly “aggressive” group it calls Phosphorus, also known as APT35, which the company has been tracking for the past two years. While it previously used <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/27/microsoft-sues-phosphorus/">spear-phishing emails</a> to lure victims, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/04/microsoft-iran-phosphorous-attack/">presidential candidates</a> during the 2020 U.S. election, Microsoft says the group is now employing social engineering tactics to build rapport with their victims before using BitLocker, a full-disk encryption feature built into Windows, to encrypt their files.</p>
<p>CISA and the FBI are urging organizations to take a series of actions to mitigate the threats posed by the Iranian attackers, including updating operating systems, implementing network segmentation and using <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/multi-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication</a> and strong passwords.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.overwolf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overwolf</a>, a platform that enables creators to build, share and monetize items inside games, has raised a $75 million Series D funding round, led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). Previous investors, including Griffin Gaming Partners, Insight Partners, Intel Capital, Liberty Technology Venture Capital and Marker also participated. The funding will be pumped into Overwolf’s CurseForge Core, a solution that enables game studios, IP owners and in-game creators to build user-generated content inside games.</p>
<p>The world where &#8220;gold&#8221; and in-game mods were bought and sold has moved on considerably. Players are now being enticed by the ability to build and share experiences inside games, creating a whole new sector for creators and game-owners alike.</p>
<p>Based in Tel Aviv, Overwolf has raised over $150 million to date from investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Atreides Management, Griffin Gaming Partners, Insight, Marker, Intel Capital, Liberty Technology Venture Capital, Market and Ubisoft.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235776" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>CurseForge Core is a white-label solution that allows publishers to easily integrate mods into their existing and new games.</p>
<p>As well as being a technical solution, Overwolf offers game developers a full-service UGC platform that will cover content moderation, IP and various other aspects.</p>
<p>Uri Marchand, Overwolf co-founder and CEO, said, “No single game studio can compete with the speed of execution and sheer creativity of a passionate community. Instead of resisting community creations, we have seen a shift in perception with leading game studios starting to embrace the value that these creators bring to the community and to the studio itself.”</p>
<p>Overwolf says it has amassed some 87,000 in-game creators, while more than 20 million gamers use Overwolf’s products monthly. It predicts it will pay out $29 million to in-game creators, nearly three times last year’s number. It’s also launching the Overwolf Creators Fund, a $50 million fund to support in-game app creators and mod authors, as well as game studios that plan to integrate mods into new titles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jonathan Lai, a partner at a16z, said: “The biggest social platforms today, including TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, are heavily driven by creators who generate content for friends, family, and the community. As games continue to evolve into social networks, creators and user-generated content will play an equally important role. Overwolf&#8217;s platform makes it possible for any player to become a co-creator of their favorite game thanks to a robust development engine, an app store for distribution, and monetization tools for creators to earn a living from their work.”</p>
<p>Speaking to me over a call, I asked Marchand if Overwolf could conceivably become a sort of &#8220;building block&#8221; for a proposed metaverse-style environment?</p>
<p>“If we&#8217;re talking about consistent experiences across games, then we can potentially create that and bridge the gap in a way that&#8217;s aligned with the IP owners,” he told me.</p>
<p>“It could be a sword, or it could be a narrative, it could be a lot of those things. I think a big part of the metaverse apart from people being able to talk and switch between experiences and create ownership is creation &#8212; and we&#8217;re a company that&#8217;s focused on the creation elements,” he added.</p>
<p>A competitor to overworld is Mod.io, which recently raised $26 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It was going to be a big couple of years for agricultural robotics well before COVID-19 was on our collective radar. Population growth and environmental concerns have been big drivers for those working to figure out how to feed people in the future. The pandemic, meanwhile, has only accelerated concerns, as many farmers have struggled to staff field-hand positions.</p>
<p>Fieldin &#8212; which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/22/tel-aviv-meetup-winners/">made its first appearance</a> on these pages as a Tel Aviv pitch-off winner back in 2016 &#8212; today announced plans to acquire Midnight Robotics. It’s certainly a good match on its face. California-based (by way of Israel and Australia) Fieldin works to help farmers accelerate data collection and automation. Midnight, meanwhile, retrofits tractors and other farming equipment with lidar-based sensing technologies.</p>
<p>Fieldin says its technology takes around a day to get up and running. As with many of these services, the company sends a technician to the farm to help on-board farmers. On the face of it, at least, it’s an easier life than many of the existing technologies that require famers to purchase brand new technology &#8212; something that’s cost-prohibitive for those on a tight budget.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2235699" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<hr />
<p>The acquisition will integrate Midnight’s technology into Fieldin’s existing solution.</p>
<p>“Over the past eight years we’ve digitized hundreds of farms and over 10,000 tractors and pieces of farming equipment — more than anyone else in the high-value crop world — and amassed a trove of invaluable data that can offer insights into best practices in farm management,” Fieldin co-founder and CEO Boaz Bachar said in a release. “By acquiring Midnight Robotics, we’re helping farmers close the loop from insight to autonomous action, so they know exactly what they need to do and execute it autonomously, all through the same platform.”</p>
<p>Midnight co-founders Yonatan Horovitz and Edo Reshef will join Fieldin as chief autonomy office and chief technology officer, respectively. They will also both be listed as Fieldin co-founders, per the deal.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
