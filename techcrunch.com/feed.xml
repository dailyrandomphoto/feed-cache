										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For years now, a growing number of tech companies &#8212; large and small &#8212; have either relocated their headquarters to Austin or opened another office or campus in the Texas capital. They&#8217;ve been drawn to the city for a number of factors, including its laid-back lifestyle, no state tax, a business-friendly environment and lower cost of living (for now).</p>
<p>The impact on the city’s startup ecosystem is noticeable in the growing number of entrepreneurs (many of whom worked at some of the tech giants who have a big presence in the city) and investors calling Austin home.</p>
<p>Most recently, Tesla’s plans to build a gigafactory in the city and Oracle’s announcement that it was relocating its headquarters here have made national headlines.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The comparisons to the Bay Area abound &#8212; from the burgeoning and maturing startup scene to an overheated and competitive housing market.</p>
<p>All the while, venture capitalists see several key areas of opportunities. At one point, Austin was once a big enterprise software city. While software is still big here, a number of other sectors are growing including CPG (consumer packaged goods) and real estate tech, among others.</p>
<p>What follows is a survey of some of the top VCs in the city and their projections about the growth of Austin’s ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s who we spoke to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Eric Engineer, S3 Ventures</li>
<li>Morgan Flager, Silverton Partners</li>

It’s hard enough just to characterize the scene as it is right now. There are so many companies of so many different sizes doing so many different things, and there isn’t really a unifying characteristic beyond growth and innovation. It really could go any direction.&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:513,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;12&quot;:0}">Carey Smith, Unorthodox Ventures</span></li>

Austin is a place where people want to succeed by helping their community succeed, and they aren’t willing to sacrifice the former for the latter. If we continue to hold on to that core philosophy as we grow, we’re in for an amazing future.&#8221;</span></p>

Part of my role as an investor and steward of the Austin ecosystem is to facilitate more connectivity within the founder community.

					<description><![CDATA[Bucky Moore, a partner at Kleiner Perkins, gives founders tactical advice on the process of raising a Series A round.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">During a seed funding round, a founder needs to convince a venture capital investor on a vision. But during a Series A fundraise, napkin-stage ideas don’t make the cut — a founder needs product progress, numbers, and revenue (or at least a plan to eventually generate some).</p>
<p>In many ways, the stakes are higher for a Series A — and Bucky Moore, a partner at Kleiner Perkins, joined <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/early-stage-2021/">TechCrunch Early Stage</a> last week to give founders tactical advice on the process of raising one.</p>
<p>Moore spoke about storytelling over semantics, pricing, and where his firm sees itself “raising the bar” for startups.</p>
<p>Here are a few key points; a full video and a transcript of the entire conversation are linked at the bottom.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Explain to investors why you are raising now</h2>
<p>More companies will raise seed rounds than Series A rounds, simply due to the fact that many startups fail, and venture only makes sense for a small fraction of businesses out there. Every check is a new cycle of convincing and proving that you, as a startup, will have venture-scale returns. Moore explained that startups looking to move to their next round need to explain to investors why now is their moment.</p>
<blockquote><p>The way I think about “why now” is [that] it is an opportunity for you as a founder to convey a unique insight and understanding of your market opportunity, the history of the space that you&#8217;re in, why companies have succeeded or failed in that space, historically speaking, and what are the known challenges from a go-to-market perspective; what headwinds will you be up against at a macro level. These are all things that I think people like me get really excited about when hearing unique insight from founders, because it suggests that they&#8217;ve really studied their market opportunity, and they understand it. <strong><em>(Timestamp: 2:19)</em></strong></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While visual &#8216;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/no-code/">no code</a>&#8216; tools are helping businesses get more out of computing without the need for armies of in-house techies to configure software on behalf of other staff, access to the most powerful tech tools &#8212; at the &#8216;deep tech&#8217; AI coal face &#8212; still requires some expert help (and/or costly in-house expertise).</p>
<p>This is where bootstrapping French startup, <a href="https://nlpcloud.io">NLPCloud.io</a>, is plying a trade in MLOps/AIOps &#8212; or &#8216;compute platform as a service&#8217; (being as it runs the queries on its own servers) &#8212; with a focus on natural language processing (NLP), as its name suggests.</p>
<p>Developments in artificial intelligence have, in recent years, led to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/17/openai-text-generator-dangerous/">impressive advances in the field of NLP</a> &#8212; a technology that can help businesses scale their capacity to intelligently grapple with all sorts of communications by automating tasks like Named Entity Recognition, sentiment-analysis, text classification, summarization, question answering, and Part-Of-Speech tagging, freeing up (human) staff to focus on more complex/nuanced work. (Although it&#8217;s worth emphasizing that the bulk of NLP research has focused on the English language &#8212; meaning that&#8217;s where this tech is most mature; so associated AI advances are not universally distributed.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="78mJtCyFNR"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/17/openai-text-generator-dangerous/">OpenAI built a text generator so good, it&#8217;s considered too dangerous to release</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;OpenAI built a text generator so good, it&#8217;s considered too dangerous to release&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/17/openai-text-generator-dangerous/embed/#?secret=78mJtCyFNR" data-secret="78mJtCyFNR" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Production ready (pre-trained) NLP models for English are readily available &#8216;out of the box&#8217;. There are also dedicated open source frameworks offering help with training models. But businesses wanting to tap into NLP still need to have the DevOps resource and chops to implement NLP models.</p>
<p>NLPCloud.io is catering to businesses that don&#8217;t feel up to the implementation challenge themselves &#8212; offering &#8220;production-ready NLP API&#8221; with the promise of &#8220;no DevOps required&#8221;.</p>
<p>Its API is based on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/hugging-face-raises-40-million-for-its-natural-language-processing-library/">Hugging Face</a> and <a href="https://spacy.io">spaCy</a> open-source models. Customers can either choose to use ready-to-use pre-trained models (it selects the &#8220;best&#8221; open source models; it does not build its own); or they can upload custom models developed internally by their own data scientists &#8212; which it says is a point of differentiation vs SaaS services such as Google Natural Language (which uses Google&#8217;s ML models) or Amazon Comprehend and Monkey Learn.</p>
<p>NLPCloud.io says it wants to democratize NLP by helping developers and data scientists deliver these projects &#8220;in no time and at a fair price&#8221;. (It has a tiered <a href="https://nlpcloud.io/#plans">pricing model</a> based on requests per minute, which starts at $39pm and ranges up to $1,199pm, at the enterprise end, for one custom model running on a GPU. It does also offer a free tier so users can test models at low request velocity without incurring a charge.)</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea came from the fact that, as a software engineer, I saw many AI projects fail because of the deployment to production phase,&#8221; says sole founder and CTO Julien Salinas. &#8220;Companies often focus on building accurate and fast AI models but today more and more excellent open-source models are available and are doing an excellent job&#8230; so the toughest challenge now is being able to efficiently use these models in production. It takes AI skills, DevOps skills, programming skill&#8230; which is why it&#8217;s a challenge for so many companies, and which is why I decided to launch NLPCloud.io.&#8221;</p>
<p>The platform launched in January 2021 and now has around 500 users, including 30 who are paying for the service. While the startup, which is based in Grenoble, in the French Alps, is a team of three for now, plus a couple of independent contractors. (Salinas says he plans to hire five people by the end of the year.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of our users are tech startups but we also start having a couple of bigger companies,&#8221; he tells TechCrunch. &#8220;The biggest demand I&#8217;m seeing is both from software engineers and data scientists. Sometimes it&#8217;s from teams who have data science skills but don&#8217;t have DevOps skills (or don&#8217;t want to spend time on this). Sometimes it&#8217;s from tech teams who want to leverage NLP out-of-the-box without hiring a whole data science team.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have very diverse customers, from solo startup founders to bigger companies like BBVA, Mintel, Senuto&#8230; in all sorts of sectors (banking, public relations, market research),&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p>Use cases of its customers include lead generation from unstructured text (such as web pages), via named entities extraction; and sorting support tickets based on urgency by conducting sentiment analysis.</p>
<p>Content marketers are also using its platform for headline generation (via summarization). While text classification capabilities are being used for economic intelligence and financial data extraction, per Salinas.</p>
<p>He says his own experience as a CTO and software engineer working on NLP projects at a number of tech companies led him to spot an opportunity in the challenge of AI implementation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I realized that it was quite easy to build acceptable NLP models thanks to great open-source frameworks like spaCy and Hugging Face Transformers but then I found it quite hard to use these models in production,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;It takes programming skills in order to develop an API, strong DevOps skills in order to build a robust and fast infrastructure to serve NLP models (AI models in general consume a lot of resources), and also data science skills of course.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to look for ready-to-use cloud solutions in order to save weeks of work but I couldn&#8217;t find anything satisfactory. My intuition was that such a platform would help tech teams save a lot of time, sometimes months of work for the teams who don&#8217;t have strong DevOps profiles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;NLP has been around for decades but until recently it took whole teams of data scientists to build acceptable NLP models. For a couple of years, we&#8217;ve made amazing progress in terms of accuracy and speed of the NLP models. More and more experts who have been working in the NLP field for decades agree that NLP is becoming a &#8216;commodity&#8217;,&#8221; he goes on. &#8220;Frameworks like spaCy make it extremely simple for developers to leverage NLP models without having advanced data science knowledge. And Hugging Face&#8217;s open-source repository for NLP models is also a great step in this direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;But having these models run in production is still hard, and maybe even harder than before as these brand new models are very demanding in terms of resources.&#8221;</p>
<p>The models NLPCloud.io offers are picked for performance &#8212; where &#8220;best&#8221; means it has &#8220;the best compromise between accuracy and speed&#8221;. Salinas also says they are paying mind to context, given NLP can be used for diverse user cases &#8212; hence proposing number of models so as to be able to adapt to a given use.</p>
<p>&#8220;Initially we started with models dedicated to entities extraction only but most of our first customers also asked for other use cases too, so we started adding other models,&#8221; he notes, adding that they will continue to add more models from the two chosen frameworks &#8212; &#8220;in order to cover more use cases, and more languages&#8221;.</p>
<p>SpaCy and Hugging Face, meanwhile, were chosen to be the source for the models offered via its API based on their track record as companies, the NLP libraries they offer and their focus on production-ready framework &#8212; with the combination allowing NLPCloud.io to offer a selection of models that are fast and accurate, working within the bounds of respective trade-offs, according to Salinas.</p>
<p>&#8220;SpaCy is developed by a solid company in Germany called Explosion.ai. This library has become one of the most used NLP libraries among companies who want to leverage NLP in production &#8216;for real&#8217; (as opposed to academic research only). The reason is that it is very fast, has great accuracy in most scenarios, and is an opinionated&#8221; framework which makes it very simple to use by non-data scientists (the tradeoff is that it gives less customization possibilities),&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/hugging-face-raises-15-million-to-build-the-definitive-natural-language-processing-library/">Hugging Face</a> is an even more solid company that <a title="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/hugging-face-raises-40-million-for-its-natural-language-processing-library/" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/hugging-face-raises-40-million-for-its-natural-language-processing-library/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/hugging-face-raises-40-million-for-its-natural-language-processing-library/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1618050204207000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEmZDvxn9bG1Q7PE1ap2fYv2iJmDw">recently raised $40M</a> for a good reason: They created a disruptive NLP library called &#8216;transformers&#8217; that improves a lot the accuracy of NLP models (the tradeoff is that it is very resource intensive though). It gives the opportunity to cover more use cases like sentiment analysis, classification, summarization&#8230; In addition to that, they created an open-source repository where it is easy to select the best model you need for your use case.&#8221;</p>
<p>While AI is advancing at a clip within certain tracks &#8212; such as NLP for English &#8212; there are still caveats and potential pitfalls attached to automating language processing and analysis, with the risk of getting stuff wrong or worse. AI models trained on human-generated data have, for example, been shown reflecting embedded biases and prejudices of the people who produced the underlying data.</p>
<p>Salinas agrees NLP can sometimes face &#8220;concerning bias issues&#8221;, such as racism and misogyny. But he expresses confidence in the models they&#8217;ve selected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of the time it seems [bias in NLP] is due to the underlying data used to trained the models. It shows we should be more careful about the origin of this data,&#8221; he says. &#8220;In my opinion the best solution in order to mitigate this is that the community of NLP users should actively report something inappropriate when using a specific model so that this model can be paused and fixed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if we doubt that such a bias exists in the models we&#8217;re proposing, we do encourage our users to report such problems to us so we can take measures,&#8221; he adds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://vybecard.com">Vybe</a> has raised a $2.9 million funding round (€2.4 million) to build a challenger bank for teens. The company is currently testing its product with a soft launch. Users get a Mastercard payment card paired with an e-wallet.</p>
<p>Each Vybe account comes with its own IBAN so that users can send and receive money. If you want to open an account and you are less than 18 years old, you have to go through the KYC process (know your identity) with your parent.</p>
<p>As for parents, they can set up some limits on card payments or even block the card. Parents can also view transactions. The startup plans to generate revenue from interchange fees as well as partnership with brands and a reward system.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While Vybe isn’t technically live, the company has attracted 375,000 downloads. Overall, 260,000 teens have pre-ordered a card already. Thousands of cards have been delivered and the first metrics are encouraging. Early adopters tend to use their card once every two days.</p>
<p>Today’s fund is a round extension from existing investors. Investors include Ronan Le Moal, the former CEO of Crédit Mutuel Arkéa, Kick Club and Manoel Amorim.</p>
<p>Banking products for teenagers are a lucrative segment. In France, there are several companies trying to position themselves on this segment, such as <a href="https://www.kard.eu">Kard</a>, <a href="https://www.pixpay.fr">PixPay</a> and <a href="https://www.xaalys.com">Xaalys</a>. Most of these companies charge a subscription fee to access the service.</p>
<p>Other fintech companies that aren’t specifically targeting young people could also work well with teenagers. For instance, young users can open a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/revolut-launches-revolut-junior-to-help-you-manage-allowance/">Revolut Junior</a> or <a href="https://lydia-app.com">Lydia</a> account and receive money from their parents.</p>
<p>In the U.S., startups offering debit cards for children are about to reach unicorn status. As The Information’s Kate Clark <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/kid-debit-card-startup-greenlight-valued-at-2-billion-in-andreessen-led-round">reported</a>, <a href="https://www.greenlightcard.com">Greenlight</a>, <a href="https://current.com">Current</a> and <a href="https://www.step.com">Step</a> are all raising new funding rounds with a valuation between $1 billion and $2 billion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The office shut-down at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic last year spurred huge investment in digital transformation and a wave of tech companies helping with that, but there were some distinct losers in the shift, too &#8212; specifically those whose business models were predicated on serving the very offices that disappeared overnight. Today, one of the companies that had to make an immediate pivot to keep itself afloat is announcing a round of funding, after finding itself not just growing at a clip, but making a profit, as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.snackmagic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SnackMagic</a>, a build-your-own snack box service, has raised $15 million in a Series A round of funding led by Craft Ventures, with Luxor Capital also participating.</p>
<p>(Both investors have an interesting track record in the food-on-demand space: Most recently, Luxor co-led a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$528 million round in Glovo in Spain</a>, while Craft backs/has backed the likes of Cloud Kitchens, Postmates and <a href="https://www.craftventures.com/portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many more</a>).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding comes on the back of a strong year for the company, which hit a $20 million revenue run rate in eight months and turned profitable in December 2020.</p>
<p>Founder and CEO Shaunak Amin said in an interview that the plan will be to use the funding both to continue growing SnackMagic&#8217;s existing business, as well as extend into other kinds of gifting categories. Currently, you can ship snacks anywhere in the world, but the customizable boxes &#8212; recipients are gifted an amount that they can spend, and they choose what they want in the box themselves from <a href="https://www.snackmagic.com/menu/featured" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SnackMagic&#8217;s menu</a>, or one that a business has created and branded as a subset of that &#8212; are only available in locations in North America, serviced by SnackMagic&#8217;s primary warehouse. Other locations are given options of pre-packed boxes of snacks right now, but the plan is to slowly extend its pick-and-mix model to more geographies, starting with the U.K.</p>
<p>Alongside this, the company plans to continue widening the categories of items that people can gift each other beyond chocolates, chips, hot sauces and other fun food items, into areas like alcohol, meal kits, and non-food items.&nbsp;There&#8217;s also scope for expanding to more use cases into areas like corporate gifting, marketing and consumer services, and analytics coming out of its sales.</p>
<p>Amin calls the data that SnackMagic is amassing about customer interest in different brands and products &#8220;the hidden gem&#8221; of the platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of the most interesting things,&#8221; he said. Brands that want to add their items to the wider pool of products &#8212; which today numbers between 700 and 800 items &#8212; also get access to a dashboard where they monitor what&#8217;s selling, how much stock is left of their own items, and so on. &#8220;One thing that is very opaque [in the CPG world] is good data.&#8221;</p>
<p>For many of the bigger companies that lack their own direct sales channels, it&#8217;s a significantly richer data set than what they typically get from selling items in the average brick and mortar store, or from a bigger online retailer like Amazon. &#8220;All these bigger brands like Pepsi and Kellogg not only want to know this about their own products more but also about the brands they are trying to buy,&#8221; Amin said. Several of them, he added, have approached his company to partner and invest, so I guess we should watch this space.</p>
<p>SnackMagic&#8217;s success comes from a somewhat unintended, unlikely beginning, and it&#8217;s a testament to the power of compelling, yet extensible technology that can be scaled and repurposed if necessary. In its case, there is personalization technology, logistics management, product inventory and accounting, and lots of data analytics involved.</p>
<p>The company started out as Stadium, a lunch delivery service in New York City that was leveraging the fact that when co-workers ordered lunch or dinner together for the office &#8212; say around a team-building event or a late-night working session, or just for a regular work day &#8212; oftentimes they found that people all hankered for different things to eat.</p>
<p>In many cases, people typically make separate orders for the different items, but that also means if you are ordering to all eat together, things would not arrive at the same time; if it&#8217;s being expensed, it&#8217;s more complicated on that front too; and if you&#8217;re thinking about carbon footprints, it might also mean a lot less efficiency on that front too.</p>
<p>Stadium&#8217;s solution was a platform that provided access to multiple restaurants&#8217; menus, and people could pick from all of them for a single order.&nbsp;The business had been operating for six years and was really starting to take off.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were quite well known in the city, and we had plans to expand, and we were on track for March 2020 being our best month ever,&#8221; Amin said. Then, Covid-19 hit. &#8220;There was no one left in the office,&#8221; he said. Revenue disappeared overnight, since the idea of delivering many items to one place instantly stopped being a need.</p>
<p>Amin said that they took a look at the platform they had built to pick many options (and many different costs, and the accounting that came with that) and thought about how to use that for a different end. It turned out that even with people working remotely, companies wanted to give props to their workers, either just to say hello and thanks, or around a specific team event, in the form of food and treats &#8212; all the more so since the supply of snacks you typically come across in so many office canteens and kitchens were no longer there for workers to tap.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting, but perhaps also unsurprising, that one of the by-products of our new way of working has been the rise of more services that cater (no pun intended) to people working in more decentralised ways, and that companies exploring how to improve rewarding people in those environments are also seeing a bump.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, we wrote about a company called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/alyce-an-ai-based-personalised-corporate-gifting-startup-raises-30m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alyce raising $30 million for its corporate gifting platform</a> that is also based on personalization &#8212; using AI to help understand the interests of the recipient to make better choices of items that a person might want to receive.</p>
<p>Alyce is taking a somewhat different approach to SnackMagic: it&#8217;s not holding any products itself, and there is no warehouse but rather a platform that links up buyers with those providing products. And Alyce&#8217;s initial audience is different, too: instead of internal employees (the first, but not final, focus for SnackMagic) it is targeting corporate gifting, or presents that sales and marketing people might send to prospects or current clients as a please and thank you gesture.</p>
<p>But you can also see how and where the two might meet in the middle &#8212; and compete not just with each other, but the many other online retailers, Amazon and otherwise, plus the consumer goods companies themselves looking for ways of diversifying business by extending beyond the B2C channel.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don’t worry about Amazon. We just get better,&#8221; Amin said when I asked him about whether he worried that SnackMagic was too easy to replicate. &#8220;It might be tough anyway,&#8221; he added, since &#8220;others might have the snacks but picking and packing and doing individual customization is very different from regular e-commerce. It&#8217;s really more like scalable gifting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Investors are impressed with the quick turnaround and identification of a market opportunity, and how it quickly retooled its tech to make it fit for purpose.</p>
<p>“SnackMagic’s immediate success was due to an excellent combination of timing, innovative thinking and world-class execution,” said Bryan Rosenblatt, principal investor at Craft Ventures, in a statement. “As companies embrace the future of a flexible workplace, SnackMagic is not just a snack box delivery platform but a company culture builder.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Corporate catering company <a href="https://www.elior.fr">Elior</a> has acquired French startup <a href="https://nestorparis.com">Nestor</a> for an undisclosed amount. Nestor originally started with a simple idea to differentiate itself from food delivery giants, such as Deliveroo, Uber Eats and others.</p>
<p>Every day, the startup offered a single menu for lunch. If you liked what was on the menu, you could order and get delivered 10 to 20 minutes later. By offering a single menu, a delivery person could deliver several clients in a single ride. Similarly, by managing its own kitchen, Nestor could improve its margins as it didn’t have to pay third-party restaurants.</p>
<p>Since I first covered Nestor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/30/nestor-focuses-on-delivering-lunch-for-office-workers-in-paris/">in 2016</a>, the company has been capital efficient and mostly focused on this unique product offering. Elior says that Nestor managed to reach 10,000 meals per week.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over the past few months, Nestor has tried to launch new offers. For instance, companies can switch to Nestor for their canteens. The startup delivers meals in fridges directly. It reminds me of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/foodles-raises-another-10-million-for-its-cloud-canteen/">Foodles</a>, another French startup focused on canteen-like services.</p>
<p>Nestor can also deliver individually packed lunches in case you are spending the day with some clients for a big meeting. <a href="https://popchef.com">Popchef</a> has also pivoted to focus more on that segment.</p>
<p>Following the acquisition, Nestor is going to focus more and more on the B2B market. While Elior is working with big companies in glass towers, it has been quite hard to convince small and medium companies to open a canteen in the office.</p>
<p>The sales pitch could be summed up in two sentences. Nestor clients don’t need to have their own kitchen as everything is prepared in advance. And employees don’t have to browse Deliveroo at lunch time to find something that isn’t a burger or a pizza.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">China&#8217;s tech giants have had a rough time in Western markets over the last few years. Huawei and DJI have been hit by trade restrictions, while TikTok and WeChat are threatened with their apps being banned in the U.S. Overall, Chinese companies with an overseas footprint are<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/chinese-hardware-global-expansion-geopolitics/"> increasingly wary of rising geopolitical tensions</a>.</p>
<p>But at an event hosted by California-based crowdfunding platform Indiegogo for Chinese consumer product makers in Shenzhen, businesses from sizes ranging from a startup making portable power stations to 53-year-old home appliances behemoth Midea, listened attentively as Indiegogo&#8217;s China managers shed light on how to court Western consumers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first stage is to let ourselves be heard by the world. We have done that,&#8221; Li Yongqin, general manager of Indiegogo China, exhorted a room of entrepreneurs. &#8220;Next, we will bravely ride the tide and accept the challenge of coming the brands loved by users around the world.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For Midea, &#8220;crowdfunding gives us a very direct way to understand consumers,&#8221; said Chen Zhenrui, who oversees the group&#8217;s overseas e-commerce initiative. Platforms like Indiegogo and Kickstarter are ways for individuals and organizations to raise capital from a large number of people to fund a project. In most cases, backers get perks or rewards from the project they fund.</p>
<p>Midea <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/midea-the-window-air-conditioner-reinvented#/">raised $1.5 million</a> last year for a new air conditioner unit launched on Indiegogo, an almost negligible amount compared to the 280 billion yuan ($42 billion) annual revenue it generated in 2019. But the support from its 3,600 backers on Indiegogo was more a proof of concept.</p>
<p>Within a few weeks, Midea learned that a compact air conditioner that saddles snugly on the window sill, blocks out noise and saves energy could entice many American consumers. Like other established Chinese home appliances makers, Midea had been exporting for several decades.</p>
<p>But &#8220;in the past, much of our overseas business was in the traditional, B2B export realm. I think we are still far from being a world-class brand,&#8221; said Chen.</p>
<p>When Midea first launched on Indiegogo, a user left comments on its campaign page calling the project a scam: How could a Fortune Global 500 company be on Indiegogo?</p>
<p>&#8220;Through rounds of communication, we got to know each other. That user gave us a big push,&#8221; Chen recalled, adding that Midea used a dozen of suggestions from Indiegogo backers to improve its product.</p>

<p>More and more traditional manufacturers from China are giving crowdfunding a shot. Padmate, based in the southern coastal city of Xiamen, built a new earbud brand called Pamu from its foundation as a white-label maker of sound systems.</p>
<p>Edison Shen, a director at Padmate, said that traditional export was getting harder as old-school distributors became squeezed by new retail channels like e-commerce. By creating their own brands and reaching consumers directly, factories could also improve profit margins. Padmate went on Indiegogo in 2018 and raised <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pamu-slide-born-for-music-never-fall-out#/">over $6.6 million</a> in one of its wireless headphone campaigns.</p>
<p>Most of the projects on Indiegogo will go beyond the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/about/our-story">9-million-backer</a> crowdfunding site onto mainstream platforms, listing on Amazon as well as advertising on Google and Facebook. Though the core services of these American Big Tech firms aren&#8217;t available in China, they have all set up some form of operational presence in China, whether it&#8217;s stationing staff in the country like Amazon or working through local ad resellers like Facebook.</p>
<p>Indiegogo itself opened its China office in Shenzhen five years ago and has since seen China-based projects raise over $300 million through its platform, according to Lu Li, general manager for Indiegogo’s global strategy. China is now the company&#8217;s fastest-growing market and accounted for over 40% of the campaigns that raised over $1 million in 2020.</p>
<p>Kickstarter, a rival to Indiegogo, also saw a surge in projects from China, which reached a <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/dLvvZ_AnMvamxS6AjjCi8A">record $60.5 million</a> in funding in 2020. The Brooklyn-based company recently began looking for a <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/kickstarter/e4027911-54dd-4549-aacb-f7404f3d1665">contractor</a> in Shenzhen or the adjacent city Hong Kong to help it research the Chinese market.</p>
<p>&#8220;In recent years, more Chinese companies are getting the hang of crowdfunding and taking their brand global, so &#8216;blockbuster&#8217; campaigns [from China] are also on the rise,&#8221; observed Li.</p>

<p>Elon Musk&#8217;s Neuralink, one of his many companies and the only one currently focused on mind control (that we&#8217;re aware of), has <a href="https://neuralink.com/blog/">released a new blog post</a> and video detailing some of its recent updates — including using its hardware to make it possible for a monkey to play pong with only its brain.</p>
<p>In the video above, Neuralink demonstrates how it used its sensor hardware and brain implant to record a baseline of activity from this macaque (named &#8216;Pager&#8217;) as it played a game on-screen where it had to move a token to different squares using a joystick with its hand. Using that baseline data, Neuralink was able to use machine learning to anticipate where Pager was going to be moving the physical controller, and was eventually able to predict it accurately before the move was actually made. Researchers then removed the paddle entirely, and eventually did the same thing with Pong, ultimately ending up at a place where Pager no longer was even moving its hand on the air on the nonexistent paddle, and was instead controlling the in-game action entirely with its mind via the Link hardware and embedded neural threads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>The last we saw of Neuralink, Musk himself was demonstrating the Link tech live in August 2020, using pigs to show how it was able to read signals from the brain depending on different stimuli. This new demo with Pager more clearly outlines the direction that the tech is headed in terms of human applications, since, as the company shared on its blog, the same technology could be used to help patients with paralysis manipulate a cursor on a computer, for instance. That could be applied to other paradigms as well, including touch controls on an iPhone, and even typing using a virtual keyboard, according to the company.</p>

<p>Musk separately tweeted that in fact, he expects the initial version of Neuralink&#8217;s product to be able to allow someone with paralysis that prevents standard modes of phone interaction to use one faster than people using their thumbs for input. He also added that future iterations of the product would be able to enable communication between Neuralinks in different parts of a patient&#8217;s body, transmitting between an in-brain node and neural pathways in legs, for instance, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1380316949087854595">making it possible for &#8220;paraplegics to walk again.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>These are obviously bold claims, but the company cites a lot of existing research that undergirds its existing demonstrations and near-term goals. Musk&#8217;s more ambitious claims, should, like all of his projections, definitely be taken with a healthy dose of skepticism. He did add that he hopes human trials will begin to get underway &#8220;hopefully later this year,&#8221; for instance – which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/16/elon-musks-neuralink-looks-to-begin-outfitting-human-brains-with-faster-input-and-output-starting-next-year/">already two years later than he was initially anticipating those might start</a>.</p>

<p>You may ask yourself, say the Talking Heads. What is this thing working from anywhere? Or as Google says, work from right here in the office. As the vaccines roll on out, some of us are just not ready for returning to normal. On this edition of the Gillmor Gang, the office is a state of mind, served up by Zoom and Clubhouse. It sounds like Clownhouse, with unlimited fungible bozos on the menu.</p>
<p>Surely we are binged out, election recalled, floating in a vat of VC alphabet soup. SPACs are everywhere and nowhere, water cooled conversations masquerading as big ticket conferences, right wing looneys seeking blanket pardons. And we&#8217;re applying for permission to stay home in our digital workshops? Yes, it will probably work for a hot second, but when will the research measure what has really changed. After a year of living a nightmare, some of us are ready for anything but the rest of our lives.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The other day on Clubhouse, they celebrated the life and times of Hal Willner, a record producer extraordinaire who died suddenly of COVID at 64. My Gang colleague Michael Markman sent me a Clubhouse notification suggesting I might want to listen in, and I did. I knew Hal a little bit, worked with him on several of his projects, and made the mistake we all make too often of assuming he or she would be around for the duration. So I clicked on the link and found myself in a room full of people who knew him a whole lot better. It was cathartic to hear them try and describe the guy, his life&#8217;s work, his day job at Saturday Night Live, and his magical series of projects pairing the strangest combinations of artists you could not even imagine. But he did.</p>
<p>So when we start to figure out this new world we&#8217;ve been propelled into, the normal we are fashioning out of the hints the virus has left us about what&#8217;s important, we all knew Willner and the mischievous glint in his eye just enough to wish for just a little more help in the now. His friends were on surer footing in this crazy clubhouse, chiming in from literally all over the world. Some saw him as a mentor, others as a collaborator, me with the twinge of regret for not being remotely brave enough to appreciate the brief window into this gentle giant for the luck of the encounter. I knew he was special, I knew it didn&#8217;t matter how or why we all got there at some time, and here was Clubhouse serving up a human experience only possible because people like Hal seized these moments of the days going by.</p>
<p>Yet it&#8217;s easy to say these new constructs are built like a house of cards, that the hype will fade, the economics atrophy, the big get bigger. It may all be true, but what part of the really big idea Clubhouse or Medium or Substack is truly vulnerable? There is where it becomes political posturing as much as anything. Just because the current or pivoted business model is suspect doesn&#8217;t mean success isn&#8217;t lurking just around the corner. If the world is suddenly toxic, does that preclude the idea that adjusting to the emergency can produce new realities that can improve on the nature of conventional reality?</p>
<p>Take Medium for a second. The writing platform announced a blogging flashback, blogrolls, as a new feature to amplify signals of affection for favorite authors. The Medium analytics are harnessed to project an organically-updating list of favorite follows informed by recent updates by the authors. For the readers, this is a convenient hybrid of social and feeds; for the writers an incentive to gain timely traction in the community of what on Twitter we call the social cloud. It is simple in execution but deep in purpose, as it encourages you to post to Medium. The platform has recently pivoted away from funding original content after pivoting away from eyeball-driven advertising, but this new feature could be a way of letting the existing architecture fund the growth of strategic analytics. The more you deliver signal to the follow notification stream, the more you prime the pump of handclaps and time to click metrics, which increases the strength of the blogroll signal and so it goes.</p>
<p>You may ask yourself, what does this have to do with working from anywhere? Well, the idea you can nurture a self-healing community of co-workers through digital technologies is right at the top of the list of things we want to do to bolster the new economy. While audio is seen as subtractive from video, it is additive in terms of broadening the user base beyond so-called creators to the so-called doers, the folks who move the products and services from place to place. It&#8217;s radio, a companion stream of news, music, soap box, ideas, alerts, reminders, and coffee breaks that fuels the day and lights the night. It&#8217;s digital mom and pop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It’s been a little over a week since union voting concluded for Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama. Things have been fairly quiet in the eye of the storm for most of it. That changed today, however, as vote counting began in earnest. Thus far, things are breaking pretty dramatically in the company’s favor, following a hard-fought <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/amazon-goes-on-the-offensive-ahead-of-next-weeks-union-vote-counting/">anti-union campaign</a>.</p>
<p>As of the end of the day, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/04/08/amazon-bessemer-mailbox-union/">no votes have more than doubled</a> the yeses, at 1,100 to 463. With counting resuming &#8212; and likely concluding &#8212; tomorrow, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which would potentially serve as the worker’s union, is decrying the company’s tactics.</p>
<p>“Our system is broken, Amazon took full advantage of that, and we will be calling on the labor board to hold Amazon accountable for its illegal and egregious behavior during the campaign,” RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. “But make no mistake about it; this still represents an important moment for working people and their voices will be heard.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The comments appear to be as much about actions the company has taken during the campaign as it is bracing for a likely challenge to the results. The numbers constitute around half of the 3,215 ballots that are being counted. They put Amazon around 500 no votes away from defeating union efforts.</p>
<p>We have reached out to the company for a response to Appelbaum’s comment, but have not heard back. In a comment offered to TechCrunch last month, the company had less than stellar words about Appelbaum, calling the union head the “Chief Disinformation Officer,” adding that “in an attempt to save his long declining union, [he] is taking alternative facts to a whole new level.”</p>
<p>Regardless of the final count, this process is likely to be drawn out. Among the complaints are reports that the company pushed the USPS to install an illegal ballot box, breaking National Labor Relations Board rulings in the process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cybercriminals have taken out a number of Facebook ads masquerading as a Clubhouse app for PC users in order to target unsuspecting victims with malware, TechCrunch has learned.</p>
<p>TechCrunch was alerted Wednesday to Facebook ads tied to several Facebook pages impersonating Clubhouse, the drop-in audio chat app only available on iPhones. Clicking on the ad would open a fake Clubhouse website, including a mocked-up screenshot of what the non-existent PC app looks like, with a download link to the malicious app.</p>
<p>When opened, the malicious app tries to communicate with a command and control server to obtain instructions on what to do next. One <a href="https://www.vmray.com/analyses/acc6e8793536/report/overview.html">sandbox analysis of the malware</a> showed the malicious app tried to infect the isolated machine with ransomware.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But overnight, the fake Clubhouse websites — which were hosted in Russia — went offline. In doing so, the malware also stopped working. Guardicore&#8217;s Amit Serper, who tested the malware in a sandbox on Thursday, said the malware received an error from the server and did nothing more.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not uncommon for cybercriminals to tailor their malware campaigns to piggyback off the successes of wildly popular apps. Clubhouse reportedly topped <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/report-social-audio-app-clubhouse-has-topped-8-million-global-downloads/">more than 8 million global downloads to date</a> despite an invite-only launch. That high demand prompted a scramble to reverse-engineer the app to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3gj5j/android-version-clubhouse">build bootleg versions</a> of it to evade Clubhouse&#8217;s gated walls, but also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/clubhouse-security/">government censors</a> where the app is blocked.</p>

<p>At least nine ads were placed this week between Tuesday and Thursday. Several of the ads said Clubhouse &#8220;is now available for PC,&#8221; while another featured a photo of co-founders Paul Davidson and Rohan Seth. Clubhouse did not return a request for comment.</p>

<p><strong>The big story: KKR invests $500M into Box</strong></p>
<p>Private equity firm KKR is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/kkr-hands-box-a-500m-lifeline/">making an investment into Box</a> that should help the cloud content management company buy back shares from activist investor Starboard Value, which might otherwise have claimed a majority of board seats and forced a sale.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>After the investment, Aaron Levie will remain with Box as its CEO, but independent board member Bethany Mayer will become the chair, while KKR&#8217;s John Park is joining the board as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;The KKR move is probably the most important strategic move Box has made since it IPO’d,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/08/industry-experts-bullish-on-500m-kkr-investment-in-box-but-stock-market-remains-skeptical/">said Alan Pelz-Sharpe of Deep Analysis</a>. &#8220;KKR doesn’t just bring a lot of money to the deal, it gives Box the ability to shake off some naysayers and invest in further acquisitions.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Are Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp down for you right now? Us too! And lots and lots of other people too, it seems.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re getting reports left and right of outages across the three Facebook properties, with no indication so far as to the cause. It&#8217;s all down so hard that Facebook&#8217;s own server status page won&#8217;t even load to explain what&#8217;s up. Some of the respective mobile apps appear to load, but are just loading cached data; refresh or try to pull in a new page, and things probably won&#8217;t load correctly.</p>
<p>When Facebook on the web <em>does</em> load, it&#8217;s largely throwing the following error message:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2136161" style="border: 1px solid grey;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Facebook.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="218" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Facebook.jpg 956w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Facebook.jpg?resize=150,48 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Facebook.jpg?resize=300,96 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Facebook.jpg?resize=768,247 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Facebook.jpg?resize=680,218 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Facebook.jpg?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>This outage comes just a few weeks after one that took out Instagram and WhatsApp in March.</p>
<p><strong>(Update, 3:19 PM: </strong>It appears things are coming back online, about an hour after the outage first began.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a big year for crypto, and <a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/">Robinhood</a> shared some stats today providing more evidence that the crypto boom is more than just hype &#8212; at least for now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a </span><a href="https://robinhood.engineering/how-crypto-fits-into-robinhoods-mission-d93c9081a598"><span style="font-weight: 400;">blog</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Christine Brown, Robinhood’s head of crypto operations, revealed that in the first quarter of 2021, 9.5 million of its customers traded crypto via the company’s platform. That’s up big time from the 1.7 million customers who traded crypto in the 2020 fourth quarter. The company first launched its Crypto unit in January of 2018 but hasn&#8217;t provided numbers in previous quarters.</span></p>
<p>In February, Robinhood <a href="https://robinhood.engineering/crypto-goes-mainstream-71c81f82de2c">revealed</a> it had seen six million new customers on Robinhood Crypto in the first two months of this year alone. That compares to  a peak of 401,000 in a single month in 2020, with a monthly average of about 200,000 customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown says the company’s intent behind launching Robinhood Crypto in the first place was to give its customers the opportunity to buy and sell cryptocurrency in addition to the range of assets offered through its brokerage, Robinhood Financial.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robinhood Crypto currently offers seven tradeable coins: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic and Litecoin. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cd3E33zd23"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/will-fading-yolo-sentiment-impact-robinhood-coinbase-and-other-trading-platforms/">Will fading YOLO sentiment impact Robinhood, Coinbase and other trading platforms?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Will fading YOLO sentiment impact Robinhood, Coinbase and other trading platforms?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/will-fading-yolo-sentiment-impact-robinhood-coinbase-and-other-trading-platforms/embed/#?secret=cd3E33zd23" data-secret="cd3E33zd23" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brown also noted that Robinhood’s crypto team has already more than tripled since the beginning of the year, although it’s not entirely clear how many staffers it currently has on that team. There are a number of crypto-related openings on its careers site, including an open “Crypto CFO” role.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is making clear that crypto is an important part of its overall business and part of its mission to democratize access to the masses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All it takes to spend, trade, and store cryptocurrency, theoretically, is an internet connection — you don’t need access to a big line of credit, or startup capital,” Brown wrote. “You don’t even have to be awake at a certain time of day to trade. The crypto market doesn’t close. Crypto was born out of a mission to take power away from institutions and return it to the people.”</span></p>
<p>Last August, Robinhood <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/17/robinhood-raises-200m-more-at-11-2b-valuation-as-its-revenue-scales/">raised $200 million more</a> at a new, higher $11.2 billion valuation in its third raise of the year before filing to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/robinhood-files-confidentially-to-go-public/">go public</a> in March. The company has had a tumultuous past year or so that was filled with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/robinhood-goes-to-congress/">time in front of Congress</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/23/amidst-robinhoods-planned-service-changes-a-tension-between-growth-and-safety/">bad PR from a user’s suicide</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/robinhood-pays-65m-to-settle-sec-charges-for-past-inferior-pricing-execution-misleading-customers/">settlements with the SEC</a>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, TechCrunch also reported earlier this week that </span>in the first<span style="font-weight: 400;"> quarter of 2021, American consumer cryptocurrency trading giant </span><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coinbase</span></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/coinbases-monster-q1-in-context/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">grew sharply</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, generating strong profits at the same time. Specifically, the company notched revenue of $1.8 billion in Q1 2021, up from $585.1 million in Q4 2020. Net income totaled “approximately $730 million to $800 million,” up from $178.8 million in Q4 2020.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In a <a href="https://sec.gov.ng/proliferation-of-unregistered-online-investment-and-trading-platforms-facilitating-access-to-trading-in-securities-listed-in-foreign-markets/">circular released</a> by Nigeria&#8217;s capital market regulator SEC today, investment platforms providing access to foreign securities might be treading on dangerous grounds.</p>
<p>According to the SEC regulations that have just been brought to light, these platforms are trading foreign securities not registered in the country and have been warned to stop doing so. Capital market operators in partnership with them have also been warned to renege on providing brokerage services for foreign securities.</p>
<p>Over the past three years, Robinhood-esque platforms like Bamboo, Trove, Chaka and Rise have sprung forth in the Nigerian fintech space. They offer Nigerians access to stocks, bonds and other securities in both local and international markets. These platforms have grown in popularity among the middle class and provide a haven to protect earnings from naira devaluations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That said, there&#8217;s a vast difference in how they operate when compared to Robinhood. In addition to being a trading app, Robinhood offers online brokerages (introducing and clearing) and also zero commission trading. Nigerian investment platforms do not, and while any trading platform can get a brokerage license in the U.S., it can be a Herculean task to obtain one in Nigeria. This is where capital market operators (local and foreign brokerage firms in this case) come into play, forming strategic partnerships with these companies so Nigerians can access both local and foreign fractional securities.</p>
<p>After a series of regulatory onslaught from different government bodies on tech startups last year, the SEC followed suit in December. It <a href="https://techcabal.com/2021/01/06/sec-vs-chaka-regulation-may-be-coming-to-investment-tech-platforms/">singled out Chaka</a>, one of the platforms and accused it of selling and advertising stocks. The regulator&#8217;s definition of the alleged offence was that Chaka &#8220;engaged in investment activities, including providing a platform for purchasing shares in foreign companies such as Google, Amazon, and Alibaba, outside the Commission’s regulatory purview and without requisite registration.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s CEO, Tosin Osibodu, denied any wrongdoing, and since the turn of the year, not much has been heard from the SEC regarding this matter until the release of today&#8217;s circular. Unsurprisingly, the regulator continued from where it left off, only this time, all <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2021/01/12/sec-regulate-chaka-bamboo/">investment platforms</a> including brokerage firms &#8212; not just Chaka &#8212; are involved. SEC&#8217;s subtle directive is to stop selling, issuing or offering for sale any foreign securities not listed on any exchange registered in Nigeria.</p>
<p>What this inherently means from now on is that investment platforms will have their work cut out and might only offer individuals access to only local stocks and securities. This affects the business models of these startups. And the core value they provide, which is to help Nigerians store monetary value and hedge against naira devaluation is at the threat of being wiped out.</p>
<p>However, following its scuffle with the SEC, Chaka announced last month that it has liaised with the regulator to <a href="https://medium.com/chaka-ng/our-commitment-to-regulatory-compliance-cc75ed9c900d">obtain a newly created license</a> to offer these services which may exempt the company from this new regulatory threat. It&#8217;s a path other investment platforms might need to take as well to bring their activities under the SEC&#8217;s purview.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the information released by the regulator as seen on its <a href="https://sec.gov.ng/proliferation-of-unregistered-online-investment-and-trading-platforms-facilitating-access-to-trading-in-securities-listed-in-foreign-markets/">website:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) has been drawn to the existence of several providers of online investment and trading platforms which purportedly facilitate direct access of the investing public in the Federal Republic of Nigeria to securities of foreign companies listed on Securities Exchanges registered in other jurisdictions. These platforms also claim to be operating in partnership with Capital Market operators (CMOs) registered with the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission categorically states that by the provisions of Sections 67-70 of the Investments and Securities Act (ISA), 2007 and Rules 414 &amp; 415 of the SEC Rules and Regulations, only foreign securities listed on any Exchange registered in Nigeria may be issued, sold or offered for sale or subscription to the Nigerian public. Accordingly, CMOs who work in concert with the referenced online platforms are hereby notified of the Commission’s position and advised to desist henceforth.</p>
<p>The Commission enjoins the investing public to seek clarification as may be required via its established channels of communication on investment products advertised through conventional or online mediums.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The Epic v. Apple lawsuit alleging monopolistic practices by the latter will begin next month, and today the main arguments of each company were published, having been trimmed down somewhat at the court&#8217;s discretion. With the basic facts agreed upon, the two companies will go to battle over what they mean, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/20/tim-cook-and-tim-sweeney-among-potential-witnesses-for-apple-epic-trial/">their CEOs</a> will likely take the (virtual) stand to do so.</p>
<p>As we&#8217;ve covered in previous months, the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/25/epics-latest-argument-in-its-fight-against-apple-keeps-antitrust-issues-front-and-center/"> thrust of Epic&#8217;s argument</a> is that Apple&#8217;s hold over the app market and 30% standard fee amount to anti-competitive behavior that must be regulated by antitrust law. It rebelled against what it describes as an unlawful practice by slipping its own in-game currency store into the popular game Fortnite, circumventing Apple payment methods. (CEO Tim Sweeney would later, and unadvisedly, compare this to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/epic-games-founder-tim-sweeney-likens-fight-against-apple-to-fight-for-civil-rights/">resisting unjust laws in the civil rights movement</a>.)</p>
<p>Apple denies the charge of monopoly, pointing out it faces enormous competition all over the market, just not within its own App Store. And as for the size of the fees — well, perhaps it&#8217;s a matter that could stand some adjustment (the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">dropped its take to 15%</a> for any developer&#8217;s first million following criticism throughout 2020), but it hardly amounts to unlawfulness.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="IXoN1hj6ja"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/judge-rules-that-apple-can-ban-fortnite-but-cant-terminate-epics-unreal-developer-accounts/">Judge denies Epic&#8217;s request to force Apple to bring Fortnite back to App Store</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Judge denies Epic&#8217;s request to force Apple to bring Fortnite back to App Store&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/judge-rules-that-apple-can-ban-fortnite-but-cant-terminate-epics-unreal-developer-accounts/embed/#?secret=IXoN1hj6ja" data-secret="IXoN1hj6ja" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>For its part, Apple contends that the whole antitrust allegation and associated dust-kicking is little more than a PR stunt, and it has something in the way of receipts.</p>
<p>Epic did, after all, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/13/epic-games-launches-a-campaign-and-lawsuit-against-apples-app-store/">have a whole PR strategy ready to go</a> when it filed the lawsuit, and the filings describe &#8220;Project Liberty,&#8221; a long-term program within the company to, in Apple&#8217;s opinion, shore up sagging revenues from Fortnite. Epic does seem to have paid a PR firm some $300,000 to advise on the &#8220;two-phase communications plan,&#8221; involving a multi-company complaint campaign against Apple and Google via the &#8220;Coalition for App Fairness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Project Liberty makes up a whole section in Apple&#8217;s filing, detailing how the company and Sweeney planned to &#8220;draw Google into a legal battle over anti-trust,&#8221; (and presumably Apple) according to internal emails, by getting banned by the companies&#8217; app stores for circumventing their payment systems. Epic only mentions Project Liberty in one paragraph, explaining that it kept the program secret because &#8220;Epic could not have disclosed it without causing Apple to reject Version 13.40 of <em>Fortnite</em>,&#8221; viz. the one with the offending payment system built in. It&#8217;s not much of a defense.</p>
<p>Whether Apple&#8217;s fees are too high, and whether Epic is doing this to extend Fortnite&#8217;s profitable days, the case itself will be determined on the basis of antitrust law and doctrine, and on this front things do not look particularly dire for Apple.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Four perspectives: Will Apple trim App Store fees?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/four-perspectives-will-apple-trim-app-store-fees/embed/#?secret=TLow3V0nqm" data-secret="TLow3V0nqm" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Although the legal arguments and summaries of fact run to hundreds of pages from both sides, the whole thing is summed up pretty well in the very first sentence of Epic&#8217;s filing: &#8220;This case is about Apple’s conduct to monopolize two markets within its iOS ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be specific, it is about whether Apple can be said to be a monopolist over an ecosystem it created and administrated from the very beginning, and one that is provably assailed on all sides by competitors in the digital distribution and gaming space. This is a novel application of antitrust law and one that would carry a heavy burden of proof for Epic — and that an (admittedly amateur) review of the arguments doesn&#8217;t suggest there&#8217;s much chance of success.</p>
<p>But the opinion of a random reporter is not much in the accounting of things; there will have to be a trial, and one is scheduled to occur next month. There&#8217;s a lot of ground to cover, as Epic&#8217;s presentation of its arguments will need to be as meticulous as Apple&#8217;s dismantling of them. To that end we can expect live testimony from Apple CEO Tim Cook, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, Apple&#8217;s former head of marketing and familiar face Phil Schiller, among others.</p>
<p>The timing and nature of that testimony or questioning will not be known until later, but it&#8217;s likely there will be some interesting interactions worth hearing about. The trial is scheduled to begin May 3 and last for about three weeks.</p>
<p>Notably there are a handful of other lawsuits hovering about relating to this,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/08/willful-brazen-and-unlawful-apple-files-breach-of-contract-countersuit-against-epic/"> such as Apple&#8217;s countersuit against Epic</a> alleging breach of contract. Many of these will depend entirely on the outcome of the main case — e.g. if Apple&#8217;s terms were found to be unlawful, there was no contract to break, or if not, Epic pretty much admitted to breaking the rules so the case is practically over already.</p>
<p>You can read the full &#8220;proposed findings of fact&#8221; documents from each party <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/17442392/epic-games-inc-v-apple-inc/">on the invaluable RECAP</a>; the case number is 4:20-cv-05640.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Calendly CEO Tope Awotona and Blake Bartlett, partner at OpenView, talk about expanding internationally, when to bootstrap and when to fundraise, and how VCs approach a profitable company.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Product-led growth is all the rage in the Valley these days, and we had two leading thinkers discuss how to incorporate it into a startup at TechCrunch Early Stage 2021. Tope Awotona is the CEO and founder of Calendly, which bootstrapped for much of its existence <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/how-atlantas-calendly-turned-a-scheduling-nightmare-into-a-3b-startup/">before raising $350 million at a $3 billion valuation from OpenView and Iconiq</a>. And on the other side of that table and this interview sat Blake Bartlett, a partner at OpenView who has been leading enterprise deals based around the principles of efficient growth.</p>
<p>In this interview, the two talk about bootstrapping and product-led growth, expanding internationally, when to bootstrap and when to fundraise, and how VCs approach a profitable company (carefully, and with a big stick). Oh, and how to spend $350 million.</p>
<p><i>Quotes have been edited and condensed for quality.</i></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="Bootstrapping is directly tied to product-led growth">Bootstrapping is directly tied to product-led growth</h2>
<p>Product-led growth is all about efficiency — spending all of a startup’s capital and time on perfecting its product to capture new users and help the most fervent customers advocate for the product with others or perhaps the managers approving their expenses. That’s directly related to bootstrapping, since by evading VC investment, a startup has to be much more tied to customers in the first place.</p>
<p><b>Tope Awotona:</b></p>
<blockquote><p>With no marketing at all, Calendly began to take off. So the initial users were in higher education, and very quickly we moved to the commercial sector. And all of that was because of the virality of the product. Seeing that, we just began to invest more into virality. So the combination of self-serve, which is incredibly capital efficient, because you don&#8217;t need all of these sales people, and also the virality, instead of spending a bunch of dollars on advertising, you can really rely on the virality of the product and rely on the network of the users to really propagate and to enable distribution, just those are the two things that really allowed us to be successful. <b>(Timestamp: 7:49)</b></p></blockquote>
<p>We later discussed how the extreme focus on users can drive efficiency through product-led growth.</p>
<p><b>Blake Bartlett:</b></p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s the product and the distribution model, and they need to be tightly aligned. Tope spoke to some of this, but I think first and foremost, even outside of metrics, it&#8217;s just how is the business built? And on the product front, the product is built, the jobs to be done, so to speak, are oriented towards the actual user of the product, not their boss. SaaS historically was built for the boss because the boss owns the the budget for that department. So if you&#8217;re building a sales tool, build for the VP of Sales, and then hopefully the AEs will, you know, go along with it. But now with product-led growth, you&#8217;re actually building for that user. … Eventually, you can build the things on top that the boss cares about like the admin panel, and the KPIs and all that kind of stuff. <b>(Timestamp: 29:35)</b></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The coronavirus pandemic has increased our collective screen time, and that&#8217;s particularly true on mobile devices. According to a new <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/insights/market-data/q1-2021-market-index">report</a> from mobile data and analytics firm App Annie, global consumers are now spending an average of 4.2 hours per day using apps on their smartphones, an increase of 30% from just two years prior. In some markets, the average is even higher &#8212; more than five hours.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 2021, the daily time spent in apps surpassed four hours in the U.S., Turkey, Mexico and India for the first time, the report notes. Of those, India saw the biggest jump as consumers there spent 80% more time in smartphone apps in the Q1 2021 versus the first quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>To put this in perspective in the American market, Nielsen had last year reported <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/report/2020/the-nielsen-total-audience-report-august-2020/">consumers were spending</a> around 4.5 hours watching live or time-shifted TV, but only 3 hours, 46 minutes using smartphone apps.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>However, we should point out that Nielsen and App Annie&#8217;s analysis can&#8217;t necessarily be compared directly, because App Annie only measured time spent on Android devices &#8212; and many Americans use iPhones. Nielsen, meanwhile, relies on panels to achieve a representative sampling. Nevertheless, the broad strokes here are that mobile apps seem to be a more popular means of entertainment than the good ol&#8217; American pastime of watching TV.</p>
<p>The new report also notes that three markets &#8212; Brazil, South Korea and Indonesia &#8212; saw the average daily time spent in apps jump to over five hours this past quarter.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to determine which apps are driving these changes as the most downloaded apps tend to remain the same quarter after quarter. The top charts are dominated by the usual names like TikTok, YouTube and Facebook, for example. That&#8217;s why App Annie now tracks what it calls &#8220;breakout apps,&#8221; which are those that saw spikes in quarter-over-quarter downloads across both iOS and Android.</p>

<p>In Q1 2021, Western markets saw <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/following-riots-alternative-social-apps-and-private-messengers-top-the-app-stores/">a sharp rise in secure messaging apps</a>, Signal and Telegram. Signal, for instance, placed first in the U.K., Germany and France, and fourth in the U.S. as a &#8220;breakout app&#8221; for the quarter. Telegram was No. 9 in the U.K., No. 5 in France and No. 7 in the U.S.</p>
<p>Investment and trading apps were also popular in the quarter, with Coinbase&#8217;s crypto app at No. 6 in the U.S. and U.K. on this list, while Binance was No. 7 in France. Crypto trading app Upbit, meanwhile, was No. 1 in South Korea. The payment app, PayPay was the No. 1 breakout app in Japan. And Robinhood was No. 2 in the U.S.</p>
<p>Clubhouse also made a showing on the &#8220;breakout&#8221; charts, as it gained ground in non-U.S. markets like Germany and Japan, where it ranked No. 4 and No. 3, respectively.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s breakout chart was different, with a focus on video apps like TikTok, Kwai, CapCut and iQIYI.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2136079" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2136079" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2136079" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image003.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="393" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image003.png 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image003.png?resize=150,87 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image003.png?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image003.png?resize=768,444 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image003.png?resize=680,393 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image003.png?resize=1536,888 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image003.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2136079" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> App Annie</p></div></p>
<p>TikTok&#8217;s influence on games was also apparent in the quarter. The game High Heels from Istanbul-based Rollic (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/02/zynga-completes-rollic-acquistion/">now owned by Zynga</a>), was heavily advertised on TikTok, sending the title to No. 1 in the U.S. and U.K.&#8217;s &#8220;breakout&#8221; games charts, as well as No. 3 in China, No. 7 in Germany and No. 6 in Russia.</p>
<p>Other hyper-casual games did well, too, including Project Makeover, DOP 2: Delete One Part and Phone Case DIY.</p>
<p>Crash Bandicoot: On the Run also broke out in the quarter. Despite launching on March 25, the game saw 21 million downloads in four days, becoming the top breakout app in Germany, No. 2 in the U.S., No. 3 in the U.K. and No. 9 in France.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/spinning-out-from-the-cryptocurrency-hardware-developer-bitfury-liquidstack-pitches-a-data-center-cooling-tech/">LiquidStack does it</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/submer-is-dunking-servers-in-goo-to-save-the-planet/">So does Submer</a>. They&#8217;re both dropping servers carrying sensitive data into goop in an effort to save the planet. Now they&#8217;re joined by one of the biggest tech companies in the world in their efforts to improve the energy efficiency of data centers, because Microsoft is getting into the liquid-immersion cooling market.</p>
<p>Microsoft is using a liquid it developed in-house that&#8217;s engineered to boil at 122 degrees Fahrenheit (lower than the boiling point of water) to act as a heat sink, reducing the temperature inside the servers so they can operate at full power without any risks from overheating.</p>
<p>The vapor from the boiling fluid is converted back into a liquid through contact with a cooled condenser in the lid of the tank that stores the servers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are the first cloud provider that is running two-phase immersion cooling in a production environment,” said Husam Alissa, a principal hardware engineer on Microsoft’s team for datacenter advanced development in Redmond, Washington, in a statement on the company&#8217;s internal blog. </span></p>
<p>While that claim may be true, liquid cooling is a well-known approach to dealing with moving heat around to keep systems working. Cars use liquid cooling to keep their motors humming as they head out on the highway.</p>
<p>As technology companies confront the physical limits of Moore&#8217;s Law, the demand for faster, higher performance processors mean designing new architectures that can handle more power, the company wrote in a blog post. Power flowing through central processing units has increased from 150 watts to more than 300 watts per chip and the GPUs responsible for much of Bitcoin mining, artificial intelligence applications and high end graphics each consume more than 700 watts per chip.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Microsoft isn&#8217;t the first tech company to apply liquid cooling to data centers and the distinction that the company uses of being the first &#8220;cloud provider&#8221; is doing a lot of work. That&#8217;s because bitcoin mining operations have been using the tech for years. Indeed, LiquidStack was spun out from a bitcoin miner to commercialize its liquid immersion cooling tech and bring it to the masses.</p>

<p><strong>&#8220;Air cooling is not enough&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>More power flowing through the processors means hotter chips, which means the need for better cooling or the chips will malfunction.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Air cooling is not enough,” said Christian Belady, vice president of Microsoft’s datacenter advanced development group in Redmond, in an interview for the company&#8217;s internal blog. “That’s what’s driving us to immersion cooling, where we can directly boil off the surfaces of the chip.”</span></p>
<p>For Belady, the use of liquid cooling technology brings the density and compression of Moore&#8217;s Law up to the datacenter level</p>
<p>The results, from an energy consumption perspective, are impressive. The company found that using two-phase immersion cooling reduced power consumption for a server by anywhere from 5 percent to 15 percent (every little bit helps).</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft investigated liquid immersion as a cooling solution for high performance computing applications such as AI. Among other things, the investigation revealed that two-phase immersion cooling reduced power consumption for any given server by 5% to 15%. </span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, companies like Submer claim they reduce energy consumption by 50%, water use by 99%, and take up 85% less space.</p>

<p>For cloud computing companies, the ability to keep these servers up and running even during spikes in demand, when they&#8217;d consume even more power, adds flexibility and ensures uptime even when servers are overtaxed, according to Microsoft.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“[We] know that with Teams when you get to 1 o’clock or 2 o’clock, there is a huge spike because people are joining meetings at the same time,” Marcus Fontoura, a vice president on Microsoft&#8217;s Azure team, said on the company&#8217;s internal blog. “Immersion cooling gives us more flexibility to deal with these burst-y workloads.”</span></p>
<p>At this point, data centers are a critical component of the internet infrastructure that much of the world relies on for&#8230; well&#8230; pretty much every tech-enabled service. That reliance however has come at a significant environmental cost.</p>
<p>“Data centers power human advancement. Their role as a core infrastructure has become more apparent than ever and emerging technologies such as AI and IoT will continue to drive computing needs. However, the environmental footprint of the industry is growing at an alarming rate,” Alexander Danielsson, an investment manager at Norrsken VC noted last year when discussing that firm&#8217;s investment in Submer.</p>
<h2><strong>Solutions under the sea</strong></h2>
<p>If submerging servers in experimental liquids offers one potential solution to the problem &#8212; then sinking them in the ocean is another way that companies are trying to cool data centers without expending too much power.</p>
<p>Microsoft has already been operating an undersea data center for the past two years. The company actually trotted out the tech as part of a push from the tech company to aid in the search for a COVID-19 vaccine last year.</p>

<p>These pre-packed, shipping container-sized data centers can be spun up on demand and run deep under the ocean’s surface for sustainable, high-efficiency and powerful compute operations, the company said.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The liquid cooling project shares most similarity with </span><a href="https://news.microsoft.com/innovation-stories/project-natick-underwater-datacenter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft’s Project Natick</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which is exploring the potential of underwater datacenters that are quick to deploy and can operate for years on the seabed sealed inside submarine-like tubes without any onsite maintenance by people. </span></p>
<p>In those data centers nitrogen air replaces an engineered fluid and the servers are cooled with fans and a heat exchanger that pumps seawater through a sealed tube.</p>
<p>Startups are also staking claims to cool data centers out on the ocean (the seaweed is always greener in somebody else&#8217;s lake).</p>
<p>Nautilus Data Technologies, for instance, has raised over $100 million (<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nautilus-data-technologies">according to Crunchbase</a>) to develop data centers dotting the surface of Davey Jones&#8217; Locker. The company <a href="https://www.nautilusdt.com/copy-of-pr-october-10th-2017-1">is currently developing a data center project</a> co-located with a sustainable energy project in a tributary near Stockton, Calif.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">With the double-immersion cooling tech Microsoft is hoping to bring the benefits of ocean-cooling tech onto the shore. “We brought the sea to the servers rather than put the datacenter under the sea,” Microsoft&#8217;s Alissa said in a company statement.</span></p>
