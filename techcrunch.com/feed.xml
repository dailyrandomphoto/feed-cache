</div><p id="speakable-summary">The increasing regulation of ESG (environmental, social, governance) disclosure reporting may have started in the public markets, but will almost certainly have downstream effects for private market actors — for founders, companies and investors.</p>
<p>Since his confirmation as the chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in April, Gary Gensler has made reforming ESG disclosures concerning climate change risk and human capital a top priority. The SEC’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-99">regulatory agenda</a> confirms as much. And Gensler is not alone in his focus on ESG at the federal level.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/20/executive-order-on-climate-related-financial-risk/">issued an executive order</a> encouraging regulators to assess climate-related financial risk. At the end of March, <a href="https://twitter.com/secyellen/status/1395520116339662848">Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wrote on Twitter</a> that “our future livelihoods … depend on the financial sector to build a more sustainable and resilient economy.” Congress is considering measures that would require increased ESG disclosures, including the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1277?s=1&amp;r=2">Improving Corporate Governance Through Diversity Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2123">Diversity and Inclusion Data Accountability and Transparency Act</a> and the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/2570">Climate Risk Disclosure Act</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This renewed federal focus on ESG issues will bolster the SEC’s effort to create disclosure practices for public companies and mutual funds. Regardless of whether these federal policies around ESG come to pass, they reflect a momentum that will almost certainly impact private markets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firms that want to go public — whether via SPAC, direct listing or traditional IPO — may have to seriously consider board diversity or environmental reporting in conjunction with — or well in advance of — their debuts.</li>
<li>Private companies seeking to align with public companies as vendors or partners may be expected to meet specific ESG requirements before the engagement.</li>
<li>Startup founders and venture funds raising capital may work to maintain the largest target market by proactively scoping ESG engagements to ensure they meet criteria for investors who may have their own ESG-focused investment requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>In his confirmation hearing before the Senate in early March, Gensler said, “Markets — and technology — are always changing. Our rules have to change along with them.”</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			The federal government is moving to increase regulation around ESG disclosure requirements with the goals of establishing greater transparency and metrics for public companies.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The federal government is moving to increase regulation around ESG disclosure requirements with the goals of establishing greater transparency and metrics for public companies. These requirements are a response to the changing markets — demands from consumers, scrutiny from investors and a general insistence for higher corporate standards from society at large.</p>
<p>Private markets aren’t immune to these forces. Already, three-quarters of investors in a <a href="https://files.pitchbook.com/website/files/pdf/PitchBook_2020_Sustainable_Investment_Survey.pdf">2020 survey</a> said it was very important to measure the success of sustainability initiatives, but they also said there’s been a lack of clarity on how to define and measure outcomes.</p>
<p>To be sure, private markets are not headed toward full-scale adoption of ESG regulations. They will not be subject to the same reporting or disclosures framework as their public counterparts. Not today, and possibly not for some time.</p>
<p>But we may begin to see private investors, funds and companies adapting to get ahead of ESG regulation and position themselves to effectively operate in a new — albeit adjacent — regulatory environment. In their case, the rules may not change — but the game could.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">South Korea’s LG Chem has earmarked ₩6 trillion ($5.2 billion) over the next four years to build out its battery materials business. The investment comes as automakers and state regulators set targets to transition away from internal combustion engine vehicles, in a shift that will likely be the most transformative to the mobility industry since the invention of the car.</p>
<p>The investments will focus on boosting the production of anode materials, separation membranes, cathode binders, and other essential battery components. This includes plans to build a massive cathode plant in the South Korean city of Gumi, that will increase the industrial giant’s anode production capacity by seven-fold, from 40,000 tons to around 260,000 tons by 2026. LG Chem had already agreed to invest ₩500 billion ($424 million) in the plant, which was announced in July 2019.</p>
<p>LG is also planning to expand its production capacity of carbon nanotubes (CNT), an advanced material used to enhance the performance of lithium-ion batteries, from 1,700 tons this year to triple or more by 2025. To get there, it’s planning on scaling output at its CNT Plant 2 and commencing construction on a third CNT plant this year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the supply chain front, LG said its preparing a joint venture with a mining company for the supply of metals and other raw materials for battery components. The company will “actively pursue cooperation in various ways with companies possessing mining, smelting and refining technologies to strengthen its metal sourcing competitiveness,” it said in a statement.</p>
<p>LG Chem is already one of the largest manufacturers of batteries and battery materials, with customers including Volkswagen, General Motors, and Tesla. And the company only sees the global battery materials market expanding – from ₩39 trillion ($34 billion) in 2021 to ₩100 trillion ($87 billion) by 2026.</p>
<p>Along with the battery investment, LG said it will pour an additional ₩3 trillion ($2.6 billion) into sustainable petrochemicals, like biodegradable polymers and plant-based bio-materials, and ₩1 trillion ($872 million) into its drug development business line.</p>
<p>CEO Hak Cheol Shin said the company is examining even more opportunities to shift toward an sustainable business portfolio. “This will be the most revolutionary change since the establishment of the company that will upgrade the value and sustainability of LG Chem, and tangible achievements will become available from the second half of this year,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When it comes to tough environments to build new technology, firefighting has to be among the most difficult. Smoke and heat can quickly damage hardware, and interference from fires will disrupt most forms of wireless communications, rendering software all but useless. From a technology perspective, not all that much has really changed today when it comes to how people respond to blazes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.qwake.tech">Qwake Technologies</a>, a startup based in San Francisco, is looking to upgrade the firefighting game with a hardware augmented reality headset named C-THRU. Worn by responders, the device scans surrounding and uploads key environmental data to the cloud, allowing all responders and incident commanders to have one common operating picture of their situation. The goal is to improve situational awareness and increase the effectiveness of firefighters, all while minimizing potential injuries and casualties.</p>
<p>The company, which was founded in 2015, just <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001871374/000187137421000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">raised about $5.5 million in financing this week</a>. The company’s CEO, Sam Cossman, declined to name the lead investor, citing a confidentiality clause in the term sheet. He characterized the strategic investor as a publicly-traded company, and Qwake is the first startup investment this company has made.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>(Normally, I’d <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/your-funding-round-isnt-special-but-you-might-be/">ignore fundings without these sorts of details</a>, but given that I am <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/01/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world/">obsessed with DisasterTech</a> these days, why the hell not).</p>

<p>Qwake has had success in recent months with netting large government contracts as it approaches a wider release of its product in late-2021. It <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/charliefink/2020/12/02/qwake-technologies-funded-to-fight-fires-with-ar-tech/">secured a $1.4 million contract from the Department of Homeland Security</a> last year, and also <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/qwake-technologies-awarded-air-force-contract-to-adapt-ar-solution-for-smokejumpers-and-special-operations-301260333.html">secured a partnership with the U.S. Air Force along with RSA in April</a>. In addition, it raised a bit of angel funding and participated in Verizon’s 5G First Responder Lab as <a href="https://www.5gfirstresponderlab.com/cohort1/">part of its inaugural cohort</a> (reminder that TechCrunch is <i>still</i> owned by Verizon).</p>
<p>Cossman, who founded Qwake along with John Long, Mike Ralston, and Omer Haciomeroglu, has long been interested in fires, and specifically, volcanos. For years, he has been an expeditionary videographer and innovator who climbed calderas and attempted to bridge the gap between audiences, humanitarian response, and science.</p>
<p>“A lot of the work that I have done up until this point was focused on earth science and volcanoes,” he said. “A lot of projects were focused on predicting volcanic eruptions and looking at using sensor networks and different things of that nature to make people who live in those regions that are exposed to volcanic threats safer.”</p>
<p>During one project in Nicaragua, his team suddenly found itself lost amidst the smoke of an active volcano. There were “thick, dense superheated volcanic gases that prevented us from navigating correctly,” Cossman said. He wanted to find technology that might help them navigate in those conditions in the future, so he explored the products available to firefighters. “We figured, ‘Surely these men and women have figured out how do you see in austere environments, how do you make quick decisions, etc.’”</p>
<p>He was left disappointed, but also with a new vision: to build such technology himself. And thus, Qwake was born. “I was pissed off that the men and women who arguably need this stuff more than anybody — certainly more than a consumer — didn&#8217;t have anywhere to get it, and yet it was entirely possible,” he said. “But it was only being talked about in science fiction, so I&#8217;ve dedicated the last six years or so to make this thing real.”</p>
<p>Building such a product required a diverse set of talent, including hardware engineering, neuroscience, firefighting, product design and more. “We started tinkering and building this prototype. And it very interestingly got the attention of the firefighting community,” Cossman said.</p>

<p>Qwake at the time didn’t know any firefighters, and as the founders did customer calls, they learned that sensors and cameras weren’t really what responders needed. Instead, they wanted more operational clarity: not just more data inputs, but systems that can take all that noise, synthesize it, and relay critical information to them about exactly what’s going on in an environment and what the next steps should be.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Qwake built a full solution, including both an IoT device that attaches to a firefighter’s helmet and also a tablet-based application that processes the sensor data coming in and attempts to synchronize information from all teams simultaneously. The cloud ties it all together.</p>
<p>So far, the company has design customers with the fire departments of Menlo Park, California and Boston. With the new funding, the team is looking to advance the state of its prototype and get it ready for wider distribution by readying it for scalable manufacturing as it approaches a more public launch later this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Superhuman co-founder and CEO Rahul Vohra joined us last week at TechCrunch Early Stage to provide an in-depth look at how he and his company worked to optimize and refine their product early to create a version of &#8220;growth hacking&#8221; that would not only help Superhuman attract users, but serve them best and retain them, too. Vohra articulated a system that other entrepreneurs should be able to apply to their own businesses, regardless of area or focus.</p>
<h2>The only good hack isn&#8217;t a hack at all</h2>
<p>Vohra started off by explaining that he&#8217;s happy to discuss anything relating to the early stages of startup growth (and welcomed <a href="https://twitter.com/rahulvohra?lang=en">DMs to his Twitter</a> if you have any specific questions). He identified a number of key areas of concern early on in company-building, including growth, pricing and even traditional growth hacking, but he noted that one area of focus is more important than any other:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">The</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">most</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">important</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">of</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">these</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">is</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">product-</span><span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">market</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">fit.</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">And</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">this</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">is</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">sort</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">of</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">the</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">standard</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">disclaimer</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">that</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">anyone</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">who</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">you</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">would</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">ever</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">talk</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">to</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">about</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">growth</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">would</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">ever</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">give</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">you,</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">which</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">is</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">you</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">shouldn&#8217;t</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">try</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">and</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">grow</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">a</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">thing</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">that</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">isn&#8217;t</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">yet</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">ready</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">to </span><span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word">grow.</span><span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word"><strong>(Timestamp: 01:11)</strong></span></p>

<p>Strong stuff, but Vohra backs up this assertion with endorsements from startup industry heavyweights like Paul Graham, Sam Altman and Marc Andreessen underlying the key importance of product-market fit &#8212; and prioritizing it early in a startup&#8217;s existence. Also, he points out that it can be easy to mistake the &#8220;feeling&#8221; of having good product-market fit as a leading indicator, when in fact it&#8217;s usually a lagging one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After operating in beta for a year, <a href="https://www.nooks.in/">Nooks,</a> a virtual workspace space targeting distributed teams, has attracted thousands of users and millions of dollars in venture capital. The Stanford student-led upstart has raised a $5 million seed round led by Tola Capital, with participation from Floodgate and investors such as Julia and Kevin Hartz (CEO and chairman of Eventbrite, respectively) and Julia Lipton, the founder of Awesome People Ventures.</p>
<p>The financing signals yet another cadre of investors betting on a company within the world of virtual HQs, a cohort that includes dozens of startups that believe distributed employees are ready to graduate from Zoom and into &#8220;metaverses&#8221; built with productivity and gamification in mind. This is Kevin Hartz&#8217;s second investment in a virtual HQ, with his first in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/sequoia-capital-puts-millions-of-dollars-into-gather-a-virtual-hq-platform/">Gather.</a> As of today, Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Menlo, Battery Ventures, Index Ventures, Y Combinator, Homebrew and Floodgate all have stakes in different virtual HQ startups.</p>
<p>In other words: Even with investors pouring money in, Nooks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/virtual-hqs-race-to-win-over-a-remote-work-fatigued-market/">has its work cut out for it</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Nooks was launched in May 2020 by Stanford students Daniel Lee, Rohan Suri, Nikhil Cheerla, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute’s Andrew Qu. Like nearly every other person unexpectedly flung into the world of remote work, the trio experienced Zoom fatigue through school and classes. They soon saw a necessity to build a space for higher-performing teams and like-minded communities to enjoy working together.</p>

<p>The co-founders first piloted Nooks within Stanford, giving it to teaching assistants to use as an engaging layer to summer virtual classes. The initial use case for Nooks looked like office hours, and homework parties, says Lee. Since initially piloting in schools, Nooks has grown to focus more on helping distributed teams work, but the ethos has stayed consistent.</p>
<p>“There should be this persistent space where, instead of just being in an ephemeral space like a meeting, you can go somewhere to create more spontaneous connections,&#8221; Lee said.</p>
<h2><b>Nooks&#8217; hooks</b></h2>
<p>When a user enters Nooks, they are greeted by a Slack-like interface. Instead of a panel of channels on the left, though, employees are invited to enter “spaces.” Each space can vary in purpose, from a front-desk mock-up to a beach hangout or a design huddle. Nooks has a space dedicated to bashing bugs that show up in code. Upon first entry into the platform, the Nooks UX stood out as different from some of its competitors. While companies like Branch and Gather look like video games with a productivity element, Nooks skips the avatar feel altogether, looking closer to<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/teamflow-lands-3-9-million-for-a-productive-virtual-hq-platform/"> Teamflow</a> or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/tandem/">Tandem.</a> The company uses a video API to let each person take up little orbs of space, and adds integrations of platforms like Google Docs, YouTube, Asana or GitHub.</p>

<p>Co-founder Suri said that the company decided to go for a simpler aesthetic to promote conversation, not more clicking.</p>
<p>“We don’t actually believe that in order to talk to someone you need to be a video gamer, have your avatar around and go walk up to them,” he said. “It should be as simple as seeing them in a room, and entering that room.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2177432" style="width: 773px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2177432" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2177432" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beach_Hangout.png" alt="nooks-social-space" width="763" height="477" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beach_Hangout.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beach_Hangout.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beach_Hangout.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beach_Hangout.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beach_Hangout.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beach_Hangout.png?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beach_Hangout.png?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Beach_Hangout.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 763px) 100vw, 763px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2177432" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Nooks</p></div></p>
<p>Of course, the company is working to balance that simplicity with an engaging environment, and includes customization of spaces and background music. There’s a “whisper feature” that allows peers to talk to each other during a presentation, virtual sales floors where Nooks creates leaderboards of top sellers and co-working spaces to promote cross-pollination of ideas.</p>
<p>Simplicity can come at the cost of spontaneity. While other virtual HQ platforms use spatial audio to create the feeling of a “bump in” &#8212; voices get louder when you are near other co-workers and quieter when you toggle away &#8212; Lee said that Nooks promotes impromptu collaboration and casual conversations by always making it so that there’s only “one click to talk to anyone.”</p>
<p>While frictionless communication is an important feature, it can’t be Nooks’ only hook. Platforms like Slack, Hangouts and even Twitter DMs only require one click (max two!) for a user to communicate with someone. Not to mention that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/slacks-new-video-and-voice-tools-are-nod-to-changing-face-of-work/">Slack is releasing a series of communication</a> tools around spontaneity and live communication.</p>
<p>Still, Nooks currently has thousands of weekly active users from teams and organizations like Stanford, Embroker and Workato. Teams using Nooks spend an average of six hours a day on the platform, the company said.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Do we need so many virtual HQ platforms?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/do-we-need-so-many-virtual-hq-platforms/embed/#?secret=vWpYTYRzZS" data-secret="vWpYTYRzZS" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h2><strong>Hybrid work’s virtual growing pains </strong></h2>
<p>As the pandemic fades in parts of the world, startups like Nooks will need to figure out ways to adapt to the return of hybrid teams after a long stint of mostly remote work. The new challenge for these startups is how they position themselves to embed well into the new culture of work.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/proximity-bias-hybrid-work">proximity bias might make that hard to do.</a></p>
<p>Proximity bias is the idea that employees who go in-person are valued higher than employees who work virtually. It’s one of the realities that make hybrid work so hard to pull off at scale: Equity suffers when a group of employees is positioned as more important or prized only because they can travel to an office.</p>
<p>Virtual workspace startups, especially the ones that want to bring work culture online, could accidentally overly fragment those who work from home versus those who work in-person. The fragmentation will disproportionately impact historically overlooked individuals, which include minorities and women. Notably, of the virtual HQs out there, most have been built, run and funded by men.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="v1e05bWxvs"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/3-views-on-the-future-of-meetings/">3 views on the future of meetings</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;3 views on the future of meetings&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/3-views-on-the-future-of-meetings/embed/#?secret=v1e05bWxvs" data-secret="v1e05bWxvs" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>When asked about how they are combating proximity bias, Lee said that “more frequent, fluid and casual conversation with remote employees helps them build stronger bonds with the rest of the team.” Sure enough, there’s an argument that many virtual HQ startups launched to extinguish proximity bias by bringing everyone in an office to the same digital world.</p>
<p>Ultimately, equalizing the playing field will require aggressive intention. How can a startup make sure virtual HQ employees have access to a spontaneous, in-person stand-up in Conference Room A? How does a platform give any employee, regardless of location, the chance to give input, disagree or share post-meeting banter? Can avatars, or floating video orbs, start to give subtle physical cues beyond a clap or thumbs up?</p>
<p>I’d wager that these features are the moonshot, and survival hack, for virtual HQ startups long-term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Venture capital price discipline is <a href="https://twitter.com/rabois/status/1414953528162988032">out the window</a>; venture funds are looking to make faster, earlier deals; and more unicorns were minted in the last three months than during any quarter in history. It&#8217;s a busy time for startups and their financial backers. Now weeks into July, it&#8217;s increasingly clear that 2021 is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">shaping up to be a record-setter for venture capital investment</a>. And investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/13/investors-dont-expect-the-us-startup-funding-market-to-slow-down/">don&#8217;t expect the frenetic pace to slow</a>.</p>

<hr />
<p>But while the dollars flowing into global startups are setting all-time records, deal volume is not tracking similar extremes. Global deal volume reached a record in the second quarter, but it just barely eked out a win over several quarters from 2018 and Q1 2021.</p>
<p>A flood of money invested against more modest deal flow has helped drive up startup valuations this year, along with deal sizes.</p>

That&#8217;s far above 2020&#8217;s median Series A valuation of $33 million, also beating the previous record set in 2019 of $39 million. The same dataset indicates that Series B, C, D and E rounds also reached new highs in 2021 compared to years going back to at least 2015.</p>
<p>So startups are getting larger checks, earlier. Does that mean that many startups are landing investments with smaller revenues than their stage (or capital base) would normally require? Yep.</p>
<p>Yesterday in a public discussion of startups valued at $1 billion or more &#8212; unicorns, in our modern parlance &#8212; <a href="https://twitter.com/shomikghosh21">Boldstart Ventures&#8217; Shomik Ghosh</a> said something that matched what The Exchange has heard from other investors, albeit in more private conversations. The Exchange estimated that the percentage of unicorns with valuations between $1 billion and $2 billion with $100 million in revenue was small. <a href="https://twitter.com/shomikghosh21/status/1414983568544120833">Ghosh took note of that approximation and wrote the following</a>:</p>

<p>Let me translate: Here the Boldstart investor is saying that it&#8217;s now common to invest in startups at a valuation that works out to 40 to 50 times those companies&#8217; annual recurring revenue, or ARR. LTM stands for <em>last 12 months</em>, indicating in a somewhat slang fashion that we&#8217;re not discussing <em>forward</em> numbers.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what NTM means: <em>next 12 months</em>. Ghosh&#8217;s statement indicates that some startups are actually able to raise capital at even higher multiples of their current revenue, enjoying pricing that can work out to 100 times their ARR for <em>next year</em>.</p>
<p>This yields some questions. For example, The Wall Street Journal&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/mims/status/1414976566480752640">Christopher Mims asked</a> if low startup revenues compared to their valuations indicates that there are a great many houses of cards set to fall in time. The answer is maybe, but probably not. Let&#8217;s talk about why the math<em> can</em> work out for startups with minimal revenues, rich valuations and lots of cash.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020 and 2021, we all became well-acquainted with nasal swabs. But small sticks we stuck up our noses, it turns out, were </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/12/853930147/despite-early-warnings-u-s-took-months-to-expand-swab-production-for-covid-19-te"><span style="font-weight: 400;">harder to come by</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than anyone could have predicted. A May 2020 survey of </span><a href="https://www.amp.org/AMP/assets/AMP_SARS-CoV-2_Survey_Report_FINAL.pdf?pass=98"><span style="font-weight: 400;">118 labs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the US found that 60 percent reported limited swab supplies – making lack of swabs the most commonly reported supply-chain problem.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One small company that stepped into the fray of swab production was the two year old OPT Industries, a Massachusetts-based company with fifteen employees involved in additive manufacturing (think 3D printing) of dense microfiber structures. The company’s printers and software can print more than just swabs, but the first product the company has focused on since 2020 is the InstaSwab – a 3D printed swab used in COVID-19 tests. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In four months in 2020, OPT Industries manufactured 800,000 nasal swabs for commercial partners like Kaiser Permanente and medical products distributor Henry Schein. After that trial run, the company foresees an uptick in production capability. Using newer, modular machines, Ou notes that each machine can now produce about 30,000 swabs per day. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the pandemic has given us an opportunity to show a specific medical area where our technology can shine,” Ou tells TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the pandemic is still a global disaster, the vaccines have changed the game when it comes to testing. OPT Industries is betting that it will survive a </span><a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states"><span style="font-weight: 400;">downturn</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in COVID-19 testing in the US by creating a superior swab, and pivoting to a home-testing market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pandemic was an early test-run for OPT, which at this point, has raised about $5 million in seed funding. The company is currently not seeking investment, notes founder Jifei Ou, but rather has moved into another testing phase for their swab products, the results of which were released today. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Statistics released today by OPT Industries, the company reports that on average their 3D printed nasal swabs were able to transfer 63 percent of viral genes into detection assays. Meanwhile in those tests, flocked fiber swabs transferred 36 percent and polyester swabs about 14 percent. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These tests were performed at Boston University Medical Center, but the results were not published in a peer-reviewed journal (though Ou has more studies that are striving for this). They were also not conducted in human COVID-19 patients, but in vitro. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, the InstaSwabs are better at picking up traces of the virus in the back of the nose and throat. Ou’s argument is that with the right type of swab, specifically, one designed with his dense microfiber structures, may help capture more of the virus and help prevent false negatives – Especially in the early days of infection, when there’s a lower viral load in the body to begin with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are countless studies looking to estimate the false negative rates for the litany of COVID-19 tests used. Case in point: </span><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242958#sec018"><span style="font-weight: 400;">one systematic review</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of 34 studies found estimates ranging from a 2 percent false negative rate to a 29 percent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also evidence linking low viral load to false negatives. </span><a href="https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12985-021-01489-0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conducted at the Public Health Laboratory in Alberta Canada, analyzed 100,001 COVID-19 tests taken from about 95,000 patients (some patients were tested two or three times). Of that group, the authors were able to confirm five false negative test results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The false negatives were attributed to low amounts of viral RNA in the body, which the authors note, was a factor of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">when </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">the samples were collected. It’s not that the swabs missed the virus, it’s that there wasn&#8217;t much virus there to pick up in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it came to analyzing how the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">swabs themselves </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">influenced test results, the authors found that both swab types used by the laboratory had produced false negative results. Though that may imply that swab type didn’t influence false negative rate, the authors argue that more data was needed to reach that conclusion definitively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not to say that improving the way that samples are collected and stored can’t influence testing accuracy. One </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jso.26561"><span style="font-weight: 400;">June 2021 paper</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> argued that using less transport medium fluid (which would result in less dilution of samples) and redesigning swabs to pick up more virus and spend less time in patients’ noses could also help optimize testing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What OPT will need to prove is that a superior swab can truly pick up significant amounts of viral RNA in the early stages of disease </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that this greater pickup rate actually has an impact on false negatives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While OPT Industries’ study (not peer-reviewed) seems to suggest the swabs can collect more virus, it doesn’t have enough information to prove that secondary thesis: that these swabs improve the accuracy of COVID-19 tests done in humans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are right now working with two clinical partners to do clinical research on that,” Ou notes.  “The result of this study and the result of the coming one will be combined together and we are preparing a manuscript to be published in a peer-reviewed publication.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should OPT prove that they can 3D print a superior swab, the bigger question is what market they’ll be poised to enter. As vaccines began to proliferate in early Spring of 2021, demand for Covid-19 tests plunged by about 46 percent nationwide, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Wall Street Journal </span></i><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/entrepreneurs-are-betting-big-on-nyc-covid-19-testing-businesses-11615903201"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (strangely, this didn’t seem to slow the explosion of testing startups, though). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states"><span style="font-weight: 400;">US is conducting</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> an average of 504,048 new COVID-19 tests per day as of July 2021, down from an average of about 1,992,273 in January. (Even with the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant upon us, the </span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDC still notes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that vaccinated people can refrain from routine testing.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ou still sees potential growth in the world of at-home testing – in this case, for COVID-19, though Ou notes that the company can 3D swabs for pretty much any bodily excretion that needs swabbing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One of the things that we&#8217;ll observe is that in the US, the majority of testing is shifting from a point of care or at a hospital to home testing. So this is our current focus and we&#8217;re looking at partnering and collaborating with the home testing kit company,” he says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has secured “several” partnerships with home-testing companies, though an NDA prevents him from naming the companies, says Ou. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At-home testing in general (for both COVID-19 and other maladies) does have some interesting players entering the market, </span><a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/what-amazon-s-potential-move-into-at-home-medical-tests-could-mean-for-market"><span style="font-weight: 400;">most recently, Amazon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Amazon plans to offer at-home testing kits for COVID-19 as well as STIs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps OPT will be able to ride a new at-home swab wave beyond the pandemic.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybereason/">Cybereason</a>, a US-Israeli late-stage <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a> startup that provides extended detection and response (XDR) services, has secured $275 million in Series F funding.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The investment was led by Liberty Strategic Capital, a venture capital fund recently founded by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/steve-mnuchin/">Steven Mnuchin</a>, who served as U.S. Treasury Secretary under the Trump administration. As part of the deal, Mnuchin will join Cybereason&#8217;s board of directors, along with Liberty advisor Gen. Joseph Dunford, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Trump until his retirement in 2019.</p>
<p>Lior Div, CEO and co-founder of Cybereason, tells TechCrunch that the startup&#8217;s decision to work with Liberty Strategy Capital came down to the firm’s “massive network&#8221; and the &#8220;understanding of the financial and government markets that Mnuchin and Gen. Joseph Dunford bring to our team.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“For example, the executive order on cybersecurity put out by the Biden Administration recommends that endpoint detection and response solutions be deployed on all endpoints,” Dior added. “This accelerates the importance of solutions like ours in the public market, and Liberty Strategic Capital has the relationships to help accelerate our go-to-market strategy in the federal sector.”</p>
<p>This round, which will be used to fuel “hypergrowth driven by strong market demand,&#8221; follows $389 million in prior funding from SoftBank, CRV, Spark Capital, and Lockheed Martin. The company didn’t state at what valuation it raised the funds, but it is estimated to be in the region of $3 billion.</p>
<p>Cybereason’s recent growth, which saw it end 2020 at over $120 million in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/10/the-100m-arr-club/">annual recurring revenue</a>, has been largely driven by its AI-powered platform. Unlike traditional alert-centric models, Cybereason&#8217;s Defense Platform is operation-centric, which means it exposes and remediates entire malicious operations.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> The service details the full attack story from root cause to impacted users and devices, which the company claims significantly reduces the time taken to investigate and recover from an enterprise-wide cyber attack. </span></p>
<p>The company, whose competitors include the likes of BlackBerry-owned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/cylance/">Cylance</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/crowdstrike/">CrowdStrike</a>, also this week expanded its channel presence<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>with the launch of its so-called Defenders League, a global program that enables channel partners to use its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>technology and services to help their customers prevent and recover from cyberattacks. Cybereason claims its technology has helped protect customers from the likes of the recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/solarwinds-hackers-targeted-nasa-federal-aviation-administration-networks/">SolarWinds supply-chain attack</a> and other high-profile ransomware attacks launched by DarkSide, REvil, and Conti groups.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Today&#8217;s $275 million funding round is likely to be Cybereason&#8217;s last before it goes public. Div previously said in August 2019 the company planned to IPO within two years, though he wouldn’t be pressed on whether the company is gearing up to go public when asked by TechCrunch. However, the company did compare its latest investment to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/04/cybersecurity-sentinelone-ipo/">SentinelOne</a>&#8216;s November 2020 Series F round, which was secured just months before it filed for a $100 million IPO.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/twilio/">Twilio</a>, a company best known for its tools that help developers build text message/phone call-powered apps, is branching out into a new category: live streaming.</p>
<p>This morning the company announced<a href="https://www.twilio.com/live"> Twilio Live</a>, a platform meant to help developers more easily integrate live video/audio features into their apps.</p>
<p>Details are still a bit light, but here&#8217;s what we know so far:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<ul>
<li>Twilio Live is launching today but in invite-only Beta mode — so not everyone will get access immediately.</li>
<li>It&#8217;ll support iOS, Android, and all &#8220;major browsers&#8221;.</li>
<li>In addition to the content streaming tools, Twilio is also building out interactivity features to support things like text chat, audience polling, screen sharing, and bringing audience members up as speakers.</li>
</ul>
<p>We saw a massive rush of Clubhouse clones hit the market after that app&#8217;s spike in popularity, with even huge names like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/twitter-spaces-arrives-on-android-ahead-of-clubhouse/">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">Discord</a> rushing to replicate its best features. With Twilio effectively turning that feature set into a plug-and-play SDK here, I&#8217;d expect to see a lot more of that.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges of reinventing the wheel when it comes to live streaming is one of scaling; what might work beautifully for one hundred viewers could grind to a halt when you have that viral moment that brings a sudden influx of ten thousand. Twilio has spent the last decade figuring out infrastructure scaling and latency — chances are, they&#8217;re starting on pretty good footing here.</p>
<p>No details seem to be available currently as to how Twilio Live&#8217;s pricing will work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aidoc, an artificial intelligence company that develops triage and analysis software, is about to double its funding. On Tuesday, the company announced a round of $66 million. Before that the company had raised about $67 million in its five-year lifetime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aidoc develops “decision support” software based on artificial intelligence. This software can read images like CT scans, detect certain abnormalities, and advise radiologists on what to do with certain patients. So far, the company’s algorithm, called BriefCase, has been approved by the FDA to evaluate patients with </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf18/K180647.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intracranial hemorrhage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf19/K192383.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">large vessel occlusion </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(a type of stroke), </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf19/K190896.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cervical spine injuries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf20/K203508.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pulmonary embolisms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf20/K201020.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">incidental pulmonary embolisms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf19/K193298.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">intra-abdominal free gas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K202992"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rib fractures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The algorithms were approved via the FDA’s 510(k) premarket pathway – which allows for fast adoption of technology that is substantially similar to other products on the market. </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-00324-0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most algorithms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are approved via that pathway, as there is </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(20)30292-2/fulltext"><span style="font-weight: 400;">no specific regulatory pathway</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for these products in the US (though the FDA is </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/145022/download"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continuously workshopping</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its oversight of AI and machine learning). </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s really unique about us as a company is the breadth and scope of what we do. Instead of building one solution we spend the time building a platform that can accelerate AI development at a really rapid pace,” says Elad Walach, the company’s founder and CEO. “This is why today we have the most FDA cleared solutions on the market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The current funding round was led by the New England VC firm General Catalyst. Chris Bischoff, a managing director of General Catalyst, says the firm was convinced by the strength of the Aidoc’s team, and the seven FDA clearances. However, they were most attracted to the company’s larger approach: create an algorithm (or series of them) that addresses many different conditions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, the company aims to help hospitals build an entire A.I strategy that can be applied to different conditions over time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s this sort of consultative approach, that they’re going in as a partner rather than a vendor,” says Bischoff. “It’s not just effectively a point solution, it’s a workflow tool.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest question facing Aidoc, or any other startup in the field of artificial intelligence, though, is whether it can convince hospitals and clinics to adopt an AI strategy in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aidoc is a software made for radiologists – a group that is dwindling faster than most would like to see. Though the US Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 7 percent increase in need for radiologists by 2029 as the population grows older, The Association of American Medical Colleges predicts the country will experience a shortfall of specialists – a group which includes radiologists. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That shortfall </span><a href="https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/press-releases/new-aamc-report-confirms-growing-physician-shortage"><span style="font-weight: 400;">could range from 17,100 to 41,900</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (these numbers include radiologists among other specialities, but the report doesn’t break down exactly how many radiologists are included in that count). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The UK, however, is already struggling with a radiologist shortage that ranges from </span><a href="https://www.rcr.ac.uk/posts/new-reports-put-uk-radiologist-shortages-focus"><span style="font-weight: 400;">27 to 37 percent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, depending on location. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI has been proposed as one solution to the widening radiologist shortage – per the American Medical Association’s report: “advances in artificial intelligence could improve the productivity of radiologists, pathologists, and others,” </span><a href="https://www.aamc.org/media/45976/download"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it notes.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s only a partial solution. Though we might be able to make each individual radiologist more productive with A.I., even Walach notes that A.I software can’t really diagnose a patient all on its own. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Definitely a radiologist needs to confirm the findings,” he notes.  “That the AI solution doesn&#8217;t do anything without the radiologist.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point, the pitch for AI in the world of radiology is that it’s a tool, not a replacement for a trained radiologist. And there’s been a lot of academic work done to develop these AI tools: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were an estimated 596 papers on the topic in </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-00324-0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2010 and 12,422 by 2019</span></a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this, AI has yet to truly become a go-to for radiologists. </span><a href="https://www.jacr.org/article/S1546-1440(21)00293-3/fulltext"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A 2020 survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> done by American College of Radiology found that just 30 percent of radiologists were using A.I in their practices – the authors called the penetration of the technology “moderate.” Only 20 percent of those not using A.I said they had plans to purchase it in the next one to five years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may be poised to see a bit of an uptick in the use of A.I. in clinics or hospitals post-coronavirus. </span><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/23/1000410/ai-triage-covid-19-patients-health-care/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some hospitals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> turned to A.I facing shortages of staff and high patient loads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Walach says that it wasn’t a major boon to Aidoc. If anything he says it slowed the company’s growth (though it was still trending upwards anyway – Walach estimates the company increased contracted annual recurring revenue seven-fold between Q1 of 2020 and Q1 2021). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instead, he attributes the growth to a wave of research on A.I’s impact on patient welfare beyond initial diagnosis. He points to studies that have found </span><a href="https://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(19)41342-5/fulltext"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A.I can reduce length of hospital stays by identifying which patients to send home</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think the biggest trends in this market is that one more and more evidence is starting to come up that AI has significant downstream benefits,” Walach says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite barriers to widespread adoption of AI, Aidoc has a long list of commercial partners. The company has almost 600 partnerships with hospitals and clinics including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Radiology Partners, Yale New Haven Medical Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UMass, University of Rochester Medical Center, LucidHealth, 4ways Healthcare, Telemedicine Clinic, Grupo Fleury, University Hospital of Basel, Sheba Medical Center, Hadassah Medical Center, and Global Diagnostics Australia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the company projects that it will be used in 10 percent of US hospitals within two years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To some extent, Bischoff argues that the adoption of Aidoc at other high profile health centers could help drive this growth. That could perhaps signal that the company may overcome the slower-than-expected leak of A.I from lab to clinic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That ability to drive high levels of trust – that would allow that deeper integration,” he says. “There&#8217;s a little bit of a lighthouse type dynamic in healthcare where if the leaders do certain things others follow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aidoc is headquartered in New York, with a research branch in Israel and has about 200 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">employees. With this new round of funding, the company plans to invest heavily into R&amp;D and has plans to double the amount of conditions evaluated by the company’s algorithms.</span></p>

Yes, but the difference seems to be that Windows 365 is far easier to use and involves none of the complexity of setting up a full Azure Virtual Desktop environment in the Azure cloud.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><iframe class="youtube-player" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qKG8r1NERl4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></p>
<p>But couldn&#8217;t Microsoft have made Azure Virtual Desktop easier to use instead of launching yet another virtual desktop service? Yes, but Azure Virtual Desktop is very much an enterprise service and by default, that means it must play nicely with the rest of the complexities of a company&#8217;s existing infrastructure. The pandemic pressed it into service in smaller companies because they had few alternatives, but in many ways, today&#8217;s launch is Microsoft admitting that it was far too difficult to manage for them. Windows 365, on the other hand, is somewhat of a fresh slate. It&#8217;s also available through a basic subscription service.</p>
<p>&#8220;Microsoft also continues to innovate in Azure Virtual Desktop for those organizations with deep virtualization experience that want more customization and flexibility options,&#8221; the company says. At least we know why the company renamed Windows Virtual Desktop to Azure Virtual desktop now. That would&#8217;ve gotten quite confusing.</p>

<p>This also gives Microsoft the opportunity to talk about &#8220;a new hybrid personal computing category&#8221; its CEO Satya Nadella calls a &#8220;Cloud PC.&#8221; It&#8217;s a bit unclear what exactly that&#8217;s supposed to be, but it&#8217;s a new category.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just like applications were brought to the cloud with SaaS, we are now bringing the operating system to the cloud, providing organizations with greater flexibility and a secure way to empower their workforce to be more productive and connected, regardless of location,” Nadella explains in today&#8217;s <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2021/07/14/microsoft-unveils-windows-365-ushering-in-a-new-category-of-computing/">press release</a>.</p>
<p>But isn&#8217;t that just <a href="https://www.forcepoint.com/cyber-edu/thin-client">a thin client</a>? Maybe? But we&#8217;re not talking hardware here. It&#8217;s really just a virtualized operating system in the cloud that you can access from anywhere &#8212; and that&#8217;s a category that&#8217;s been around for a long time.</p>
<p>“Hybrid work has fundamentally changed the role of technology in organizations today,” said Jared Spataro, corporate vice president, Microsoft 365. “With workforces more disparate than ever before, organizations need a new way to deliver a great productivity experience with increased versatility, simplicity and security. Cloud PC is an exciting new category of hybrid personal computing that turns any device into a personalized, productive and secure digital workspace. Today’s announcement of Windows 365 is just the beginning of what will be possible as we blur the lines between the device and the cloud.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As mobile developers build apps, they push them out into the world and problems inevitably develop, which engineers have to scramble to fix. <a href="https://www.mobile.dev/">Mobile.dev</a>, a new startup from a former Uber engineer, wants to flip that story and catch errors before the app launches. Today, the company emerged from stealth with a beta of their solution and a $3 million seed investment led by Cowboy Ventures with participation from multiple tech luminaries.</p>
<p>While he was at Uber, company CEO and co-founder Leland Takamine says that he observed this workflow where an app was put out in the world, a company set up tooling to monitor the app and then worked to fix the problem as users reported issues or the monitoring software picked them up. At Uber, they began building tooling to try to catch problems pre-production.</p>
<p>When he started mobile.dev with COO Jacob Krupski, the goal was to build something like this, but for every company regardless of the size. &#8220;The insight that we had was that anything we could do to catch problems before releasing an app was 100 times more valuable than anything that you can monitor in production,&#8221; Takamine told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>And that&#8217;s what the company aims to do.&#8221;Our mission at mobile.dev at a high level is to empower companies to deliver high quality mobile applications. And more specifically, stop sacrificing users and start catching issues before you release,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="LrSpe4qARl"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/ex-uber-team-raises-6m-seed-for-geospatial-analytics-platform-unfolded-ai/">Ex-Uber team raises $6M seed for geospatial analytics platform Unfolded.ai</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ex-Uber team raises $6M seed for geospatial analytics platform Unfolded.ai&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/ex-uber-team-raises-6m-seed-for-geospatial-analytics-platform-unfolded-ai/embed/#?secret=LrSpe4qARl" data-secret="LrSpe4qARl" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>He says that when he speaks to app developers about a solution like this, they are intrigued because as he says &#8220;it&#8217;s really a no-brainer&#8221; question, but unless you have the scale of a company like Uber and vast engineering resources there hasn&#8217;t been a solution like this available for the average company or individual developer. And it was that deep technical expertise he built at Uber that laid the groundwork for what they are building at mobile.dev.</p>
<p>The two founders launched the company a year ago and have been working with design partners and initial customers, particularly Reddit. The product goes into beta today. For now, they are the only two employees, but that is going to change with the new capital as they look to add more engineering talent.</p>
<p>With a very specific set of skills required to build a solution like this, it makes it even more challenging to hire diverse employees, but Takamine says that the goal is to build a diverse team. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s making sure that we look beyond just our immediate network and making sure that we&#8217;re looking at diverse sources,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company launched during the pandemic and with just the two founders involved have been fully remote up until now, and they intend to keep it that way as they add new employees in the coming months.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to be fully remote, I think we have a great advantage that we&#8217;re starting from remote, and it&#8217;s much more difficult to transition from an office to remote. So we&#8217;re starting from first principles here and building our culture around remote work,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie, </strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m a postdoc engineer who started STEM OPT in June after failing to get selected in the H-1B lottery. </strong></p>
<p><strong>A colleague suggested that I apply for an EB-1A for extraordinary ability green card, but I have not won any major awards, much less a Nobel Prize. Would you tell me more about the EB-1A? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks!</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Bashful in Berkeley</strong></p>
<p>Dear Bashful,</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out to me! Most people who get green cards through the EB-1A process are far from achieving a Nobel Prize &#8212; don’t worry, it’s still possible!</p>
<p>My law partner, <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/member/anita-koumriqian/">Anita Koumriqian</a>, recently talked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lanie-denslow-worldwise/">Lanie Denslow</a>, a cultural competence and business protocol consultant who helps companies and professionals navigate cultural differences in today’s complex, fast-moving and global business environment. In the Immigration Law for Tech startups <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/079-cultural-competence-and-immigration-cases-with-lanie-denslow/">podcast episode</a>, they talked about how culture drives behavior and how we need to understand the culture an individual comes from in order to understand their actions and approaches.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2100312" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2100312" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2100312" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg" alt="A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo." width="1024" height="675" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2100312" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Joanna Buniak / <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sophie Alcorn <span class="screen-reader-text">(opens in a new window)</span></a></p></div></p>
<p>Along those lines, I often find that many international professionals and students who qualify for an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/podcast/015-extraordinary-ability-bootcamp/">EB-1A</a> are extremely modest and underestimate their abilities and achievements. In American culture, professionals are expected to promote their abilities and accomplishments or personal branding. While that practice is accepted in the United States, it’s frowned upon in many other countries, where modesty is more culturally valued.</p>
<p>That means many international professionals and students — perhaps even you — may feel out of their comfort zone when submitting an application for an <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/eb-1a-green-card/">EB-1A extraordinary ability green card</a> and gathering the five to eight recommendation letters from individuals who are qualified to assess their work and achievements.</p>
<p>Before I dive in further, I suggest you consult an experienced immigration attorney who can assess whether you would be a strong candidate for an EB-1A or if other options would better suit your situation and goals. You should consider talking to your employer about sponsoring you for a green card, and know that you can also file a petition on your own. The EB-1A and EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver) are two employment-based green cards for which the beneficiaries can self-petition (without an employer sponsor).</p>
<h2>Qualifications for an EB-1A</h2>
<p>To qualify for an EB-1A, you must meet any <em>three </em>of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have received nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence. These awards should be post-university level and might be able to include such things as VC funding, pitch competitions and international hackathons.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.simpplr.com/">Simpplr</a>, a modern platform for building intranet sites (or &#8217;employee communications and enablement platforms,&#8217; as the company calls it), today announced that it has raised a $32 million Series C round led by Tola Capital. Norwest Ventures, which led the company&#8217;s Series B round last year, as well as Salesforce Ventures and George Still Ventures also participated. This brings Simpplr&#8217;s total funding to just over $61 million.</p>
<p>As Simpplr CEO and founder Dhiraj Sharma told me, the Series B round was meant to help the team accelerate product innovation and development. Unsurprisingly, the COVID-19 pandemic only increased demand for digital workplace solutions like Simpplr. As Sharma noted, the company&#8217;s thesis was always that the world was moving toward remote/hybrid work. The pandemic only accelerated this process and with that, the sense of urgency in its customer base to modernize their own platforms for communicating with their employees. To keep up with this growth, the company doubled its team since last August (though Sharma, just like many other startup founders I&#8217;ve recently talked to, also bemoaned that it’s becoming increasingly hard to find talent).</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/simpplr.gif"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2177267" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/simpplr.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company says that it added 100 enterprise customers over the course of the last year. Today, its customer base includes a number of early adopters like Splunk or Nutanix, which were always building toward a global workforce and always had a need for a product like Simpplr. But due to the pandemic, more traditional businesses like Fox, AAA insurance or Renewal by Andersen also needed to quickly find ways to support their newly remote workforces.</p>
<p>&#8220;When this pandemic happened, there were lots of traditional companies who didn&#8217;t think that they would be doing remote work as much in the near future as they had to,&#8221; Sharma said. &#8220;For them, things changed and then what they realized is that they did not have effective means of formal employee communication and also lacked the digital employee experience &#8212; and they realized that very quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Simpplr is obviously not the only intranet solution on the market, but Sharma argues that the service isn&#8217;t just recognized by analyst firms like Gartner and Forrester, but also highly reviewed by its customers, in large parts thanks to its focus on user experience. &#8220;UX is our number one strength and differentiator. We have been pushing the boundaries of intranet for last five years,&#8221; he said and cited features like the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.simpplr.com/auto-governance-engine/">auto-governance engine</a>, which he likened to a &#8220;Roomba for your intranet.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2177270" style="width: 730px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/covid-intranet-1x-1.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2177270" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2177270" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/covid-intranet-1x-1.png" alt="" width="720" height="391" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/covid-intranet-1x-1.png 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/covid-intranet-1x-1.png?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/covid-intranet-1x-1.png?resize=300,163 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/covid-intranet-1x-1.png?resize=680,369 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/covid-intranet-1x-1.png?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2177270" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Simpplr</p></div></p>
<p>Analytics, too, is another area where Simpplr is trying to differentiate itself. &#8220;Our company&#8217;s mission is to help companies build a better workplace &#8212; and unless we can show the areas of improvement and provide insights like how to do something better, we just become a dumb tool,” he said. “For us, what is very important is not only that you are communicating but helping our customers to understand what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not working. What&#8217;s the impact of the communication and how are your employees feeling about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the company is working on building more AI into its tools &#8211; including its analytics &#8212; to help companies better communicate with their employees and understand the impact of those messages.</p>
<p>As for the new funding round, Sharma noted that he bootstrapped his previous two companies, which has made him take a somewhat conservative approach to fundraising. &#8220;When I used to hear that your investors or VCs expect growth at all costs, I just could never understand that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So while building this company, even though this is a venture-funded company, I still wanted to make sure that I use the finances responsibly and I build a business in a sustainable manner. I wanted to make sure that if we raised a large investment, we have a proper use for that investment and that this investment will bring the right results.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tola Capital principal Eddie Kang will now join Simpplr&#8217;s board. &#8220;The future of work is hybrid and Simpplr is essential to a company&#8217;s ability to engage with employees,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As enterprise software investors, what excites us about Simpplr’s platform is that it allows leadership teams to streamline communications across channels and provides a turnkey platform that drives value to customers very quickly. Our partnership with Simpplr will accelerate its roadmap to meet the needs of global business leaders and communications teams.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just over four months after announcing <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/m1-finance-raises-another-rapid-fire-round-after-scaling-its-aum-to-more-than-3-5b/">a $75 million Series D</a>, </span><a href="https://www.m1finance.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">M1 Finance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> today is announcing a new $150 million Series E round of funding led by SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financing, which also included participation from existing backers, propels the Chicago-based fintech to unicorn status with a valuation of $1.45 billion. It also marks M1’s fourth funding round in just over a 13-month time frame, and brings its total raised since its mid-2015 inception to over $300 million. Previous investors include Coatue Management, Left Lane Capital, Jump Capital and Clocktower Technology Ventures, among others.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of its Series D in March, M1 was “near unicorn status,” according to founder and CEO Brian Barnes.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup combines three different traditional fintech services into one (automated investing, borrowing and banking/spending) and has seen rapid growth over the past couple of years. At the time of its last raise in early March, for example, it had reached $3.5 billion in AUM (assets under management). Today, the company says it now has $4.5 billion in AUM, which is up more than fivefold compared to 18 months prior, according to Barnes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since July 1, 2020, the company has more than doubled its user base and tripled its AUM.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">M1 first launched to the public in late 2016 with the mission of building a platform that would help people manage and grow their money “with control and automation – for free.” (For more details on just how M1 makes its money, check out its blog <a href="https://www.m1finance.com/blog/how-m1-makes-money/">here</a>).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the company says it has “hundreds of thousands” of customers that either invest, conduct digital checking or access portfolio lines of credit through its platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many other companies, M1 saw a pandemic-driven boost in business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, there seemed to be a surge of new interest in investing, particularly by millennials, according to Barnes. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2177212" style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2177212" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2177212 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/BrianBarnes-1.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="390" height="260" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/BrianBarnes-1.jpg 6016w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/BrianBarnes-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/BrianBarnes-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/BrianBarnes-1.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/BrianBarnes-1.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/BrianBarnes-1.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/BrianBarnes-1.jpg?resize=2048,1367 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/BrianBarnes-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 390px) 100vw, 390px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2177212" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> M1 Finance founder &amp; CEO Brian Barnes</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lockdown led many to decrease their spending, while an uncertain future increased the appetite to build wealth for the long-term through investing,” he told TechCrunch. “M1 experienced this firsthand. We quadrupled our assets under management since the start of the pandemic last March&#8230; and saw a 3x increase in signups in January 2021 compared to the month prior.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last December, M1 launched </span><a href="https://www.m1finance.com/blog/smart-transfers/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart Transfers,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allowing its “Plus” clients to automate financial goals based on pre-set rules. In February of this year, it released </span><a href="https://www.m1finance.com/custodial/#:~:text=A%20custodial%20account%20is%20an,the%20assets%20in%20the%20account."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Custodial Accounts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, giving M1 Plus parents or guardians the ability to invest in portfolios for younger generations. In June, M1 launched </span><a href="https://www.m1finance.com/blog/send-check/#:~:text=This%20new%20feature%2C%20exclusively%20for,'t%20do%20it%20digitally)."><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send Check,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which allows M1 Plus clients to send physical checks from their M1 Spend Plus checking accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We always want to be the ones pushing for change, just as we have by moving away from the manual input of every trade or one-size-fits-all portfolios,” Barnes said. “Our plan is to continue to innovate across Invest, Borrow and Spend, finding ways to make complex processes seamless.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Munish Varma, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, says his firm believes M1 is “well-positioned to consolidate users’ financial lives on a one-stop super-app with its Invest, Spend and Borrow products.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its fresh capital to build new products and features, further &#8220;innovate&#8221; its platform and do more hiring. M1 has grown its headcount from 40 at the start of 2020 to 250 employees today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As my colleague Alex Wilhelm pointed out when covering M1’s Series D, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the company is not the only service in the savings, investing and spending spaces that has seen growth in the last year. Robinhood and Public </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/as-expected-stock-trading-service-public-raises-220m-at-unicorn-valuation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have done well on</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-q4-2020-revenue-shows-a-return-to-growth/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">investing side of things</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and Chime has </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/how-robinhood-and-chime-raised-2b-in-the-last-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scaled quickly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the spending and saving markets.</span></p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>For this week’s deep dive, <a href="https://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_">Natasha</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyCrichton">Danny</a> decided it was time to chat about funding rounds. Yep, everyone&#8217;s favorite topic, just in time for the return of our wonderful producer <a href="https://twitter.com/CGates123">Chris.</a></p>
<p>To help us navigate these particular waters, we had our friend and friendly competitor <a href="https://twitter.com/alexrkonrad">Alex Konrad</a> on the show. Konrad is a senior editor over at Forbes, and part of the founding duo behind the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/newsletter/midastouch/">Midas Touch newsletter.</a> We like him &#8211; and his puppy!</p>
<p>With four of us around the Zoom table, here&#8217;s what we got into:</p>
<ul>
<li>An overview of the venture capital market in Q2. You can read <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/startups-have-never-had-it-so-good/">TechCrunch&#8217;s coverage of the global numbers here</a>, and our further exploration of the US market here. TechCrunch has more coming on the matter, so stay tuned.</li>
<li>While the show includes the staggering statistics on the current funding frenzy, we soon broadened the conversation to why it all matters.</li>
<li>Consider this a peek into the reporter&#8217;s notebook! We spoke about the supply and demand for covering funding rounds, the imbalance in who receives what money, and how an overall reader ad writer numbness to that $2 million pre-seed impacts the headlines.</li>
<li>Which landed us into our final section: how to stand out in the overall deluge of funding rounds. Here we all had a take, because all reporters find different things interesting. Here we answer questions about what metrics to pay attention to, how to be more than a number in your pitch, and the value of talking about topics other than your startup&#8217;s success.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks again to Alex K. for joining the show! Find him on Twitter,https://twitter.com/alexrkonrad and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/">check out his work at Forbes.</a></p>
<p>Chat with everyone on Friday, a show that is already coming together to be a scorcher. A bit like the weather. Except in San Francisco. Natasha is cold!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://acelerate.io/">Acelerate</a>, a software company looking to help restaurants make the most out of their infrastructure, is today announcing the close of a $14.44 million Series A financing led by Sequoia Capital.</p>
<p>The startup was founded by George Jacobs, who grew up working in his family&#8217;s pizzeria. He attended USC with a plan to get a business degree and ultimately expand Georgee&#8217;s Pizza, but realized that there was an opportunity beyond his own family restaurant to help all kinds of restaurants in the wake of the tech boom.</p>
<p>After a couple of years at Doordash, he came up with the idea for Acelerate, a startup working to give restaurants a way to make the most of their infrastructure.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The first piece of the business is a simple software solution that allows restaurants to manage their entire digital footprint, from order management, pricing, menu updates and changes, to sales and marketing. The idea is that many restaurants are selling through their own brick-and-mortar location, of course, but also selling through a bevy of other platforms like Doordash, Uber Eats, or Seamless. On top of that, their restaurants are listed on Opentable, Yelp, and other marketing platforms.</p>
<p>It can be a lot to manage.</p>
<p>Acelerate&#8217;s SaaS product allows restaurants to manage all of these platforms from a single spot.</p>
<p>But where the company really differentiates from rival players is its licensing business. Acelerate has developed seven proprietary restaurant brands, all with their own menus. They license those brands, complete with the recipes, cooking instructions, and a training guide to restaurants who want to offer more through their online sales portals.</p>
<p>For example, an ice cream shop working with Acelerate may have a strong business in the summer, but struggle in the winter. That same ice cream shop may have a full working kitchen that rarely gets used save for what it takes to make ice cream and cones.</p>
<p>Acelerate allows that shop to license the rights to operate a burger shop or a BBQ joint out of that same space, teaching employees how to make a bacon cheeseburger or a rack of ribs, thus creating an additional revenue stream for that restaurant during leaner months for its traditional business.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2177394" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_1142.jpeg?w=225" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_1142.jpeg 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_1142.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_1142.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_1142.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/IMG_1142.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />Moreover, Acelerate not only licenses its own brands, but works with existing restaurant brands to license out their menus to other restaurant partners.</p>
<p>Thus far, Acelerate has signed on three existing restaurants as brand licensing partners.</p>
<p>Big chains, like Applebees, only use the software piece of Acelerate, but smaller restaurants gravitate toward the licensing product as a way to expand their business, it said. As cloud kitchens trend upward, the startup has found a way to turn existing restaurants into cloud kitchens, as well.</p>
<p>The software side of the business operates as expected, on a monthly subscription model. On the licensing side, restaurants can license one of the brands offered through Acelerate, either homegrown or third-party. Acelerate collects a 40 percent fee from restaurant partners, which includes all third-party marketplace, order processing and delivery fees, as well as promotional spend. The startup also negotiates national food distribution deals to help restaurants get up and running with a new ingredient list.</p>
<p>Jacobs told TechCrunch that Acelerate is currently working with thousands of restaurants on the software side, and that hundreds of stores are licensing the Acelerate brands.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s new capital will be used towards further growth of the team and product. Right now, Acelerate has 11 full time employees, and about half of them are women or underrepresented minorities, according to Jacobs.</p>
<p>Jacobs explained that the unique opportunity for the company is that it&#8217;s not purely a software play that sits on top of an already complicated tech stack.</p>
<p>&#8220;The big opportunity lies in the combination of two great pieces of operating a restaurant, which is technology and operations,&#8221; said Jacobs. &#8220;To do that, we believe that proximity is power and we need to be as close to our customers as possible. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re really doubling down on building local teams and ensuring that we&#8217;re hands on with our operator and restaurant partners.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today a new software company from two former Nutanix executives called <a href="https://devrev.ai/">DevRev</a> emerged from stealth with a $50 million seed round from Mayfield Fund, Khosla Ventures and several industry luminaries. The company, which aims to bring the coding and revenue processes closer together, already has 75 employees working on the new software platform, which they hope to have ready to launch later this year.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not every day you see a $50 million seed round, but perhaps the fact that former Nutanix co-founder and CEO Dheeraj Pandey and his former SVP of engineering Manoj Agarwal are involved, could help explain the investor enthusiasm for the new project.</p>
<p>Pandey says that he has seen a gap between developers and the revenue the applications they create are supposed to generate. The idea behind the new company is to break down the silos that exist between the front of the office and the back of the office and give developers a deeper understanding of the customers using their products, or at least that&#8217;s the theory.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Dev and Rev are Yin and Yang to each other. In today&#8217;s world they are really far apart with tons of bureaucracy between these two parties. Our goal to bring dev and rev to get rid of the bureaucracy,&#8221; Pandey told me</p>
<p>The company intends to build an API to help developers pull this information from existing systems for companies already working with a CRM tool like Salesforce, while helping gather that customer information for younger companies who might lack a tool. Regardless, the idea is to bring that info where the developer can see it to help build better products.</p>
<p>The way it works in most companies is customer service or sales hears complaints or suggestions about the product, and tickets get generated, but putting these issues in front of the people building the software isn&#8217;t always easy or direct. DevRev hopes to change that.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Why Slack and Salesforce execs think they&#8217;re better together&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/04/why-slack-and-salesforce-execs-think-theyre-better-together/embed/#?secret=mymAPcYBHQ" data-secret="mymAPcYBHQ" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Navin Chaddha, managing director at Mayfield, whose firm is investing in DevRev, sees a need to bring these different parts of the company together in a more direct way. &#8220;The code that developers work on today is used by support as well as marketing and sales. By bringing the world of issues and tickets closer to the world of revenue and growth, DevRev’s unified platform bridges the gap between developer and customer and elevates the developer to a business leader,&#8221; Chaddha said.</p>
<p>With 75 employees working on the problem, DevRev is already a substantial startup. As experienced founders Pandey and Agarwal certainly understand the importance of building a diverse and inclusive company. Pandey sees the top of the employment funnel really being focused on engineering, design and business schools and the company is working to bring in a diverse group of young employees.</p>
<p>&#8220;[We are looking at ways] to search for talent and to promote talent, to make them into leaders. I think we have an empty canvas by the way, and we have this idea of COVID, and being able to do remote work has really grown the top of the funnel, the mouth of the funnel now can be anything and everything. [&#8230;] [Colleges and universities] are I would say the real source of all diversity at the end of the day. We have seen how engineering schools, design schools and business schools are actually getting so diverse,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The company is working to build the product now and reaching out to developer communities on Discord, GitHub and other places that developers gather online to get their input, while testing and improving the product in-house and with design partners.</p>
<p>Nutanix, the founders&#8217; previous company, launched in 2009 and raised over a $1 billion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/28/nutanix-execs-discuss-how-they-built-their-2016-ipo-roadshow-deck/">before going public in 2016</a>. Pandey and Agarwal left Nutanix at the end of last year to launch the new company.</p>
