										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It&#8217;s been a long time coming but Facebook is finally feeling some heat from Europe&#8217;s much trumpeted data protection regime: Ireland&#8217;s Data Protection Commission (DPC) has<a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/press-releases/data-protection-commission-announces-decision-whatsapp-inquiry"> just announced</a> a €225 million (~$267M) for WhatsApp.</p>
<p>The Facebook-owned messaging app has been under investigation by the Irish DPC, its lead data supervisor in the European Union, since December 2018 &#8212; several months after the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">first complaints were fired</a> at WhatsApp over how it processes user data under Europe&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), once it begun being applied in May 2018.</p>
<p>Despite receiving a number of specific complaints about WhatsApp, the investigation undertaken by the DPC that&#8217;s been decided today was what&#8217;s known as an &#8220;own volition&#8221; enquiry &#8212; meaning the regulator selected the parameters of the investigation itself, choosing to fix on an audit of WhatsApp&#8217;s &#8216;transparency&#8217; obligations.</p>
<p>A key principle of the GDPR is that entities which are processing people&#8217;s data must be clear, open and honest with those people about how their information will be used.</p>
<p>The DPC&#8217;s decision today (which runs to a full 266 pages) concludes that WhatsApp failed to live up to the standard required by the GDPR.</p>
<p>Its enquiry considered whether or not WhatsApp fulfils transparency obligations to both users and non-users of its service (WhatsApp may, for example, upload the phone numbers of non-users if a user agrees to it ingesting their phone book which contains other people&#8217;s personal data); as well as looking at the transparency the platform offers over its sharing of data with its parent entity Facebook (a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/30/whatsapps-privacy-u-turn-on-sharing-data-with-facebook-draws-more-heat-in-europe/">highly controversial issue at the time the privacy U-turn was announced</a> back in 2016, although it predated GDPR being applied).</p>
<p>In sum, the DPC found a range of transparency infringements by WhatsApp &#8212; spanning articles 5(1)(a); 12, 13 and 14 of the GDPR.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition to issuing a sizeable financial penalty, it has ordered WhatsApp to take a number of actions to improve the level of transparency it offer users and non-users &#8212; giving the tech giant a three-month deadline for making all the ordered changes.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">In a statement responding to the DPC&#8217;s decision, WhatsApp disputed the findings and dubbed the penalty &#8220;entirely disproportionate&#8221; &#8212; as well as confirming it will appeal, writing: </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">“WhatsApp is committed t</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">o providing a secure and private service. We have worked to ensure the information we provide is transparent and comprehensive and will continue to do so. We disagree with the decision today regarding the transparency we provided to people in 2018 and the penalties are entirely disproportionate. We will appeal this decision.” </span></p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s worth emphasizing that the scope of the DPC enquiry which has finally been decided today was limited to only looking at WhatsApp&#8217;s transparency obligations.</p>
<p>The regulator was explicitly <em>not</em> looking into wider complaints &#8212; which have also been raised against Facebook&#8217;s data-mining empire for well over three years &#8212; about the legal basis WhatsApp claims for processing people&#8217;s information in the first place.</p>
<p>So the DPC will continue to face criticism over both the pace and approach of its GDPR enforcement.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, prior to today, Ireland&#8217;s regulator had only issued one decision in a major cross-border cases addressing &#8216;Big Tech&#8217; &#8212; against Twitter when, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/15/twitter-fined-550k-over-a-data-breach-in-irelands-first-major-gdpr-decision/">back in December</a>, it knuckle-tapped the social network over a historical security breach with a fine of $550k.</p>
<p>WhatsApp&#8217;s first GDPR penalty is, by contrast, considerably larger &#8212; reflecting what EU regulators (plural) evidently consider to be a far more serious infringement of the GDPR.</p>
<p>Transparency is a key principle of the regulation. And while a security breach may indicate sloppy practice, systematic opacity towards people whose data your adtech empire relies upon to turn a fat profit looks rather more intentional; indeed, it&#8217;s arguably the whole business model.</p>
<p>And &#8212; at least in Europe &#8212; such companies are going to find themselves being forced to be up front about what they&#8217;re doing with people&#8217;s data.</p>
<h3><strong>Is the GDPR working?  </strong></h3>
<p>The WhatsApp decision will rekindle the debate about whether the GDPR is working effectively where it counts most: Against the most powerful companies in the world, which are also of course Internet companies.</p>
<p>Under the EU&#8217;s flagship data protection regulation, decisions on cross border cases require agreement from all affected regulators &#8212; across the 27 Member States &#8212; so while the GDPR&#8217;s &#8220;one-stop-shop&#8221; mechanism seeks to streamline the regulatory burden for cross-border businesses by funnelling complaints and investigations via a lead regulator (typically where a company has its main legal establishment in the EU), objections can be raised to that lead supervisory authority&#8217;s conclusions (and any proposed sanctions), as has happened here in this WhatsApp case.</p>
<p>Ireland originally proposed a far more low-ball penalty of up to €50M for WhatsApp. However other EU regulators objected to its draft decision on a number of fronts &#8212; and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) ultimately had to step in and take <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-09/edpb_bindingdecision_202101_ie_sa_whatsapp_redacted_en.pdf">a binding decision</a> (issued this summer) to settle the various disputes.</p>
<p>Through that (admittedly rather painful) joint-working, the DPC was required to increase the size of the fine issued to WhatsApp. In a mirror of what happened with its draft Twitter decision &#8212; where the DPC has also suggested an even tinier penalty in the first instance.</p>
<p>While there is a clear time cost in settling disputes between the EU&#8217;s smorgasbord of data protection agencies &#8212; the DPC submitted its draft WhatsApp decision to the other DPAs for review back in December, so it&#8217;s taken well over half a year to hash out all the disputes about WhatsApp&#8217;s lossy hashing and so forth &#8212; the fact that &#8216;corrections&#8217; are being made to its decisions and conclusions can land &#8212; if not jointly agreed but at least arriving via a consensus getting pushed through by the EDPB &#8212; is a sign that the process, while slow and creaky, is working.</p>
<p>Even so, Ireland&#8217;s data watchdog will continue to face criticism for its outsized role in handling GDPR complaints and investigations &#8212; with some accusing the DPC of essentially cherry-picking which issues to examine in detail (by its choice and framing of cases) and which to elide entirely (by those issues it doesn&#8217;t open an enquiry into or complaints it simply drops or ignores), with its loudest critics arguing it&#8217;s therefore still a major bottleneck on effective enforcement of data protection rights across the EU. And the associated conclusion for that critique is that tech giants like Facebook are still getting a pretty free pass to violate Europe&#8217;s privacy rules.</p>
<p>But while it&#8217;s true that a $267M penalty is still the equivalent of a parking ticket for Facebook, orders to change how such adtech giants are able to process people&#8217;s information have the potential to be a far more significant correction on problematic business models. Again, though, time will be needed to tell.</p>
<p>In a statement on the WhatsApp decision today, <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/statement-dpc-issues-eu-225-million-fine-whatsapp">noyb</a> &#8212; the privacy advocay group founded by long-time European privacy campaigner Max Schrems, said: <em>&#8220;</em>We welcome the first decision by the Irish regulator. However, the DPC gets about ten thousand complaints per year since 2018 and this is the first major fine. The DPC also proposed an initial €50MK fine and was forced by the other European data protection authorities to move towards €225M, which is still only 0.08% of the turnover of the Facebook Group. The GDPR foresees fines of up to 4% of the turnover. This shows how the DPC is still extremely dysfunctional.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schrems also noted that he and noyb still have a number of pending cases before the DPC &#8212; including on WhatsApp.</p>
<p>In further remarks, Schrems and noyb said: &#8220;WhatsApp will surely appeal the decision. In the Irish court system this means that years will pass before any fine is actually paid. In our cases we often had the feeling that the DPC is more concerned with headlines than with actually doing the hard groundwork. It will be very interesting to see if the DPC will actually defend this decision fully, as it was basically forced to make this decision by its European counterparts. I can imagine that the DPC will simply not put many resources on the case or &#8216;settle&#8217; with WhatsApp in Ireland. We will monitor this case closely to ensure that the DPC is actually following through with this decision.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Corelight, a San Francisco-based startup that claims to offer the industry’s first open <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/network-security/">network detection and response</a> (NDR) platform, has raised $75 million in Series D investment led by Energy Impact Partners.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>The round — which also includes a strategic investment from Capital One Ventures, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/crowdstrike-falcon-fund">Crowdstrike Falcon Fund</a> and Gaingels — brings Corelight’s total raised to $160 million, following a $50 million Series C in October 2019, a $25 million Series B in September 2018, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/18/corelight-closes-9-2m-series-a-to-help-enterprises-battle-ransomware/">and a $9.2 million Series A in July 2017</a>.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s raised plenty of capital in the past few years, the startup isn’t planning its exit just yet. Brian Dye, CEO of Corelight, tells TechCrunch that given Corelight’s market opportunity and performance — the startup claims to be the fastest-growing NDR player at scale — it plans to invest in growth and expects to raise additional capital in the future.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Public listing timeframes are always hard to forecast, and we view the private markets as attractive in the short term, so we expect to remain private for the next couple years and will look at market conditions then to decide our next step,&#8221; Dye said, adding that the Corelight plans to use its latest investment to fuel the acceleration of its global market presence and to develop new data and cloud-based offerings.</p>
<p>“Aside from go-to-market expansion, we are investing to ensure that the insight we provide both continues to lead the industry and can be readily used by customers of all types,” he added.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Corelight, which competes with the likes of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/fireeye/">FireEye</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/02/fireeye-to-sell-products-unit-for-1-2b-to-symphony-led-group/">STG-owned McAfee</a>, was founded in 2013 when Dr. Vern Paxson, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, joined forces with Robin Sommer and Seth Hall to build a network visibility solution on top of an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/open-source/">open-source</a> framework called Zeek (formerly Bro).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Paxson began developing Zeek in 1995 when he was working at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). The software is now widely regarded as the gold standard for both network security monitoring and network traffic analysis and has been deployed by thousands of organizations around the world, including the U.S. Department of Energy, various agencies in the U.S. government, and research universities like Indiana University, Ohio State, and Stanford.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As live audio becomes more and more popular, co-founders David Sacks (former COO of PayPal and CEO of Yammer) and Axel Ericsson sought to combine social audio and podcasting into one seamless app. The resulting app <a href="https://www.callin.com/">Callin</a> launches today on iOS with an announcement of $12 million in Series A funding co-led by Sequoia, Goldcrest, and Craft Ventures, where Sacks is a founder and partner.</p>
<p>On live audio platforms like Clubhouse or Twitter Spaces, once a room ends, the audio is gone. While Callin has similar live audio functionality, it sets itself apart by allowing users to save their live recording and edit it into an episode of a podcast.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d been meaning to do a podcast for years, and I just had never gotten around to it, because it&#8217;s too complicated, and the barriers are too high,&#8221; said Sacks, who started his &#8220;All In&#8221; podcast in lockdown. &#8220;We have a guy in the studio who spends six hours doing post-production on every episode of the pod, and we all had to get microphones, hardware&#8230; It&#8217;s complicated to organize.&#8221;</p>
<p>For aspiring podcasters creating their first shows, Callin reduces the barrier to entry while allowing users to retain ownership of the content they create on the app. To start recording, users just open a room, which can be private or public &#8212; then they can invite guests to talk with them, or record alone. In a live room, Callin also has a more streamlined queue for audience participation to make it easier for hosts to manage crowds.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-2197200" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /></p>
<p>To edit your podcast after recording, the app generates a transcript &#8212; it takes about the same amount of time as your recording to transcribe. Then, you can tap a block of text to cut it from the podcast, including isolated filler words, like um and uh. As of now, you can&#8217;t cut individual words or phrases within each block of text identified by the AI, but Sacks says that the app will continue building out its editing system. Callin also automates the process of cutting out &#8220;dead air&#8221; at the beginning or end of a recording. After finishing edits, the host can upload the recording as an episode of a show that they create on the app. Users can also export their audio to share it on other podcasts hosts, and in the future, Sacks said users will be able to syndicate the content via an RSS feed.</p>
<p>&#8220;But consuming that content via a podcast app would be different from experiencing it on Callin, because you have the interactive playback to see the room as it was when the conversation occurred,&#8221; said Sacks. &#8220;So you can see the avatar of who&#8217;s talking and you can click it and follow them or browse their profile to see what else they&#8217;re interested in, so it&#8217;s a different experience than just a flat audio file.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2197159" style="width: 405px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197159" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2197159 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8021-e1630522704992.png?w=395" alt="" width="395" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8021-e1630522704992.png 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8021-e1630522704992.png?resize=87,150 87w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8021-e1630522704992.png?resize=174,300 174w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8021-e1630522704992.png?resize=395,680 395w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG_8021-e1630522704992.png?resize=29,50 29w" sizes="(max-width: 395px) 100vw, 395px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197159" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Callin, screenshot by TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Podcasters cannot yet publish their transcripts &#8212; which, like most automated transcripts, aren&#8217;t 100% accurate &#8212; but that functionality, which Callin is working on, could create some much-needed accessibility that&#8217;s still lacking on Clubhouse. Like Clubhouse, Callin doesn&#8217;t support live captioning yet (Twitter Spaces does). But Sacks said that once it expands to allow hosts to share transcripts, live captioning would &#8220;be on the roadmap.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are apps out there that do rooms, there&#8217;s apps that let you edit transcripts, and there&#8217;s apps that do social discovery or highlights, but nobody&#8217;s really put all these pieces together into one experience,&#8221; Sacks said. &#8220;So we&#8217;re trying to be this complete vertical stack for anyone who wants to create an audio show, and so I think you&#8217;ll see us keep iterating on every aspect of that experience. We want there to be nothing you can do in a podcasting studio that you can&#8217;t do on our app.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, in its current form as it launches into the App Store, Callin lacks tools to edit the quality of an audio recording, add sound effects or music, and edit content in a more precise way. Plus, a podcast recorded on an iPhone won&#8217;t sound as good as a professionally produced show, or even a hobbyist&#8217;s podcast recorded on a consumer-grade USB mic. But the success of live audio apps has shown that sometimes listeners aren&#8217;t looking for quality post-production and sound design, but rather, they just want to hear people talk about a subject that interests them. So, Callin and its investors are betting on the fact that people would want to listen to pre-recorded Clubhouse rooms if they could.</p>
<p>Sacks has used his app to create shows like &#8220;Sacks on SaaS,&#8221; a show for software company founders, and an interview show called &#8220;Red Pills,&#8221; which is titled with a phrase that has <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/04/red-pill-meme-alt-right-twitter/618577/">a very fraught history</a> on the internet. Other user-made content on the app includes shows about the NFL, startups in Berlin, cooking, and more. In its beta, Sacks says that Callin had &#8220;thousands&#8221; of users who created over 100 shows.</p>
<p>Per its Community Guidelines, Callin &#8220;is a place for people to speak, so whenever speech is limited on our platform, there should be a good reason.&#8221; Callin will only limit speech restricted by the host of a room, speech restricted by &#8220;underlying technology platforms&#8221; like Apple and Google, and &#8220;dangerous speech not protected by the First Amendment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Content moderation has been a challenge on live audio platforms like Clubhouse, which has struggled to refine its <a href="https://blog.clubhouse.com/on-community-moderation/">content moderation standards</a> after <a href="https://twitter.com/clubhouse/status/1383935475333820417?lang=en">reports</a> of racist and antisemitic speech. Callin&#8217;s Community Guidelines indicate that it will host any user-generated content that won&#8217;t get the app booted off of Apple and Google stores. Recently, Parler served as a high-profile example of how a social platform&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/apple-confirms-it-will-allow-parler-to-return-to-app-store/">refusal to moderate content</a> got it removed from app stores, though it has since been reinstated after months of back-and-forth.</p>
<p>With its $12 million Series A round, Callin hopes to support Android and web versions of the app. Eventually, Callin could seek profit through advertisements and show subscriptions, but Sacks says that the company plans to scale first before exploring its monetization options.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this is the best product that I&#8217;ve ever worked on,&#8221; said Sacks. &#8220;I mean, I think it&#8217;s better than Yammer. I think it&#8217;s better even than PayPal.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">India’s top banks five years ago built the interoperable UPI railroads and enabled over 150 million people in the South Asian market to pay digitally. Scores of firms &#8212; including local firms Paytm, PhonePe, CRED and international giants Google and Facebook &#8212; in India today support the UPI infrastructure, which is now reporting 3 billion transactions each month.</p>
<p>Banks are now ready for their second act.</p>
<p>On Thursday, eight Indian banks announced that they are rolling out &#8212; or about to roll out &#8212; a system called Account Aggregator to enable consumers to consolidate all their financial data in one place. (Participants banks are HDFC, Kotak, ICICI, Axis, SBI, IndusInd, IDFC, and Federal Bank. Four of them are rolling out the system Thursday, others say they will roll out the new system soon.)</p>
<p>The objective of Account Aggregator (AA) is to aggregate all financial information of an individual, said M Rajeshwar Rao, Deputy Governor of India’s central bank &#8212; Reserve Bank of India &#8212; at a virtual event Thursday.</p>
<p>The new system makes it possible for banks, tax authorities, insurers, and other finance firms to aggregate data of customers &#8212; who have provided their consent &#8212; to get better understanding about their potential customers, make informed decisions and ensure smoother transactions.</p>
<p>Users who provide consent &#8212; and it only takes a few taps to do so &#8212; will be able to share their financial information from one Account Aggregator participant to another through a centralized API-based repository. Users get to decide for how long they wish their data to be shared with a particular Account Aggregator participant.</p>
<p>&#8220;For retail loan underwriting (&#8220;eligibility check&#8221;), rather than submitting previous 3 years bank statements, I can simply authenticate a data transfer via AA (and revoke the data transfer AFTER the loan is approved or sanctioned). For self-employed or freelance professionals, getting Term Insurance has always been difficult since they cannot prove their income &#8211; AA lets you provide an audit trail of past income to underwrite the Term Insurance application,&#8221; Rahul Mathur, founder and chief executive of insurance aggregator startup BimaPe, told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2197447" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197447" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2197447 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/india-account-aggregators.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="521" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/india-account-aggregators.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/india-account-aggregators.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/india-account-aggregators.jpg?resize=300,153 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/india-account-aggregators.jpg?resize=768,391 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/india-account-aggregators.jpg?resize=680,346 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/india-account-aggregators.jpg?resize=1536,781 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/india-account-aggregators.jpg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197447" class="wp-caption-text">An illustration of how the AA system works.</p></div></p>
<p>Most countries globally already have privacy laws that recognize the rights of individuals. But even as individuals and businesses have the right to exercise their control over their data, the current system has made it difficult for consumers to operationalize how they provide consent.</p>
<p>&#8220;They face this difficult for two reasons,&#8221; explained Siddharth Tiwari, head of the Bank for International Settlements in Asia and Pacific. &#8220;Firstly, a service provider usually seeks consent to use and transfer data at time when consumers [are] agreeing to participate in an activity with the service provider. Since this consent is granted for a wide variety of possibilities, it is broad and sweeping in nature,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Secondly, newly created data are often gathered and retained in proprietary silos and stored in various institutions in incompatible formats. Consumers can find it difficult to share their data as they have only limited options. [&#8230;] Thus, service providers who are custodians of data effectively act as defacto owner of the data,&#8221; he said, adding that Account Aggregator is designed to potentially address these challenges. &#8220;A robust consent-based data sharing system has the potential for consumers derive value from their data while maintaining control.&#8221;</p>
<p>Account Aggregator is built in part to help consumers and businesses access financial services such as loans. Existing credit bureaus in India have data of only a fraction of the nation&#8217;s 1.4 billion population, which makes it very difficult for most in the country to access working capital, explained Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani, who’s been an adviser to the initiative, at the event Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Talks are on to onboard telecom operators as well,&#8221; he said, adding that the system has already achieved the sophistication that it could be extended to other industries.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an architecture that can now be applied to several additional industries,&#8221; he said, pointing to healthcare, fitness, testing labs as examples. &#8220;We can confidently say that there is no other country in the world that has built a robust infrastructure of this kind and at scale where its people can leverage their data. This approach is now getting global recognition.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Account Aggregator system is also positioned to dramatically increase the addressable market for online insurers, lenders, and players in several other industries.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a big step towards a connected financial ecosystem, and will be very significant in Fi&#8217;s journey to help working millennials get better with their money. With the successful demonstration of the framework today we are excited to have all our users experience the power and convenience of the AA integration once it’s rolled out to all users,” said Sumit Gwalani, co-founder of Fi.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story. More to follow&#8230;</em></p>

<p id="speakable-summary">The Federal Aviation Administration is looking into an anomaly on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-reopens-ticket-sales-073418808.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">Virgin Galactic</a> flight that carried <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-richard-branson-spaceflight-complete-154012847.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">Richard Branson to space</a>. In a piece discussing not just that particular flight but the company&#8217;s various <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-10-31-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">safety</a> issues throughout the years, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-red-warning-light-on-richard-bransons-space-flight" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="22" data-v9y="1"><em>The New Yorker</em></a> explained that Virgin&#8217;s spacecraft went off-course during descent, triggering an &#8220;entry glide-cone warning.&#8221; The spacecraft uses the glide cone method, which mimics water circling down the drain, for landing. Apparently, the pilots for the mission didn&#8217;t fly as steeply as they should have, causing the system to raise the alarm.</p>
<p>An FAA spokesperson confirmed to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-faa-probing-virgin-galactic-july-11-flight-deviation-2021-09-01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="23" data-v9y="1"><em>Reuters</em></a> that the vehicle &#8220;deviated from its Air Traffic Control clearance as it returned to Spaceport America&#8221; and it&#8217;s investigating the incident. The agency gives missions to space a designated airspace they can fly in to prevent collisions with commercial planes and to minimize civilian casualties in the event of an accident. Virgin&#8217;s Unity 22 mission flew out of that designated airspace for a minute and forty-one seconds before the pilots were able to correct course.</p>
<p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>Nicholas Schmidle, author of <em>The New Yorker</em> piece, said he attended a meeting a few years ago, wherein the same pilots on the Unity 22 flight said a red light entry glide-cone warning should &#8220;scare the shit out of you.&#8221; Apparently, that means it&#8217;s too late, and that the safest course of action is to abort. In a statement it <a href="http://www.parabolicarc.com/2021/09/01/virgin-galactic-statement-about-anomaly-on-richard-bransons-suborbital-space-flight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="24" data-v9y="1">published</a> after the article went out, though, Virgin Galactic said it &#8220;disputes the misleading characterizations and conclusions&#8221; in the piece and that the people on the flight weren&#8217;t in any danger as a result of the flight deviation. The company said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When the vehicle encountered high altitude winds which changed the trajectory, the pilots and systems monitored the trajectory to ensure it remained within mission parameters. Our pilots responded appropriately to these changing flight conditions exactly as they were trained and in strict accordance with our established procedures. Although the flights ultimate trajectory deviated from our initial plan, it was a controlled and intentional flight path that allowed Unity 22 to successfully reach space and land safely at our Spaceport in New Mexico. At no time were passengers and crew put in any danger as a result of this change in trajectory.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It also said that the spacecraft did not fly outside of the lateral confines of the mission&#8217;s protected airspace, though it did drop below the altitude of the airspace it was provided. The company added that it&#8217;s &#8220;working in partnership with the FAA to address the airspace for future flights.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Last-mile logistics supplier AxleHire provides same-day and next-day delivery through a network that includes gig economy, couriers and traditional carriers. Over the past year, it has been quietly piloting automated repositioning startup Tortoise&#8217;s remote controlled delivery robots in Los Angeles and compact container delivery service URB-E&#8217;s e-bike container delivery in New York City. On Thursday, it announced plans to scale the two very different zero-emissions pilot programs nationally over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>AxleHire, which is known for parcel delivery and restaurant meal kit delivery like Blue Apron and HelloFresh, plans to bring over 100 Tortoise robots across the country. During URB-E&#8217;s summer deployment with AxleHire in NYC, it deployed 10 vehicles moving 100 containers per week. Now it will deploy 50 URB-E vehicles moving anywhere from 300 to 500 containers per week in NYC, LA and San Francisco, as well as other launch cities. The company, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210407005155/en/AxleHire-Raises-20-Million-to-Redefine-Last-Mile-Logistics">which raised a $20 million round in April</a>, didn&#8217;t specify every city it would be entering with these new programs, but Tortoise and URB-E said we can look to the cities AxleHire already operates in: Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, New York, Phoenix, Seattle and Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p>AxleHire&#8217;s style is to establish delivery hubs in or near dense metro areas, which makes for easier trips and less miles traveled in total. The partnerships with Tortoise and URB-E are a part of AxleHire&#8217;s mission to create more sustainable and cheaper last-mile delivery. The company says its partnerships with the two startups have also lowered its emissions by 95%. AxleHire is providing an example of one company trialing two very different greener and tech-focused forms of transporting goods, so it will likely serve as an interesting case study for other last-mile logistics providers.</p>

<p>In New York, AxleHire and URB-E have been working together on a microcontainer delivery system between Brooklyn and Manhattan. URB-E&#8217;s vehicles are specifically designed to be able to ride in the bike lanes, despite their ability to haul over 800 pounds. AxleHire says its pilot with URB-E resulted in a six times reduction in traffic and a model that is three times cheaper than EV delivery vans, largely based on the avoidance of parking tickets.</p>
<p>Over the past year in Los Angeles, AxleHire stationed Tortoise&#8217;s electric, 4-mph remote-piloted carts, which carried up to 120 pounds worth of goods, in its delivery microhubs in cities, allowing the little bots with friendly smiley faces to go back and forth, making about 15 deliveries per day within a three-mile radius. In addition, AxleHire loaded a large truck with multiple packages and a Tortoise robot, which would then drive into a dense residential area. This truck would serve as a mobile delivery hub, doing its own deliveries while the bot goes back and forth delivering parcels and being reloaded all day long.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s basically the hive model, where we&#8217;re augmenting the existing van or truck in terms of how many deliveries they could do in a two-hour stretch,&#8221; Dmitry Shevelenko, co-founder of Tortoise, told TechCrunch. &#8220;There&#8217;s communication happening with our subject confirming they&#8217;ll be home to receive it. If so, they get notified that the robot&#8217;s on the way when it&#8217;s about 10 minutes away, and then when it arrives, the customer will come out and get it from the containers in the robot.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Tortoise bots, which can ride on sidewalks or bike lanes, have both swappable batteries and can be plugged and charged, according to Shevelenko. On a single charge, they can get around 10 to 15 miles of range.</p>
<p>While Tortoise&#8217;s bots will be operated 100% remotely over the next year, remote positioning is not Tortoise&#8217;s end goal at all. Autonomy is the goal, and doing partnerships like this, as well as with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/27/spin-bets-its-scooter-future-on-3-wheels-and-remote-control-tech/">shared e-scooter operators like Spin</a>, allows Tortoise not only to get into markets that currently don&#8217;t have regulation for self-driving vehicles, but also to just get into the market now, rather than spending multiple years mapping it first. The only real infrastructure the bots need is 4G connectivity.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The beauty is that we can ship the robot to a new location and because we have the benefit of human judgment oversight every inch of the journey,&#8221; said Shevelenko. &#8220;We don&#8217;t need perfect routing or perfect mapping. We&#8217;re filling in the maps over time, and that gives us a big data advantage.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>By slowly collecting routing data over the course of the next year, Tortoise will be giving its system more data to learn on and create the most optimal route for the specific use case of low-speed and lightweight delivery vehicles. Shevelenko says the long-term vision of Tortoise is to have its tech on any light electric vehicle, whether it be a delivery robot, a scooter, a cleaning robot, security robot or construction robot. Delivery is a great place to start, given the massive demand in the COVID marketplace.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more vehicles we have with Tortoise eyes on them, the more data we&#8217;re collecting, which means we&#8217;re doing trips with higher autonomy and lower costs,&#8221; said Shevelenko.</p>
<p>Aside from allowing for max data collection, remote controlled delivery bots over the next year also give Tortoise the advantage of getting the community used to this new tech.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think the right way to enter a community is first to reassure people that this is safe and get them comfortable with it,&#8221; said Shevelenko. &#8220;Once it&#8217;s part of daily life, then slowly over time, we can turn on more autonomy, but there&#8217;s no need to rush into that right now. The practical reality is, everybody&#8217;s claiming they&#8217;re doing autonomy but they aren&#8217;t. They always have a fallback like safety drivers or remote monitors. Nobody actually trusts their economy system, and so we&#8217;re kind of leaning into that and not trying to do something that is impossible.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Summer is still technically in session, but a snowball is slowly developing in the world of apps, and specifically the world of in-app payments. A report in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-apple-hit-with-antitrust-case-india-over-in-app-payments-issues-2021-09-02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a> today says that the Competition Commission of India, the country&#8217;s monopoly regulator, will soon be looking at an antitrust suit filed against Apple over how it mandates that app developers use Apple&#8217;s own in-app payment system &#8212; thereby giving Apple a cut of those payments &#8212; when publishers charge users for subscriptions and other items in their apps.</p>
<p>The suit, filed by an Indian non-profit called &#8220;Together We Fight Society&#8221;, said in a statement to Reuters that it was representing consumer and startup interests in its complaint.</p>
<p>The move would be the latest in what has become a string of challenges from national regulators against app store operators &#8212; specifically Apple but also others like Google and WeChat &#8212; over how they wield their positions to enforce market practices that critics have argued are anti-competitive. Other countries that have in recent weeks reached settlements, passed laws, or are about to introduce laws include Japan, South Korea, Australia, the U.S. and the European Union.</p>
<p>And in India specifically, the regulator is currently working through a similar investigation as it relates to in-app payments in Android apps, which Google mandates use its proprietary payment system. Google and Android dominate the Indian smartphone market, with the operating system active on 98% of the 520 million devices in use in the country as of the end of 2020.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to watch whether more countries wade in as a result of these developments. Ultimately, it could force app store operators, to avoid further and deeper regulatory scrutiny, to adopt new and more flexible universal policies.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we are seeing changes happen on a country-by-country basis.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apple-announced-new-settlement-with-japan-allowing-developers-to-link-to-external-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached a settlement in Japan</a> that will let publishers of &#8220;reader&#8221; apps (those for using or consuming media like books and news, music, files in the cloud and more) to redirect users to external sites to provide alternatives to Apple&#8217;s proprietary in-app payment provision. Although it&#8217;s not as seamless as paying within the app, redirecting previously was typically not allowed, and in doing so the publishers can avoid Apple&#8217;s cut.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>South Korean legislators earlier this week <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved a measure</a> that will make it illegal for Apple and Google to make a commission by forcing developers to use their proprietary payment systems.</p>
<p>And last week, Apple also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-will-now-let-app-store-developers-talk-to-their-customers-about-buying-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made some movements in the U.S.</a> around allowing alternative forms of payments, but relatively speaking the concessions were somewhat indirect: app publishers can refer to alternative, direct payment options in apps now, but not actually offer them. (Not yet at least.)</p>
<p>Some developers and consumers have been arguing for years that Apple&#8217;s strict policies should open up more. Apple however has long said in its defense that it mandates certain developer policies to build better overall user experiences, and for reasons of security. But, as app technology has evolved, and consumer habits have changed, critics believe that this position needs to be reconsidered.</p>
<p>One factor in Apple&#8217;s defense in India specifically might be the company&#8217;s position in the market. Android absolutely dominates India when it comes to smartphones and mobile services, with Apple actually a very small part of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>As of the end of 2020, it accounted for just 2% of the 520 million smartphones in use in the country, according to figures from Counterpoint Research quoted by Reuters. That figure had doubled in the last five years, but it&#8217;s a long way from a majority, or even significant minority.</p>
<p>The antitrust filing in India has yet to be filed formally, but Reuters notes that the wording leans on the fact that anti-competitive practices in payments systems make it less viable for many publishers to exist at all, since the economics simply do not add up:</p>
<p class="Text__text___3eVx1j Text__dark-grey___AS2I_p Text__regular___Bh17t- Text__large___1i0u1F Body__base___25kqPt Body__large_body___3g04wK ArticleBody__element___3UrnEs" data-testid="paragraph-3">&#8220;The existence of the 30% commission means that some app developers will never make it to the market,&#8221; Reuters noted from the filing. &#8220;This could also result in consumer harm.&#8221;</p>
<div class="SpacingContainer__container___2kvuUN SpacingContainer__max-width___1aBoiA">
<div class="AdSlot__container___vv9J1U">
<div class="AdSlot__inner___1TrdcP">
<div>
<div id="reuters_mobile_mpu_1" class="AdSlot__slot___1GI9_W">Reuters notes that the CCI will be reviewing the case in the coming weeks before deciding whether it should run a deeper investigation or dismiss it. It typically does not publish filings during this period.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">PhonePe, one of the largest digital payments services in India, on Thursday launched <a href="https://www.phonepe.com/pulse/">Pulse</a>, a free product to offer insights into how people in the world’s second largest internet market are paying digitally.</p>
<p>And PhonePe would know: the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/phonepe-raises-700-million-becomes-a-separate-entity/">Flipkart-backed five-year-old startup</a> said its insights are based on over 22 billion transactions it has processed over the years.</p>
<p>Pulse offers an unprecedented level of understanding of the inroads digital payments and various financial services have made across Indian states, districts and over 19,000 zip codes. The new product offers a range of granular data including how many of its transactions in a state were made between users, to merchants, and to pay utility bills.</p>
<p>The startup, which has anonymized users&#8217; data, will publish new data and analysis periodically and one major report each year, it said. The startup also published its <a href="https://www.phonepe.com/pulse-static-api/static/docs/Pulse_Report_2021_M_B.pdf">maiden report</a> (PDF) Thursday.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197415" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197415" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2197415 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/phonepe-pulse.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1181" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/phonepe-pulse.jpg 2000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/phonepe-pulse.jpg?resize=150,89 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/phonepe-pulse.jpg?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/phonepe-pulse.jpg?resize=768,454 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/phonepe-pulse.jpg?resize=680,402 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/phonepe-pulse.jpg?resize=1536,907 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/phonepe-pulse.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197415" class="wp-caption-text">A look at PhonePe&#8217;s Pulse product (Screengrab)</p></div></p>
<p>PhonePe co-founder and chief executive Sameer Nigam said at a virtual conference that PhonePe is also making its insights available through an API for academics, analysts, the government, policy makers, regulatory bodies, and other players to use at no charge.</p>
<p>More than 100 million Indians have started to transact digitally in the past five years buoyed by New Delhi&#8217;s move to invalidate much of the cash in circulation in 2016 and establishment of UPI railroads by retail banks in India that offers interoperability across apps. UPI has emerged as the most popular way Indians pay digitally today and PhonePe commands more than 40% of its market share.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The sudden surge in the adoption of mobile payments has also attracted several international giants &#8212; including Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Samsung &#8212; to launch their payment offerings in the South Asian nation. India&#8217;s mobile payments market is estimated to be worth $1 trillion by 2023, according to Credit Suisse.</p>
<p>The rationale behind launching Pulse, an effort that was initially conceptualized by the startup&#8217;s communications team, is to offer clarity to people on the digital payments behavior as there have been too much unverified noise in the industry, PhonePe executives said at a virtual event Thursday.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we started PhonePe five years back, we struggled to get reliable granular data on digital payments trends across the country. We had promised ourselves that if we are successful and gather enough data on our platform, we would open it for anyone who wants to get deeper insights on the Indian payments industry. We built PhonePe Pulse because we can, and crucially because we should help unlock opportunities for others to build in India,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>When asked about potentially losing the competitive advantage, Nigam said PhonePe is publishing the data for the greater good and he encouraged other players in the industry to also take similar steps. The data could help businesses better inform their decisions, he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In Europe and the US we are very much getting used to groceries being delivered within 15 minutes, with a huge battleground of startups in the space. Startups across Europe and the US have raised no less than $3.1 billion in the last quarter alone for grocery deliveries within 10 or 20-minute delivery promises. But all are scrambling over a market where the average order size is pretty low. What if it was in the hundreds, and didn’t require refrigeration?</p>
<p>This is probably going to be the newest &#8220;15/30minute&#8221; consumer battleground, as high-end consumer goods come to last-mile deliveries.</p>
<p>The latest to Arive in this space is… <a href="https://www.getarive.com/">arive</a> – a German-based startup that delivers high-end consumer brands within 30 minutes. It’s now raised €6 million in seed funding from 468 Capital, La Famiglia VC and Balderton Capital.</p>
<p>But stacking its shelves with well-known brands and spinning up last-mile delivery logistics, Arive is offering fitness products, cosmetics, personal care, homeware, tech and fashion. Consumers order via an app, with the delivery coming via a bike-only fleet in 30-minutes or less.</p>
<p>The behavior it&#8217;s tapping into is already there. It seems the pandemic has made us all work and play from home, leaving foot traffic in inner cities still below pre-Covid levels.</p>
<p>Arive says it works directly with brands to offer a selection of their products for on-demand delivery, offering them a new distribution channel to a new type of customer that wants speed and convenience.</p>
<p>arive is currently available in Munich and has recently launched in Berlin, Frankfurt, and Hamburg. The 30-minute delivery guarantee means it doesn’t need as many micro fulfillment centers as grocery players, helping it to keep infrastructure costs low.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Maximilian Reeker, co-founder of arive, said: “While the space for hyper-fast grocery delivery is increasingly crowded, we found the brands we love are still stuck in a three-day delivery scheme. For today’s time-poor consumers, this is too long.”</p>
<p>Bardo Droege, investor at 468 Capital, commented: “Our cities are dynamic, fast-moving places, and people living there want the tools and services that reflect their lifestyles so it’s no wonder the 15-minute groceries category has taken off so quickly. We’re confident the arive team will take this on.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://riseconf.com/">RISE</a>, one of Asia’s largest tech conferences, is returning to Hong Kong in March 2022 as an in-person event, and will be held there for at least five years, announced organizer Web Summit today. Last year, Web Summit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/web-summit-will-hold-rise-2022-in-kuala-lumpur-launch-a-new-event-in-tokyo/">said RISE would move to Kuala Lumpur,</a> but its return to Hong Kong means the conference will no longer be held in Malaysia’s capital, though a spokesperson told TechCrunch that it is plans to host other events there in the future.</p>
<p>RISE will take place at the AsiaWorld-Expo from March 14 to 17, 2022.</p>
<p>In November 2019, while large pro-democracy demonstrations were taking place, Web Summit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/15/rise-conference-2020-2021/">announced it was postponing RISE to 2021</a>. Then in December 2020, it said that the 2021 event would not be held, and RISE would instead resume in Kuala Lumpur in 2022.</p>
<p>In an emailed statement, a RISE spokesperson told TechCrunch, “The political situation in Hong Kong did not impact our decision to consider Kuala Lumpur as a host city. Rise 2022 was originally meant to take place in Kuala Lumpur. However, this is no longer feasible. We would like to thank the MDEC, who invited us to host RISE in their wonderful city,” adding “RISE has already had five successful years in Hong Kong since its launch in 2015. Our long-standing relationship with the city made it a natural decision to stay.”</p>
<p>In Web Summit’s announcement, co-founder and chief executive officer Paddy Cosgrove said, “We are extremely grateful for the support the city of Hong Kong has given RISE over the last five years, and we couldn’t be more excited to return in-person in 2022.”</p>
<p>The announcement included a statement from Hong Kong’s secretary for commerce and economic development, Edward Yau, who said, “I’m very excited that RISE, the world-renowned tech event, has chosen to return to Hong Kong and stay here in the coming five years.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Market research and insights are often underutilized assets for enterprises but it’s usually too hard to find content and there’s a lot of duplication, or information isn’t used well.</p>
<p>Swedish startup Stravito says it can centralize internal and external data sources and create something more akin to a &#8216;Spotify or Netflix&#8217; for these kinds of assets, making them far more usable and consumable, they say.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clearly onto <em>something</em>, since it&#8217;s now raised a €12.4million ($14.6million USD) series A funding round led by Endeit Capital, with additional investment from existing investors HenQ, Inventure and  Creades. To date, Stravito has raised €20.1million ($23.7million USD).</p>
<p>Founded in 2017 by market research veterans and former iZettle employees, Stravito counts among its customers Carlsberg, Edwards Lifesciences, Pepsi Lipton, Danone, Electrolux and Comcast.</p>
<p>Thor Olof Philogène, CEO and co-founder at Stravito said: &#8220;It has never been more important for the world’s largest enterprises to understand and react to their customer’s changing behaviors using centralized, vetted company insights. Stravito’s technology and platform makes it fast and easy for companies to use research to make better decisions.”</p>
<p>On a call with me he added: “We provide a search technology, and a great design, all combined to deliver an intuitive, highly automated cloud service that allows these big companies to centralise internal and external data sources so they can pull out the nuggets they need.”</p>
<p>Jelle-Jan Bruinsma, Partner at Endeit Capital, added: “Endeit Capital is always looking for the next generation of  international software scale-ups, and Stravito stood out in the Nordics through its impressive work to raise the bar in the multibillion dollar market research and data industry.”<br />
Stravito also appointed Elaine Rodrigo, Chief Insights &amp; Analytics Officer at Reckitt Benckiser, to its board of directors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

					<description><![CDATA[Stockeld Chunk is made using fermented legumes, which gives the cheese a feta-like look and feel and contains 30% protein.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Cheese is one of those foods that when you like it, you actually love it. It’s also one of the most difficult foods to make from something other than milk. <a href="https://www.stockeld.com/">Stockeld Dreamery</a> not only took that task on, it has a product to show for it.</p>
<p>The Stockholm-based company announced Thursday its Series A round of $20 million co-led by Astanor Ventures and Northzone. Joining them in the round — which founder Sorosh Tavakoli told TechCrunch he thought was “the largest-ever Series A round for a European plant-based alternatives startup,” was Gullspång Re:food, Eurazeo, Norrsken VC, Edastra, Trellis Road and angel investors David Frenkiel and Alexander Ljung.</p>
<p>Tavakoli previously founded video advertising startup Videoplaza, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/20/ooyala-buys-euro-video-ad-startup-videoplaza-in-its-first-acquisition/">sold it to Ooyala in 2014</a>. Looking for his next project, he said he did some soul-searching and wanted the next company to do something with an environmental impact. He ended up in the world of food, plant-based food, in particular.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="BrJ4ofjCca"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/20/ooyala-buys-euro-video-ad-startup-videoplaza-in-its-first-acquisition/">Ooyala Buys Euro Video Ad Startup Videoplaza In Its First Acquisition</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ooyala Buys Euro Video Ad Startup Videoplaza In Its First Acquisition&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/20/ooyala-buys-euro-video-ad-startup-videoplaza-in-its-first-acquisition/embed/#?secret=BrJ4ofjCca" data-secret="BrJ4ofjCca" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Removing the animal has a huge impact on land, water, greenhouse gases, not to mention the factory farming,” he told TechCrunch. “I identified that cheese is the worst. However, though people are keen on shifting their diet, when they try alternative products, they don’t like it.”</p>
<p>Tavakoli then went in search of a co-founder with a science background and met Anja Leissner, whose background is in biotechnology and food science. Together they started Stockeld in 2019.</p>
<p>Pär-Jörgen Pärson, general partner at Northzone, was an investor in Videoplaza and said via email that Stockeld Dreamery was the result of “the best of technology paired with the best of science,” and that Tavakoli and Leissner were “using their scientific knowledge and vision of the future and proposing a commercial application, which is very rare in the foodtech space, if not unique.”</p>
<p>The company’s first product, Stockeld Chunk, <a href="https://medium.com/stockeld-dreamery-blog/launching-our-first-product-may-6-welcome-behind-the-scenes-7b9830def100">launched</a> in May, but not without some trials and tribulations. The team tested over 1,000 iterations of their “cheese” product before finding a combination that worked, Tavakoli said.</p>
<p>Advances in the plant-based milk category have been successful for the most part, not necessarily because of the plant-based origins, but because they are tasty, he explained. Innovation is also progressing in meat, but cheese still proved difficult.</p>
<p>“They are typically made from starch and coconut oil, so you can have a terrible experience from the smell and the mouth feel can be rubbery, plus there is no protein,” Tavakoli added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Stockeld wanted protein as the core ingredient, so Chunk is made using fermented legumes — pea and fava in this case — which gives the cheese a feta-like look and feel and contains 30% protein.</p>
<p>Chunk was initially launched with restaurants and chefs in Sweden. Within the product pipeline are spreadable and melting cheese that Tavakoli expects to be on the market in the next 12 months. Melting cheese is one of the hardest to make, but would open up the company as a potential pizza ingredient if successful, he said.</p>
<p>Including the latest round, Stockeld has raised just over $24 million to date. The company started with four employees and has now grown to 23, and Tavakoli intends for that to be 50 by the end of next year.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="jUbOEqtAyY"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/plant-based-meat-startups-china/">Chinese startups rush to bring alternative protein to people&#8217;s plates</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Chinese startups rush to bring alternative protein to people&#8217;s plates&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/05/plant-based-meat-startups-china/embed/#?secret=jUbOEqtAyY" data-secret="jUbOEqtAyY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The new funding will enable the company to focus on R&amp;D, to build out a pilot plant and to move into a new headquarters building next year in Stockholm. The company also looks to expand out of Sweden and into the U.S.</p>
<p>“We have ambitious investors who understand what we are trying to do,” Tavakoli said. “We have an opportunity to think big and plan accordingly. We feel we are in a category of our own in a sense that we are using legumes for protein. We are almost like a third fermented legumes category, and it is exciting to see where we can take it.”</p>
<p>Eric Archambeau, co-founder and partner at Astanor Ventures, is one of those investors. He also met Tavakoli at his former company and said via email that when he was pitched on the idea of creating “the next generation of plant-based cheese,” he was interested.</p>
<p>“From the start, I have been continuously impressed by the Stockeld team’s diligence, determination and commitment to creating a truly revolutionary and delicious product,” Archambeau added. “They created a product that breaks the mold and paves the way towards a new future for the global cheese industry.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.cajoo.eu">Cajoo</a> is raising some money in order to compete more aggressively in the new and highly competitive category of food delivery companies. Interestingly, the lead investor in today’s funding round is Carrefour, the supermarket giant. Headline (formerly e.ventures) is also participating in the round as well as existing investors Frst and XAnge.</p>
<p>Carrefour’s investment isn’t just a financial investment. Cajoo will take advantage of Carrefour’s purchasing organization. This way, Cajoo will be able to offer more products to its customers.</p>
<p>Cajoo is part of a group of startups that try to create a whole new category of grocery deliveries. The company operates dark stores and manages its own inventory of products. Customers can then order items without having to think whether they’ll be home when the delivery happens. Around 15 minutes later, a delivery person shows up with your groceries.</p>
<p>The startup competes with <a href="https://getir.com">Getir</a>, <a href="https://gorillas.io">Gorillas</a>, <a href="https://www.goflink.com">Flink</a>, <a href="https://tryzapp.com">Zapp</a> and a few others. It also indirectly competes with traditional retailers and their online ordering systems.</p>
<p>“It’s a category that is incredibly capital intensive,” co-founder and CEO Henri Capoul told me. “We own the entire value chain. If we want to expand, we have to launch hubs, we have to buy products.”</p>
<p>With $40 million on its bank account, Cajoo now wants to solidify its strong market position in its home country. The service is currently live in 10 French cities — Paris, Neuilly-sur-Seine, Levallois-Perret, Boulogne-Billancourt, Lille, Lyon, Toulouse, Bordeaux and Montpellier.</p>
<p>And yet, the company is already facing some competition in Paris for instance. But Henri Capoul sees it as market validation. “There are a lot of players that have raised a lot of money. But it’s a regulated market. We own all our products and we have to comply with regulation. We can’t sell everything at a loss,” he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While Henri Capoul expects some sort of consolidation down the road, the company is doing everything to remain a big, independent company. “European champions will be national champions first. Right now, some players can overcome a lack of products with discounts. I’m convinced that the future of this category will be represented by three or four local players that are strong in other countries.” Henri Capoul said.</p>
<p>Cajoo is currently the only French company operating at this scale in this category. So it’s clear that the company sees itself as a market leader in France first. But the company is already looking at other markets as well — Belgium, Italy, Spain, maybe Portugal or Eastern Europe countries.</p>
<p>But first, the company wants to grow its team. The number of employees working in the HQ is going to double by the end of the year. Operations and delivery teams will also grow quite drastically. The company expects a fivefold increase by the end of the year on this front.</p>
<p>Some delivery people are directly hired by Cajoo. But the company is also relying on partners — both contracting companies and freelancers. So the company faces some of the challenges that Deliveroo and Uber Eats also face.</p>
<p>Cajoo might be a great business idea, but users will have to ask themselves whether it really solves an important need or they’re just using it because it exists. Instant delivery companies could have a real impact on brick-and-mortar shops over the long run.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey gave a coalition of app-based service providers like Uber and Lyft the go-ahead to start collecting signatures needed to put a proposed ballot measure before voters that would define drivers as independent contractors rather than employees.</p>
<p>Backers of the initiative, which is essentially a MA version of Proposition 22, would need to gather tens of thousands of signatures for the measure to make it to the November 2022 ballot. Despite the fact that last year <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-lawsuit-massachusetts/massachusetts-judge-allows-state-lawsuit-over-uber-lyft-driver-status-to-proceed-idUSKBN2BH3JX">Healey filed a lawsuit</a> that challenged Uber and Lyft&#8217;s classifications of drivers as contractors who are therefore not entitled to benefits like sick leave, overtime or minimum wage, on Wednesday, the AG certified the current measure met constitutional requirements.</p>
<p>The news comes nearly two weeks after a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/californias-gig-worker-prop-22-ruled-unconstitutional-by-superior-court/"> superior court judged ruled California&#8217;s Prop 22</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/07/human-capital-the-gig-economy-in-a-post-prop-22-world/">which was passed in 2020</a>, unconstitutional. The union-backed Coalition to Protect Workers&#8217; Rights urged Healey to reject the measure under the same grounds, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/companies-backed-massachusetts-gig-worker-ballot-measure-clears-key-hurdle-2021-09-01/">told Reuters</a> that it is considering suing to challenge the measure.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Coalition for Independent Work, the coalition of members including Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Instacart, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/gig-companies-take-worker-classification-fight-to-massachusetts-through-ballot-initiative/">filed the petition for this ballot initiative last month</a>, a move that<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/04/uber-ceo-calls-massachusetts-gig-economy-ballot-measure-the-right-answer/?preview_id=2185936"> Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said</a> he thinks is &#8220;the right move.&#8221; The proposed initiative would also allow drivers to earn a minimum of $18 per hour in 2023 before tips and provide those who work for at least 15 hours per week with healthcare stipends. Drivers would also be guaranteed at least 26 cents per mile to cover vehicle upkeep and gas.</p>
<p>The coalition has until December 1 to collect and file 80,239 signatures from voters. If they miss that deadline, they can gather an additional 13,374 signatures by July 6, 2022 to get the initiative on the ballot.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has reached a settlement with the Japanese regulator to allow developers of “reader” apps to link to their own websites for users to manage their accounts. The change goes to effect in early 2022.</p>
<p>Apple has been facing scrutiny in multiple markets, including the US and South Korea, over how it mandates its own payment systems for developers, with critics accusing it of anti-competitive practices.</p>
<p>In this latest development, the settlement in Japan, from the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC), will mandate Apple to make a change its polices on the reader apps so that users of purchase content. Reader apps include not just apps for reading, but any app that accesses &#8220;purchased&#8221; or subscribed media in the cloud for app users to consume. It covers digital magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music, and video and the list includes the likes of Netflix, Spotify, Audible and Dropbox.</p>
<p>Before the change goes into effect next year, Apple will continue to update its guidelines and review process for users of readers apps, according to its statement.</p>
<p>Apple will also apply this change globally to all reader apps on the store.</p>
<p>“We have great respect for the Japan Fair Trade Commission and appreciate the work we’ve done together, which will help developers of reader apps make it easier for users to set up an manage their apps and service, while protecting their privacy and maintaining their trust,” Phill Schiller, who oversees the App Stores at Apple.</p>
<p>Apple seems to be taking the scrutiny it&#8217;s facing among lawmakers, developers and the public on board. Last week, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-will-now-let-app-store-developers-talk-to-their-customers-about-buying-direct/">announced</a> several updates that allow developers more flexibility for their customers, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/apple-lowers-commissions-on-in-app-purchases-for-news-publishers-who-participate-in-apple-news/">the company also launched a News Partner Program to support local journalist.</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Although developers and others have been crying foul for years over restrictive app store practices, Apple has long maintained that it puts its policies in place for the protection of consumers and to create more consistent user experiences.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, as technology, payment systems, and consumer habits have evolved, those criticisms have only grown louder. In that regard, Asia and the US are not the only markets where lawmakers are finally starting to take more action around the issue. In Australia, the Competitions and Consumer Commission is also considering regulations around digital payment systems &#8211; rules that would impact not just Apple, but also other dominant players like Google and WeChat.</p>
<p>And just this week, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/south-korea-passes-anti-google-law-bill-to-curb-google-apple-in-app-payment-commission/">South Korea became the first country to curb Apple and Google from imposting their own payment system on in-app purchases.</a></p>
<p>Apple has more than 30 million registered developers building iOS apps.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">From beaming actors into the class room to plucking things out of space, the second day of Y Combinator’s S21 Demo Day was a fresh snapshot of what nearly 200 startup teams believe is the future of innovation.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the TechCrunch team <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/here-are-all-the-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day-part-1/">covered the first half of this batch,</a> as well as the startups with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/our-favorite-startups-from-ycs-summer-21-demo-day-part-1/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29">one-minute pitches that stood out to us</a>. We even<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/y-combinator-s-21-equity/?tpcc=ECTW2020"> podcasted about it!</a> Today, we’re doing it all over again. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/here-are-all-the-companies-from-day-two-of-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day/">Here’s our full list of all startups</a> that presented on the record today, and below, you’ll find our votes for the best Y Combinator pitches of Day Two. The ones that, as people who sift through a few hundred pitches a day, made us go &#8220;oh wait, what&#8217;s this?&#8221;</p>
<h2>Spark Studio</h2>
<p>My experience with Indian culture is that it has a long history of valuing math and science over any other subject, which is why <a href="https://sparkstudio.co/">Spark Studio</a>’s twist on online enrichment was refreshing. The YC company offers live, extracurricular learning classes for kids in Indian households — with a twist: The classes are about music, art and communication. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/14/outschool-series-c-unicorn/">As seen by the success of Outschool,</a> small-group classes for school-going children can be a scalable way to supplement traditional education. Spark Studio is selling to kids between the ages of 5 to 15, which are highly impressionable, exploratory years.</p>
<p>Growing up, I was the only kid in my predominantly Indian family friend group who didn’t gravitate toward STEM. There were no services, other than the local library, to quench my interest in writing and reading. A service like Spark, if it gains the trust of parents, has the potential to make currently unconventional interests more conventional. And with over 400 students, and less than 2% churn, Spark Studio has early inklings it may be onto something. — Natasha</p>
<h2>Litnerd</h2>

<p>The best books don’t feel like homework, they feel like trips into another universe and hangouts with characters that could be friends. <a href="https://litnerd.com/">Litnerd</a> is trying to scale the feeling of immersive, engaging text to millions of students, while also encouraging better literacy and habit-forming skills. The startup has works read and enacted by actors, making classroom reading into a more entertaining experience for school-age children.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the U.K., a 12-month grace period for compliance with <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-data-protection-themes/age-appropriate-design-a-code-of-practice-for-online-services/code-standards/">a design code</a> aimed at protecting children online expires today &#8212; meaning app makers offering digital services in the market which are &#8220;likely&#8221; to be accessed by children (defined in this context as users under 18 years old) are expected to comply with a set of standards intended to safeguard kids from being tracked and profiled.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-data-protection-themes/age-appropriate-design-code/">Age Appropriate Design Code</a> (aka the &#8216;Children&#8217;s Code&#8217;) came into force on September 2 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/uk-watchdog-sets-out-age-appropriate-design-code-for-online-services-to-keep-kids-privacy-safe/">last year</a> however the U.K.&#8217;s data protection watchdog, the ICO, allowed the maximum grace period for hitting compliance to give organizations time to adapt their services.</p>
<p>But from today it expects the standards of the code to be met.</p>
<p>Services where the code applies can include connected toys and games and edtech but also online retail and for-profit online services such as social media and video sharing platforms which have a strong pull for minors.</p>
<p>Among the code&#8217;s stipulations are that a level of &#8220;high privacy&#8221; should be applied to settings by default if the user is (or is suspected to be) a child &#8212; including specific provisions that geolocation and profiling should be off by default (unless there&#8217;s a compelling justification for such privacy hostile defaults).</p>
<p>The code also instructs app makers to provide parental controls while also providing the child with age-appropriate information about such tools &#8212; warning against parental tracking tools that could be used to silently/invisibly monitor a child without them being made aware of the active tracking.</p>
<p>Another standard takes aim at dark pattern design &#8212; with a warning to app makers against using &#8220;nudge techniques&#8221; to push children to provide &#8220;unnecessary personal data or weaken or turn off their privacy protections.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-data-protection-themes/age-appropriate-design-code/">full code</a> contains 15 standards but is not itself baked into legislation &#8212; rather it&#8217;s a set of design recommendations the ICO wants app makers to follow.</p>
<p>The regulatory stick to make them do so is that the watchdog is explicitly linking compliance with its children&#8217;s privacy standards to passing muster with wider data protection requirements that are baked into U.K. law.</p>
<p>The risk for apps that ignore the standards is thus that they draw the attention of the watchdog &#8212; either through a complaint or proactive investigation &#8212; with the potential of a wider ICO audit delving into their whole approach to privacy and data protection.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will monitor conformance to this code through a series of proactive audits, will consider complaints, and take appropriate action to enforce the underlying data protection standards, subject to applicable law and in line with our Regulatory Action Policy,&#8221; the ICO writes in guidance on its website. &#8220;To ensure proportionate and effective regulation we will target our most significant powers, focusing on organisations and individuals suspected of repeated or wilful misconduct or serious failure to comply with the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>It goes on to warn it would view a lack of compliance with the kids&#8217; privacy code as a potential black mark against (enforceable) U.K. data protection laws, adding: &#8220;If you do not follow this code, you may find it difficult to demonstrate that your processing is fair and complies with the GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] or PECR [Privacy and Electronics Communications Regulation].&#8221;</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2021/08/as-the-children-s-code-comes-in-what-s-next/">blog post last week</a>, Stephen Bonner, the ICO’s executive director of regulatory futures and innovation, also warned app makers: &#8220;We will be proactive in requiring social media platforms, video and music streaming sites and the gaming industry to tell us how their services are designed in line with the code. We will identify areas where we may need to provide support or, should the circumstances require, we have powers to investigate or audit organisations.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have identified that currently, some of the biggest risks come from social media platforms, video and music streaming sites and video gaming platforms,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;In these sectors, children’s personal data is being used and shared, to bombard them with content and personalised service features. This may include inappropriate adverts; unsolicited messages and friend requests; and privacy-eroding nudges urging children to stay online. We’re concerned with a number of harms that could be created as a consequence of this data use, which are physical, emotional and psychological and financial.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Children’s rights must be respected and we expect organisations to prove that children’s best interests are a primary concern. The code gives clarity on how organisations can use children’s data in line with the law, and we want to see organisations committed to protecting children through the development of designs and services in accordance with the code,&#8221; Bonner added.</p>
<p>The ICO&#8217;s enforcement powers &#8212; at least on paper &#8212; are fairly extensive, with GDPR, for example, giving it the ability to fine infringers up to £17.5 million or 4% of their annual worldwide turnover, whichever is higher.</p>
<p>The watchdog can also issue orders banning data processing or otherwise requiring changes to services it deems non-compliant. So apps that chose to flout the children&#8217;s design code risk setting themselves up for regulatory bumps or worse.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;UK watchdog sets out &#8216;age appropriate&#8217; design code for online services to keep kids&#8217; privacy safe&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/uk-watchdog-sets-out-age-appropriate-design-code-for-online-services-to-keep-kids-privacy-safe/embed/#?secret=dpMdNG0EDj" data-secret="dpMdNG0EDj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In recent months there have been signs some major platforms have been paying mind to the ICO&#8217;s compliance deadline &#8212; with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/google-to-introduce-increased-protections-for-minors-on-its-platform-including-search-youtube-and-more/">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/12/tiktok-to-add-more-privacy-protections-for-teenaged-users-limit-push-notifications/">TikTok</a> all announcing changes to how they handle minors&#8217; data and account settings ahead of the September 2 date.</p>
<p>In July, <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/giving-young-people-a-safer-more-private-experience/">Instagram said</a> it would default teens to private accounts &#8212; doing so for under-18s in certain countries which the platform confirmed to us includes the U.K. &#8212; among a number of other child-safety focused tweaks. Then in August, Google announced similar changes for accounts on its video sharing platform, YouTube.</p>
<p>A few days later TikTok also said it would add more privacy protections for teens. Though it had also made <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/tiktok-update-will-change-privacy-settings-and-defaults-for-users-under-18/">earlier changes</a> limiting privacy defaults for under-18s.</p>
<p>Apple also recently got itself into hot water with the digital rights community following the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/interview-apples-head-of-privacy-details-child-abuse-detection-and-messages-safety-features/"> announcement of child safety-focused features</a> &#8212; including a child sexual abuse material (CSAM) detection tool which scans photo uploads to iCloud; and an opt-in parental safety feature that lets iCloud Family account users turn on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/new-apple-technology-will-warn-parents-and-children-about-sexually-explicit-photos-in-messages/">alerts related to the viewing of explicit images by minors</a> using its Messages app.</p>
<p>The unifying theme underpinning all these mainstream platform product tweaks is clearly &#8220;child protection.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while there&#8217;s been growing attention in the U.S. to online child safety and the nefarious ways in which some apps exploit kids&#8217; data &#8212; as well as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/instagrams-handling-of-kids-data-is-now-being-probed-in-the-eu/">a number of open probes in Europe</a> (such as this <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/28/eu-to-review-tiktoks-tos-after-child-safety-complaints/">Commission investigation of TikTok</a>, acting on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/tiktok-hit-with-consumer-child-safety-and-privacy-complaints-in-europe/">complaints</a>) &#8212; the U.K. may be having an outsized impact here given its concerted push to pioneer age-focused design standards.</p>
<p>The code also combines with incoming U.K. legislation which is set to apply a &#8220;duty of care&#8221; on platforms to take a broad-brush safety-first stance toward users, also with a big focus on kids (and there it&#8217;s also being broadly targeted to cover all children; rather than just applying to kids under 13 as with <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule">COPPA</a> in the U.S., for example).</p>
<p>In the blog post ahead of the compliance deadline expiring, the ICO&#8217;s Bonner sought to take credit for what he described as &#8220;significant changes&#8221; made in recent months by platforms like Facebook, Google, Instagram and TikTok, writing: &#8220;As the first of its kind, it’s also having an influence globally. Members of the U.S. Senate and Congress have called on major U.S. tech and gaming companies to voluntarily adopt the standards in the ICO’s code for children in America.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Data Protection Commission in Ireland is preparing to introduce the Children’s Fundamentals to protect children online, which links closely to the code and follows similar core principles,&#8221; he also noted.</p>
<p>And there are other examples in the EU: France&#8217;s data watchdog, the CNIL, looks to have been inspired by the ICO&#8217;s approach &#8212; issuing its own <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cnil-publishes-8-recommendations-enhance-protection-children-online">set of child-protection-focused recommendations this June</a> (which also, for example, encourage app makers to add parental controls with the clear caveat that such tools must &#8220;respect the child&#8217;s privacy and best interests&#8221;).</p>
<p>The U.K.&#8217;s focus on online child safety is not just making waves overseas but sparking growth in a domestic compliance services industry.</p>
<p>Last month, for example, the ICO announced the first clutch of <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/certification-schemes-register/">GDPR certification scheme criteria</a> &#8212; including <a href="https://www.ageappropriatedesign.accscheme.com">two schemes which focus on the age-appropriate design code</a>. Expect plenty more.</p>
<p>Bonner&#8217;s blog post also notes that the watchdog will formally set out its position on age assurance this autumn &#8212; so it will be providing further steerage to organizations which are in scope of the code on how to tackle that tricky piece, although it&#8217;s still not clear how hard a requirement the ICO will support, with Bonner suggesting it could be actually &#8220;verifying ages or age estimation.&#8221; Watch that space. Whatever the recommendations are, age assurance services are set to spring up with compliance-focused sales pitches.</p>
<p>Children&#8217;s safety online has been a huge focus for U.K. policymakers in recent years, although the wider (and long in train) Online Safety (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/08/uk-sets-out-safety-focused-plan-to-regulate-internet-firms/">neé Harms</a>) Bill remains at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/">the draft law</a> stage.</p>
<p>An earlier attempt by U.K. lawmakers to bring in mandatory age checks to prevent kids from accessing adult content websites &#8212; dating back to 2017&#8217;s Digital Economy Act &#8212; was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/uk-quietly-ditches-porn-age-checks-in-favor-of-wider-online-harms-rules/">dropped in 2019</a> after widespread criticism that it would be both unworkable and a massive privacy risk for adult users of porn.</p>
<p>But the government did not drop its determination to find a way to regulate online services in the name of child safety. And online a<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ge verification checks look set to be &#8212; if not a blanket, hardened requirement for all digital services &#8212; increasingly brought in by the backdoor, through a sort of &#8220;recommended feature&#8221; creep (as the <a href="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/blog/age-verification-in-the-online-safety-bill/">ORG has warned</a>). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The current recommendation in the age appropriate design code is that app makers &#8220;ta</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">ke a risk-based approach to recognising the age of individual users and ensure you effectively apply the standards in this code to child users,&#8221; suggesting they: &#8220;Either establish age with a level of certainty that is appropriate to the risks to the rights and freedoms of children that arise from your data processing, or apply the standards in this code to all your users instead.&#8221; </span></p>
<p>At the same time, the government&#8217;s broader push on online safety risks conflicting with some of the laudable aims of the ICO&#8217;s non-legally binding children&#8217;s privacy design code.</p>
<p>For instance, while the code includes the (welcome) suggestion that digital services gather as little information about children as possible, in an announcement <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/uk-tells-messaging-apps-not-to-use-e2e-encryption-for-kids-accounts/">earlier this summer</a> U.K. lawmakers put out guidance for social media platforms and messaging services &#8212; ahead of the planned Online Safety legislation &#8212; that recommends they <em>prevent</em> children from being able to use end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right; the government&#8217;s advice to data-mining platforms &#8212; which it suggests will help prepare them for requirements in the incoming legislation &#8212; is <em>not</em> to use &#8220;gold standard&#8221; security and privacy (E2E encryption) for kids.</p>
<p>So the official U.K. government messaging to app makers appears to be that, in short order, the law will require commercial services to access <em>more</em> of kids&#8217; information, not less &#8212; in the name of keeping them &#8220;safe.&#8221; Which is quite a contradiction versus the data minimization push on the design code.</p>
<p>The risk is that a tightening spotlight on kids privacy ends up being fuzzed and complicated by ill-thought-through policies that push platforms to monitor kids to demonstrate &#8220;protection&#8221; from a smorgasbord of online harms &#8212; be it adult content or pro-suicide postings, or cyberbullying and CSAM.</p>
<p>The law looks set to encourage platforms to &#8216;show their workings&#8217; to prove compliance &#8212; which risks resulting in ever-closer tracking of children&#8217;s activity, retention of data &#8212; and maybe risk profiling and age verification checks (that could even end up being applied to all users; think sledgehammer to crack a nut). In short, a privacy dystopia.</p>
<p>Such mixed messages and disjointed policymaking seem set to pile increasingly confusing &#8212; and even conflicting &#8212; requirements on digital services operating in the U.K., making tech businesses legally responsible for divining clarity amid the policy mess &#8212; with the simultaneous risk of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/uk-online-harms-bill-coming-next-year-will-propose-fines-of-up-to-10-of-annual-turnover-for-breaching-duty-of-care-rules/">huge fines if they get the balance wrong</a>.</p>
<p>Complying with the ICO&#8217;s design standards may therefore actually be the easy bit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to TechCrunch’s continuing coverage of Y Combinator’s Summer 2021 Demo Day! This is Day Two. If you haven’t caught up yet on what happened during the first day, you <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/here-are-all-the-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day-part-1/">can read our recap of all the presenting companies here</a>, our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/here-are-all-the-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day-part-1/">favorites from that first set here, </a>and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/y-combinator-s-21-equity/">a quick podcast </a>about all of the above.</p>
<p>Today we’re back in the action, listening to a few hundred rapid-fire pitches throughout the day. What follows are short overviews of each company based on their one-minute pitch. Elsewhere on the site we’ll soon have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/our-favorite-startups-from-ycs-summer-21-demo-day-part-2/">our Day Two favorites</a> for you to enjoy, so be on the lookout for that!</p>
<h2>Day Two companies</h2>
<p><a href="https://intellect.co">Intellect</a>: A mental healthcare service that provides teletherapy for employers in Asia. They&#8217;ve also got a free consumer app at the top of the funnel that has seen 2.5 million users since launching a year ago. The company says it&#8217;s grown to $500,000 ARR in the last six months.</p>
<p><a href="https://mazumago.com">MazumaGo</a>: Banking and electronics payment service for construction companies. MazumaGo aims to help this antiquated industry move off of traditional banking and into a unified ledger. The banking infrastructure product puts credit and debit cards into customer hands, starting in the United States.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pandai.org">Pandai</a>: Pandai is helping kids in elementary/high school in Southeast Asia boost their grades with a learning app that replaces take-home workbooks. With more than 1,600 paying subscribers using the app for almost an hour a day, Pandai may be on its way to helping thousands more get the A.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.shoplocale.com">Locale</a>: Think that DoorDash doesn’t have enough food options? Locale is betting that some folks want more options and are willing to pay for that access. The startup wants to help restaurants sell farther from their operations, and its model is showing some early traction. The company’s revenue (GMV, perhaps) scaled from $145,500 in July to $192,000 in August. The startup claims 70% retention month to month and an average order of just over $100.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.projectarrow.co/">Arrow</a>: Arrow is building one-click-checkout-payment infrastructure for online sellers in Southeast Asia aiming to boost social commerce among small sellers. The team behind Arrow helped launch GrabPay and has already scaled GMV at the startup to $150,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.talentdrop.com/">Talentdrop</a>: A hiring marketplace where open jobs are posted with &#8220;bounties.&#8221; If someone you refer is ultimately hired and stays a while, you get the bounty. The company says that $1 million in bounties have been posted to the site thus far.</p>
<p><a href="http://infina.vn">Infina</a>: A retail investing app aiming to be the Robinhood of Vietnam. Since launch in January, Infina has reached over $2.5 million in assets under management. Its first focus was breaking open mutual funds and fixed-income products, and now it wants to head into stocks and crypto for its younger user base.</p>
<p><a href="https://blackoak.tv">BlackOakTV</a>: Black millennials are bigger consumers of streaming content than other demographics, but comparatively little of that content is made with them in mind. Black Oak TV is a subscription streaming service by and for Black creators and stars — could the next Dave Chappelle or Issa Rae come from here instead of YouTube or TikTok?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.heo-robotics.com/">HEO Robotics</a>: This startup wants to leverage unused time on existing satellites that monitor the planet to find stuff in space. Not trash, like <a href="https://turionspace.com">the startup that presented yesterday</a> that wants to clean up space around Earth, but things like other satellites. HEO says that it is selling to the Australian government, and executed a live in-orbit demo during Y Combinator. There are going to be many more satellites in space over time, the company says, which could boost demand for its service.</p>
<p><a href="https://getgallery.co">Gallery </a>: Gallery is building a platform to help developers quickly create self-stage staging environments, saving time and energy. The founding team has experience from Facebook and Goldman Sachs and hopes to tackle what it believes is a $5 billion market for mid-sized engineering teams alone.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197308" style="width: 631px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197308" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2197308 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adra.jpg" alt="" width="621" height="476" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adra.jpg 621w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adra.jpg?resize=150,115 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adra.jpg?resize=300,230 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adra.jpg?resize=50,38 50w" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197308" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Adra</p></div></p>
<p><a href="https://www.adra.ai">Adra</a>: AI to help dentists find cavities they might otherwise miss. It can also convert fuzzy X-rays into something a bit easier for patients to understand. Currently in a pilot with 20 dentists.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tantl.com/">Tantl</a>: Low-code APIs are hot, and a team of Google and Apple engineers are building Tantl to make it speedy, too. Tantl enables developers to build faster internal workflows — for $20 bucks a seat. Think skipping repetitive code, easy authentication and customer user interfaces. The SaaS business launched last week and has onboarded three customers.</p>
<p><a href="https://titipku.com">Titipku</a>: A huge amount of people in Indonesia want to do their local shopping online like so many of us already do, and Titipku is ready to make it happen. They&#8217;re &#8220;Instacart for Indonesia&#8221; and that&#8217;s that. Sales are already popping and the model is proven, so let&#8217;s just offer a preemptive congratulations on their success.</p>
<p><a href="https://goflok.com/">Flok</a>: Flok is building what it describes as an Airbnb for corporate offsites. That means the startup is helping connect companies looking to host some IRL activities with a location that will be suitable. In a remote-first area, heading into a remote-friendly future, companies may spend more time and money bringing staff together sporadically. Flok wants to help those events come together. Per the startup, it takes around 15% of bookings and has booked 45 events so far worth around $200,000 in revenue.</p>
<p><a href="https://sparkstudio.co">Spark Studio</a>: The team at Spark Studio is building a hub for online extracurricular courses designed for kids, reflecting the COVID-era changes to how kids learn on the web. The team is particularly focused on music, art and communication skills, hoping to streamline the wide offerings of the internet into a platform where high-quality, vetted content lives.</p>
<p><a href="https://hello.brightreps.com/">BrightReps</a>: A no-code tool meant to help you shift your company&#8217;s customer response workflows from flowcharts/spreadsheets into something more easily updated and iterated upon. Founder Brittani Dunlap says the company is profitable with $740,000 in ARR.</p>
<p><a href="https://verihubs.com">Verihubs</a>: Indonesia has a thriving fintech sector, with hundreds of startups and the well-known unicorn Gojek. Verihubs is launching a data and verification platform for regional fintechs to do stuff like authenticate customer identities and access financial data. The service has landed 45 customers, fueling $41,000 in monthly revenue.</p>
<p><a href="https://getaleph.com/">Aleph</a>: A lot of banks, fintechs, and other companies want to use the latest financial models but also prefer to rely on the good old spreadsheet. Aleph allows ordinary spreadsheets in Excel or Google Sheets to have specialized financial tools built right in and always up to date. The best of both worlds, if you really love spreadsheets and financial models!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sirka.io/">Sirka</a>: Noom is now so big that startups are looking to take its model to new markets. Sirka is one such company, with a focus on the Southeast Asian region. The startup wants to replicate Noom’s science-first approach to weight control, noting that there are 150 million overweight or obese folks in the SEA area. The startup also noted that its users lose 4% of their weight on average. Is that a lot? For me (Alex) at around 160 pounds, that would be around 6.4 pounds.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.watu.email/">Watu</a>: Watu wants to help retailers close the sale they almost made. The platform is building a shopping workflow that lives inside emails and allows shoppers to make a purchase without getting tossed back to the mobile web.</p>
<p><a href="https://stownest.com">Stownest</a>: On-demand, full-service storage spaces for India. They pack up your stuff, store it and bring it back when you need it. The company says it&#8217;s helped over 12,000 customers so far, handling over 20,000 pickups/deliveries.</p>
<p><a href="https://trycomet.com">Comet Health</a>: A digital physical therapy platform that combines telehealth with video-based curriculum. Comet Health is launching with a focus on pelvic floor physical therapy and already ran a proof-of-concept pilot in Virginia.</p>
<p><a href="https://lemonade.finance">Lemonade Finance</a>: Africa&#8217;s banking system is evolving quickly, as we&#8217;ve seen from other startups in this batch. Lemonade Finance is a consequence of that — a bank for the millions of Africans who have left for other shores but still need to interact with accounts or people at home, send or receive money and so on. Having encountered this problem themselves, the founders built Lemonade Finance to make it simpler for the African Diaspora to bank abroad.</p>
<p><a href="http://parallel.bio">Parallel Bio</a>: Coming up with ideas for new pharma products, testing them on non-humans and later scaling up to testing on our species takes a long time and is expensive. Parallel Bio claims to have created a human immune system in a petri dish, which can help with testing new drugs sans using humans on the front lines of testing. As with all biotech concerns, I (Alex) struggle to vet the company’s possibilities of a tech breakthrough, but the concept here is very neat.</p>
<p><a href="https://atmana.org/">Atmana</a>: The team at Atmana is building a platform to help 15-30-year-olds break technology addictions, specifically addictions to gaming, porn and social media. The company is taking a serious approach with its $90 per year treatment plans, which combine support groups, accountability and education.</p>
<p><a href="https://floatpay.com">Float</a>: Supply chain finance — in other words, they pay for your inventory upfront, you pay them back as it sells. Float co-founder Rob LaFave previously co-founded/sold Foodzie, while co-founder Zack Kim was the CTO of Zaarly. Float says they&#8217;ve deployed $50,000 in advances to five customers so far.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kitchenful.com/">Kitchenful</a>: Led by a former Hellofresh executive, Kitchenful thinks that grocery delivery’s commidification means it’s time for new innovation. The app gives users personalized recommendations for recipes — and then delivers the ingredients straight from a local grocery store. The team has landed partnerships with Walmart, Kroger, Target and REWE for logistics, and has launched in one city so far.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197319" style="width: 993px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197319" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2197319 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/transastra.jpg" alt="" width="983" height="521" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/transastra.jpg 983w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/transastra.jpg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/transastra.jpg?resize=300,159 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/transastra.jpg?resize=768,407 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/transastra.jpg?resize=680,360 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/transastra.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 983px) 100vw, 983px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197319" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TransAstra</p></div></p>
<p><a href="https://www.transastracorp.com">TransAstra Corporation</a>: Space tugs are a hot item in space: small spacecraft that help get other spacecraft where they need to go. TransAstra, from a former Momentus CEO, is using a new, super efficient &#8220;solar thermal rocket engine&#8221; that he says accomplishes this type of mission better than anything out there. With millions in NASA money and hundreds of millions in LOIs, MOUs and contracts, TransAstra sounds like it&#8217;s well on its way to being the biggest name in space tugs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.comadre.com.br">Comadre</a>: Nubank won’t control the entire Brazilian neobanking market if Comadre gets its way. The company is building a new digital bank for low-income families, a group of folks that it says have to pool their funds together to pay bills on time, so they need new tech. The startup intends to charge $8 per family per month, in addition to generating interchange incomes. Of course, fintech is a competitive market, but if Comadre can land a customer base, its revenue story writes itself.</p>
<p><a href="https://trytoku.com/">Toku</a>: The startup helps subscription companies collect revenues in Latin America where 15% of recurring charges fail. While traditional options rely on collection agencies, Toku taps cross-channel outreach to connect with subscribers and get them back in the fold.</p>
<p><a href="http://makaniscience.net/">Makani Science</a>: This team has built what it says is the &#8220;world&#8217;s first wireless patch that can accurately and continuously monitor breathing.&#8221; Co-founder Michael Chu says the company expects to get FDA clearance within a year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.verde.agr.br">Verde</a>: Small and medium-sized farms in Brazil may now have a new favorite credit card. Verde is a fintech platform that wants to make it easier for farmers to request and access loans. Beyond credit cards, Verde’s services include insurance and digital banks.</p>
<p><a href="https://anakin.company">Anakin</a>: Every e-commerce site wants to know exactly how every other e-commerce site is pricing the same goods, but it&#8217;s not always easy to do this systematically and comprehensively. Anakin fills this role, monitoring competing platforms for their clients and providing real-time pricing data so it can be undercut or otherwise responded to in order to snatch up that customer. With three &#8220;multibillion-dollar&#8221; companies paying half a million bucks a year already, Anakin seems well on its way to success. And maybe it&#8217;ll save you a few bucks as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://tagme.pk/">TAG</a>: Tag is building a neobank for Pakistan, a market that it claims features 100 million unbanked individuals out of a population of 250 million. The startup said that it is working with employers to help employees get their wages deposited into their TAG account instead of being handed out in cash. The company has local regulatory approval and is live in its market with a debit card product.</p>
<p><a href="https://firstignite.com">FirstIgnite</a>: The team is building a marketplace that pairs companies with university experts to tackle challenges they&#8217;re facing. The team already has pilots with University of Chicago and Carnegie Mellon, among others.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.perfekto.mx/">Perfekto</a>: Pitched as &#8220;Imperfect Foods for Latin America,&#8221; Perfekto delivers a subscription box of tasty-but-not-necessarily-pretty produce. Co-founder Anahí Sosa previously led the rollout of Uber Grocery in Latin America, and says Perfekto is currently seeing $8,000 in monthly revenue.</p>
<p><a href="https://sfatherapeutics.com/">SFA Therapeutics</a>: As digital health matures, SFA Therapeutics is the latest to pitch a new focus on treating the root cause of disease, instead of suppressing symptoms for momentary relief. The team is betting on an oral solution for the over 100 million patients who suffer from autoimmune diseases (and who currently deal with painful injections as a mainstream solution). The therapeutics company has a Phase 1B trial underway and referenced “strong clinical data” on their drug’s use in combating psoriasis.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.levo.mx">Levo</a>: Levo is supercharged savings accounts in Mexico, providing up to three times the average yield (6.5% vs. 2.1%) by combining customers’ accounts and negotiating better deals with the banks and other financial organizations they work with. It&#8217;s a smart idea in use around the world but apparently not for individual savings accounts in Mexico — for now!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.laudable.com">Laudable</a>: The B2B sales process needs to move past the PDF world, Laudable reckons. The startup wants to help its customers find and share videos of their customers using their product to share instead of written testimonials. We have some questions about how its product works, but the startup scaled from $0 to $27,000 in MRR in two months, so it appears to be onto something. Also sales tech tools have raised quite a lot of money in the last year, so there’s likely appetite for Laudable.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.monto.mx/">Monto</a>: Monto&#8217;s team is building a platform that provides companies in Mexico with the ability to give workers &#8220;salary on demand,&#8221; which isn&#8217;t an advance but allows workers to request the salary they have already earned between paychecks. Workers are charged a flat rate of $34.50 + VAT.</p>
<p><a href="http://mindstate.design">Mindstate Design Labs</a>: Mindstate says it&#8217;s working on &#8220;next-gen&#8221; psychedelic therapeutics for treating things like PTSD. One thing they&#8217;re working on is a &#8220;safer MDMA&#8221; that they say doesn&#8217;t cause post-treatment depression and would allow for a &#8220;greater ability to redose for increased efficacy.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://beau.to">Beau</a>: Small businesses have finally been peer pressured into digitizing their operations for more seamless customer experiences — it only took a pandemic. Beau is building a no-code client workflow for customer communications. With Beau, these businesses can collect submissions, files, payments and send messages to build loyalty (and do their jobs). The minimum viable product has been launched to seven paying customers and 65 active companies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ruthhealth.com/">Ruth Health</a>: Pregnant women receive a lot of care but once the baby is born, there are months of health issues they still have to deal with — and little support provided by existing medical providers. Ruth Health is a telehealth clinic focused specifically on postpartum care, with $150 out-of-pocket sessions to address common women&#8217;s issues like painful sex and unwanted urination. Their rallying cry is &#8220;for vagina owners, by vagina owners!&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://axolo.co/">Axolo</a>: Offering what it calls a “war room for each pull request,” Axolo is a startup building in what we might call the developer productivity space. Its service creates a Slack channel around pull requests that helps engineers avoid swapping from Github back to their internal chats. The company says around 35 organizations are using its product today, and intends to monetize using a freemium model. Axolo will cost around $8 per engineer per month.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ananya.health/">Ananya Health</a>: The team at Ananya Health is building a portable medical device that can freeze abnormal cells much cheaper than existing solutions. The team is focused specifically on using the device to treat cervical &#8220;pre-cancer&#8221; in regions across the world where medical help is hardest to reach.</p>
<p><a href="https://noloco.io">Noloco </a>: A no-code tool for agencies/real estate firms/small businesses to easily build branded portals for interacting with clients, handling things like communication and file sharing. Co-founder Simon Curran says the company is currently seeing an MRR of $1,500.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.govly.com/">Govly</a>: Red tape has a way of bringing people together. Govly helps companies like Cisco and Nutanix come together to bid on government contracts. It wants to grow beyond a SaaS tool and into a marketplace that helps businesses sell into the government. The team hopes to be a better visualization into the business-to-government procurement space.</p>
<p><a href="https://walrus.club">Walrus</a>: Countless young people in India sign up for their first bank account every year. Walrus thinks it would be nice if they signed up with them — a neobank that offers a simple debit card and tools for saving, budgeting and investing. With a straightforward 1% transaction fee model it could be the simplest way for folks there to start banking.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2197314" style="width: 1122px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2197314" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2197314 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mach9.jpg" alt="" width="1112" height="677" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mach9.jpg 1112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mach9.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mach9.jpg?resize=300,183 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mach9.jpg?resize=768,468 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mach9.jpg?resize=680,414 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mach9.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1112px) 100vw, 1112px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2197314" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mach9</p></div></p>
<p><a href="https://www.mach9.io/">Mach9 Robotics</a>: Ah the modern world, full of wonder and aging infrastructure. Sure, we’ve built a lot, but a lot of our infrastructure is fraying. And that means inspections are a pretty big deal. But inspecting stuff in the ground is a huge pain in the backside. Mach9 uses a thermal camera attached to a car to peer into the Earth and find infrastructure issues. The company claims three paid pilots.</p>
<p><a href="http://algouniversity.com/">Algo University</a>: Algo University is taking the ISA learning model to India, training university students there to become solid software engineers. Students also have the option to pay upfront for the education platform, which teams live classes, assignments and contests to help students pick up skills that hopefully land them at top tech jobs.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.therify.co/">Therify</a>: Therapy works better when you&#8217;re talking to someone that you feel understands you. Therify provides mental healthcare as a benefit to companies, focusing on matching patients with therapists who have similar backgrounds. Co-founder James Murray says it&#8217;s currently running $100,000 in paid pilots with &#8220;four global companies.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jovian.ai">Jovian</a>: The “Great Resignation” has led companies to get quite nifty with their benefits, with one impact being the rise of investment in employee education.

<p><a href="https://argonaut.dev">Argonaut</a>: Practically every tech company that wants to scale will need to deploy infrastructure to the cloud, causing words like Kubernetes, Terraform and containerization to be uttered. Argonaut automates this deployment as much as possible to reduce or eliminate the need for specialized engineering work, so even dummies like me can launch a company.</p>
<p><a href="http://abhi.com.pk/">Abhi</a>: Here’s another startup working on the Pakistani market. Abhi wants to offer instant wage access to workers in the country. Early traction appears to be good, with some $15,000 in total payment volume in its first month. The startup claims to have 45 MOUs &#8212; a very non-GAAP sort of contract, if you will &#8212; that represent around 200,000 employees. If it converts a few of those into real agreements, Abhi should have enough volume to truly test its model in the country.</p>
<p><a href="https://dots.community/">Dots</a>: Dots (one of two companies called Dots in this cohort!) is building a software product to help automate online customer communities, plugging into platforms like Slack and Discord and allowing companies to automate certain tasks and help them ensure new community members don&#8217;t slip through the cracks.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.koshex.com">Koshex</a>: Obviously the middle class in India needs somewhere to put their money. If they don’t want to use Stack (two entries above) then maybe they’ll go for Koshex, which bills itself as “Wealthfront for India.” Integrated with more than 40 financial institutions already, Kosher is prepared to handle billions of dollars worth of Indian small investments.</p>
<p><a href="https://shimmer.care">Shimmer</a>: Therapy is good and if everyone could access regular therapy it would be good for the world. But there aren’t enough therapists, and the service is often too expensive for folks in need &#8212; if they can get access. Shimmer wants to bridge the need-coverage gap by offering online mental health support groups that are run by coaches. Peer support can be pretty key to helping with various issues, as anyone in recovery can tell you. The company has 105 users today and claims 2x the retention of traditional therapy.</p>
<p><a href="https://front.page">FrontPage</a>: Building on the retail investor boom, FrontPage wants to build a Public.com for India, helping market investors and traders find a community of people interested in the finance world while browsing trades, charts and new discussions taking place in real time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hyperglue.com/">HyperGlue</a>: Once you&#8217;ve got a big audience, keeping track of what your users are saying about you all around the internet gets tough. HyperGlue analyzes things that people share in places like Reddit and Discord to give product managers an automated breakdown of what people are saying about your product  — the things they hate, the features they want, etc.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.oneistox.in">Oneistox</a>: Online-cohort based classes for designers, architects and engineers — sold at roughly $900 bucks a pop.

<p><a href="https://joingreenwork.com">Greenwork</a>: With the huge infrastructure bill coming through, demand for skilled blue-collar labor will be jumping over the next few years. Greenwork wants to organize it with a LinkedIn-like site for these folks, often government-trained experts who need to find a project to apply their skills to. A recruitment and networking platform just for this valuable class of workers could be just the thing to get people back to work.</p>
<p><a href="https://marketfeed.com">marketfeed</a>: This is fun. Marketfeed is an app that trains users in India to trade stocks. Its founder claims to be akin to the Jim Cramer of India, with a boatload of YouTube subs to back up the claim. So far the app has reached around $100,000 in MRR. Seeing how popular trading has become in Europe and the United States in the last few quarters marketfeed’s general thrust makes sense.</p>
<p><a href="https://warrant.dev/">Warrant</a>: Warrant is building a platform that helps developers add authorization and access control to their web and mobile apps. The company&#8217;s API manages the complexity while users are able to define rules that meet the needs of their product.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.inversionspace.com/">Inversion Space</a>: Instead of taking stuff <em>to</em> space, Inversion Space wants to bring some back <em>from</em> space. That’s an, ahem, inversion of what we tend to hear from space startups. The startup is building a return “capsule” that is four feet in diameter and wants to be able to drop stuff from space back to the planet in under an hour. Notably the startup claims some $225 million worth of LOIs, which may sound like a lot, but given what it costs to do anything in space, keep the number in scale. Inversion is targeting a first launch (drop?) in mid-2023.</p>

<p><a href="https://rivia.ai">Rivia.AI</a>: D2C brands in India need better ways to get their products into ever-impatient consumer hands.

By ignoring Amazon, Rivia.AI is helping e-commerce brands in India achieve two-day shipment, while the startup makes $0.65 on each delivery. Rivia.AI has 2,400 monthly transactions — and a mission to get to the billions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.palla.app/">Palla</a>: Sending money across borders has never been easy. Or rather, if it&#8217;s easy, it&#8217;s expensive. Palla aims to make it both easy and cheap to send money to and from LatAm, from one person to another. They&#8217;re partnering with big fintech and banking companies to get thousands of folks signed up and ready to get cash from out of the country on their debit cards in seconds rather than hours.</p>
<p><a href="https://suplias.com">Suplias</a>: This is cool. There are 13 million small grocery stores in Africa, Suplias says, which it wants to help supply. The startup offers a B2B mobile marketplace that uses third-party logistics providers to get new inventory to small grocers rapidly. The digitization of SMBs in emerging markets is a well-known trend, but this is a bit different. And if the margins are good, it could scale pretty rapidly.

<p><a href="https://www.rentmarble.com">Marble</a>: Marble helps property owners manage their properties from afar. The platform handles rent collection and maintenance in addition to remote showings, collecting $50 per unit per month, significantly undercutting competitor pricing.</p>

<p><a href="https://boldvoice.com">BoldVoice</a>: Duolingo may be the best-known language learning app on the market, but BoldVoice has a deep focus in one area that unicorn is missing: smart speech. The startup wants to help non-native English speakers find (and flaunt) their voices. The startup uses short-form videos, taught by Hollywood accent coaches who traditionally help actors, to deliver content. The curriculum is built around three Ps: posture, to help with the physical feel of using an English R versus a Spanish R; phonology, the vowels and consonants; and porosity, which is the musicality of an accent. In two months, it has hit $5,000 in monthly revenue from over 200 paid uses. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/boldvoice-y-combinator-pre-seed/">We wrote more about the startup on TechCrunch</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.onsleek.com/">Sleek</a>: Impulse buys on the internet aren&#8217;t actually any easier than big buys. You still have to go through the whole checkout process, except on the few shops that offer one-click fire-and-forget checkout. But what if I told you there was a startup offering a browser extension that makes every online shop have a one-click checkout … AND it gives you cash back? That&#8217;s the pitch with Sleek&#8217;s ML-powered checkout bot. By preventing cart rot they increase sales, collect the commissions and pass on the savings to you. Of course, you&#8217;re still out the cost of that impulse buy you would have left behind … but let&#8217;s not talk about that.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cloudanix.com">Cloudanix</a>: Lots of companies now use more than one public cloud provider. So not just AWS, or just Azure, but GCP and others as well.

As the world becomes increasingly a multicloud domain, the company could find itself riding a secular shift.</p>

Okani acts as a digital primary care provider living in WhatsApp, so patients can meet with a doctor and get tailored referrals rather than take on the time and expense of a hospital trip.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.breakaway.app/">The Breakaway</a>: Ah, do you need more motivation to get back on your indoor bike? Is your Peloton sitting idle because you are worried that <a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/bike/instructors/grannyriri">Matt</a> will judge you for not doing enough Power Zone Max rides? The Breakaway is building a “motivational coaching” application for fitness dweebs like me. Its iOS app will link to your Peloton, so you can, well, cycle more? Better? I would joke that surely the $50 you already pay Peloton is enough, but since we’re already paying that, why not tack on more to perhaps cycle a bit more?</p>

<p><a href="https://cellchorus.com">CellChorus</a>: All kinds of medicines, therapies, vaccines and other research processes need to understand what effects they create on a cell-by-cell level, but observing this directly can be very difficult. CellChorus does it, though, and has trained a machine learning model to watch footage of cell interactions and automatically derive conclusions like which cells perform best and why. They&#8217;ve already got traction and have been in multiple prestigious journals, so while it&#8217;s not something you&#8217;ll be using at home, it could be standard issue tech in medical research soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://secoda.co">Secoda</a>: Secoda wants to aggregate your company’s data in a single place, so that internal teams can better work together and share metadata, queries and more.

<p><a href="https://www.contalink.com/">Contalink</a>: Startups love to build SaaS for sales teams, but Contalink is refreshingly looking at another team for its software-based tool: the accounting department. The platform helps accountants move off of desktop software into the electronic cloud, a shift the team claims will make bookkeeping a much faster task. Starting with a focus on Mexico SMBs, Contalink has landed 2,700 paying users with $50,000 in monthly recurring revenue.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.catenabiosciences.com/">Catena Biosciences</a>: Autoimmune disorders are devastating and difficult to treat. Catena has a new approach born out of work at CRISPR co-inventor Jennifer Doudna&#8217;s lab. By attaching custom proteins to red blood cells, they can retrain the immune system to cease its mistaken and destructive response, potentially providing a treatment for Graves’ disease, celiac disorder, multiple sclerosis and more. Big Pharma is already nosing around, as you might expect, and I predict a large valuation quite soon. (But more importantly, treatments for serious disorders.)</p>
<p><a href="https://kapacity.io">Kapacity.io</a>: Connects to existing devices/products (like HVAC) in a building and controls them via API to reduce electricity costs, aiming for a 25% reduction and taking a cut of the savings.</p>

<p><a href="https://evidentlyai.com">Evidently AI</a>: Machine learning models are used almost universally in tech stacks, but telling when they&#8217;re failing and how isn&#8217;t as simple and established as something like &#8220;500 Error server not found.&#8221; Evidently wants to make tracking and debugging ML systems simpler and easier, so that faults can be identified and fixed faster. As authors of dozens of ML models themselves, the team thinks they&#8217;ve got the chops to do it. And who will naysay them?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.adaptyvbio.com/">Adaptyv Biosystems</a>: A smaller, faster chip for biotech companies to synthesize and screen proteins. CEO Julian Englert says their chip is 100,000x smaller than existing options, allowing them to screen &#8220;millions of drugs instead of thousands.&#8221;; from the data they&#8217;ll gather, they&#8217;ll build &#8220;the world&#8217;s largest protein database.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.craft.aero">Craft Aerospace</a>: Craft Aerospace is designing and testing a totally novel new vertical take-off and landing aircraft designed to fly and land in and around cities, making regional travel faster and cheaper. The design of the aircraft is pretty wild, but it actually makes a lot of sense and could help change SF-to-LA into Tenderloin-to-Silverlake (well, maybe not that, but you get the idea). <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/craft-aerospaces-novel-take-on-vtol-aircraft-could-upend-local-air-travel/">I wrote more about their new approach here</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://snowboard.software/">Snowboard Software</a>: If you know what the &#8220;Snowflake data cloud&#8221; is, Snowboard might be for you. Snowboard is a data catalog for Snowflake, allowing you to dig through your data on the platform faster, find data issues, etc. You can self-host it, or they&#8217;ll host for you; it&#8217;s free to start tinkering with, and you start paying after 1,000 indexed columns. The company says it&#8217;s currently seeing $15,000 ARR with four companies onboarded.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jupe.com">Jupe</a>: First up, the Jupe founder who presented had an excellent hat. He was also living in a Jupe in a parking lot. Why? Because Jupe sells glamping-in-a-box. The company has booked some $6.5 million in revenue this year and claims to be profitable. It sells software and hardware and takes a pretty big cut of total spend. Er, is glamping a big industry? I have glamped. It was nice. Perhaps it is growing during the COVID era.</p>
<p><a href="https://hera.so">Hera</a>: The team at Hera is building a Calendar app with an emphasis on productivity, with a number of overt and more subtle features aimed at helping people get the most out of their meetings without living in a bloated calendar app.</p>
<p><a href="http://astekdx.com">Astek</a>.: Helps doctors find the right antibiotic faster — an hour, the company says, instead of days — in emergency situations. The company expects to charge $100 per test.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.protegosolutions.io/">Protego</a>: Founded by ex-Rappi entrepreneurs, Protego helps LatAm companies recover lost revenue.

<p><a href="https://www.vflowmedicalinc.com/">V-Flow Medical</a>: Millions of Americans suffer from compressed pelvic veins, a dangerous condition usually treated with stents — which have a 20% failure rate. V-Flow has designed a device to treat the huge number of people who need an alternative treatment. With a track record of medical device approvals and exits behind them, the team says they have this whole thing mapped out and hopefully ready to keep hundreds of thousands of people healthy.</p>
<p><a href="https://bloop.ai">bloop</a>: An extension for your code editor that surfaces code examples from each library&#8217;s official documentation. Works with VS Code, with support for other IDEs on the way.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instacrops.com">Instacrops</a>: An agtech startup focused on helping farmers in Latin America maximize their crop yields using technology like IoT sensors and drones while integrating data sources to help farmers make the best decisions with the best information available.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.biteninja.com">Bite Ninja</a>: Bite Ninja wants drive-thru restaurants to use its freelancers (ninjas) to help others order and receive food (bites), allowing people to take drive-thru orders from home. One of the co-founders ran a BBQ restaurant chain called Baby Jacks, where he built out the initial concept. The team says it&#8217;s currently running pilots with five chains and would make $150,000 per restaurant location.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pylonump.com/">Pylon</a>: One way to stand out in Y Combinator is to be a fully bootstrapped company making nearly double-digit revenue. That’s what Pylon, a platform to help water and electricity companies manage infrastructure, did in its pitch today. The profitable company improves its clients operations by detecting and reducing leakages, consumption theft and uncollected bills.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.clearmix.com/">ClearMix</a>: Organizing an in-person video team at a global company can be tough at the best of times, let alone during a pandemic. ClearMix is a fully remote video production suite that lets video teams record and produce videos quickly and professionally, but entirely online. No doubt it&#8217;s going up against some heavy hitters in the Adobe vein, but the need is clear.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sequincard.com">Sequin </a>: A fintech play, Sequin wants to give women debit cards to help them build credit &#8212; the card features what the company called “live credit reporting” &#8212; so that more women can access debt products. The company plans to eventually build a credit card product as well. Per Sequin, it expects to generate around $60 per user per year thanks to interchange incomes.</p>
<p><a href="https://useteamspace.com/">Teamspace</a>: A remote collaboration platform built by a Facebook product designer who worked on the company&#8217;s Workplace product.

The productivity software startup charges $10 a month — and claims it&#8217;s gaining one customer every two minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.whalesync.com">Whalesync</a>: No-code tools are definitely popular (there have been plenty in the last two days) but they don&#8217;t solve every problem. And it turns out they create at least one new one — keeping data in sync between no-code tools can be tough and your devs end up having to code a data pipeline anyway. Whalesync connects no-code tools with each other, staving off the &#8220;real&#8221; coding for another step or two.</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yummy-venezuela/id1506748350">Yummy</a>: Co-founded by a Postmates alum, Yummy is building a super app for Venezuela that it intends to expand to Peru and Chile. The company’s application includes food, CPG and entertainment products and claims to have expanded to ride-hailing as well. Yummy says that it is doing $1.6 million in monthly GMV, a figure that is growing by 35% each month. If that growth keeps up, expect to hear more about the company.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.jinguhealth.com/">Jingu Health</a>: Millions of women suffer from vaginal infections with no effective treatment, but Jingu Health is coming to the rescue with a powerful tool. They target the underlying cause of these infections by analyzing the microbiome with computational biology tools and reprogramming it (think &#8220;more of this, less of this,&#8221; not bioengineered microorganisms). They claim to have the first pill-based treatment. It&#8217;s even FDA approved even though it doesn&#8217;t need to be … just in case.</p>
<p><a href="https://echoeshq.com">Echoes HQ</a>: This one could prove controversial. Echoes wants to measure engineering output and align time spent to different corporate OKRs. If TechCrunch rolled this out to measure writer output, there would be pitchforks in the streets.* Precisely how much engineers want to have their work monitored so that a manager elsewhere can chide them for whatever they deem to be “less than productive” is not clear. However, given how tight the market is for technical talent, if this introduces any sort of material friction, it would drive regretted employee churn, as they say.</p>
<p>*And by streets we mean various Slack channels.</p>

DocVita is looking to scale telehealth in India further with a platform that connects consumers with generalists and specialists across a wide network. The founders have experience in the healthcare software industry and have scaled the company to $12,000 in monthly GMV after just a few months on the market.</p>
<p><a href="http://waterplan.com">Waterplan</a>: Tech and water may not usually mix well, unless you’re Waterplan. The startup helps industrial facilities mitigate water risk, a growing threat due to climate change and deterioration. It has $345,000 in annual recurring revenue thanks to 12 pilot customers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.moxionpower.com/">Moxion Power</a>: I (Alex) half expect this company to announce a SPAC-led deal to go public in the next month. It’s building large, mobile batteries that construction sites and other commercial operations can use to provide power in locations where they today use generators. Lower emissions is a win. The company expects to get its first production facility online in Q1 2022. Given the huge interest in EV tech more generally today, we like Moxion’s chances of raising the capital it needs to give its business a shot.</p>
<p><a href="https://lightly.ai/">Lightly</a>: A machine learning startup that helps ML teams prioritize the data most in need of labeling, pointing them to the data subsets that will have the biggest impact on their overall model accuracy.</p>
<p><a href="https://beeper.com">Beeper</a>: You probably use like a half dozen chat apps. Beeper merges them all together  — even iMessage, through some hackery involving forwarding messages from a Mac or jailbroken iPhone — and adds things like unified search. Co-founders Eric Migicovsky and Brad Murray previously worked together at Pebble, the early smartwatch company Eric founded.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rendalomaq.com/">Rendalo Maq</a>: A digital broker for construction equipment in LatAm. Clients turn to Rendalo Maq to procure and handle fleet management for construction companies in the region. While the startup’s software is focused on used equipment and rentals, it’s also a marketplace and operating system.</p>
<p><a href="https://getbasis.com">Basis</a>: Look, if you&#8217;re in business automation like me, you understand that a dynamic end-to-end data pipeline is worth its weight in bitcoin. Was that convincing? Okay, I&#8217;m not in business automation but I can guess that with the amounts of data coming in and the number of places it needs to go, you want a big-time solution, and that&#8217;s what Basis wants to be. &#8220;Yes code&#8221; instead of no code, giving superpowers to your dev team so they don&#8217;t have to hire a specialist in data handling just to make things work.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.levro.com">Levro</a>: Something that I’ve noticed among lots of smaller companies is building in many countries at once. That means that business itself is increasingly global. Which is great for remote workers, but a bit wonky when it comes to payments and banking. Levro appears to be prepping to help smooth the currency situation by offering a multicurrency banking service. The company dangled a hook during its pitch, offering free payments up to a transaction cap for folks tuned into Demo Day. Let’s see if that helps it drive early sign-ups. Its website currently only lets folks sign up for updates, so it may be some time until we fully grok Levro’s early traction.</p>
<p><a href="https://zazos.com/en">Zazos</a>: A no-code tool for HR teams that helps them build the exact functionality they need and leave out what they don&#8217;t while allowing customizations across interfaces, permissioning and data integrations.</p>
<p><a href="https://courses.filadd.com/">Filadd</a>: Helps students in Latin America pass their college entrance exams, then provides them with 24/7 access to tutors until they graduate. Co-founder Joaquin Olmedo says the company is currently seeing $800,000 in annual revenue.</p>

TestRigor has created technology that allows companies to run tests that better emulate the way end users engage with their applications. The software claims to be faster, non-engineer friendly, and thus more scalable for its clients. Netflix is one of the customers fueling testRigor’s $700,000 annual recurring revenue.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.heimdalccu.com">Heimdal</a>: Heimdal pulls valuable minerals out of seawater while simultaneously sequestering carbon dioxide, producing carbon-negative materials for the concrete and glass industries. Cement manufacturing is notoriously a huge polluter, so with regulations coming in, they and everyone else are jonesing for green processes and raw materials. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/heimdal-pulls-co2-and-cement-making-materials-out-of-seawater-using-renewable-energy/">I wrote this up in more detail here!</a></p>
<p><a href="https://unbox.ai/">Unbox</a>: QA doesn’t get enough love in the ML world, but it matters. ML models can be biased as heck, or simply broken. Unbox wants to help ML team members, both technical and not, to find issues in ML models and create tests to check to make sure that fixes work. The team hails from Apple. Unbox did not share growth metrics.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.joinfizz.com/">Fizz</a>: Fizz is building a debit card that helps college students in the U.S. start building out their credit without having to learn lessons about overzealous credit use the hard way. Building good credit early is critical but can be tough for college students operating on tight budgets, Fizz is building a platform designed for college students specifically.</p>
<p><a href="https://mentor.cam/">Mentorcam</a>: A marketplace connecting people with those they admire for advice — sorta like Cameo for 1:1 advice. Charging $20-$300 per video, they saw $7,000 in gross sales in August. Notably, the company says, nearly half of its users are repeat customers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.telm.ai/">Telmai</a>: Data quality can make or break a startup, so Telmai wants to be the reliable sidekick that sniffs out inaccuracies or anomalies before you do. The data observability platform uses a no-code onboarding process and claims it can begin working for clients within minutes. Beyond fighting bad data, Telmai offers high-level visualization, and soon, proactive alerts and user inputs for correctness. For data analytics teams, which are constantly deciding whether to escalate a blip, Telmai is meant to take some of the guesswork out of their days and more broadly simplify operations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amenli.com/">Amenli</a>: Amenli is the first licensed online insurance broker in Egypt. Able to sign customers up in a few minutes for low-cost premiums around $200 per year, it&#8217;s hard to see how this can be anything but a runaway success assuming they do it right. Go get it, Amenli!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.usenash.com/">Nash</a>: This is fun. Nash has built software atop mass-market delivery APIs (it listed DoorDash and Uber, among others) to allow other companies to offer same-day delivery. Why is it neat? Because SMBs can’t code, having another company plug them into delivery networks could unlock the delivery market for companies that can’t afford an engineering team. Per Nash, it has a 10% take rate and is doing around $60,000 in GMV.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bytekitchen.io/">Byte Kitchen</a>: Byte Kitchen wants to build ghost kitchens that make the best dishes from the best restaurants in the country, licensing brands and recipes and bringing them access to more markets.

<p><a href="http://tenyks.ai/">Tenyks</a>: Helps AI developers figure out how/why their computer vision systems are doing what they&#8217;re doing and build more reliable systems. With both co-founders having Ph.D.s in &#8220;Explainable AI,&#8221; this one seems like a good fit. Founder Botty Dimanov says they&#8217;re currently working with one customer, with four more getting set up now and seven+ on the waitlist.</p>
<p><a href="https://maroo.us/">Maroo</a>: “Save the date” doesn’t exactly scream stable revenue, so Maroo is building a payments service for the wedding industry. The startup is rethinking how the business owners within the wedding industry — from caterers to that charming venue you eye every time you drive past it — receive payments. As for the happy couple, Maroo offers a buy now, pay later service for a more accessible financing option,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tavus.io">Tavus</a>: Here&#8217;s one that might make you squint a little. Tavus wants to replace written outreach (think sales emails and such) with computer-generated deepfakes. Yes, you read that correctly. Customize the name, company and other aspects and get hundreds of tailored videos that look just like someone recorded a video message just for the recipient. Is it a good idea? We&#8217;ll see … but like it or not it&#8217;s here, and it seems to be effective. Let you and I proceed into this strange new world together, my friend.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.marqvision.com/">MarqVision</a>: Monitors the large ecommerce marketplaces and aims to automatically detect/flag counterfeits while providing brands a dashboard for sending take-down requests. Co-founder Mark Lee says that they&#8217;ve reached $100k in MRR after launching 9 months ago, citing LVMH (read: Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Fendi, Off-White, etc.) as a client.</p>
<p><a href="https://enso.org">Enso</a>: The team at Enso is building a data processing tool that helps automate developer processes that require a ton of repetitive manual work. The no-code platform wants to put components built by its community of experts into the hands of data scientists.</p>
<p><a href="https://getbritehr.com/">Brite</a>: When your employer offers you a zillion different benefits/insurance options, Brite helps you wade through it and figure out what&#8217;s right. Co-founder Ben Hale says they&#8217;ve already worked with over 400,000 employees (across 250+ employers) and are seeing an MRR of $28,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://metlo.io">Metlo</a>: The truth wins, and that’s a lesson for life and for startups. Metlo, built by former Facebook and Uber engineers, helps companies store their business metrics (like “daily active users”) in a standardized, transparent way across different tools without a bunch of duplicated work. In seven weeks, the startup landed four design partners.</p>
<p><a href="https://mergequeue.com">MergeQueue</a>: When you&#8217;ve got 20 engineers all coding separately to build a new feature, it can take as long to integrate and reconcile their work as it does to do it in the first place. MergeQueue automates code submission workflows to avoid build failures that result in costly code reviews and delays. The team encountered this issue at Google (easy to imagine) and hacked together their own solution there — now they&#8217;ve built something for everyone else to use.</p>
<p><a href="https://costcertified.com/">CostCertified</a>: Bringing price transparency to an opaque market is never too bad an idea. CostCertified wants to make the worlds of construction materials and labor more transparent with a marketplace and “real-time quoting engine” that it has built. Per the startup, it has around $250,000 in ARR from SaaS revenues today and intends to take a 1% cut of GMV in the future.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for September 1, 2021. It’s a big day in TechCrunch history in that we’ve been shuffled to a new parent company. More on that in a moment. First, Disrupt attendees, you can <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/fire-up-crunchmatch-today-and-start-networking-with-techcrunch-disrupt-2021-attendees/">now hit up CrunchMatch to meet other cool folks</a>.

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apollo-completes-its-5b-acquisition-of-verizon-media-now-known-as-yahoo/">Hello, Apollo!</a> </strong>TechCrunch is no longer part of Verizon Media Group, a somewhat forgotten subsidiary of the U.S. telco. Instead, we are now part of Yahoo, which is owned, in turn, by Apollo, a large investing company that is publicly traded. Cue the parade. Jokes aside, the long-announced deal has finally been completed. We’ll have more notes on our new overlords as soon as we meet them.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/what-amplitudes-choice-to-direct-list-says-about-its-products-growth-and-value/">Inside Amplitude’s IPO filing:</a></strong> TechCrunch’s coverage of the accelerating IPO market continued today with notes on Amplitude’s product-analytics-focused debut. For more on Toast and Freshworks’ filings, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/5-takeaways-from-toasts-s-1-filing/">head</a></strong> here or <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/inside-freshworks-ipo-filing-as-the/">here</a></strong>. Oh, <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/d2c-specs-purveyor-warby-parker-files-to-go-public/">and Warby Parker here</a></strong>, if D2C is your jam.</li>
<li>Sticking to the big-dollar news today, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/vista-equity-takes-majority-stake-in-saas-startup-drift-taking-it-to-unicorn-status/"><strong>Vista Equity is buying a majority stake in Drift</strong></a>. Based in Boston, Drift focuses on what it calls “conversational” sales tools. The two parties were being coy to a silly level by not disclosing the price paid for Drift, other than that the majority sale of the company values the former startup at more than $1 billion. Why Drift sold to Vista instead of going public is not clear, but we do feel cheated out of its S-1 filing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>As we write to you today, the TechCrunch team is busy writing thousands of words about the second day of startup pitches from Y Combinator’s Demo Day. You can read about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/here-are-all-the-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day-part-1/">every startup that pitched yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>Now, to today’s news. First, Berlin Brands, which buys and hopes to scale brands that sell on Amazon, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/berlin-brands-group-now-valued-at-1b-raises-700m-to-buy-and-scale-merchants-that-sell-on-marketplaces-like-amazon/">now worth north of $1 billion</a> after raising a $700 million equity-and-debt round. There is apparently infinite capital available to finance the purchase of smaller e-commerce brands.</p>
<p>So much so that Forum Brands <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/berlin-brands-group-now-valued-at-1b-raises-700m-to-buy-and-scale-merchants-that-sell-on-marketplaces-like-amazon/"><em>also</em> announced new capital for the activity today</a>. Its $100 million in debt financing may sound small compared to what Berlin Brands just secured, but it’s still nine figures of dry powder.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/blueprint-raises-16m-series-b-to-grow-its-title-focused-insurtech-business/"><strong>Blueprint raises $16M to scale its title insurance business:</strong></a> It turns out that the title insurance business in the United States is too valuable. Blueprint wants to reduce its size by offering lower-priced coverage to customers who buy multiple properties in several states.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/insurify-a-virtual-insurance-agent-raises-100m-series-b/"><strong>Insurify raises $100M as insurtech marketplaces stay hot:</strong></a> Sure, neoinsurance providers have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/23/why-have-the-markets-spurned-public-neoinsurance-startups/">taken a bath in the public markets lately</a>, but the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/02/why-vcs-are-dumping-money-into-insurance-marketplaces/">insurtech <em>marketplace</em> game</a> still looks healthy. Insurify, which competes with Zebra and other players, is now $100 million richer.  An indicator, we presume, that it is still finding plenty of market to attack.</li>
<li>If you want more on the insurtech venture capital market, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/insurtech-is-hot-on-both-sides-of-the-atlantic/">TechCrunch has your back</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/skit-raises-23m-series-b-round-led-by-westbridge-capital-to-accelerate-its-growth/"><strong>Call center automation is big business:</strong></a> At least for Skit, a startup that just closed a $23 million Series B. Per our own Kate Park, Skit’s tech helps its customers automate nearly all of their voice support calls.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/humane-a-stealthy-hardware-and-software-startup-co-founded-by-an-ex-apple-designer-and-engineer-raises-100m/"><strong>Company we know little about raises lots of money:</strong></a> Have you heard of Humane? Probably not. Born from some ex-Apple folks, the startup &#8212; “which has ambitions to build a new class of consumer devices and technologies,” TechCrunch reports &#8212; has no products in the market. And yet it has raised $100 million this week after raising $30 million last year. What will it build? I guess we’ll find out.</li>

		Mark McClain is the founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.sailpoint.com/">SailPoint</a>, the leader in cloud enterprise security. 	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">You&#8217;ve heard the phrase &#8220;leading by example,&#8221; but what about &#8220;leading with values&#8221;?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always led by example by using my values as my guide. Still, it wasn’t until I founded my first company that I fully understood the importance of embedding those values into the company, too.</p>
<p>Integrity, individuals, impact and innovation are the &#8220;<a href="https://www.sailpoint.com/company/#:~:text=SailPoint's%20success%20is%20directly%20tied,Integrity%2C%20Impact%2C%20and%20Individuals.">4 I values</a>&#8221; that drive my decisions and the actions of those at my company each day. These are not just words on a wall at our HQ or on a mousepad for our remote crew, but values that everyone in the company lives and breathes. Over the last two years, these four values became even more important and continued to guide me, my family and the leaders at our company.</p>
<p>As organizations map out their &#8220;return to the workplace&#8221; (NOT &#8220;return to work,&#8221; because we never stopped working) plans, we should not simply go back to how things were before. Instead, let’s all take a moment to redesign something that sets everyone up for success, with values as the compass. I think you’ll find this approach helps people not only survive, but thrive in the workplace.</p>
<p>Leading with values is, in my experience, the best leadership position to take, and there are three ways to accomplish this goal.</p>
<h2>Leave behind old-school mentalities on workplace hierarchy</h2>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The tone of the company&#8217;s culture comes from the top. The culture you envision for your company will only come about if your employees believe in the practices that you are asking them to implement.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>At some point in your career — probably right out of school, a few years in or somewhere in the middle — you experienced a company where treating lower-level employees with less respect is just &#8220;a part of the job.&#8221; Companies with this type of &#8220;paying your dues&#8221; mentality tend to work these lower-level employees like grunts until they burn out and leave.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Or they eventually crawl their way up into management-level positions, and the cycle perpetuates itself as they deride the newer crop of employees, eroding any semblance of a healthy culture.</p>
<p>This is not the way.</p>
<p>As a leader, if you want your work environment to indicate inclusivity, support, collaboration and have the essence of a team mentality, <em>you</em> must set the precedent right away. This means stripping away the hierarchy that accompanies work titles and making it clear that your company values contribution based on merit, regardless of position. You are one team, united in your purpose to deliver on your mission, based on your values. This level setting ensures that everyone has skin in the game, and no one has the leeway to treat people poorly.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t get caught in an ivory tower mindset</h2>
<p>Early on in my career, I began sharing an office when I could. Those office spaces were purposely not what anyone would consider cool or nice “digs&#8221; — not the furniture and certainly not the view. Even as CEO now, I’ve had someone on the team describe my current office as a closet. But it gets the job done.</p>
<p>Simple signals like this send a powerful message, and the signal must remain consistent. Don&#8217;t take a limo; rent a cheap car. Don&#8217;t fly first class; fly coach. These may seem like minor details, but one of the biggest pitfalls any CEO can encounter is falling victim to an ivory tower mindset — when you become so out of touch with the people you manage, your employees start to notice.</p>
<p>Make a cognizant effort to know your people. Implement a &#8220;management by walking around&#8221; strategy. Don&#8217;t sit in your office all day; get out on the floor among your people. Drop by their desks and ask them how their day is going. Eat lunch in the break room. Put in the effort to attend new hire onboarding.</p>
<p>Not physically back in the office? Drop into Slack channels and Zoom meetings. I once &#8220;Zoom bombed&#8221; a baby shower for one of our crew members just to hear all the well wishes, and it made my day and theirs. Overall, just be present and humanize your workspace. It pays off in spades.</p>
<h2>Be thoughtful and consistent with workplace practices</h2>
<p>The tone of the company&#8217;s culture comes from the top. The culture you envision for your company will only come about if your employees believe in the practices that you are asking them to implement. More importantly, you will not grow a solid culture if you don’t give these initiatives and practices 100% of your own effort.</p>
<p>For example, one new initiative we rolled out last year is a campaign we call &#8220;<a href="https://www.sailpoint.com/blog/rethinking-work-in-identity/">Free2Focus</a>.&#8221; Twice a week, the SailPoint crew is asked to avoid booking meetings for a couple of hours during Free2Focus time. Not only does this address Zoom fatigue, it also gives our crew the chance to catch their breath whichever way suits them best — whether that&#8217;s taking a walk, helping with their children&#8217;s schooling or just turning off the camera for a bit.</p>
<p>If I want my team to show themselves some grace during the week, I&#8217;ve found that I need to apply the same practice. This means not setting up meetings during Free2Focus, not sending emails all hours of the day and night and not judging people for taking breaks when they need them. I trust my team to get the job done largely on their own time and own their own terms. I promise, your employees’ performance will be better because of it.</p>
<p>Being a CEO is more than building on a vision, a product or an idea. It&#8217;s about leading your people with values to accomplish mutual goals in a way that doesn&#8217;t zap them of their morale or dignity. It&#8217;s easy to get caught up in all the things that come with a job, but if you don&#8217;t put in the effort to immerse yourself and your values into the entire company, you&#8217;ll end up too big for your own good — and certainly too big for your company&#8217;s good.</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t happen overnight, but remember, the smallest things are often the ones that have the biggest impact. If you’re the leader, lead by example. It’s the only way to build teams that stand the test of time.</p>
