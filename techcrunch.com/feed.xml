										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Micromobility companies that aim to turn a profit have to juggle running a tight ship, adhering to constantly shifting local  regulations and getting as many riders on vehicles as possible. Boston-based Zoba, a micromobility fleet optimization startup, has developed a platform to help with that.</p>
<p>Zoba runs a behind-the-scenes logic layer of an operator’s fleet management software that uses AI to help decide where every vehicle in a fleet should be positioned, how to incentivize users with dynamic pricing and how to optimize operational efficiency.</p>
<p>“The way we approach this problem is we have a core platform that we&#8217;ve built, which is basically designed to help us understand your current market conditions, so we use machine learning to understand where demand will be for the systems, how that would be impacted by prevailing weather conditions and all the other sorts of very dynamic factors that happen in the market,” Joseph Brennan, co-founder of Zoba, told TechCrunch. “Then we feed that information into an optimization engine that is purpose-built to help us solve for these very large, complex optimization problems fast enough for them to be operationally relevant.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219172" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Zoba’s tech is plugged into the back end of over 150,000 vehicles across 150 cities globally, mainly in the U.S. and Europe. The startup works with very large operators, including Spin, and on Tuesday announced the close of a $12 million Series A round led by NTTVC, with participation from existing investor CRV.</p>
<p>Zoba intends to use the funds to scale its go-to-market functions, like customer support, sales and marketing, as it expands into new markets like India and Latin America. It also wants to expand into new verticals like delivery and maybe even autonomous ride-hailing in the future, says Brennan.</p>
<p>“We really think of ourselves as a deep tech company,” Brennan said. “The product is not done, it’s never going to be done. And so we will continue to invest heavily in terms of widening what we view as a pretty large technical lead between us and anyone else in this problem space.”</p>
<p>Zoba’s system is informed by historical data provided by the operators, such as where vehicles have been ridden or when they’ve been in maintenance. This information is then used to reconstruct demand histories in a way that can not only detail where rides have been in the past, but also predict where they will be in the future.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Zoba also collects environmental information about the city that might drive near-term fluctuations in demand, like road networks and weather data.</p>
<p>“Weather is a really critical one,” said Brennan. “We’re using Tomorrow.io weather data, which is the best in class weather data that’s very granular and accurate, because we need to know for the next two hours, is it going to drop five degrees in temperature? Is it going to start to rain? This is the core of what’s flowing into our system.”</p>
<p>Most in-house fleet management platforms are less data driven and more intuition-based, with in local markets guessing at where demand might be, says Brennan.</p>
<p>“What we are trying to do is take that data which is an incomplete, heavily censored data set, and find some sort of truth about what demand actually looks like using models that we&#8217;ve been developing for years,” he said.</p>
<p>The company says by implementing its platform, shared micromobility companies have seen ridership increase by 20% to 50%, which helps to cover overhead costs like the vehicles themselves, warehouses and labor. Zoba also says it’s improved labor productivity by 20% by managing deployments, rebalances and battery swaps, and helps operators be better city partners by helping to manage zone constraints and keep vehicles off sidewalks.</p>
<p>“Zoba is truly unique in this market, in that they’ve spent a lot of time thinking about the industry’s problems, then building a new solution from the ground up to address fleet optimization,” said Ben Bear, CEO of Spin, in a statement. “Instead of relying on historical trends to determine demand, Zoba gives the ability to predict where our customers will need our services beforehand. That truly enables us to increase our revenues while reducing operational costs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Newfoundland-based <a href="https://www.colabsoftware.com/">CoLab Software</a>, which provides a web-based collaboration tool and issue-tracking platform for engineering teams, announced today that it has raised $17 million in Series A funding. New York-based investment firm Insight Partners led the funding round with participation from new and existing venture capitalists and angel investors from companies such as Xometry, Onshape, GrabCAD, Bosch, Tesla and Atlassian.</p>
<p>CoLab, which was founded in 2017, allows manufacturing teams to easily share and review design files while getting feedback in real-time. The platform currently has several Fortune 500 customers, including Hyundai Mobis, Schneider Electric and Johnson Controls.</p>
<p>The idea for CoLab originated while founders Adam Keating and Jeremy Andrews were building one of the world’s first hyperloop pods for SpaceX and working on the Model 3 program at Tesla. They say the teams that were building physical products were using tools 20 years behind teams that were building software products.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219783" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“We became frustrated with just how slow and archaic things were,” CoLab co-founder and CEO Adam Keating told TechCrunch in an interview. “We became engineers to solve hard problems and create things but we ended up spending half of our time chasing down administrative work.”</p>
<p>Keating says they found that all of the processes were conducted manually and that the main record of communication within teams was through email. The pair then decided to build CoLab with the aim of helping innovative engineering companies improve collaboration within their teams. They acknowledge that the obvious choice for most founders at the time would have been to start a technology company in Silicon Valley. However, Keating and Andrews decided to start CoLab in Newfoundland and Labrador, the easternmost province in Canada.</p>
<p>CoLab’s short-term goal is to allow engineers to focus on creating and building by making their work as automated as possible. The company is doing this by investing in real-time abilities that allow design and manufacturing teams to collaborate efficiently.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219790" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219790" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2219790" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CoLab-Watch-Product-Image.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="569" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CoLab-Watch-Product-Image.jpg 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CoLab-Watch-Product-Image.jpg?resize=150,83 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CoLab-Watch-Product-Image.jpg?resize=300,167 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CoLab-Watch-Product-Image.jpg?resize=768,427 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CoLab-Watch-Product-Image.jpg?resize=680,378 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CoLab-Watch-Product-Image.jpg?resize=1536,853 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CoLab-Watch-Product-Image.jpg?resize=2048,1138 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/CoLab-Watch-Product-Image.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219790" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> CoLab</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The platform currently has three main features: Drive, Track and Reviews. The ‘drive’ feature lets users organize their work independently of their other file systems and share files securely. CoLab’s ‘track’ feature offers a birds-eye view of what’s happening within a team. Lastly, the ‘reviews’ feature lets users collaborate on designs, ranging from formal design reviews to informal peer checks.</p>
<p>CoLab currently consists of a 54-person team largely based in Newfoundland and across Canada. The company signed a gender diversity pledge in 2019 when its team was 10 percent female. Today, CoLab’s team is 33 percent female. With this latest round of funding, the company plans to double its workforce.</p>
<p>“We’re going to open 25 roles right away and then there will be a second group of 25 roles opening up just after the new year. The focus of that is going to be on helping us get CoLab into the hands of more engineering teams,” Keating said.</p>
<p>Additionally, some of the funding will be used for marketing purposes, as the company hasn’t spent much on that front to date. CoLab will use the last part of the funding to invest in upcoming products and features that are scheduled to launch later this year and early next year.</p>
<p>Further, as part of its funding release, CoLab also announced that Josh Fredberg, the managing director at Insight Partners, is joining CoLab’s board of directors.</p>
<p>“CoLab’s CoDesign tool is a game-changer for engineers around the globe,” said Fredberg in a statement. “Rarely do you see a product that so perfectly addresses a pain point that is both highly technical and widespread, but that’s what happens when you combine frustration with an entrepreneurial mindset. Adam, Jeremy and team are uniquely positioned to tackle a profession-wide problem with their category-leading platform.”</p>
<p>In terms of looking to the future, Keating says there is a bigger data model opportunity within CoLab that the company plans to leverage and that the company will continue to aim to give engineering teams a suite of tools that can help combine and automate their day-to-day activities.</p>
<p>“Long-term, it’s about plugging into each and every tool engineers have. We’d love to be plugged into Slack, Microsoft Teams and Jira so that when someone logs into CoLab, it’s their home base,” Keating said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no question that fintech has exploded in recent years. But along with that, we have also seen a related surge in funding into companies that provide the infrastructure that financial institutions &#8212; incumbents and fintechs alike &#8212; need in order to operate faster and more competitively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">São Paulo-based <a href="https://pismo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pismo</a> is one of those infrastructure providers. And today, the startup announced it has raised $108 million in a Series B funding round led by SoftBank. Interestingly, the financing also included “strong participation” from e-commerce giant Amazon and Silicon Valley-based venture firm Accel along with Falabella Ventures, PruVen and existing backers Redpoint eventures and Headline. With the latest raise, Pismo has now raised a total of $118 million in funding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fact that Amazon has invested in a LatAm infrastructure provider for the financial services industry is notable. It appears that the company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is investing time and energy in Latin America, and with that, is thinking about the payment methods and the infrastructure that consumers of Amazon services will have.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219797" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2016, Pismo has racked up a list of big-name customers, including </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banco Itaú (one of Brazil’s largest banks), BTG, Cora, N26 and Falabella. Its “platform” handles more than 4 billion API calls monthly and hosts more than 30 million accounts, which combined result in over $3.5 billion in transaction volume a month. For some context, at the beginning of this year, it was doing less than $1 billion per month in transaction volume, according to CEO and co-founder Ricardo Josua. It ended 2020 with less than 10 million accounts total. It’s growing at a rapid clip, adding about 2.5 million accounts monthly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a SaaS business, Pismo mostly makes money </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">by charging transaction fees. It charges per active account, so prices decrease based on volume. In other words, the more clients a customer has, the less they pay per account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pismo’s cloud-native core processing platform is aimed at giving banks, fintechs and other financial institutions “flexibility and agility,” said Josua. It does things like allow customers to launch products for cards and payments, digital banking, digital wallets and marketplaces. Pismo also claims to allow financial institutions to “take charge of their core data and use it intelligently.” Think of it as Latin America’s answer to Galileo.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are here to help these institutions to not be constrained and be ready for the next generation of payments and banking services,” Josua said.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219947" style="width: 208px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219947" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2219947 " src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pismo.jpg?w=166" alt="Pismo" width="198" height="358" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pismo.jpg 640w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pismo.jpg?resize=83,150 83w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pismo.jpg?resize=166,300 166w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pismo.jpg?resize=375,680 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Pismo.jpg?resize=28,50 28w" sizes="(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219947" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Pismo</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s achieved great success in LatAm, the company plans to use its new capital to expand outside the region as well as to “accelerate the development” of technologies for banking, payments and financial markets infrastructure. Pismo already has customers in Asia and is planning to open offices in the United States (in Austin, Texas) and the United Kingdom (in Bristol).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All our major competitors are global players,” Josua said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It also plans to invest in sales and go-to-market strategy. To this point, it has invested with no sales team and very little marketing effort, according to Josua.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this year, Pismo hired a former McKinsey partner, Vishal Dalal, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vishal-dalal-to-lead-international-expansion-of-pismo-one-of-the-worlds-most-advanced-financial-platforms-301232525.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to serve as its CEO of global operations</a>. Josua is no stranger to the financial space. He also founded <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/conductor-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conductor (now called Dock)</a>, which is widely considered to be LatAm’s first payments &amp; banking-as-a-service platform, and former executives of that company joined him to start Pismo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One year ago, the central bank [of Brazil] launched an instant payment solution. Banks and fintechs were scrambling,” Josua told TechCrunch. “Since we had built the technology for this new generation, we were ready and 100% real time and institutions were able to implement without a single line of code. It is a very simple product that we think will be spread everywhere, even in the U.S.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pismo also, unsurprisingly, plans to do more hiring &#8212; specifically it’s looking for more than 200 engineers. The startup has scaled from a team of 40 in March of 2020 and now has over 250 employees, 85% of which it says are technical talent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But just don’t call Pismo a fintech or a BaaS company. Josua prefers the term “techfin” to describe what the startup does.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are a technology company first and foremost,” he said. “We even provide the infrastructure for BaaS companies. Five of our clients are providing BaaS solutions to their customers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its investors are bullish on the company&#8217;s potential, and not just in LatAm &#8212; but globally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alex Szapiro, head of Brazil and operating partner at SoftBank, considers Pismo to be a company that “developed from scratch a world-class technology able to solve many of the problems in finance in a very scalable manner.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Some of the largest banks and FIs in LATAM are already using Pismo not only for their digital attack initiatives but also for their core products, replacing outdated legacy providers,” he wrote via email. “At the same time, some of the most sophisticated fintechs are leveraging their products with their technology.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Szapiro believes that Pismo is in a unique position of being a &#8220;neocore&#8221; technology platform that is already running large-scale operations for financial institutions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The founders are outstanding and have great ambitions to make Pismo a truly global company,” he added in a written statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel partner Ethan Choi said his firm was looking for the “Galileo for LatAm” when it came across Pismo.  (Accel actually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/17/galileo-financial-raises-77-million-for-its-fintech-services-that-were-19-years-in-the-making/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invested in Galileo</a> before it sold to SoFi in October of 2019. )</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically, he said, Accel was looking for a company that provides the core infrastructure for fintechs but also a company that understood the nuances of the local market’s banking ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Pismo, Accel found those things as well as a founding team that had helped build a “Gen1” version of Pismo today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We knew when we were looking, it needed to be a next-gen API-first, cloud-based platform,” Choi said. “And that’s what Pismo is. It’s the most robust platform of its kind we could find in the region, and as robust as any platform we’d see globally. It can help with everything you can list that a fintech needs to do.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The UK&#8217;s antitrust watchdog will take a close look at the music streaming market.</p>
<p>Today the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-plans-probe-into-music-streaming-market">announced</a> that it will be conducting a market study of music streaming as soon as possible, as its latest piece of work aimed at expanding competition in digital markets.</p>
<p>It uses market studies to identify competition and consumers issues &#8212; and, if needed, to look at how best to tackle problems.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220104" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The development could have implications for how mobile app stores and music streaming giants like Apple Music and Spotify can operate in the UK in the future &#8212; if the CMA decides it needs to step in and impose corrective measures.</p>
<p>The exact scope of the study is yet to be determined but in a letter to MPs the regulator said it will prioritize the work &#8212; writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;On 13 October, the Board considered initial proposals to carry out a markets project on music streaming. They agreed that work in this area aligned with the CMA’s prioritisation principles, and that it supported a strategic goal of the CMA to foster effective competition in digital markets, ensuring they operate in a way that promotes innovation and the consumer interest. On this basis, the Board agreed that there was merit in taking forward a market study. They also agreed, in the light of the concerns you have collectively expressed, that this work should be prioritised: that is, it should be the next market study that the CMA launches. CMA staff will now prioritise more detailed further work to refine and scope this project. This will again be considered by the Board, with a view to formally commencing the market study as soon as practically possible.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The move follows a <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/work/646/economics-of-music-streaming/">report by a parliamentary committee</a> this summer which identified concerns over the economics of the music streaming market &#8212; such as the possible dominance of major music labels and the potential for contractual agreements between them and streaming services which could stifle innovation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Last month, in its response to the DCMS Select Committee report, the government asked the CMA to examine the economics of the market to dig into concerns around transparency and fairness.</p>
<p>In a statement today, Andrea Coscelli, CEO of the CMA, said: &#8220;The UK has a love affair with music and is home to many of the world’s most popular artists. We want to do everything we can to ensure that this sector is competitive, thriving and works in the interests of music lovers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the past decade, the music industry has evolved almost beyond recognition, with streaming now accounting for more than 80% of all music listened to in this country. A market study will help us to understand these radical changes and build a view as to whether competition in this sector is working well or whether further action needs to be taken.&#8221;</p>
<p>The CMA is building out its knowledge base on all things digital and is set to have an expanded role in overseeing the digital sphere as the government is in the process of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/27/the-uks-plan-to-tackle-big-tech-wont-be-one-sized-fits-all/">reforming digital competition rules</a> to respond to concerns about the impact of tech giants.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/uks-digital-markets-unit-starts-work-on-pro-competition-reforms/">Digital Markets Unit</a> has already been set up inside the regulator &#8212; pending legislation to establish its full powers. But the CMA has not been sitting on its hands waiting for the government to pass reforms.</p>
<p>It has previously conducted a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/03/uks-cma-launches-investigation-into-digital-advertising-and-its-potential-harm-to-consumers/"> study of the online advertising market</a> &#8212; which led to a raft of concerns being identified that appear to be informing the government&#8217;s reshaping of UK digital competition rules.</p>
<p>It has also stepped in and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/11/google-wont-end-support-for-tracking-cookies-unless-uks-competition-watchdog-agrees/">put a regulatory brake on Google&#8217;s plans</a> for phasing out third party tracking cookies &#8212; garnering commitments from the tech giant over how its planned &#8216;Privacy Sandbox&#8217; alternative will function. That investigation remains ongoing.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the CMA also opened <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/uks-cma-opens-market-study-into-apple-googles-mobile-duopoly/">a market study of Apple and Google&#8217;s dominance of the mobile ecosystem</a>. And <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk/">Apple&#8217;s App Store is simultaneously under investigation</a> by the regulator.</p>
<p>On the music streaming front, European Union regulators are a little ahead of their counterparts in the UK &#8212; back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/europe-charges-apple-with-antitrust-breach-citing-spotify-app-store-complaint/">April</a> the Competition Commission charged Apple with an antitrust breach related to competition in the music streaming services market.</p>
<p>European music streaming rival, Spotify, had long complained about Apple&#8217;s T&amp;Cs being &#8216;unfair&#8217;, although the EU&#8217;s competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, claimed its case is not about Spotify &#8212; saying that rather it&#8217;s about the conditions that Apple imposes on all music streaming providers that are trying to reach customers via its App Store.</p>
<p>Since the EU has identified concerns it&#8217;s a fairly safe bet the CMA&#8217;s market study will also find some issues to be addressed.</p>
<p>But it remains to be seen what the UK regulator may suggest if it does find problems &#8212; with a range of possible outcomes available to it, such as making recommendations to government to change regulations or public policy; encouraging relevant businesses to self-regulate; taking consumer or competition law enforcement action against firms; or opening a more in-depth market investigation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most FMCG brands rely on a combination of owned and outsourced assets to carry out delivery operations</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The variety of both models brings about a fragmented logistics cycle and FMCGs can lose significant value in the process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://illa.com.eg/">ILLA</a> is an Egyptian startup that provides full-stack delivery solutions to corporates and small businesses in the FMCG sector. And today, it is announcing the close of a $2 million funding round to scale across Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Having worked for over 15 years in the FMCG industry working for Coca-Cola, Clorox and others, I could see firsthand the kind of fragmentation that exists within logistics operations for big-name FMCG brands, and that called for a better approach than the existing solutions,&#8221; said Mahmoud El-Zomor, the startup&#8217;s CEO who founded the company in 2019.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219830" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon sensing a need for such a service, El-Zomor teamed up with his co-founders &#8212; Alaa Jarkas, Ahmed Sakr and Hossam Saraya &#8212; who have some background in the industry to build ILLA</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ILLA services </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are designed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for distributors, food and beverage chains, hotels, hypermarkets, manufacturers and other stakeholders involved in the FMCG industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has a unified platform and centralized operations team that handles middle-mile delivery logistics for FMCGs. The delivery provided by the company reduces friction between the brands and logistics suppliers as complete visibility of operations </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is assured</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its launch, the Egyptian startup has completed more than 250,000 transactions from over 65 clients</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some of these names include Coca-Cola, P&amp;G, Danone, Nestlé, Juhayna, and PepsiCo.<br />

<p><div id="attachment_2220094" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2220094" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2220094" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC07765-copy-Copy.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="355" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC07765-copy-Copy.jpg 6000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC07765-copy-Copy.jpg?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC07765-copy-Copy.jpg?resize=300,156 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC07765-copy-Copy.jpg?resize=768,400 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC07765-copy-Copy.jpg?resize=680,355 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC07765-copy-Copy.jpg?resize=1536,801 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC07765-copy-Copy.jpg?resize=2048,1068 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DSC07765-copy-Copy.jpg?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2220094" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ILLA</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Mohamed Emera, the company&#8217;s director of growth, ILLA is targeting the FMCG logistics head-on, which speaks to the company&#8217;s focus on disrupting the market in Egypt. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bigger picture is global, where fragmentation in supply chain is a $1 trillion market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That focus on the industry affords us leverage to dig deep into the problem and find solutions from within, that and the unique nature of delivery specific to FMCG gives us room for innovation that others cannot afford,&#8221; said the director.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the company digs deep to find more solutions from within, it also plans to use this investment to fuel growth in Egypt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In addition, ILLA wants to &#8220;disrupt the traditional route-to-market for FMCG companies and SMEs while building more around its tech platform to deliver more value to its clients and drivers alike,&#8221; the CEO remarked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investors who led the round include Watheeq Financial Services and Golden Palm Investments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Others that participated are Loftyinc Capital Management, Kepple Africa Fund, Cubit Ventures, AUC Angels, Oqal Angel Network and Flat6Labs Cairo &#8212; it&#8217;s the accelerator&#8217;s third time investing in the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Khaled Zaidan of Watheeq Financial Services said, &#8220;With the onset of covid, the global supply chain management industry is suitable for modernization, and ILLA is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">uniquely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> positioned as an end-to-end execution platform.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Middle-mile logistics is one of the most underinvested segments of the global supply chain market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. ILLA has identified this massive opportunity in MENA and is offering a full-stack B2B supply chain management platform enabling FMCG brands to reach retailers </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">directly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at the lowest cost per case. Mahmoud and team are utilizing the trucking logistics shared economy and tech automation to innovate within a large and fast-growing market,&#8221; AJ Okereke, a partner at Golden Palm Investments, added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Berlin-based on-demand grocery delivery and dark store operator <a href="https://gorillas.io/en">Gorillas</a> has grabbed &#8220;close to&#8221; $1 billion in Series C funds, in the latest sign of the searing investor interest driving activity in urban food shopping apps across the continent and beyond.</p>
<p>The round is being led by another food-focused on-demand delivery startup &#8212; German&#8217;s Delivery Hero &#8212; which<a href="https://www.deliveryhero.com/newsroom/delivery-hero-invests-in-gorillas/"> confirmed</a> it&#8217;s invested $235M in Gorillas to grab around 8% of the upstart grocery delivery startup.</p>
<p>Gorillas already passed a unicorn valuation back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/gorillacorn/">March this year</a>, even though it was only founded last year. It&#8217;s now being valued at $2.1BN, pre-money &#8212; and touts the Series C as largest funding raise of a non-listed business in the European grocery delivery sector.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220056" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>Commenting in a statement, Kağan Sümer, CEO and founder, said: &#8220;The size of today&#8217;s funding round by an extraordinary investment consortium underscores the tremendous market potential that lies ahead of us. With Delivery Hero, we have chosen a strong strategic support that is deeply rooted in the global delivery market, and is renowned for having unique experience in sustainably scaling a German company internationally. We have the best team in our sector, leading partners, and financial resources to strengthen our market-leading position in <span class="xn-location">Europe</span> and beyond.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also participating in the round &#8212; which comes just seven months after Gorillas bagged a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/25/gorillacorn/">$290M Series B</a> &#8212; are existing investors Coatue Management, DST Global, <span class="xn-money">Tencent</span>, Atlantic Food Labs, Fifth Wall, Greenoaks, A*; along with new investors G Squared, Alanda Capital, Macquarie Capital<span style="font-size: 12px;">,</span> MSA Capital and Thrive Capital.</p>
<p>The startup operates a network of urban dark stores to fulfil orders for speedy grocery deliveries within the cities where it offers a service (it&#8217;s available in more than 55 cities at this point, including <span class="xn-location">Amsterdam</span>, <span class="xn-location">London</span>, <span class="xn-location">Paris</span>, <span class="xn-location">Madrid, New York</span>, <span class="xn-location">Milan</span> and <span class="xn-location">Munich</span>).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since its founding in <span class="xn-chron">June 2020</span>, Gorillas has scaled to operate more than 180 warehouses across its nine international markets, and says its last-mile couriers (who are employed on <a href="https://gorillas.io/en/blog/11-things-you-need-to-know-about-gorillas">fixed-term contracts</a>, rather than gig workers) delivered more than 4.5 million orders in the past six months alone.</p>
<p>The company says it&#8217;s now entering a new phase of its business following the period of rapid international growth &#8212; which will focus on building a scalable and robust business infrastructure at the same time as trying to accelerate future growth.</p>
<p>Specifically it said the Series C will be used to bolster its footprint in existing markets while investing further into operations, people, technology, marketing and finance infrastructures &#8212; to ensure it stays focused on customer experience.</p>
<p>For its part, Gorllias&#8217; lead investor for the round &#8212; Delivery Hero &#8212; said the investment underlines its own commitment to quick commerce (aka q-commerce) globally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gorillas has been setting new standards for the delivery industry by offering an efficient and sustainable alternative to traditional grocers. We have been following their stellar growth over the past few months, and we are beyond excited to be now part of their journey. Both of our companies place a lot of value on creating a strong sense of community and we are convinced that our investment will positively impact employees, consumers as well as our industry,&#8221; said Niklas Östberg, CEO and co-founder of Delivery Hero in a supporting statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Delivery Hero is on a mission to advance quick commerce globally and we see Gorillas as one of the leaders in Europe and the US,&#8221; he added. &#8220;The Gorillas team has an exceptional customer focus driving the highest retention rates we have seen in the industry. This has enabled them to reach over $300M revenue run-rate in only one year with continued double digit monthly revenue growth. We truly believe that investing in innovative q-commerce players will benefit the entire industry and set a new standard for what a great customer experience looks like.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the early pandemic, a few weeks before Gorillas was born, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/16/delivery-hero-ceo-shares-what-hes-learned-about-managing-logistics-during-a-pandemic/">TechCrunch discussed the grocery delivery market</a> with Östberg &#8212; who noted that it was seeing &#8220;a larger willingness&#8221; among its customer base to have more than hot meals delivered.</p>
<p>A year and a half later Europe&#8217;s landscape for on-demand delivery continues to be a highly volatile, high cash burn mix.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">HT Aero, an urban air mobility (UAM) company that&#8217;s an affiliate of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng, has announced a $500 million Series A raise. The company will use the funds to acquire top-tier talent, advance R&amp;D and &#8220;continue to gain airworthiness provision and certification&#8221; as it advances towards the next generation of its vehicles, according to Deli Zhao, founder and president of the company.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our next-generation model will be a fully integrated flying vehicle and automobile, designed for both low-altitude air travel and road driving,&#8221; Zhao said in a statement. &#8220;We are planning for an official roll-out in 2024.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>HT Aero recently revealed its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZUj6BaWWik&amp;ab_channel=ElectricVehicles">fifth-generation flying vehicle, the Xpeng X2</a>, which can handle autonomous flight take-off and landing for certain city scenarios, back-end scheduling, charging and flight control. The company says it wants to provide UAM solutions for individual consumers, rather than businesses, which would certainly be in line with Xpeng&#8217;s goals.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220024" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Xpeng, along with IDG Capital and 5Y Capital, led the funding round, which HT Aero says is the largest single-tranche fundraising in the low-altitude flying vehicle space in Asia. A consortium of investors including Sequoia China, Eastern Bell Capital, GGV Capital, GL Ventures and Yunfeng Capital also participated in the round. Xpeng is the only strategic investor out of a group of purely financial investors, which signals that the EV manufacturer is getting more serious about owning the future of mobility.</p>
<p>As part of its investment in HT Aero, Xpeng will be able to help share knowledge with the company on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/xpeng-lidar-adas/">autonomous vehicle technology</a>, one of its strengths, as well as help with logistics and supply chain management. HT can also leverage Xpeng&#8217;s manufacturing capabilities, a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>HT Aero&#8217;s UAM vehicles will also have a part to play in Xpeng&#8217;s mobility ecosystem that aims to integrate driving and flying. Xpeng&#8217;s CEO, He Xiaopeng, plans to go into further detail about that ecosystem at the company&#8217;s Tech Day event, to be held on October 24, along with other updates into autonomous technology, flying vehicles, supercharging technology and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/08/a-chinese-ev-startup-wants-to-build-a-ridable-robot-unicorn-for-kids/"> robotic unicorns</a>.</p>
<p>Honda Motor Company (HMC) also r<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/honda-motor-co-announces-plans-for-evtol-avatar-robots-and-space-technologies/">ecently announced plans to integrate different forms of mobility into one ecosystem</a>. Marcos Frommer, manager of corporate communications at HMC, revealed various scenarios in which future consumers can tap into one app to book everything from robotaxis to eVTOLs.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our mission has always been to explore efficient, safer and carbon-neutral mobility solutions that go beyond smart EVs,&#8221; said Xiaopeng in a statement. &#8220;What we are seeing is the integration of the three driving forces of smart mobility – disruptive technology, new sources of energy and mass production. We will embrace this opportunity, which is unprecedented in the history of modern transportation.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">According to an SEC Form D filing, <a href="http://www.sisu.vc">Sisu Game Ventures</a>, a Pre-Seed and Seed fund which invests in gaming startups <a href="https://sec.report/Document/0001863012-21-000001/">has raised a $50m</a> first close of its new fund. However, the company declined to comment.</p>
<p>Paul Braigel of Sisu, which launched in 2014, did however comment that the firm had made several investments over the summer, including in a Zynga founder’s new venture. Sisu team members have been involved as entrepreneurs, operators and investors in companies like Remedy, Unity, Disney, Niantic, Funcom and EA. </p>
<p>The fund has so far made 14 investments. Half in existing portfolio companies, such as in Resolution Games and Lightheart Entertainment, and the rest in new additions, including Theorycraft Games, Playco, and Core Loop.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219693" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Braigel said the Sisu fund III investor base is almost exclusively from the games industry, including global studios like Supercell, platform holders and publishers like Sony and Ubisoft, as well as individual founders of studios.</p>
<p>Bragiel said: “A number of founders from the Sisu family have gone on to start multiple successful ventures and these are the kind of founders we love to support. Our goal is that if we invest in a founder once, we hope to back all future companies they start”.</p>
<p>Sisu says it invests before a product is ready and metrics are there, it also works with individual founders in a &#8216;studio builder&#8217; format.</p>
<p>Recent examples of this include Lightheart Entertainment with their first game Mr. Autofire, as well as Mainframe Industries with their yet unannounced cloud-native MMO.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>So far the fund has had 8 exits, including Small Giant Games acquisition by Zynga for 700m, but also King acquiring Hatrabbit, Helsinki Gameworks acquisition by Next Games and Flaregames acquisition of Kopla Games.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For independent retailers, inventory financing is often a complicated and lengthy process that ties up their working capital. <a href="https://www.bondaval.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BondAval</a>, an insurtech startup with offices in London and Austin, Texas, is focused on helping them access better credit terms while providing assurance to suppliers that they will be paid on time.</p>
<p>The company announced today it has raised $7 million led by Octopus Ventures, with participation from Expa and returning investors Insurtech Gateway, TrueSight Ventures and founders like Monzo and GoCardless’s Tom Blomfield, ComplyAdvantage’s Charlie Delingpole and Entrepreneur First’s Matt Clifford.</p>
<p>BondAval’s flagship product is MicroBonds, currently available in the United States and United Kingdom. Meant as an alternative to traditional bank guarantees and collateral-based instruments, which can take months to secure, Microbonds are non-cancellable exposure coverage policies that use a credit risk engine, don’t require collateral and are available almost instantly online. Merchants buy MicroBonds to guarantee they will fulfill a contract with a wholesaler. If a merchant needs to file a claim, it is also processed and paid out almost immediately, reducing their business risks.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220029" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>BondAval was created in 2020 by co-founders Tom Powell and Sam Damoussi, who believe that giving all businesses, regardless of their size, access to affordable investment-grade payment security can fortify the entire supply chain, helping SMEs compete on a more even playing field with large corporations.</p>
<p>MicroBonds are <a href="https://www.bondaval.com/news/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed by Hamilton and Beat Capital Insurance Services in the U.S.</a>, and <a href="https://www.bondaval.com/news/7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arch Capital Group and Hamilton Insurance Group in the U.K.</a></p>
<p>The new funding, which brings BondAval’s total raised to $9 million, will be used on growth, hiring and building its technology and provisioning services.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In a statement, Octopus Ventures’ fintech investor Tosin Agbabiaka said, “For decades, companies looking to guarantee future transactions were forced to stomach high costs, significant collateral requirements, and a slow, analogue process. BondAval’s technology changes that, applying surety to micro B2B transactions to transform the cost structure of the product.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over 90% of global shipped goods are transported by some 50,000 marine transport vessels. Even though shipping by sea is reasonably environmentally friendly, marine transportation still represents 3% of total global greenhouse gas emissions and consumes more than €150bn in fossil fuel annually.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ankeri.net/">Ankeri</a>, is a Reykjavik, Iceland,-based startup that is all about making the data needed to to calculate fuel efficiency, carbon emissions, and logistics data for those maritime logistics.</p>
<p>It says its cloud-based platform unifies all this disparate commercial and technical ship information, applies algorithms and helps charterers discover the highest energy efficiency and least carbon emissions options.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219647" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s now raised €2M in late seed funding from Frumtak Ventures to help the marine transport industry reach global transparency and decarbonization goals.</p>
<p>This new round will help Ankeri strengthen its presence in North America, Europe and Asia. Ankeri counts German shipping company Hapag-Lloyd among its customers.</p>
<p>The company, founded in 2016 by Kristinn Aspelund and Leifur Kristjansson, previously raised €930k from local investors and grant funds including Iceland’s New Business Venture Fund and the Iceland Technology Development Fund.</p>
<p>Aspelund said: “We are currently seeing immense friction in the global marine shipping sector, driven in large part by pandemic-related ripple effects, significant data blindspots due to antiquated manual, static processes, and increasingly stringent decarbonization regulations. By modernizing and digitizing the ship charter processes, Ankeri brings significant transparency to the broad fluctuations in pricing and performance across vessels and carriers, which can equate to nearly €1 million in reduced total annual costs of operations.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Perhaps most importantly, the collection and utilization of vessel fuel consumption and emissions data within our platform informs more sustainable vessel selection decisions by cargo charterers and serves as a turning point in meeting marine transport decarbonization goals,” he added.  </p>
<p>Napa, Q88 and AXS are perhaps the closest competitors, however, this area of transport (like many long running supply chain, construction and industrial processes) is really still mostly manual, with plenty off spreadsheets, email and old habits of working.</p>
<p>Svana Gunnarsdóttir, Managing Partner at Frumtak Ventures said: “We know that some of the largest challenges in the global supply chain are transport inefficiencies and poor systems interoperabilities that impede data collection and analysis, and drive up costs. Ankeri is helping to solve these problems technologically while incorporating into its solutions strong core financial and environmental sustainability values.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gloucester, Massachusetts-based <a href="http://cometeer.com">Cometeer</a> has been around for nine years. In that time, the company has built up a mad scientist&#8217;s lair worth of coffee scientists, equipment and processes to jolt some fresh life into the industry. Based out of a former frozen seafood facility, the company has created a multimillion-dollar proprietary production line to turn beans into flash-frozen little &#8220;pucks&#8221;, sealed in capsules to keep their flavor intact. The 10x strength brew is then ready to use.</p>
<p>Pick beans. Roast them. Grind them. Add water. Drink. Coffee really doesn&#8217;t have to be complicated, but every year a dozen new startups come jittering along to try to find new and innovative ways to inject some flavor and caffeine into the drab, meaningless existence of a technology journalist. Most of those startups are safely ignored, because the vast majority of them will be gone by the time you think of writing a &#8220;where are they now&#8221; round-up at the end of the year. Still, when a fistful of investors pump a total of $100 million into an upstart, you&#8217;d best believe that even the most under-caffeinated reporter begrudgingly shoves some toothpicks to prop open their eyelids, and pays attention.</p>
<p>The previous round was $50 million, closing in April of 2020. In the current round of financing, the company harvested $35 million from D1 Capital, Elephant, Tao Capital, Addition Ventures, Avenir, Greycroft Partners and TQ Ventures, along with a number of coffee-expert angel investors. The company declined to disclose the valuation of the funding round.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2217872" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To brew the pods, you &#8220;melt&#8221; the puck by dropping it in a cup of hot or cold water, wait a bit, and you&#8217;ve got a fresh cup of joe on the go. The only thing you need is some water, and a way of heating the water, if it&#8217;s hot coffee your little heart desires. The capsules stay fresh for up to three years if you keep them in the freezer, and will survive for about three days in the refrigerator.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219427" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219427" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2219427" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FrozenCapsule.png?w=680" alt="Frozen Cometeer Capsule" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FrozenCapsule.png 3502w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FrozenCapsule.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FrozenCapsule.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FrozenCapsule.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FrozenCapsule.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FrozenCapsule.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FrozenCapsule.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/FrozenCapsule.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219427" class="wp-caption-text">The Cometeer capsules are flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen to preserve the flavor. In your freezer, they stay fresh for about three months. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cometeer</p></div></p>
<p>As for the coffee itself, the magic starts with the beans:</p>
<p>&#8220;Our roasting partners are the backbone of Cometeer. Equally as important as superior tasting roasts, considerations amongst our roasters is their support of coffee farmers, and commitment to direct trade purchasing at equitable prices multiple times the fair trade minimum,&#8221; explains Cometeer&#8217;s co-founder and CEO Matt Roberts. &#8220;We are focused on building out a diverse group of roasting partners with unique backgrounds, sourcing techniques and roasting styles. Alongside these partners, we look to support the de-commoditization of the coffee industry.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Cometeer has seen extreme growth over the past couple of years, growing from 12 to 120 employees since its previous round of funding. For now, the company is focusing on its direct-to-consumer play.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we are focused on direct to consumer right now, we are trialing on-premise with George Howell&#8217;s café in Boston and are piloting B2B coffee solutions with focus on corporate gifting,&#8221; explains Roberts.</p>
<p>The company shut down its wait-list today, making the coffee available for anyone who has a credit card and a hankering for a new frontier in Java technology. The capsules are two-buck-pucks, with a price tag of around $2.00 each &#8212; the base shipment is 32 capsules for $64.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google is set to announce new Pixel phones today. The company is holding an event at <strong>10 AM PT (1 PM in New York, 6 PM in London, 7 PM in Paris)</strong>. And you’ll be able to watch the event right here as the company is streaming it live.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian fintech CRED said on Tuesday it has raised $251 million in a new financing round, its third funding this year, at a valuation of $4.01 billion.</p>
<p>Existing investors Tiger Global and Falcon Edge Capital co-led the three year-old Bangalore-based startup’s Series E financing round. Marshall Wace and Steadfast also participated &#8212; and so did existing investors DST Global, Insight Partners, Coatue, Sofina, RTP, and Dragoneer. The startup was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/06/indias-cred-valued-at-2-2-billion-in-new-215-million-fundraise/">valued at $2.2 billion in an April round</a> this year and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/india-cred-raises-81m-buys-back-1-2m-shares-from-employees/">$806 million in a round it disclosed in January</a>.</p>
<p>TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/11/indian-fintech-cred-seeks-funds-at-5-5-billion-valuation/">reported</a> last week that CRED had finalized a financing round recently at a pre-money valuation of $3.75 billion. The outlet also reported that the startup has held preliminary talks about a new round, which could value it at about $5.5 billion. A CRED spokesperson said at the time that everything in the story was inaccurate. ($3.75 billion pre-money valuation + $251 million new raise = $4.01 billion post-money valuation.)</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2220035" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>CRED helps and rewards people improve their credit score by encouraging them to pay their credit card bills on time. The startup has amassed over 7.5 million members. (India has about 25 million unique credit card users.)</p>
<p>On its app, the startup offers its members access to a range of premium brands. The startup, unlike most others in India, doesn’t focus on the usual TAM of India — hundreds of millions of users of the world’s second-most populated nation — and instead caters to some of the most premium audiences.</p>
<p>“India has 57 million credit cards (vs 830 million debit cards) [that] largely serves the high-end market. The credit card industry is largely concentrated with the top 4 banks (HDFC, SBI, ICICI and Axis) controlling about 70% of the total market. This space is extremely profitable for these banks – as evident from the SBI Cards IPO,” analysts at Bank of America wrote in an earlier report.</p>
<p>“Very few starts-ups like CRED are focusing on this high-end base and [have] taken a platform-based approach (acquire customers now and look for monetization later). Credit card in India remains an aspirational product. The under penetration would likely ensure continued strong growth in coming years. Overtime, the form-factor may evolve (i.e. move from plastic card to virtual card), but the inherent demand for credit is expected to grow,” they added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup didn&#8217;t disclose what it plans to do with the new investment. But in recent weeks, TechCrunch has reported, CRED has held talks to invest in other fintech startups.</p>
<p>CRED recently invested $5 million in CredAvenue, which recently unveiled a $90 million Series A funding, and is in talks to back fintech startup Uni at a valuation of over $300 million, TechCrunch reported.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Founded in 2017, <a href="https://geniebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geniebook</a> is a Singapore-based learning platform that uses a combination of machine learning and human teachers to personalize each student’s education. The company announced today it has raised $16.6 million in Series A funding led by East Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners, with participation by angel investors including John Danner, founder of Dunce Capital; Gaurav Munjal and Roman Saini, founders of Indian edtech unicorn Unacademy; Snapdeal founders Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal; and senior executives from Grab, Shopee and Gojek.</p>
<p>Geniebook’s founders say it is profitable, and its revenue has grown over 2,000% since the beginning of 2019. It now has a user base of 150,000 students, and 350 employees across offices in Singapore, Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
<p>Most of Geniebook’s students are based in Singapore and Vietnam, and it plans to use part of its funding to continue growing in those markets before focusing on other Southeast Asian countries. The startup’s Series A brings its total raised to about $18 million. Geniebook’s last round of funding was a $1.1 million pre-Series A round in 2019 from Apricot Capital.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219195" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Geniebook offers English, mathematics and science courses based on Singapore’s national curriculum for primary and secondary school students. The platform’s three core features are GenieSmart, or practice sheets customized for students with AI-based tech; live online classes, called GenieClass, that can host up to 900 students at a time; and GenieAsk, where a teacher and teaching assistant are assigned to groups of 50 students for class discussions and help.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219200" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219200" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2219200" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Geniebook-Co-founders-2.jpg?w=551" alt="Geniebook co-founders Neo Zhizhong and Alicia Cheong" width="400" height="494" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Geniebook-Co-founders-2.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Geniebook-Co-founders-2.jpg?resize=122,150 122w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Geniebook-Co-founders-2.jpg?resize=243,300 243w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Geniebook-Co-founders-2.jpg?resize=768,948 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Geniebook-Co-founders-2.jpg?resize=551,680 551w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Geniebook-Co-founders-2.jpg?resize=41,50 41w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219200" class="wp-caption-text">Geniebook co-founders Neo Zhizhong and Alicia Cheong</p></div></p>
<p>The startup was founded by Neo Zhizhong and Alicia Cheong, who met while they were in university. Cheong tutored math, Neo tutored science and the two often referred students to one another. Eventually, they decided to set up a brick-and-mortar tutoring center, which quickly became profitable. While figuring out how to scale the center, the two started incorporating tech elements into classes, before deciding to make the business fully online in 2017. “We realized technology can change the way teachers teach and students learn,” Neo said.</p>
<p>Though Geniebook became an online platform well before the start of the pandemic, Neo said COVID-19 created a lot more awareness among parents and students. “Southeast Asia is a $60 billion market for private education and the market suddenly became a $60 billion market for <em>online</em> education.” As students got used to live-streaming classes, they started to expect more personalized and interactive content, he added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Instead of generic worksheets, each student’s homework is customized by GenieSmart, which uses a neural network to pick questions based on their strengths and weaknesses, so they don’t have to answer questions about concepts they are already comfortable with. The communities led by teacher/teaching assistant pairs are another way to keep students motivated. Neo said Geniebooks’ personalization features is one of the ways it differentiates from other learning platforms like Koobits and Superstar Teacher.</p>
<p>“One of the questions any educator needs to answer is ‘how do we create an environment that engages a community of learners by themselves,’ so educators don’t have to keep nagging learners, because then kids will just be like ‘please don’t talk to me anymore,’” said Neo.</p>
<p>In Geniebook’s communities, students are encouraged to work together, with teachers and teaching assistants providing learning content, guidance and corrections. Students are also rewarded with points for completing worksheets or answering questions correctly that can be redeemed for things like Roblox’s virtual currency and Apple App Store credits (though some save them up to get holiday presents for their parents).</p>
<p>Each teacher works with several communities of students. To help them as the platform scales up, Geniebook will implement an AI chat function to answer basic and frequently-asked questions.</p>
<p>Geniebook’s new funding will be used to hire for leadership roles, build its product development team and market expansion.</p>
<p>In a statement about the funding, Lightspeed partner Dev Khare said, “The Southeast Asia region has several countries with exam-driven cultures where Geniebook’s worksheets and cohort-based live learning approach delivers a premium experience with measurable improvement in student outcomes.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Primer &#8212; a UK startup that has built a drag-and-drop framework to help merchants easily build payment stacks to sell online &#8212; has seen rapid take-up of its services in the 20 months since it launched. Now the company is announcing a Series B of $50 million at a $425 million valuation to double down on the opportunity to do more.</p>
<p>ICONIQ Growth &#8212; the growth-stage arm of the San Francisco <a href="https://iconiqcapital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wealth management and investment firm</a> connected to Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Jack Dorsey and other high net-worth tech executives &#8212; led the round with existing investors Accel, Balderton Capital, Seedcamp, Speedinvest, and RTP Global among those also participating.</p>
<p>Primer today works across more than 20 countries and has some 45 integrations that its merchant users can add to their payment flows, ranging from payments providers like Stripe, Apple Pay, Adyen and Braintree, through to fraud screening from Riskified, sales tax calculations from TaxJar, and more. When a user creates a payment workflow, Primer creates a separate line of code that developers can use to integrate what&#8217;s been built on Primer.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219869" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The plan will be both to add in more integrations, to expand the kinds of relationships Primer builds with the wider payments ecosystem, and to build new services for merchants, too.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are building out a whole suite in the next year to aid merchants with operations, and the observability of the payment stack,&#8221; said Paul Anthony, Prime&#8217;s co-founder and CEO.</p>
<p>There is a curious paradox in the world of e-commerce.</p>
<p>On one side, e-commerce companies spend a lot of time (and money) in trying to build experiences that are as simple as possible, to keep shoppers sticking around, interested and buying things.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On the other, payments &#8212; which are at the heart of all e-commerce experiences &#8212; are notoriously fragmented.</p>
<p>&#8220;Preferred payment method&#8221; changes depending on which country you go to; and so too do the different companies that are part of the payments process, and the services that can be (and should be) rolled in with payments, such as identity verification.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one reason why so many embedded payments companies have emerged over the years: they have done all the hard work knitting several transactions and stakeholders in the payments process together, and now all a merchant needs to do is add a couple of lines of code to their sites for payments to appear and work.</p>
<p>Payments companies, keen to grow their business and their margins, are consolidating a number of commerce technology providers &#8212; for example, Stripe has been on something of an acquisition spree this year bringing in tools to calculate sales tax, to help manage identity verification, and more &#8212; but Primer believes that this is not the full story.</p>
<p>Anthony and his co-founder Gabriel Le Roux saw some of the pain points that bigger merchants faced first-hand when they worked together at Braintree. Even with the might of PayPal at their disposal, those merchants still faced a lot of complexity in building and maintaining their payments stacks.</p>
<p>Primer&#8217;s mostly mid-market customers &#8212; they include micro-mobility startup Voi, Freddie’s Flowers and Parkopedia &#8212; helping with payments strategy and use to engage with customerson average use between 4 and 5 services in their payments stack, Le Roux said, and that number is slowly growing.</p>
<p>The importance of a tool like Primer is not just to make it much easier to build the payments check-out flow (eg, creating a tree where you can map out all of the options of what happens when a person tries to make a purchase and it&#8217;s rejected or approved by, say, a card company) but simply to give those merchants an easier way of having a choice of providers, testing out different payments services and more.</p>
<p>“Over the past two decades, the pace of new payment solutions entering the market has been accelerating dramatically to support global consumer demand for trends like mobile payments, digital wallets, 1-click checkout, buy now pay later, and so on,&#8221; said Roy Luo, a partner at ICONIQ Growth, in a statement. &#8220;However, no one payment solution is close to accommodating all the changes and innovations that merchants need to keep up. So, for merchants’ payment and engineering teams, this dynamic forces immense technical complexity in tying together multiple payment methods, gateways, fraud detection, and more.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The people who work on shipping vessels are vital to world trade, but they still experience a lot of arcane hiring processes. Many lack transparency about important things like pay or even the working conditions of they ships they will spend months on. Maritime recruitment platform <a href="https://www.seafair.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seafair</a> was created to solve these problems. It vets seafarers and shipping operators and uses matching algorithms to fit crew members with the right vessels.</p>
<p>The company announced today it has raised $5.7 million led by General Catalyst, with participation from FirstMinute Capital, Signal Ventures, TA Ventures, SV Angel, SpeedInvest and returning investor FJ Labs. This brings Seafair’s total funding to about $7 million.</p>
<p>Seafair was launched late last year by Agapitos Diakogiannis, who was born and raised in Greece, and its current clients include one of the world’s top 100 shipping companies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219187" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Greece is one of the global superpowers in shipping, so when I was working in consulting, I became close to the industry and really fell in love with it.”</p>
<p>After consulting, Diakogiannis spent time in venture capital, were he saw how labor marketplaces are disrupting industries like construction, manufacturing, oil and gas.</p>
<p>Diakogiannis realized he had the network to address a large market opportunity, but there was another reason for starting Seafair. After talking to seafarers, he realized how opaque the hiring process is. Many people have trouble finding jobs even though their labor is in high demand and they don’t know a lot about working conditions or payment before accepting a placement.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Maritime intelligence platform Greywing raises seed funding from investors like Flexport&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/maritime-intelligence-platform-greywing-raises-seed-funding-from-investors-like-flexport/embed/#?secret=iu1k6gYSE2" data-secret="iu1k6gYSE2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Seafair matches workers with shipping companies based on their background, skills and performance, and uses matching algorithms to make the process of filling vacancies more efficient. It also provides vessel operators with human resources software that helps them consolidate data that is otherwise siloed in different ERP platforms and spreadsheets. Seafair is currently focused on senior officer roles, like chief engineers and ship masters, since those positions are the ones that have the most certification and training to track.</p>
<p>Shipping companies are based around the world, but about 50% of seafarers come from Eastern Europe and the Philippines, so they typically rely on agencies to staff vessels. Since agencies rely on hiring commissions to make money, however, they might not always provide the best fits for openings, Diakogiannis said.</p>
<p>Seafair provides a digitized and more transparent version of traditional agencies (and is licensed to operate as an agency in Ukraine and the Philippines, with more countries planned).</p>
<p>First, seafarers upload their CVs online, then Seafair runs a series of background checks and online assessments. If it decides someone is a good fit for a vessel, the platform schedules interviews. If they are hired, Seafair starts the deployment process, including digital contracts.</p>
<p>The platform also verifies employers and the vessels under their management before they can start using Seafair. The startup’s HR software includes tools to manage payments, insurance, schedules and rest hours. Some of its features customized to the maritime industry include alerts for when a seafarer’s certifications are going to expire, and salary recommendations to help increase retention rates.</p>
<p>Seafair’s new funding will be used to build more technology for seafarer vetting and expand in markets including Germany, Nordic countries and the United States.</p>
<p>In a statement, General Catalyst managing director Niko Bonatsos said, “The maritime industry is one of the last untapped frontiers. One needs deep industry insights, an ambitious vision and a determined team to succeed in a market like this—and we saw all the above in Seafair.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Shared micromobility operator Lime is on track for third quarter adjusted EBITDA profitability, marking this as the second profitable quarter in the company&#8217;s history, according to CEO Wayne Ting. During the Wall Street Journal Tech Live event, Ting said COVID has turned from a &#8220;headwind into a tailwind,&#8221; heralding more prosperous times in the year to come.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Around this time last year, at the WSJ Future of Everything event,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/lime-touts-a-2020-turnaround-and-2021-profitability/"> Ting also boasted of the company&#8217;s movement</a> beyond the financial hardships of the pandemic and toward Q3 profitability. Lime said it was operating both cash flow positive and free cash flow positive, with expectations to be full-year profitable in 2021. Unfortunately, COVID got in the way again.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219923" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;The Delta variant led to additional lockdowns and delays of cities opening up around the world, which impacted projected top-line revenue,&#8221; Russell Murphy, senior director of corporate communications at Lime, told TechCrunch. &#8220;Even without tourism and commuting returning to pre-COVID levels, we&#8217;re glad that demand has returned and we&#8217;re anticipating a continued surge in ridership in 2022.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ting said bottom-line growth is what made a difference this year. Q3&#8217;s top line was about the same as the same quarter in 2019, give or take 1% to 2%, and that was not a profitable quarter. This means that although Lime was not able to generate more sales and revenue, it was able to spend its money and manage its operating costs far more efficiently.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP accounting measure that many startups use to give a more comparable picture of their financial performance. Factors like stock-based compensation for employees are often removed from adjusted EBITDA, which can make it all but impossible to truly understand a company&#8217;s cash flow position without an official SEC filing. Ting did not mention cash-flow positivity during the event.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Lime has done things like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/lime-plans-for-modes-beyond-bikes-and-scooters-in-2021/">deploy its Gen4 scooters with swappable batteries</a>, which can certainly help streamline charging processes. Better-quality scooters and bikes that last longer also remove some of the significant costs of vehicle depreciation while bolstering unit economics. The company said it was also able to drive operational efficiencies with learnings from running a large, global micromobility fleet, but didn&#8217;t provide specifics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;The business is coming back even though some of our biggest use cases are still not back, so commute is not back, tourism is not back,&#8221; said Ting. &#8220;What we&#8217;ve actually seen is we dramatically grew what we call &#8216;intercity travel.&#8217; People are using us versus alternatives because we are open-air, single passenger, because people want a greener way to move around. And when I look forward to 2022, commute is going to come back to some extent, tourism is going to come back. We just announced opening travel from Europe, and all those are going to be tailwinds going into next year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lime is also relying on shifting consumer sentiments to grow revenues, particularly around younger generations and climate change.</p>
<p>&#8220;The number one source for carbon pollution in the United States is transportation,&#8221; said Ting. &#8220;If we want to fundamentally solve carbon from transportation we have to look at lighter weight alternatives like scooters and bikes, and we have to invest in public transportation. When you talk to young people, this is deeply felt by them and they&#8217;re changing their behavior to meet this moment.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook already allows users to cross-post their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/359139904893501?id=526867548205796">Instagram Stories</a> and <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/launching-reels-on-facebook-us/">Reels</a> to Facebook. Now it&#8217;s testing a new feature that would see posts flowing in the other direction, too. The company recently rolled out an option that allows users to cross-post their Facebook updates that include photos or videos over to their Instagram. For people who are active on both platforms, the feature could save you from having to upload the same media twice in two different apps. It also gives Facebook an easy way to seed Instagram with more content at a time when the company is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/16/technology/instagram-teens.html">invested in ensuring Instagram remains</a> a popular social media platform with younger users in the face of increased competition from apps like Snapchat and TikTok.</p>
<p>Facebook said the feature, which has yet to be formally announced, first began to roll out earlier this month. However, the company noted the option is currently a global test that&#8217;s only available to a small group of people who already have their Facebook profiles linked to a personal, creator or business account on Instagram.</p>
<p>If available, you&#8217;ll see the feature in Facebook&#8217;s compose box where you create posts. The new toggle appears besides those for editing the audience for your post and creating a new album.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219874" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2219885" style="width: 598px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219885" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2219885" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1429.png?w=680" alt="" width="588" height="347" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1429.png 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1429.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1429.png?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1429.png?resize=768,453 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1429.png?resize=680,401 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1429.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219885" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screenshot from the Facebook app on iOS</p></div></p>
<p>When tapped, you&#8217;ll be taken to a new screen where you can choose to share the individual Facebook post to your connected Instagram account, as well. The screen informs you this option will only apply to the post in question &#8212; it won&#8217;t become the default setting going forward.</p>
<p>If you do want to change your defaults, though, you can visit the linked &#8220;Accounts Center,&#8221; where you can now toggle on an option to automatically share all your Facebook Posts to Instagram, in addition to automatically sharing your Facebook Stories to Instagram Stories. (The latter was previously available.)</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2219905" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2219905" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2219905 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IMG_1430-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2219905" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Screenshot from the Facebook app on iOS</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company told us users will be able to cross-post to Instagram single photos, single videos or multiphoto albums up to 10 photos — the max that&#8217;s supported through Instagram&#8217;s carousels. Other formats, like GIFs, polls, photos albums with more than 10 photos, Feed reshares, text-only posts and any media that&#8217;s too tall for Instagram&#8217;s Feed are not eligible for cross-posting at present.</p>
<p>Facebook has been working to make its suite of apps more interoperate in recent months &#8212; and not just by making cross-posting an option for those who use multiple apps.</p>
<p>The company last year introduced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/facebook-introduces-cross-app-communication-between-messenger-and-instagram-plus-other-features/">cross-app communication between Messenger and Instagram</a>, allowing Instagram users to chat with friends who use Facebook and (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-messenger-releases-cross-app-group-chats-further-integrating-with-instagram/">as of last month</a>) vice versa. It&#8217;s also been working on making Messenger more of a &#8220;connective tissue&#8221; for Facebook&#8217;s growing number of real-time experiences and has been testing a way that Facebook users could <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/messenger-celebrates-its-10th-anniversary-with-new-features-and-a-plan-to-become-the-connective-tissue-for-real-time-experiences/">make voice and video calls right on Facebook</a> without having to switch to the Messenger app. And last month, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/facebook-revamps-its-business-tool-lineup-following-threats-to-its-ad-targeting-business/">revamped its ad products</a> to include more tools that would allow people to message businesses on any of Facebook&#8217;s chat platforms, instead of just the one where they&#8217;re seeing the ad. That means users could click an Instagram ad to chat with a business on WhatsApp, for example.</p>
<p>If this all makes it a bit more confusing to determine what content lives where and who&#8217;s using which app, that could be by design. The tighter integrations may make it more difficult to fully exit Facebook, as content and communications flow between the Facebook suite of apps. In addition, the complexity could be hard to unravel in the case that regulators decide to break up Facebook into separate businesses, if it were to be declared a monopoly at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Facebook did not say how long the global test would run or when it would roll out more broadly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ford Motor Company is investing $316 million (£230 million) to transform its Halewood, U.K. vehicle transmission facility into an electric power unit plant, making it Ford&#8217;s first EV component in-house assembly site in Europe.</p>
<p>The investment is subject to and includes about $42 million (£30 million) from the U.K. government through its Automotive Transformation Fund, according to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=the+times+uk+ford+halewood&amp;sxsrf=AOaemvIONEXZTRmBpXYdkBQ5JycJJVObbw%3A1634596414710&amp;ei=PvZtYezhKoK-3LUPoq6P4Ao&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjs-JiVgtXzAhUCH7cAHSLXA6wQ4dUDCA4&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=the+times+uk+ford+halewood&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBwghEAoQoAEyBwghEAoQoAEyBwghEAoQoAEyBwghEAoQoAE6BwgAEEcQsAM6BQghEKsCOggIIRAWEB0QHjoFCCEQoAFKBAhBGABQiyZY8S5gxy9oAXACeACAAfQBiAGpC5IBBTAuMy40mAEAoAEByAEIwAEB&amp;sclient=gws-wiz">The Times</a>. Some 500 local automotive jobs will be saved as a result of the investment, the paper said.</p>
<p>Power units produced in the plant will supply all-electric passenger and commercial vehicles sold in Europe, helping the company inch toward its electrification goals. Earlier this year,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/17/ford-to-go-all-electric-in-europe-by-2030/"> Ford announced its European strategy</a> to only sell electric vehicles on the continent by 2030 and to only produce electric commercial vehicles in Europe by 2024. The company spent $1 billion to revamp an assembly factory in Cologne, Germany and predicts that electric models will account for two-thirds of its European sales.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2219821" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The power unit is what replaces the engine and transmission in an ICE vehicle; it manages the flow of electricity delivered by the battery and controls the speed of the electric motor and the torque it produces. Ford estimates power unit production in Halewood will begin in mid-2024, with planned capacity at around 250,000 units per year. The automaker did not respond to requests about whether the power units will be sent to the Cologne facility or elsewhere for assembly.  Historically, the Halewood factory exports 100% of its production, helping to make Ford one of the U.K.&#8217;s largest exporters of engines and transmissions from its facilities to &#8220;more than 15 countries on six continents, with overseas sales generating around £2.5 billion ($3.5 billion) annually,&#8221; according to the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this highly competitive, global race to secure electric vehicle manufacturing, our priority is to ensure the U.K. reaps the benefits,&#8221; Kwasi Kwarteng, the U.K. government’s business secretary and member of parliament, said in a statement. “Today’s announcement, backed by government funding, is a huge vote of confidence in Britain’s economic future and our plans to ramp up electric vehicle production. It will future-proof Halewood’s proud industrial heritage and secure high-skilled, well-paid jobs across the North West for years to come.”</p>
<p>Europe isn&#8217;t the only place Ford is expanding its electric capabilities. The automaker has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/fords-30b-investment-in-electric-revs-up-in-house-battery-rd/">$30 billion to play with</a> by 2025, and the fruits of its labor in China have finally dropped. On Monday, the first Mustang Mach-E manufactured in China rolled off the assembly line. Customers in China will have access to the locally produced Mach-E by the end of the year through Ford&#8217;s direct sales network of EV city stores, according to the company. Ford says it&#8217;s on track to open 25 stores in major metro areas this year and expand to more than 100 within the next five years.</p>

<h2>Astra completes its investigation into August&#8217;s sideways launch</h2>
<p>It appears that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/astra-completes-investigation-into-august-launch-failure-aims-for-next-attempt-in-october/">small rocket startup Astra has identified</a> the root cause of the anomaly that led to its launch failure at the end of August. Evidently, it was due to a propellant leakage, which caused one of the engines to shut down one second after launch, Astra&#8217;s chief engineer Benjamin Lyon <a href="https://astra.com/news/launch-and-learn-lv0006/">said in a blog post</a>. The subsequent asymmetrical engine firing that came after led the rocket to hover and drift in the air before managing a brief vertical ascension.</p>
<p>Even as it recounted the debacle, the company is ready to try again, opening the launch window for its next attempt on October 27. The rocket, dubbed “LV0007,” will carry a test payload for the U.S. Space Force.</p>

<h2>Steve Wozniak and Alex Fielding want to create &#8220;the Google Maps of space&#8221;</h2>
<p>Rumors were swirling in September after Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak tweeted a link to a one-minute promo video on YouTube for a new company called Privateer. Sleuths started to wonder if the new company might have to do with orbital debris or space junk &#8212; cleaning it up, perhaps?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Not quite. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/12/steve-wozniak-privateer-space-company/">I got the lowdown</a> on the new startup from co-founder Alex Fielding, who told me that Privateer&#8217;s aim is to create concrete and actionable knowledge regarding the location of space debris. As it turns out, what info we do have isn&#8217;t that great. To solve this problem, Privateer aims to send up its first demo spacecraft, dubbed Pono 1, next February; subsequent launches will follow.</p>
<p>“I’m an optimist and I still am very, very, very afraid that we’re too late, that we’re probably within 24 months of the first on-orbit human space casualty,&#8221; Fielding said. &#8220;And the reason for that is just the proliferation in low Earth orbit.”</p>
<h2>A new partnership between defense and venture capital</h2>
<p>This week, I chatted with the co-founders of Embedded Ventures, an eleven-month-old venture capital firm that&#8217;s recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/13/u-s-space-force-partners-with-vc-firm-embedded-ventures-under-new-rd-agreement/">entered into a novel agreement</a> with the U.S. Space Force. This news interested me because the two entities are using a partnership agreement called a CRADA &#8212; a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement &#8212; that&#8217;s never before been used with a VC fund.</p>
