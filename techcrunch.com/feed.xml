										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Two months after its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/upmesh-wants-to-build-a-community-driven-discovery-app-for-southeast-asian-live-commerce/"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">seed round</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> announcement, Singapore-based startup <a href="https://upmesh.io/sg">Upmesh</a> has raised a $7.7 million pre-Series A round led by Monk&#8217;s Hill Ventures. The new funding brings its total raised so far to $10.5 million.  </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Upmesh will use the pre-Series A funding to expand its regional presence in Southeast Asia and launch its first Instagram live selling app and backend automation features like logistics automation. It also plans to double down on its live commerce products. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Since its seed round, Upmesh has nearly doubled its online merchants in less than three months with a growing merchant base by 30% month on month. In October, Upmesh was used by almost 300 live commerce merchants in Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines, with an annualized gross merchandise value of $40 million.  </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245161" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Upmesh’s tool helps merchants grow sales through analytics to identify their best-selling product items and patterns in buying behaviors. Its tool also provides e-commerce functions that automatically capture orders made in livestream comments and send a checkout link to buyers. At the same time, sellers go live on social media platforms like Facebook Live and Instagram Live.   </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Upmesh competes with e-Commerce platforms like Shopee and Lazada and SaaS tools, including Shopline, but the company offers live commerce on social media that attract more buyers and audience and provide automation to help customers grow their business, said Wong Zi Yang, CEO and co-founder of Upmesh.</span></p>

<p>Upmesh also tailors its order capturing tools to meet the expectations of sellers and buyers in different Southeast Asia countries unlike other companies that provide order-capturing tools for live commerce like CommentSold and Dibsly, Wong said in October.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Upmesh users range from mom-and-pop street shops selling on live streams to supplement foot traffic to specialized live commerce sellers moving thousands of stock-keeping units (SKUs). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“Live commerce is transforming eCommerce and shaping the buying behavior of the digital consumer in Southeast Asia. While Upmesh provides a full technology and service stack to enable live commerce, it is even more critical to enabling small and medium sellers at scale. Small and medium sellers from the fastest-growing segment in eCommerce and their needs are largely unmet. Upmesh is focused on meeting their needs,” said Kuo-Yi Lim, co-founder and managing partner of Upmesh. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“We are glad to join forces with Monk’s Hill Ventures in our mission to transform eCommerce. We are united in our shared belief that community is the next frontier for eCommerce, and live commerce is the ideal medium for bringing community and commerce together,” said Wong. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian ride-hailing giant Ola has raised $139 million at a valuation of about $7.3 billion, it said in a filing, ahead of its plans to file for an initial public offering early next year.</p>
<p>Mumbai-headquartered financial giant Edelweiss led the new investment tranche. IIFL, Siddhant Partners, Tejal Merchantile, Hero Enterprise also poured money, Bangalore-headquartered Ola said in the filing, which was <a href="https://entrackr.com/2021/12/ola-valuation-crosses-7-3-bn-completes-geospoc-acquisition-for-3-5-mn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first reported</a> by Indian news outlet Entrackr.</p>
<p>The new investment comes five months after SoftBank-backed Ola <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/temasek-and-warburg-pincus-invest-500-million-in-ola/">raised $500 million in a round</a>, one of the largest in the internet consumer segment in India, led by Temasek and Warburg Pincus. Ola co-founder and chief executive Bhavish Aggarwal had also invested in that round, the firm said at the time.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245196" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Ola &#8212; which operates in India as well as Australia, the U.K. and New Zealand and has over a million drivers on its platform &#8212; said at the time that its ride-hailing business had rebounded after New Delhi eased restrictions in the country.</p>
<p>Separately, Ola Electric has raised $52.7 million in a round led by Temasek, the firm said in a filing. This investment comes two months after Ola Electric, which spun out of Ola in 2019, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/ola-electric-raises-200-million-at-3-billion-valuation/">raised $200 million at a $3 billion valuation</a> in a round led by Alpha Wave Global (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/falcon-edge-closes-first-tranche-of-10b-fund-rebrands-as-alpha-wave-global/">formerly known as Falcon Edge Capital</a>). Aggarwal also spearheads Ola Electric.</p>
<p>The firm, which unveiled its electric scooters in August, has delayed the delivery of the vehicle several times citing chip shortage. Furthermore, Bangalore-headquartered mobility startup Bounce this month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/bounce-infinity-e1-launch/">launched its own electric scooter</a> that is more affordable than Ola Electric’s offerings.</p>
<p>But the issues don’t stop there. Both Ola and Ola Electric have seen several key executive departures in recent months as a result of what Indian outlet Morning Context reported as <a href="https://themorningcontext.com/internet/bhavish-aggarwal-is-choking-ola" target="_blank" rel="noopener">toxic work culture and distrustful chief executive</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/byjus-geogebra-austria/">Byju’s buys Austrian edtech startup GeoGebra:</a> </strong>Indian edtech giant Byju’s is once again buying a smaller company, this time GeoGebra, or what TechCrunch described as an “interactive and collaborative mathematics learning tool.” We reported the purchase price as around the $100 million mark.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-apologizes-to-current-employees-for-blundering-the-execution-of-mass-layoffs/">That awful CEO is sorry about how he fired you:</a> </strong>By now you have seen the video of Better.com CEO Vishal Garg firing a big chunk of his staff in a stilted video call, despite having pulled forward hundreds of millions of dollars from a future fundraise to finance his company’s operations. He went viral, amazingly, with TikToks cropping up mocking his pretty sucky way of firing a bunch of folks before the holidays. Now he’s apologizing. Surely he will shape up now and stop committing such epic gaffes. We’re certain.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/synthesia-raises-50m-to-leverage-synthetic-avatars-for-corporate-training-and-more/"><strong>Synthesia’s bet on corporate avatars:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Jordan Crook wrote up a $50 million round for a startup betting on synthetic avatars and the work of turning PowerPoints into videos. It’s one of those ideas that if it takes off, will appear obvious in hindsight. Today, the future is less certain. Still, when it comes to doing something fresh, Synthesia is a good example of how startups can tinker with the digital world and perhaps write a new path forward for businesses more generally.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we get into a chunk of the day’s incremental startup news, Ron Miller <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/as-corporate-venture-accelerates-twilio-jumps-into-the-fray/">wrote up Twilio’s new corporate venture capital fund</a>. CVC is not a new idea, but it has seen its activity soar in recent quarters. Companies like Coinbase are rewriting the rulebook on how to invest from the corporate perspective. So, it’s not a <em>huge </em>shock to see Twilio jump into the game.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/black-ops-ventures-launches-to-invest-in-black-founders/">And speaking of new venture funds:</a> </strong>TechCrunch has a brief look today at Black Ops Ventures, a new $13 million fund built to invest in Black founders. While some progress has been made in terms of investing more frequently — more equitably, really — into Black-founded startups, the venture capital market remains markedly imbalanced. Here’s one step toward a more fair future.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/developer-productivity-startup-gadget-raises-8-5m-led-by-sequoia-and-bessemer/"><strong>Gadget raises $8.5M from blue-chip backers:</strong></a> Bessemer and Sequoia have teamed up to put $8.5 million into Canada-based Gadget, which builds software for developers. Per TechCrunch, the startup “bundles the tools, libraries, APIs and best practices needed by developers into a single experience.” DevOps is a huge industry, frankly, so this round is not a shock to our sensibilities.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/chainguard-seed-software-supply-chain-security/"><strong>Software supply chains need protection as well:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Never before have we spent so much time as a society discussing supply chains. I bet you know where more ports are than ever before. But <em>physical</em> supply chains are hardly the only type out there, it turns out. Chainguard just raised $5 million to help protect <em>software</em> supply chains, an important project given how some cyberattacks are targeting software dependencies to carry out impressive hacks.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/candela-hydrofoiling-electric-boats-24m-investment/"><strong>Electric boats?</strong></a><strong> </strong>Boats may be the plaything of the wealthy, but they are also a pretty good way to pollute the planet. Candela wants to fix the latter half of the preceding sentence with electric boats and just raised $24 million for its business.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/afero-raises-50m-series-c-for-its-security-focused-iot-platform/"><strong>Afero raises $50 million for its IoT platform:</strong></a> The IoT hype has died down, and from its ashes a number of companies are doing rather well. Samsara is going public next week — more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/samsara-could-become-a-decacorn-in-upcoming-iot-themed-ipo/">here</a>, if you’d like — and security-focused IoT platform Afero just put together eight figures of capital to scale its own service.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/nigerias-digital-payroll-platform-bento-expands-to-kenya-rwanda-and-ghana-to-enter-six-other-african-markets-in-2022/"><strong>Bento targets Kenyan, Rwandan, Ghanan markets:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Bento is a Nigeria-based “digital payroll and human resource management platform,” TechCrunch reports. Just don’t expect it to stay within its national borders — the startup has eyes on six new markets in the next year. Payroll and HR software, of course, are big the world around, so it’s not a surprise to see Bento scaling well in the African market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/lydia-grabs-another-100-million-for-its-european-financial-super-app/"><strong>Lydia adds crypto to its platform, then $100M to its accounts:</strong></a> TechCrunch noted when Lydia, an aspiring European financial super app, added both equity and crypto trading to its service. Today, the company announced a fresh $100 million funding round. The company is a reminder that France’s startup scene is not one that you should ignore.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/accounts-payable-automation-startup-tipalti-raises-270m-quadruples-valuation-to-8-3b/">Tipalti now worth $8.3B:</a> </strong>While midmarket accounts payable automation may not be the Most Fascinating Topic in the world, that fact doesn’t stop it from being lucrative. As Bill.com has built a huge business helping SMBs with the financial back office, Tipalti wants to help businesses one level larger. It just socked away $270 million at a new $8.3 billion valuation. The company was worth just $2.2 billion last October when it raised $150 million.</li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seven years ago, San Francisco Bay Area startups attracted more than 40% of all U.S. seed- and early-stage venture dollars.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But according to &#8220;Beyond Silicon Valley,&#8221; a report released today by investment firm Revolution and PitchBook, that percentage fell to 27% this year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It’s been more than 10 years since that percentage fell below 30%,&#8221; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/silicon-valleys-share-of-us-vc-funding-falls-to-lowest-level-in-more-than-a-decade/">reports Mary Ann Azevedo, who interviewed Case and studied the report&#8217;s findings.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She identified several factors that are pushing investors in major tech hubs to venture outside their own backyards in search of opportunities. Many readers will be surprised to learn which city is now the top destination for dollars from NYC and SF-based investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This momentum we&#8217;re seeing now? You ain&#8217;t seen nothing yet,&#8221; said Case.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Niantic announced a Pokémon GO feature today that will incentivize users to conduct more AR scans of landmarks in their neighborhood. This user-generated data will help Niantic build its &#8220;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/niantic-raises-300m-at-a-9b-valuation-to-build-the-real-world-metaverse/">real-world metaverse</a>,&#8221; which will be powered largely by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/niantic-reveals-its-vision-for-a-real-world-metaverse-releases-lightship-ar-developer-kit/">Lightship</a>, its free AR Development Kit (ARDK).</p>
<p>In Pokémon GO, users visit PokéStops, which represent real-world places &#8212; these can be anything from a mundane mailbox, to a major historic site, to a cool statue that you never noticed in your neighborhood. Pokémon GO&#8217;s landmark database has gotten much bigger over time, but it was already pretty huge at launch — thanks largely to data submitted by players of Ingress, the game Niantic built back when it was a tiny side-project inside of Google.</p>
<p>To <a href="https://niantic.helpshift.com/a/pokemon-go/?p=web&amp;s=top-articles&amp;f=scanning-a-pokestop&amp;l=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conduct an AR scan</a> of a PokéStop, you tap a scan button and are then prompted to walk slowly around the area while your camera captures data about your physical, real-world surroundings. Players have the option to wait until later (perhaps when they&#8217;re connected to Wi-Fi) to send Niantic their scan. These scans help build out a 3D world map for Niantic&#8217;s games, as well as those developed through the ARDK.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245103" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>You&#8217;ve been <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/armapping-researchtask/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">able to scan</a> PokéStops and Gyms within the game for a while now, but there&#8217;s been little incentive for players to do so. Now scanning a PokéStop will cause it to &#8220;<a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/power-up-pokestop-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">power-up</a>,&#8221; yielding better in-game rewards for any player who visits the stop before said power-up wears off. Spinning a PokéStop always gives players items to help them catch Pokémon, but a powered-up Stop will give them even more.</p>
<p>PokéStops will have three visually distinct levels: they reach level one at five scans, level two at 10 scans and level three at 25 scans. The higher the level, the longer the power-up will last, and the more items it will reward. For Niantic, meanwhile, more scans = higher fidelity data.</p>
<p>&#8220;Scanning new places will help create exciting new AR experiences for Trainers worldwide, and long term will help create a Real-World Metaverse, where people can explore the world overlaid with digital creations,&#8221; the company said in an announcement.</p>
<p>While all players will be able to spin a powered-up Stop, they&#8217;ll have to reach level 20 before they can scan a landmark themselves — a way, perhaps, of avoiding spam uploads.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri testified before Congress for the first time Wednesday, defending the app’s impacts on teens and its aspirations to bring younger children formally into the fold.</p>
<p>In September, leaked documents from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen painted a picture of a company that knows it takes a toll on the mental health of some of its most vulnerable users.</p>
<p>“Thirty-two percent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse,” researchers said in an internal presentation, reported by The Wall Street Journal. Internal research also found that within a group of teen Instagram users who said they experienced suicidal thoughts, 13% of British users and 6% of American users connected their desire to commit suicide to Instagram.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245121" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company now known as Meta conducted that research internally and it was only brought to light through a revelatory series of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports in The Wall Street Journal</a>. The leaked documents came up repeatedly in Wednesday&#8217;s hearing, with lawmakers on the Senate&#8217;s consumer protection subcommittee citing the revelations and pressing unsuccessfully for access to more of Instagram&#8217;s internal findings on its impacts on kids and teens.</p>
<h3>Disturbing findings</h3>
<p>In his opening statement, subcommittee chair Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said that just prior to the hearing, his staff again made a test to explore dangerous content on Instagram and easily found algorithmic recommendations serving dangerous content. &#8220;&#8230;Within an hour, all of our recommendations promoted pro anorexia and eating disorder content.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ranking member Marsha Blackburn&#8217;s own office also made a test account for a teen and noted that it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/head-of-instagram-adam-mosseri-says-teen-accounts-created-on-the-web-dont-default-to-private/">defaulted to &#8220;public&#8221; rather than private</a>, as Instagram says that accounts for users under 16 do. Mosseri admitted that Instagram failed to enable the safety step for accounts create on the web.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri says teen accounts created on the web don&#8217;t default to private&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/08/head-of-instagram-adam-mosseri-says-teen-accounts-created-on-the-web-dont-default-to-private/embed/#?secret=QDplk1KCPn" data-secret="QDplk1KCPn" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;This is now the fourth time in the past two years that we have spoken with someone from Meta and I feel like the conversation repeats itself ad nauseam,&#8221; Blackburn (R-TN) said during opening statements. &#8220;Nothing changes — nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the hearing, Mosseri followed Meta’s approach to recent damning reporting, dismissing some of the findings outright — even intuitive ones. In response to a question on concerns about Instagram&#8217;s addictive nature — a phenomenon that most Instagram users could attest to — Mosseri asserted that “Respectfully, I don&#8217;t believe that research suggests that our products are addictive.”</p>
<p>Prior to Mosseri’s testimony, Facebook’s Global Head of Safety Antigone Davis <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/">appeared before the Senate subcommittee</a> to address teen safety concerns. “We have put in place multiple protections to create safe and age-appropriate experiences for people between the ages of 13 and 17,” Davis argued, defending the company&#8217;s efforts.</p>
<p>Meta doubled down, defending its practices in light of the reports and Haugen’s subsequent testimony to U.S. lawmakers. The company argued that the precautions it takes on Instagram are adequate and that the research was taken out of context. “It is simply not accurate that this research demonstrates Instagram is ‘toxic’ for teen girls,” Facebook Head of Research Pratiti Raychoudhury wrote in a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post slamming The Wall Street Journal’s reporting</a>.</p>
<p>In late September, facing the firestorm of criticism, Mosseri announced that Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/instagram-puts-kids-version-on-ice-after-critical-backlash/">would pause its plans to develop Instagram Kids</a>, a version of the app specifically for children under 13. The company faces ongoing criticism from the mental health community and lawmakers in the U.S. and abroad who believe that Instagram is not a responsible custodian for the well-being of children and teens.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Instagram puts kids version &#8216;on ice&#8217; after critical backlash&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/instagram-puts-kids-version-on-ice-after-critical-backlash/embed/#?secret=bURsBgPSGN" data-secret="bURsBgPSGN" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In the hearing, Mosseri repeated the company’s argument that kids are already using the platform in spite of its age requirements and building a kid-specific app would create a layer of safety that doesn’t currently exist. “We know that 10- to 12-year-olds are online&#8230; we know that they want to be on platforms like Instagram,” Mosseri said. “And Instagram quite frankly wasn&#8217;t designed for them.”</p>
<h3>Meta still wants to regulate itself</h3>
<p>Mosseri also used the hearing to propose a new &#8220;industry body&#8221; that would create tech-wise best practices on issues like age verification, parental controls and product design for kids and teens. Mosseri also took the notable step of stating that Instagram would be willing to follow rules from this theoretical pseudo-regulatory agency in order to &#8220;earn some of our Section 230 protections.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blumenthal slammed Mosseri&#8217;s proposal for self regulation, pressing the Instagram head on what enforcement would look like in that scenario. Mosseri wasn&#8217;t eager to agree with Blumenthal&#8217;s suggestion that the U.S. Attorney General should be able to oversee enforcement if tech companies failed to meet their own standards. &#8220;Self policing based on trust is no longer a viable solution,&#8221; Blumenthal said, concluding the hearing.</p>
<p>Policy leads from YouTube, Snap and TikTok testified before Congress in October on the same issues, largely spending their time <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/26/tiktok-snap-youtube-hearing-congress/">contrasting their own policies</a> on kids and teens to those of rival Facebook. “Being different from Facebook is not a defense,” Blumenthal said during that hearing. “That bar is in the gutter. It’s not a defense to say that you are different.”</p>
<p>Last month, Instagram began <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/instagram-tests-take-a-break-reminders-on-an-opt-in-basis/">testing an opt-in feature</a> called “Take a Break” that would remind users to take up to a 30 minute break from the famously addictive app, if enabled. A day prior to Mosseri’s testimony,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/instagram-announces-plans-for-parental-controls-and-other-safety-features-ahead-of-congressional-hearing/"> that feature launched</a> alongside the announcement that Instagram would roll out its first set of parental controls in March of 2022. Those controls will allow parents to monitor and limit time spent on the app but fall short of the powerful controls <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/tiktok-expands-parental-controls-to-include-search-commenting-and-account-privacy/">offered by rivals like TikTok</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram is bringing back a chronological feed, according to statements made by Instagram head Adam Mosseri during <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/head-of-instagram-adam-mosseri-will-testify-before-the-senate-on-teen-mental-heath/">his testimony</a> today before a <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senate panel</a> over the harms to young people using the app. Mosseri was asked if he believed consumers should be able to use the Instagram app without &#8220;being manipulated by algorithms,&#8221; and the executive said he would support giving people the option to have a chronological feed. He then added that the company was developing that option now, in fact.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe in more transparency and accountability and we believe in more control. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re currently working on a version of a chronological feed that we hope to launch next year,&#8221; said Mosseri.</p>
<p>Pressed for more details on the company&#8217;s plans on this front, Mosseri noted that Instagram has been for a few years experimenting with different ways to offer users more control over their experience. One idea it tested publicly was called &#8220;Favorites,&#8221; which allowed users to pick a subset of people whose accounts they wanted to see at the top of their feeds. The other idea the company had been working on is a chronological version of Instagram, Mosseri said.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245109" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;I wish I had a specific month to tell you right now, but right now we&#8217;re targeting the first quarter of next year,&#8221; Mosseri noted as to when the chronological option would be introduced to the public.</p>
<p>Instagram&#8217;s switch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/15/filteredgram/">to an algorithmic feed back in 2016</a> was a decision that had been fraught with controversy. Although filtered feeds were becoming the norm across social media at the time, as they improved engagement metrics, many users were unhappy with the changes. Instagram even went so far as to agree to add more recent posts to its algorithmic feed<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/22/instagram-recent/"> due to the user backlash</a> in subsequent years after the new feed&#8217;s launch.</p>
<p>In 2020, the company had been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/13/instagram-latest-posts/">spotted building an internal prototype</a> of a &#8220;Latest Posts&#8221; feature that would allow users to get caught up on recent updates through a special section in the app, but it was not a full-fledged return to a reverse-chronological feed &#8212; like the one Facebook offers today as a News Feed option. The feature also never rolled out publicly to Instagram&#8217;s global user base.</p>
<p>Now, under oath, Mosseri is promising that users may actually get a chronological feed option once again. But it&#8217;s highly unlikely that Instagram would make this a default setting or even an obvious choice, given the benefits that an algorithmic feed brings in terms of keeping users engaged with the app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Crowdfunding platform Kickstarter is making a big bet on the blockchain, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/articles/the-future-of-crowdfunding-creative-projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcing</a> plans to create an open source protocol &#8220;that will essentially create a decentralized version of Kickstarter’s core functionality.&#8221; The company says the goal is for multiple platforms to embrace the protocol, including, eventually, Kickstarter.com.</p>
<p>Kickstarter is launching a new organization called Kickstarter PBC, which will begin development of the protocol. Kickstarter is funding the project, appointing an initial board for the organization and committing to be one of the first platforms on the protocol, though no specific timelines were offered for when such a transition might take place. The company also announced that they&#8217;re establishing an &#8220;independent governance lab,&#8221; which will publish research and engage with the community on the topic of protocol governance.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting path for Kickstarter, which already shares some philosophical DNA with blockchain products allowing consumers to support projects and build up a community around them while taking a stake in the success of those products. While the &#8220;stake&#8221; in Kickstarter&#8217;s model has been a completed physical or digital product, newer blockchain crowdfunding platforms are upending that model by giving users tokens tied to the projects which can accrue in value as the product matures. Some of these efforts are questionably legal, but there are endless ways to obfuscate what exactly is being bought and sold by users.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245083" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>For the time being it seems Kickstarter is aiming to proceed slowly in terms of how the protocol will impact the user experience. &#8220;As a user, the Kickstarter experience you’re familiar with will stay the same. You won’t &#8216;see&#8217; the protocol, but you will benefit from its improvements,&#8221; a blog post from the company reads.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">While web3 technologies have driven major excitement among technologists and amateur and professional investors alike, plenty of mainstream users still have hangups with the technology due to controversy around energy usage of some of the more popular networks, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. Kickstarter is aiming to sidestep these concerns by placing their new vertical on the Celo blockchain, which uses a less energy-intensive consensus mechanism that the team behind it bills as &#8220;carbon negative.&#8221; </span>Other than highlighting that the protocol will leverage Celo, Kickstarter didn&#8217;t offer too many specifics about how it envisions Kickstarter PBC&#8217;s work developing in the near or far term.</p>
<p>Kickstarter isn&#8217;t the only &#8220;traditional&#8221; tech giant looking to develop an open source protocol that their own platform will eventually adopt; Twitter has been working on bluesky, an effort to develop a decentralized social media protocol.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/head-of-instagram-adam-mosseri-will-testify-before-the-senate-on-teen-mental-heath/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">testifying before the Senate</a> today about the impact of Instagram on teens&#8217; mental health. His first appearance before the Senate, this is just one of several hearings that have taken place ever since whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked documents from Facebook &#8212; now Meta &#8212; showing that the company knew it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/seeking-to-respin-instagrams-toxicity-for-teens-facebook-publishes-annotated-slide-decks/">harming teen girls</a>.</p>
<p>In July, Instagram gestured toward teen user safety by implementing a policy that made all accounts from users under 16 <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/instagram-to-default-young-teens-to-private-accounts-restrict-ads-and-unwanted-adult-contact/">private by default</a>. But Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) said at the hearing that just yesterday, her team made an account for a 15-year-old, which didn&#8217;t default to private. She asked Mosseri directly why this happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;<span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">It</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">turns</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">out</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">that</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">we</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">default</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">those</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">under</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">the</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">age</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">of</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">16</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">to</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">private</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">accounts</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">for</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">the</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">vast</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">majority</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">of</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">accounts,</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">which</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">are</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">created</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">on</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">Android</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">and</span> <span class="transcript-snippet__content__body__word ng-star-inserted">iOS,&#8221; Mosseri said. &#8220;We have missed that on the web and we will correct that quickly.&#8221;</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245051" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Failing to uniformly implement the feature is a significant oversight for a company keen to look proactive on protecting its youngest users, particularly because the loophole remained open for months undetected.</p>
<p>Facing legislative pressure, Instagram continues to add more safety features like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/instagram-tests-take-a-break-reminders-on-an-opt-in-basis/">&#8220;Take a Break&#8221;</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/instagram-announces-plans-for-parental-controls-and-other-safety-features-ahead-of-congressional-hearing/">parental controls</a>, which will roll out in 2022. Following the whistleblower leaks, Mosseri paused the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/instagram-puts-kids-version-on-ice-after-critical-backlash/">development of Instagram Kids</a>, a product designed for users younger than 13.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple will not have to implement changes to its in-app purchase system and App Store guidelines as ordered by the judge&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/10/apple-prohibited-from-blocking-outside-payment-in-epic-ruling/">ruling in its court battle</a> with Epic Games. While Apple largely won that case, as the court ruled, Apple was not acting as a monopolist &#8212; the company had been ordered to stop preventing app developers from adding links that pointed users to other means of paying for their in-app purchases outside the App Store. Both Apple and Epic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/epic-games-appeals-last-weeks-ruling-in-antitrust-battle-with-apple/">appealed</a> the original ruling &#8212; Epic because it was not successful with its larger claims, and Apple because it disagreed with this aspect of the ruling over in-app purchases. Apple originally had until December 9 to update its App Store policies, but had asked the court for a stay on the injunction regarding the changes to its in-app purchasing guidelines until the appeal was decided.</p>
<p>The appeals court has now granted Apple more time before the injunction goes into effect. That means developers will have to continue to use the existing in-app purchase system Apple provides. They won&#8217;t be allowed to link to or steer users to their own websites for payments from inside their apps.</p>
<p>In a document filed today in the U.S. Court of Appels for the Ninth Circuit (see below), the court decided Apple had demonstrated &#8220;at minimum, that its appeal raises serious questions on the merits of the district court&#8217;s determination that Epic Games Inc. failed to show Apple&#8217;s conduct violated any antitrust laws but did show that the same conduct violated California&#8217;s Unfair Competition Law.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2245052" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The court additionally ruled that Apple has made a &#8220;sufficient showing of irreparable harm,&#8221; and so it granted Apple&#8217;s motion to stay part of the permanent injunction.</p>
<p>The stay will remain in effect until the appeals case is heard, the filing said.</p>
<p>Apple had tried before to argue its case for a stay and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/apple-ordered-to-comply-with-courts-decision-in-epic-games-case-over-in-app-payments/">the court denied the motion</a>. Its latest attempt was granted, after it changed tactics, arguing, among other things, that <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-threatens-commissions-on-in-app-purchases-outside-the-app-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it would have to come up with</a> a whole new system to commission purchases that took place outside the App Store.</p>
<p>Epic Games declined to comment on the court&#8217;s decision.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>An Apple spokesperson, however, shared the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re constantly evolving the App Store to help create an even better experience for our users and the incredibly talented community of iOS developers. Our concern is that these changes would have created new privacy and security risks, and disrupted the user experience customers love about the App Store. We want to thank the court for granting this stay while the appeals process continues.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The venture capital market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/07/global-startups-raise-158b-in-q3-an-all-time-record/">is on a tear</a>, pumping capital into a host of startups around the world. It&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/01/equity-tuesday-everyone-is-raising-money-at-the-same-time/">generally considered</a> a great time to raise capital and build a technology-centered, disruptive business.</p>
<p>For some, that is. While the venture capital boom of the last few years has helped a great number of founders, the capital is not landing equally. Women remain underinvested in, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/female-founders-are-making-a-buzzing-venture-backed-comeback/">despite some recent gains</a>. Black founders are raising more capital than ever, but still <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/something-ventured-funding-to-black-startup-founders-quadrupled-in-past-year-but-remains-elusive/">just a fraction of a fraction</a> of what others have managed in recent years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.blackopsvc.com/">Black Ops Ventures</a> wants to shake up the norm and invest in Black founders as its focus.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244345" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>TechCrunch caught wind of Black Ops&#8217; founding and recent first close thanks to our familiarity with one of its partners, <a href="https://twitter.com/motownini">James Norman</a>. He&#8217;s the founder <a href="https://www.pilot.ly/">of Pilot.ly</a>, a technology platform built to collect audience insights regarding video content, and a partner at <a href="https://www.transparentcollective.com/#/">the Transparent Collective</a>.</p>
<p>The Black Ops team, apart from Norman, includes managing partner <a href="https://twitter.com/hautrepreneur">Heather Hiles</a> (Udemy, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation), partner<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanartgreen/"> Sean Green</a> (<a href="https://arternal.com/">ARTERNAL</a>), and principal <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ebony-peay-ramirez-b8578119/">Ebony Peay Ramirez</a> (Oculus, <a href="https://plum20.com/">Plum2.0</a>).</p>
<p>The first Black Ops fund is worth $13 million to date, though we expect that number to rise after it completes a second close. The group&#8217;s first capital pool <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/black-ops-ventures-launches-new-seed-fund-to-invest-in-outstanding-black-tech-founders-301436281.html">was sourced</a> from corporations (Northwestern Mutual, Bank of America) and well-known technology denizens, including Drew Houston and Ben Horowitz.</p>
<p>TechCrunch spoke with Norman about the fund, curious about its general strategy. Per the founding member, Black Ops will invest at the seed stage, writing checks into rounds worth a few million dollars. The group&#8217;s intention, according to Norman, is to lead seed rounds, solving an issue that he&#8217;s seen with Black founders, namely that they wind up with interest from investors but no venture group willing to take point on their round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Black Ops intends to solve that by leading, allowing other capital pools to play catch-up with their own checkbooks.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s investments may also help overlooked founders hire folks that fall outside the networks of some more established venture capital groups. &#8220;If I went and raised a big round from some top-tier VC, do you think that those people can help me hire other people of color?&#8221; Norman asked TechCrunch rhetorically before supplying his own answer: No.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to build team [and] culture and scale a company in a way that&#8217;s sustainable over time and that fits the founder&#8217;s vision,&#8221; he said, adding that &#8220;the pieces of the [startup] puzzle that we&#8217;re gonna bring together are not available to Black founders anywhere else.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thesis at Black Ops &#8212; investing in Black founders &#8212; is pretty darn smart. There&#8217;s essentially infinite competition for white male founders coming out of a handful of U.S. schools. That dynamic leads to silly pricing at times, with investors competing with one another to get their capital into &#8220;hot&#8221; startups. Black founders rarely find themselves in a similar situation. That means that Black Ops will be investing in deals that, I presume, will both prove accretive for Black founders generally and lucrative for the firm itself.</p>
<p>Norman touched on this, saying that &#8220;nobody we ever pitched this [idea to] has ever heard the story that we pitched. We really detailed why this group of people is the biggest arbitrage opportunity to tech. [To] not invest in these people is crazy because you&#8217;re missing out on all the money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black Ops itself won&#8217;t be able to create parity in the venture capital world for Black founders, but it can make a dent in a problem that &#8212; despite all their wealth and putative brilliance &#8212; many venture groups have failed to tackle in any meaningful capacity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In 2014, more than 40% of U.S. seed- and early-stage venture dollars went to Bay Area startups.</p>
<p>But that was a long time ago.</p>
<p>In recent years, Bay Area startups have accounted for a smaller percentage of U.S. VC investment, according to <a href="https://revolution.com/beyond-silicon-valley-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;Beyond Silicon Valley,&#8221;</a> a new report co-produced by venture firm Revolution and PitchBook. So far in 2021, only about 27% of U.S. VC dollars have gone to Bay Area startups. It&#8217;s been more than 10 years since that percentage fell below 30%, the study said, despite the fact that the country is on track to see record amounts of venture funding overall this year. We dug into the report and talked to Revolution CEO and Chairman Steve Case about the findings.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244789" style="width: 2088px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244789" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2244789 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-08-at-9.13.15-AM.png" alt="" width="2078" height="1084" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-08-at-9.13.15-AM.png 2078w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-08-at-9.13.15-AM.png?resize=150,78 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-08-at-9.13.15-AM.png?resize=300,156 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-08-at-9.13.15-AM.png?resize=768,401 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-08-at-9.13.15-AM.png?resize=680,355 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-08-at-9.13.15-AM.png?resize=1536,801 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-08-at-9.13.15-AM.png?resize=2048,1068 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-08-at-9.13.15-AM.png?resize=50,26 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2078px) 100vw, 2078px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244789" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Revolution/PitchBook</p></div></p>
<p>Case is the founder of the Revolution trio of funds (including the Rise of the Rest Seed Fund), which focus exclusively on investing outside of Silicon Valley. Since launching the platform in 2014, Case and his teams have invested in 194 companies across 89 cities.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Not only is 2021 a record year for dollars raised, it&#8217;s panning out to be a record year for Bay Area- and NYC-based VCs who are investing in startups outside their regions. As recently as 2017, more than 50% of early-stage Bay Area dollars were received by Bay Area startups. Today, that percentage is 37%, according to the Revolution/PitchBook report.</span></p>
<p>In each of the past two years, at least $11 billion of Bay Area capital has been invested outside the three major ecosystems. A decade ago, that figure was under $3 billion.</p>
<p>“When we look at the industries of the future, and the companies of the future, they&#8217;re going to be dispersed around the country and around the world and if all you&#8217;re doing is investing in your own backyard, you&#8217;re going to miss out on all the opportunities to invest in some of the iconic companies of the future,” Case told TechCrunch.</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Peer-to-peer trading, face to face, eye to eye — it&#8217;s the way deals had been done for millennia, before distance and lack of trust forced us to use go-betweens such as banks and brokers to transact.</p>
<p>Now decentralized finance (DeFi) has taken us back to an over-collateralized future. We can transact peer to peer not only remotely but also trustlessly by interacting with a smart contract. This innovation has set the foundation for a financial renaissance that goes far beyond just replacing intermediaries.</p>
<p>Until recently, regulators have largely ignored this emerging parallel financial system. But with former blockchain professor Gary Gensler as chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, D.C. has woken up. The question is: How can authorities enforce regulations that don&#8217;t rely on the presence of intermediaries? And how will the regulation protect users and the market?</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244794" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<h2>Decentralization &gt; deterritorialization</h2>
<p>DeFi protocols might appear out of regulatory reach. Copies of blockchain transaction history are stored in nodes all over the world, ready to reappear like the many-headed hydra if one should be compromised.</p>
<p>Yet history provides lessons of how regulators might think they can address DeFi.</p>
<p>Historically, regulators have only held purview over legal entities within their jurisdiction. This changed with the extraterritorial Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) of 2010, which saw U.S. authorities regulating beyond their currency and U.S. persons across the world and coordinating with other jurisdictions by signing intergovernmental agreements (IGAs) for enforcement.</p>
<p>The EU followed a similar approach with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018, writing regulations from their ivory tower to control the data of Europeans wherever they are in the world — though it remains unclear how authorities can enforce against organizations outside the EU.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Looking ahead, we could see regulators rely on similar extraterritorial methods in an attempt to reach into cyberspace and enforce regulation in DeFi.</p>
<h2>Choke points and on-ramps</h2>
<p>Even with extraterritorial enforcement, however, regulators would still need to identify choke points that could be used to control otherwise decentralized protocols.</p>
<p>These points of centralization already appear to be on the radar of regulators. As Gensler <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptos-defi-projects-arent-immune-to-regulation-secs-gensler-says-11629365401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remarked</a>: DeFi can be a misnomer, with platforms often being &#8220;decentralized in some aspects but highly centralized in other aspects.”</p>
<p>Individual protocols with known developers, or those controlled by corporate token holders, might be pressured to get changes pushed to the protocol. And for protocols that are as decentralized as they claim — run by distributed anonymous communities — regulators could make interaction with the protocol illegal. Or, more likely perhaps, stymie the flow of funds by targeting on-ramps or marking certain protocols as toxic.</p>
<p>These on-ramps could be fiat-to-crypto exchanges or stablecoins that could be forced to incorporate due diligence and know-your-client procedures to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism (AML/CFT) efforts, etc. To be effective, these future controls will need to be built with DeFi in mind. This could see the sanction list published as a Chainlink lookup or a free API call from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) or Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) directly.</p>
<p>At the same time, individual protocols seeking to integrate with the real economy are likely to make trade-offs that work in favor of regulators.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://aave.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aave</a>&#8216;s know-your-client versions of liquidity pools are providing limited DeFi access to institutions by using on-ramps to KYC participants. They are able to mitigate risk by relying on organizations like Chainalysis to analyze blockchains for know-your-transaction (KYT), though this comes at the cost of depth of liquidity, and doesn&#8217;t grow the pie for all participants.</p>
<p>Other promising solutions include smart wrapping contracts that allow verified entities to deposit funds and automatically mint &#8220;fully compliant assets&#8221; that can be used in any DeFi protocol without having to KYC each time.</p>
<p>On the flip side, protocols may further decentralize; as we’ve seen recently, MakerDAO shut down legal entities and relies solely on the DAO. But while these fully decentralized protocols may remain out of reach of regulators, they could also be divorced from the real economy to an extent.</p>
<p>With these scenarios in mind, the question becomes not <em>how to enforce regulation </em>but what outcome the <em>regulations should be aiming to achieve</em>.</p>
<h2>How should DeFi be regulated?</h2>
<p>As to what changes should be pushed to protocol level, we now stand at a crossroads.</p>
<p>There is opportunity for the appropriate level of regulation to give DeFi enough breathing space to make a difference: boosting transparency, increasing financial inclusion and enabling credit to 8 billion people that will see the world take a tremendous jump toward prosperity.</p>
<p>Yet there is also potential for overreach that would stifle innovation and growth and have unintended consequences. Unfortunately, we seem to be well down this path already.</p>
<p>What is needed is the realization that DeFi shares many of the same goals as financial regulators: overhauling inflexible processes and delivering wider access, cheaper prices and more stability — all while ensuring these benefits are widely shared with all participants in the market.</p>
<p>For example, access to liquidity has long been a central concern not only for cryptocurrency and blockchain projects, but for financial markets in general. As per the Bank of England&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2019/andrew-hauser-panellist-at-trade-tech-fx-europe-barcelona" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Run Lola Run</a> speech of 2019, there is evidence that those that are further from liquidity get a worse and worse deal.</p>
<p>DeFi has the potential to create fairer, more transparent and more liquid markets through completely new mechanisms, helping everyone to reduce fraud and front-running, resolving fragmentation and creating markets that are efficient, resilient, fair and equally accessible to all — not just participants that have the right connections.</p>
<p>Defining the right regulation could make or break DeFi, and there are big questions to be answered: How do we establish wallet scores? How do we build in decentralized identifiers (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">W3C DIDs</a>)? And how can we ensure that any controls don&#8217;t work against financial inclusion?</p>
<p>Given such an opportunity to rebuild finance from the ground up, we need to be bold: Set clear objectives and create regulation that smooths the path to get to the new financial world — without simply settling for a faster version of what we have today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’re pretty big reading nerds here at TechCrunch, which means that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/gift-guide-the-best-books-for-2020-recommended-by-vcs-and-techcrunch-writers-part-1/">we like to collect yearly book recommendations</a> and share them with you.</p>
<p>With our own Danny Crichton having left the fold for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dannycrichton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pastures more Lux-urious</a>, The Exchange crew decided to take up the mantle of collecting and sharing book suggestions this year. To collect a wide sample, we asked venture capitalists to share their favorites from the year — not just books written this year, mind, but what they read in 2021 that they wanted to shout out — and divided the list into two parts.</p>
<p>Today we’re discussing books that don’t have a core focus on business. Tomorrow, we’ll flip the script and dive into recommendations that are business-focused. There’s a loose fiction focus today, and a nonfiction focus tomorrow, but divvying based on content type wound up being the most sensible way to parse our collected recs into two neat parts.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244806" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>In total, we had more than 80 unique recommendations, with several titles collecting more than one nod. It may not surprise you to learn that some science fiction titles were rather popular with the technology investing crew.</p>
<p>Before we get into the list, a note that next year we’ll ask founders to contribute. This year, we approached the data collection in a somewhat ad-hoc manner. Next year, we’ll smarten up, create a form and let more folks weigh in.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regardless, let’s talk about the best non-business books from some of the more influential business folks in the startup industry. (Also, The Exchange will be paywall-free today and tomorrow so that everyone can read.

<h2>The most recommended non-business books of 2021</h2>
<p>There was less overlap with fiction than we anticipated, but we did find some common notes. Let’s start with those:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0593135202/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0593135202&amp;linkId=21569ce4e18ad2f52b6a5ddfbd540704">Project Hail Mary</a>, by Andy Weir</h3>

<p>From the author of &#8220;The Martian&#8221; (very good) and &#8220;Artemis&#8221; (also very good), &#8220;Project Hail Mary&#8221; is a science-fiction romp that includes the things that Weir became known for with his earlier projects, namely problem-solving and space. If you liked &#8220;The Martian,&#8221; you’ll dig &#8220;Project Hail Mary.&#8221;</p>
<p>In terms of recommendations, <a href="https://twitter.com/vc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jake Chapman</a>, a managing partner at Alpha Bridge Ventures; <a href="https://twitter.com/zachcoelius" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zach Coelius</a>, a managing partner at Coelius Capital; and <a href="https://twitter.com/evdillon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ted Dillon</a>, an operating partner at Clean Energy Ventures, all gave it a nod.</p>

<p>The final titles of our most recommended section come from the same author. Costanoa Ventures’ investor <a href="https://twitter.com/amyecheetham" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Cheetham</a> gave us two picks from the same author, so we’re including them here as a pair. Both are historical fiction novels, in case that sways you one way or the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nightingale&#8221; is being turned into a movie, per the author’s website, and hit a number of bestseller lists. While we’re not familiar with her work, Cheetham gave us an author to dig into, precisely what we were hoping to uncover with this project.</p>
<h2>Recommendations that we can endorse</h2>
<p>Next, let’s dig into books that got single recommendations from venture capitalists, but that we’ve read ourselves and can therefore endorse.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439156816/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1439156816&amp;linkId=f113a40935c7fd41784eace64772e4f5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On Writing</a>, by Stephen King</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2244949" style="width: 459px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244949" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2244949 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/On-Writing.jpg?w=449" alt="" width="449" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/On-Writing.jpg 529w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/On-Writing.jpg?resize=99,150 99w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/On-Writing.jpg?resize=198,300 198w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/On-Writing.jpg?resize=449,680 449w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/On-Writing.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244949" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Scribner</p></div></p>
<p>Vertex Ventures’ <a href="https://twitter.com/tessachen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tessa Chen </a>gave &#8220;On Writing&#8221; her endorsement, stating that it is “an oldie but goodie” that she has read several times and said “people who write in our portfolio” have read as well.</p>
<p>As writers for a living, we can confirm that &#8220;On Writing&#8221; is a good read. It’s challenging in that it makes demands of the reader in terms of how to approach rule-breaking, to pick an example. If you want to become a better writer, and therefore communicator, it’s worth every minute you can give it.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, Mark Forsyth’s &#8220;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Eloquence-Mark-Forsyth/dp/1785781723" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Elements of Eloquence&#8221;</a> — recommended by Dillon — is probably worth consuming.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sandhya" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sandhya Hegde</a>, a general partner at Unusual Ventures, sent this recommendation. Alex recently read the book, having become familiar with Tchaikovsky thanks to his &#8220;Children of Time&#8221; and &#8220;Children of Ruin&#8221; titles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shards of Earth&#8221; is good in that it brings new flavors to the space opera genre. If you enjoy space romps that take the reader through civilizations and star systems, you’ll like the book. But the concept of art plays a bigger role than you’d expect, giving the book’s antagonists a rather different tenor than most bad guys have in the realm of science fiction.</p>

Jemisin</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2244951" style="width: 455px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244951" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2244951 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fifth-Season.jpg?w=445" alt="" width="445" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fifth-Season.jpg 522w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fifth-Season.jpg?resize=98,150 98w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fifth-Season.jpg?resize=196,300 196w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fifth-Season.jpg?resize=445,680 445w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Fifth-Season.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244951" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Orbit</p></div></p>
<p>By this point, you may have some of Jemisin’s work, as her profile has become rather large in recent years. Her &#8220;Inheritance Trilogy&#8221; is straight-up magic, as is her collection of short stories, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Long-Black-Future-Month/dp/0316491373" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;How Long &#8217;til Black Future Month?&#8221;</a></p>
<p>But her perhaps best work is the &#8220;Broken Earth Trilogy,&#8221; recommended by Redpoint’s <a href="https://twitter.com/emily__man" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emily Man</a>. Imagine a world where the planet itself is a rival, and where magic and technology intermingle with an intensity that we can’t recall reading elsewhere. The books are worth buying as a trio and bingeing. Just don’t have social events on your calendar. Once you start the series, you won’t want to do anything else.</p>

<p>Thanks to Techstars’ <a href="https://twitter.com/ckevinliu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kevin Liu</a> for recommending &#8220;The Pearl,&#8221; giving us a chance to wax about Steinbeck. While we’re most familiar with &#8220;Cannery Row&#8221; and &#8220;Tortilla Flat,&#8221; there’s no need to stick to his lighter works — nor to the great movie adaptations of &#8220;East of Eden&#8221; and &#8220;Of Mice and Men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Pearl&#8221; is a good entry for this list given its central theme of greed. Which, you know, is a pretty important part of investing.</p>

<p>Eclipse Ventures partner <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jay-knafel-3483625b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jayson Knafel</a> threw this one into the mix. Honestly, you should read the entire &#8220;Remembrance of Earth&#8217;s Past&#8221; trilogy, of which &#8220;The Three-Body Problem&#8221; is the first work.</p>
<p>The saga goes over first contact, the question of species safety, how far we might take science one day and more. The first book is amazing. The second book in the series spends time asking questions about humanity itself, while the third pushes the reader so far into the weird that it is nearly philosophical at times. That said, the final book in the series, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deaths-End-Remembrance-Earths-Past/dp/0765386631">&#8220;Death’s End,&#8221;</a> is one of Alex’s favorite books, period. It’s just flat-out bonkers good.</p>

<p>We’re adding our endorsement to this particular title given that one of our partners read it and loved it. So, that’s another vote alongside <a href="https://twitter.com/texasvc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mercury Fund’s Aziz Gilani’s</a> nod.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ove&#8221; is not a book about a happy person, mind; it’s about a grump. But that fact doesn’t make it any less delightful, we reckon. You can find a copy of this book just about anywhere, given its popularity.</p>

<p>Here was a surprise! <a href="https://twitter.com/vcsurferdad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Venrock’s Brian Ascher</a> threw &#8220;Ready Player Two&#8221; into the mix, which made us sit back and remember when we read &#8220;Ready Player One,&#8221; a book that is metaverse-y and was also made into a movie not too long ago. You can skip the film.</p>
<p>Regardless, Ascher cited the book’s “depiction of AI and neural links” as being “very current,” adding that “apparently Mark Zuckerberg liked the book, too.”</p>
<p>While &#8220;Ready Player One&#8221; had some issues, it has become a book that many folks have read. So, in terms of cultural importance, perhaps &#8220;Ready Player Two&#8221; will reach similar status. Which means we should probably read it.</p>

<p>Another <a href="https://twitter.com/amyecheetham?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cheetham</a> recommendation, Alex read this one as part of a book club. The book is centered around twins, race and America’s failings as a nation to move past its racist roots. It’s a read well worth the time if you want to look at the world from a different perspective.</p>

<p>Veil got a vote from <a href="https://twitter.com/vc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chapman</a>, who also liked &#8220;Project Hail Mary.&#8221; So you won’t be shocked to learn that it is also in the science fiction genre. Dealing with climate change and politics, &#8220;Veil&#8221; is an interesting foray into the future, but an Earth-focused one. Don’t expect warp drives.</p>
<p>You might know Peper from his active social media accounts. Frankly, since reading &#8220;Veil,&#8221; Alex has been meaning to read more Peper, so consider this short blurb his reminder to do so.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We&#8217;re in the earliest stages of Artemis, NASA&#8217;s new push to establish an enduring human presence on the moon, and Kathy Lueders will be leading a great deal of this ambitious undertaking. But it&#8217;s more than rockets and lunar landers, as she&#8217;ll explain at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TechCrunch Sessions: Space</a> next week on December 14 &amp; 15.</p>
<p>Lueders, a NASA veteran of long standing, recently became head of the newly minted Space Operations Mission Directorate, which will oversee launches and near-Earth operations for Artemis and other projects. She&#8217;ll also be working closely with the International Space Station as its approaches its final years of service as a NASA facility.</p>
<p>Lueders was previously the head of human spaceflight, where she presided over the enormous increase in commercial crew flights, led by SpaceX&#8217;s Falcon 9 rockets and eventually its Dragon capsule. Her new role keeps her close to these crucial day-to-day operations, letting her focus on those while allowing R&amp;D to be more the purview of Jim Free at the Explorations Systems Development Mission Directorate. No doubt they&#8217;ll work closely together, but it will be interesting to hear her perspective on why the new organization makes sense.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244520" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>We will also discuss <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">robotic exploration, space infrastructure, ISS decommissioning</a> and of course one of Lueders&#8217;s favorite topics, inspiring the next generation of space workers and researchers, from astronauts to engineers to data analysts.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/">TC Sessions: Space 2021</a> takes place on December 14-15. Don’t miss the big value in our sponsored sessions. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-sessions-space-2021/#tickets">Buy your pass right now</a> and get ready to take away mission-critical information to help you build a better business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ottawa-based <a href="https://gadget.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gadget</a>, a developer productivity company founded by two former Shopify employees, has raised $8.5 million in seed funding. The funding round was led by Sequoia Capital and Bessemer Venture Partners, with participation from Greg Brockman, the co-founder and CTO of OpenAI; Koen Koppen, the CTO of Klarna; Solmaz Shahalizadeh, the head of data science and engineering at Shopify; and more.</p>
<p>Founded in 2020 by Harry Brundage and Mohammad Hashemi, Gadget aims to offer e-commerce app developers a way to cut down on the time they spend writing code. The platform allows developers to build and scale apps more efficiently by allowing them to skip the busywork associated with their tasks.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started Gadget because we were trying to build a bunch of different things ourselves and got frustrated with how long it took to get anything off the ground,&#8221; CEO Brundage told TechCrunch in an interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s frustrating to spend weeks and weeks pre-launching and preparing these things. We figured that lots of other people have the same problem and we wanted to build something that solves it.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244913" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Gadget bundles into a single experience the tools, libraries, APIs and best practices needed by developers. It allows developers to define their data models and write code while accessing a set of advanced primitives, such as built-in state machines, automated access control, instant API generation and integrations to other SaaS platforms.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244965" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244965" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2244965" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gadget-product-image.png" alt="" width="1024" height="656" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gadget-product-image.png 1810w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gadget-product-image.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gadget-product-image.png?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gadget-product-image.png?resize=768,492 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gadget-product-image.png?resize=680,436 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gadget-product-image.png?resize=1536,984 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gadget-product-image.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244965" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits: </strong>Gadget</p></div></p>
<p>In terms of the recent funding, Gadget plans to use it to publicly launch its serverless stack and build out connections to third-party APIs, beginning with Shopify. Brundage and Hashemi plan to initially focus on the e-commerce giant in order to leverage their product and engineering expertise with the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to put the money to use in hiring an even more amazing and bigger team and then just delivering as many features as we can,&#8221; Brundage said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regarding the future, Brundage and Hashemi hope to build a long-lasting enduring company that makes it easier for important software to be developed. Brundage noted that there are many possible useful tools that haven&#8217;t been built yet and the company hopes Gadget can make those tools come to life.</p>
<p>“Software development is reaching a tipping point,” said Mike Vernal, a partner at Sequoia, in a statement. “As we expect more from the software we use, developers need more from the tools they build with in order to keep pace with demands. Gadget&#8217;s platform delivers on the promise of helping ecommerce developers build scalable software, incredibly fast.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">By late last year, the alarm bells were <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/fireeye-breach-solarwinds-federal-agencies/">just starting to ring</a>. Researchers discovered that Russian spies had months earlier burrowed deep into the networks of several U.S. federal networks. The spies, working for Russia&#8217;s foreign intelligence service, had first targeted SolarWinds, an IT company whose software helps to remotely manage the networks of thousands of businesses, Fortune 500 organizations and federal government agencies. By breaking into SolarWinds&#8217; network and pushing a tainted software update to its customers, the Russian spies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/solarwinds-hackers-targeted-nasa-federal-aviation-administration-networks/">delivered digital backdoors</a> directly to the heart of the U.S. federal government.</p>
<p>It was, and by some accounts <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/10/24/new-activity-from-russian-actor-nobelium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continues to be</a>, one of the most intricate acts of cyber-espionage in recent years to become public. But it was the delivery mechanism that sparked fear: How could companies trust that the software on their networks hadn&#8217;t been tampered with?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s one of the problems that five ex-Google employees are trying to solve. Dan Lorenc, Matt Moore, Scott Nichols, Ville Aikas and Kim Lewandowski founded <a href="https://chainguard.dev/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chainguard</a> in October after working together on building open source tools at Google. Before founding Chainguard, the five most recently worked on two open source security projects, Sigstore, a new standard for digitally signing and verifying software, and SLSA (delightfully pronounced <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2021/06/introducing-slsa-end-to-end-framework.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;salsa&#8221;</a>), a framework for maintaining end-to-end integrity of a software supply chain.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2243057" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Just like a product made on a factory assembly line, software can be made up of different components, and can sometimes depend on code written by others and released as open source for anyone to use. These software &#8220;dependencies&#8221; sometimes have bugs that go unnoticed but are incorporated into larger software projects. Attackers also intentionally try to introduce subtle flaws that can be later exploited, sometimes at scale, if the flaws are embedded in widely used software.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of companies are relying more and more on open source software, and actually not realizing the risks that they&#8217;re setting themselves up for when they go and find some random package on the internet and install it in their production systems,&#8221; Lewandowski told TechCrunch. &#8220;We want to make it possible for companies to have confidence in some of these critical open source packages; they can go back and trace to the source and understand the pieces that go into creating that software package and having an audit trail to go back and track to see where it came from, if there does happen to be a breach.&#8221;</p>
<p>The co-founding team plans to work on open source projects to help companies understand and manage the risks they face from the software supply chains.</p>
<p>Chainguard announced Wednesday that it has raised $5 million in seed funding, led by Amplify Partners and several angel investors. Lewandowski said the team plans to use the funding to scale the company beyond the five new employees, and continue to build out the products it wants to take to market. &#8220;We&#8217;re probably going to be pretty split down the middle of focusing on open source and then building with a product,&#8221; said Lewandowski.</p>
<p>Though early days, the company said it plans to bring an early version of its product offering next year, with a focus on helping companies harden their own software supply chains.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Candela makes an unusual style of watercraft called a hydrofoiling boat, which glides above the sea on fins for a smoother, more efficient ride — doubly unusual, in fact, in that it is electrically propelled. The company has <a href="https://www.mynewsdesk.com/candela-speedboat-ab/pressreleases/electric-watercraft-maker-candela-secures-eu24m-investment-from-eqt-ventures-to-scale-production-of-foiling-vessels-3149465" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised $24 million</a> to accelerate production of its existing small craft and a larger commercial one, in pursuit of cleaner and generally more future-proof waters.</p>
<p>The principle on which these boats work is actually fairly easy to understand. As a boat moves through the water, it tends to propel itself upwards and out as well as forward, and in a traditional watercraft — especially in choppy seas — this leads to the boat bouncing up and down on the water as it goes.</p>
<p>Hydrofoiling watercraft rise up too, but unlike a normal keeled boat the craft has a set of strong, bladelike fins attached to the powertrain and a horizontal fin below. At cruising speed the boat rises up on these fins so that they are the only things under the water, reducing drag and chop considerably and correspondingly increasing the efficiency of the engine.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244872" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Of course there are consequences to having your boat standing on its fins like that, not least of which is it looks a little strange (boaters are very conscious of these things). But practically speaking, the main issue is probably that turning tends to&#8230; well, flop the boat over on its side due to the abnormally high center of gravity. Fortunately this potentially dangerous tendency is handled preemptively in Candela boats.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244874" style="width: 2510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-boats-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244874" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2244874 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-boats-1.jpg" alt="CG image of a Candela P-8 on the water." width="2500" height="1402" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-boats-1.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-boats-1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-boats-1.jpg?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-boats-1.jpg?resize=768,431 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-boats-1.jpg?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-boats-1.jpg?resize=1536,861 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-boats-1.jpg?resize=2048,1149 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-boats-1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2244874" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Candela</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;When you turn left in a Candela, it will lean left, and you will be pushed down in your seat, not to the side as in a planing boat. This coordinated turn is performed by the on board software, which regulates the angle of attack of the foil 100 times per second. So the foil moves constantly, in real time, to balance the boat,&#8221; explained a company representative in response to my question. Although he compared it to a fighter jet, it might be easier to think of an all-wheel-drive system constantly monitoring for slip and anticipating such factors during a car&#8217;s turns.</p>
<p>Solving this problem makes hydrofoiling craft a viable alternative to a traditional hull, and that in turn solves one of the problems inherent to electric watercraft: low range. Watercraft face incredible resistance from the medium through which they travel, and at speed even the best batteries out there will run out much sooner than a gas tank.</p>

<p>Painstakingly designing the entire boat around the engine and shaving every gram off the weight, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/zin-boats-reinvents-the-electric-speedboat-in-a-bid-to-become-the-tesla-of-the-sea/">as Zin Boats does</a>, is one approach to making those battery packs last, but if you can increase efficiency by half with something like hydrofoiling, you outrange any other boat in the same class almost without trying.</p>
<p>These boats do actually exist, though only a handful of them at present. Candela started out with the prototype C-7 speedboat, and made several upgrades with the larger <a href="https://candela.com/candela-c-8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C-8</a>, currently in pre-production with the first boat about 80% done and delivery of the first run scheduled for spring. Before you get out your piggy bank, let&#8217;s be clear here: This craft is aimed squarely at the ultra-rich, with a €290,000 price tag before you start adding options like a hard top.</p>
<p>But while the company does hope to sell as many of these as possible to the Monaco and Dubai crowd, the bigger opportunity may be in public transport, of all things. Ferries are crucial infrastructure to cities around the world, but are often old, diesel-powered things that pollute the air and water around them. Candela is aiming at replacing those with its 30-passenger P-30.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2244931" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-p30.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244931" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2244931" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-p30.jpg" alt="3D model of Candela's P-30 passenger boat." width="1024" height="619" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-p30.jpg 2500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-p30.jpg?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-p30.jpg?resize=300,181 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-p30.jpg?resize=768,464 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-p30.jpg?resize=680,411 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-p30.jpg?resize=1536,928 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-p30.jpg?resize=2048,1238 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/candela-p30.jpg?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2244931" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Candela</p></div></p>
<p>The company plans to debut the P-30 in Stockholm in 2023, where they hope it will operate for 40% cheaper, get around faster, quieter, and without making waves. They even plan to make it autonomous at some point, though we&#8217;ll address that ambition when it&#8217;s actually being attempted. With a predicted 60 mile range per charge, the P-30 should be able to make multiple trips without stopping and plug in to a fast charger at terminals without too much disruption.</p>
<p>Replacing commercial ferry and water taxi fleets with clean-running alternatives could be a huge step toward improving local water quality and cutting down on municipal contributions to pollution. Many coastal and bay cities could use something like this and may be willing to pay a premium to be recouped in lower running costs and general goodwill.</p>
<p>The $24 million round was led by EQT Ventures, with participation from TED curator Chris Anderson. The money will be used to expand the R&amp;D team and scale up production with automated tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’ve shown that our hydrofoil tech is the key to make electric boats commercially viable. We’re seeing boundless demand for the Candela C-8, as well as huge interest in our commercial vessels,&#8221; said Candela CEO Gustav Hasselskog in a press release. &#8220;The investment from EQT Ventures will allow us to double down on our mission to speed up the transition to fossil fuel-free lakes and oceans. It took us four years to develop the technology and two more years to master it. Now we are ready to scale up fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all still toys for the filthy rich, but at one point so were electric cars. A few more years and electric boats may be as affordable as traditional ones — which is to say, not very, but considerably less than a house. If it ends up helping keep our waterways, lakes and oceans cleaner, though, I&#8217;m all for it.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I sponsored my fiancé for a K-1 visa last year right before the pandemic. Unfortunately, the consulate canceled my fiancé’s visa interview and he hasn’t yet been able to get his visa. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Now that travel restrictions to the United States have been lifted, what’s the status of visa interviews?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— Pining in Pittsburgh</strong></p>
<p>Dear Pining,</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to me with your question. While theoretically love knows no bounds, the U.S. immigration system can sometimes assert otherwise. We are saddened to hear that you and your fiancé have been separated for so long! We have many clients in your situation, which we recently chatted about on the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/immigration/100-ilts-100th-episode-celebration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100th episode of “Immigration Law for Tech Startups.</a>” Rest assured, we’re beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>As always, I recommend consulting with an immigration attorney for specific guidance — every situation is different based on where you and your fiancé are located, and immigrants often say it’s very helpful to have an attorney throughout the <a href="https://www.alcorn.law/k-1-visa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K-1 visa</a> process to answer questions and guide you, as well as to support with the adjustment of status process once you and your fiancé are married.</p>

<p>The good news is that starting in January 2022, all U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) personnel will be back in USCIS offices, working to get through the backlogs and reduce processing times that increased substantially during the pandemic. Abroad, however, cases and interviews at the State Department will likely continue to face delays. Many U.S. embassies and consulates remained closed, and those that have reopened have huge backlogs to work through.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter posted today that it&#8217;s testing a feature that would turn its in-app explore page into a TikTok-like video feed, complete with even a &#8220;For You&#8221; tab. This feature is testing on both Android and iOS for users in certain countries who use Twitter in English.</p>
<p>“We’re testing out a revamped, more personalized Explore page to make it easier for you to unwind, find new interests and see what’s happening,&#8221; a Twitter spokesperson told TechCrunch. The company said it is a visual-forward way of surfacing content that already exists on Twitter. This is part of Twitter&#8217;s ongoing effort to improve personalized recommendations and discovery across the platform.</p>
<p>Twitter is the latest social app to see if it can capitalize on TikTok&#8217;s rapid growth &#8212; the short form video app surpassed<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/tiktok-reached-1-billion-monthly-active-users/"> one billion</a> monthly active users this year, making it one of the fastest companies to hit that milestone. TikTok clones like Instagram Reels, Snapchat Spotlight and YouTube Shorts have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/11/instagram-bonuses-reels-tiktok/">incentivized creators</a> to use their platforms and have grown in popularity. Even apps like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/netflix-launches-fast-laughs-a-tiktok-like-feed-of-funny-videos/">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/24/spotify-tests-a-tiktok-like-vertical-video-feed-in-its-app/">Spotify</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/reddit-is-quietly-rolling-out-a-tiktok-like-video-feed-button-on-ios/">Reddit</a> are experimenting with the format.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244877" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">*checks Explore tab*</p>
<p>If it’s looking different, then you’re in our latest test: a new Explore experience to help you discover the best content that’s trending. Available in certain countries for some of you who use Twitter in English on Android and iOS. <a href="https://t.co/PGQwMT8r8B">pic.twitter.com/PGQwMT8r8B</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1468619385472438279?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter has been constantly churning out new products and features this year, like Spaces, Twitter Blue and Tip Jar. This momentum is expected to continue with Parag Agrawal taking over as CEO after co-founder <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/29/jack-reportedly-stepping-down-from-twitter-ceo-role/">Jack Dorsey</a> stepped down last week. Already, Agrawal has begun <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/03/new-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-begins-restructuring-as-two-execs-step-down/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">r</a><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/03/new-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-begins-restructuring-as-two-execs-step-down/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">estructuring the company</a> to support what he called &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/paraga/status/1465349749607854083" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ambitious goals</a>&#8221; in an email to staff, which he tweeted upon his appointment.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Spaces, Twitter&#8217;s live audio product, is now the default center icon on the app&#8217;s bottom navigation bar. This indicates that Twitter is committed to promoting this Clubhouse competitor. But Twitter&#8217;s copycat features haven&#8217;t always been successful. Fleets, its Snapchat/Instagram stories competitor, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/twitter-fleets-rip/">shuttered</a> after eight months. So, just because Twitter is testing a short form video feed doesn&#8217;t mean that this will definitively become its vehicle for content discovery. But, as TikTok&#8217;s success has shown, people find short videos to be quite engaging.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At Apple&#8217;s Worldwide Developer Conference in June, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/heres-everything-apple-announced-at-the-wwdc-2021-keynote/">teased its plans</a> to incorporate support for home, office and hotel keys into Apple Wallet, as well as state driver licenses. Today, Apple is announcing Hyatt will become the first hotel partner to support the new technology. The hotel chain will roll out support for room keys in Apple Wallet for their guests, starting initially with six U.S. properties, with more to come in the future.</p>
<p>The six properties include Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, Hyatt Centric Key West Resort &amp; Spa, Hyatt House Chicago/West Loop-Fulton Market, Hyatt House Dallas/Richardson, Hyatt Place Fremont/Silicon Valley and Hyatt Regency Long Beach.</p>
<p>The new system will work alongside the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/world-of-hyatt/id476639005" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World of Hyatt mobile app</a>. After making a reservation in the app, you&#8217;ll be presented with a screen that offers you the option to add your room key to Wallet. This experience is similar to when you book tickets or passes and then have the option to tap a button to add those items to Apple Wallet for later access. And like other passes, you can add your hotel room keys immediately after booking your reservation. Of course, the door won&#8217;t unlock until the time of check-in.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2244796" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Once the key is added to your Apple Wallet, you&#8217;ll be able to see the reservation dates, property name and your upcoming check-in date on the main screen. You can also tap on the three-dot menu on the upper-right to view more information about your stay, including your reservation number and other details about the property. Plus, you can launch the Hyatt app directly from within Apple Wallet to manage your reservation.</p>
<p>The hotel keys aren&#8217;t only available on your iPhone &#8212; they&#8217;re also automatically added to the Wallet app on a paired Apple Watch.</p>
<p>In addition to the convenience of not having to keep up with a plastic hotel key card, this system may also allow guests to bypass waiting in lines in the lobby to check in. Instead, the app can notify guests when the room is ready and they can check in on their phone. When that process is completed, the room key will be enabled and will display your room number so you can just head to your room directly. This could help customers reduce their COVID exposure, as well, as they won&#8217;t have to wait in lines alongside other guests for check-in.</p>
<p>Apple says guests with multiple rooms will be able to add them all to their same room key and wallet for their stay, so they don&#8217;t have to remember which virtual key to tap. And like the Express mode used by transit pass holders, hotel keys can also work in an Express mode where you won&#8217;t even need to unlock your device to open the door. The key also work to unlock access to hotel amenities, like the gym or pool.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2244852" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2244852" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2244852" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/BM5A2475_RET-1.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="453" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/BM5A2475_RET-1.jpg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/BM5A2475_RET-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/BM5A2475_RET-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/BM5A2475_RET-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/BM5A2475_RET-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/BM5A2475_RET-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/BM5A2475_RET-1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/BM5A2475_RET-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2244852" class="wp-caption-text">Hyatt room key in Apple Wallet on Wednesday, Oct. 27, 2021 in Chicago. (Jean-Marc Giboux/AP Images for Hyatt)</p></div></p>
<p>If the guest decides to extend their stay or book a late checkout in the mobile app, the hotel key will update as well. One thing you can&#8217;t do, however, is share the hotel key with a friend &#8212; they only work with the Hyatt account holder who&#8217;s logged into the mobile app. After checkout, the hotel keys are archived in Apple Wallet but not deleted.</p>
<p>The new system will require hotels to update their room lock infrastructure to support NFC technology. This allows the customers to open hotel doors with a tap, like they do today when using Apple Pay at supported point-of-sale terminals. Hyatt is working with <a href="https://www.assaabloy.com/group/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assa Abloy</a> on its solution, but Apple is open to working with the vendors the hotel chooses. The company declined to say which other hotel chains may be working to roll out the technology, but notes Hyatt has plans to expand access across global properties.</p>
<p>Support for hotel keys is rolling out today to iPhones running iOS 15 and Apple Watch devices running watchOS 8. Hyatt tells TechCrunch it&#8217;s currently only working on a cardless solution for iOS users, though it hasn&#8217;t ruled out working with Google down the road.</p>
