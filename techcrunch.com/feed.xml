										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Global logistics company Geodis has tapped startup Phantom Auto to help it deploy forklifts that can be controlled remotely by human operators located hundreds, and even thousands, of miles away.</p>
<p>The aim is to use the technology to reduce operator fatigue &#8212; and the injuries that can occur as a result &#8212; as well as reduce the number of people physically inside warehouses, according to the Geodis. The use of remotely operated forklifts won&#8217;t replace employees — just where they work. It&#8217;s that detail that Geodis, which often has operations outside of city centers, finds appealing.</p>
<p>Stéphanie Hervé, chief operating officer for Geodis&#8217; Western Europe, Middle East and Africa operations, told TechCrunch that use of the remotely operated forklifts will help the company attract a new group of workers, including those with physical disabilities. The intent isn&#8217;t to outsource workers to other countries, but to find more workers within a region, according to the company.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Under the partnership, Phantom Auto&#8217;s remote operation software is integrated into KION Group forklifts. The forklifts are equipped with 2-way audio so that remote operators, which Geodis also describes as &#8216;digital drivers&#8217;, can communicate with their co-workers inside the warehouses.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132409" style="width: 7459px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Geodis-Forklift-2_Credit-to-Geodis-_-Jean-claude-Moschetti-_-REA_294586_294586_016-copy.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132409" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2132409 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Geodis-Forklift-2_Credit-to-Geodis-_-Jean-claude-Moschetti-_-REA_294586_294586_016-copy.jpg" alt="Geodis Phantom Auto forklift" width="7449" height="4966" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Geodis-Forklift-2_Credit-to-Geodis-_-Jean-claude-Moschetti-_-REA_294586_294586_016-copy.jpg 7449w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Geodis-Forklift-2_Credit-to-Geodis-_-Jean-claude-Moschetti-_-REA_294586_294586_016-copy.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Geodis-Forklift-2_Credit-to-Geodis-_-Jean-claude-Moschetti-_-REA_294586_294586_016-copy.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Geodis-Forklift-2_Credit-to-Geodis-_-Jean-claude-Moschetti-_-REA_294586_294586_016-copy.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Geodis-Forklift-2_Credit-to-Geodis-_-Jean-claude-Moschetti-_-REA_294586_294586_016-copy.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Geodis-Forklift-2_Credit-to-Geodis-_-Jean-claude-Moschetti-_-REA_294586_294586_016-copy.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Geodis-Forklift-2_Credit-to-Geodis-_-Jean-claude-Moschetti-_-REA_294586_294586_016-copy.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Geodis-Forklift-2_Credit-to-Geodis-_-Jean-claude-Moschetti-_-REA_294586_294586_016-copy.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 7449px) 100vw, 7449px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2132409" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Geodis</p></div></p>
<p>Phantom Auto and Geodis have been working together for more than two years via pilot program conducted in Levallois and Le Mans, France. This announcement signals a deeper relationship and one that could be a boon for Phantom Auto.</p>
<p>The initial deployment is focused on France, Hervé said. For now, Phantom Auto&#8217;s software will be used to remotely operate forklifts in the initial pilot sites of Levallois and Le Mans and will then expand throughout the country over the next year. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Geodis employees at the two initial sites have already been trained to remotely operate the forklifts, Phantom Auto co-founder Elliot Katz said.  </span></p>
<p>Geodis&#8217; footprint extends far beyond the boundaries of France. The company has some 165,000 clients in 120 countries. They own 300 warehouses, which are located throughout the world, and also provide third-party logistics services to thousands of other customers, including Amazon and Shopify.</p>
<p>Phantom Auto&#8217;s tie-up with Geodis is another example of the company seeking business outside of the fledging autonomous vehicle industry, which was its initial focus. The company, founded in 2017, developed vehicle-agnostic software to remotely monitor, assist operate fleets of unmanned vehicles such as forklifts, robots, trucks and passenger vehicles.</p>
<p>The company is adjacent to the AV industry. While AV operators rarely talk publicly about the need for teleoperations, it is viewed as a necessary support system to commercially deploy robotaxis and for other AV applications. But as autonomous vehicle developers pushed back timelines to commercialize the technology, Phantom Auto expanded into new areas.</p>
<p>Phantom Auto, which has raised $25 million to date, expanded a logistics business targeting sidewalks, warehouses and cargo yards, all the places where autonomy and teleoperation are being deployed today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">By now you’ve probably heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social_and_corporate_governance">ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) ratings</a> for companies, or ratings for their carbon footprint. Well, now a UK company has come up with a way of rating the ‘ethics’ social media companies. <br />
  <br />
<a href="https://ethicsgrade.io/">EthicsGrade</a> is an ESG ratings agency, focusing on AI governance. Headed up <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/radclyffe/">Charles Radclyffe</a>, the former head of AI at Fidelity, it uses AI-driven models to create a more complete picture of the ESG of organizations, harnessing Natural Language Processing to automate the analysis of huge data sets. This includes tracking controversial topics, and public statements.</p>
<p>Frustrated with the green-washing of some ‘environmental’ stocks, Radclyffe realized that the AI governance of social media companies was not being properly considered, despite presenting an enormous risk to investors in the wake of such scandals as the manipulation of Facebook by companies such as Cambridge Analytica during the US Election and the UK’s Brexit referendum.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EthicsGrade-Industry-Summary-Scorecard-Social-Media-.pdf">EthicsGrade Industry Summary Scorecard &#8211; Social Media</a></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EthicsGrade-Industry-Summary-Scorecard-Social-Media-.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="437" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2132253" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EthicsGrade-Industry-Summary-Scorecard-Social-Media-.jpg 620w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EthicsGrade-Industry-Summary-Scorecard-Social-Media-.jpg?resize=150,106 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EthicsGrade-Industry-Summary-Scorecard-Social-Media-.jpg?resize=300,211 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/EthicsGrade-Industry-Summary-Scorecard-Social-Media-.jpg?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px" /></p>
<p>The idea is that these ratings are used by companies to better see where they should improve. But the twist is that asset managers can also see where the risks of AI might lie.</p>
<p>Speaking to TechCrunch he said: “While at Fidelity I got a reputation within the firm for being the go-to person, for my colleagues in the investment team, who wanted to understand the risks within the technology firms that we were investing in. After being asked a number of times about some dodgy facial recognition company or a social media platform, I realized there was actually a massive absence of data around this stuff as opposed to anecdotal evidence.”</p>
<p>He says that when he left Fidelity he decided EthicsGrade would out to cover not just ESGs but also AI ethics for platforms that are driven by algorithms.</p>
<p>He told me: “We&#8217;ve built a model to analyze technology governance. We’ve covered 20 industries. So most of what we&#8217;ve published so far has been non-tech companies because these are risks that are inherent in many other industries, other than simply social media or big tech. But over the next couple of weeks, we&#8217;re going live with our data on things which are directly related to tech, starting with social media.”</p>
<p>Essentially, what they are doing is a big parallel with what is being done in the ESG space.</p>
<p>“The question we want to be able to answer is how does Tik Tok compare against Twitter or Wechat as against WhatsApp. And what we&#8217;ve essentially found is that things like GDPR have done a lot of good in terms of raising the bar on questions like data privacy and data governance. But in a lot of the other areas that we cover, such as ethical risk or a firm&#8217;s approach to public policy, are indeed technical questions about risk management,” says Radclyffe.</p>
<p>But, of course, they are effectively rating algorithms. Are the ratings they are giving the social platforms themselves derived from algorithms? EthicsGrade says they are training their own AI through NLP as they go so that they can automate what is currently very human analysts centric, just as ‘sustainalytics’ et al did years ago in the environmental arena.</p>
<p>So how are they coming up with these ratings? EthicsGrade says are evaluating “the extent to which organizations implement transparent and democratic values, ensure informed consent and risk management protocols, and establish a positive environment for error and improvement.” And this is all achieved, they say, all through publicly available data &#8211; policy, website, lobbying etc. In simple terms, they rate the governance of the AI not necessarily the algorithms themselves but what checks and balances are in place to ensure that the outcomes and inputs are ethical and managed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal really is to target asset owners and asset managers,&#8221; says Radclyffe. &#8220;So if you look at any of these firms like, let&#8217;s say Twitter, 29% of Twitter is owned by five organizations: it&#8217;s Vanguard, Morgan Stanley, Blackrock, State Street and ClearBridge. If you look at the ownership structure of Facebook or Microsoft, it&#8217;s the same firms: Fidelity, Vanguard and BlackRock. And so really we only need to win a couple of hearts and minds, we just need to convince the asset owners and the asset managers that questions like the ones journalists have been asking for years are pertinent and relevant to their portfolios and that&#8217;s really how we&#8217;re planning to make our impact.”</p>
<p>Asked if they look at content of things like Tweets, he said no: “We don&#8217;t look at content. What we concern ourselves is how they govern their technology, and where we can find evidence of that. So what we do is we write to each firm with our rating, with our assessment of them. We make it very clear that it&#8217;s based on publicly available data. And then we invite them to complete a survey. Essentially, that survey helps us validate data of these firms. Microsoft is the only one that&#8217;s completed the survey.”</p>
<p>Ideally, firms will “verify the information, that they&#8217;ve got a particular process in place to make sure that things are well-managed and their algorithms don&#8217;t become discriminatory.”</p>
<p>In an age increasingly driven by algorithms, it will be interesting to see if this idea of rating them for risk takes off, especially amongst asset managers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://nested.com/">Nested</a>, the London-based startup that is using technology to build a &#8220;modern&#8221; estate agency and improve the home-selling experience, has raised an additional £5 million. Backing comes from Axel Springer, alongside previous backers Balderton Capital and Northzone.</p>
<p>Described as a &#8220;strategic investment,&#8221; Nested co-founder and CEO Matt Robinson tells TechCrunch that the round brings the &#8220;vast industry experience and resources&#8221; of Axel Springer to the board, in advance of a U.K. nationwide launch this year &#8212; meaning that the proptech is expanding beyond its current footprint of London.</p>
<p>Pitched as a &#8220;modern estate agent,&#8221; Nested&#8217;s offering pairs local agents with what it claims is industry leading tools and technology to help them better-support home-sellers (and buyers). It initially launched by offering to front the cash needed to buy your next home before you had sold your existing one, but now covers the entire house-selling journey.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Most recently, Robinson says Nested has been testing a new &#8220;hyper-local&#8221; approach so it can better service different neighbourhoods in a huge city like London. The idea, he says, is to give customers the best of both worlds: &#8220;a fantastic local agent who knows their area inside out, powered by Nested’s unique technology&#8221;.</p>
<p>This saw Nested launch 5 hyper-local areas in 2020 and Robinson says it has quickly gained up to 15% market share in those local markets. It is planning to launch an additional 30 areas over the next 18 months, as well as moving outside London for the first time.</p>
<p>&#8220;We find the best local agents and empower them with unique technology and services versus anyone else in the industry, traditional or online,&#8221; says Robinson. &#8220;There are some good traditional agents out there but the tools they have to do their job and for the customer to see what&#8217;s happening are pre-internet. We take the best local agents and give them tools to instantly be better at their job and give customer a better experience&#8221;.</p>
<p>He says that this is very different to online estate agencies, such as Purplebricks, which effectively offer &#8220;a DIY option where the agents are set up to fail by having to serve too many customers to give any of them a good service&#8221;. Meanwhile, he notes, traditional agents have barely changed in 50 years.</p>
<p>&#8220;Customers used to pick us because we had great features and services they couldn’t get anywhere else and great people but it was clear that the vast majority of customers also really value the knowledge and experience of a local agent and we were forcing them to pick between superior features, service and people versus most local,&#8221; adds Robinson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our approach now is to give them both. We hire the absolute best local agents, and empower them and our customers with features to manage their sale better than they could anywhere else. For example, our customer account, buying agent and advance&#8221;.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Robinson argues that by focusing on each local market, customers benefit from local network effects through cross-selling homes. &#8220;We are [also] able to give agents a healthier workload with less travel, meaning more time for clients and better tailored advice&#8221;.</p>
<p>As an example of how Nested&#8217;s tech helps local agents do a better job, the company recently released updates to its mobile app which gives home-sellers instant access to every aspect of their sale &#8212; from viewing feedback and scheduled viewings to even showing what actions their agent has taken to generate enquiries and how many times they have chased up specific enquiries. &#8220;All at the tap of a button instead of playing phone tag with your agent,&#8221; is how Robinson frames it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><strong>Update</strong>: It seems that the market is volatile indeed. After pricing its shares at the lower end of the range, Deliveroo, trading as &#8220;ROO&#8221; on the London Stock Exchange, opened at 331 pence (£3.31), down some 15% on its private placement pricing, and it has been continuing to decline in early trading. It&#8217;s <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/stock/ROO/deliveroo-holdings-plc/trade-recap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now at 303.35 pence</a> and has been as low as 271 pence (and as high as 344.95 pence). We&#8217;ll continue to update this story. Original post below.</p>
<p>Tech stocks continue to deliver on the public markets, figuratively and literally: <a href="http://deliveroo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deliveroo</a>, the UK food-delivery giant backed by Amazon that has seen a surge of business during the Covid-19 pandemic, has <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/ROO/announcement-of-offer-price/14920034" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced pricing</a> of £3.90 ($5.36) for its shares when goes public on the London Stock Exchange later today, valuing it with a market cap of £7.59 billion ($10.4 billion), and raising £1.50 billion ($2.1 billion).</p>
<p>The figure is at the lower end of the reduced range Deliveroo set earlier in the week of £3.90-£4.10. At the time, Deliveroo said the &#8220;volatile global market conditions for IPOs&#8221; led it to narrow the range from its original £3.90-£4.60. &#8220;<span class="il">Deliveroo</span> is choosing to price responsibly within the initial range and at an entry point that maximises long-term value for our new institutional and retail investors,&#8221; the company said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Separately, Deliveroo has been facing persistent controversy over how it pays its drivers, a story that doesn&#8217;t look like it will go away too soon. Deliveroo sources have repeatedly claimed that negative stories arising out of these labor issues have not been impacting the company in the lead-up to the IPO. Activity today on the market could be one indication of what the real impact has been.</p>
<p>The listing today is a milestone not just for the company but for the London stock market in general. At a time when a number of scaled up privately-held tech companies have, and are exercising, a lot of options &#8212; acquisitions to bigger rivals, listing in the U.S. market, pursuing a SPAC &#8212; it&#8217;s notable that Deliveroo has opted for the LSE. It&#8217;s the biggest IPO on the exchange in terms of market cap in nine years (when commodity giant Glencore listed in 2011), and the biggest in terms of money raised since last September (when e-commerce company The Hut Group listed).</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very proud that Deliveroo is going public in London &#8211; our home,&#8221; said Will Shu, Deliveroo&#8217;s CEO and co-founder. &#8220;As we reach this milestone I want to thank everyone who has helped to build Deliveroo into the company it is today &#8212; in particular our restaurants and grocers, riders and customers. In this next phase of our journey as a public company we will continue to invest in the innovations that help restaurants and grocers to grow their businesses, to bring customers more choice than ever before, and to provide riders with more work. Our aim is to build the definitive online food company and we&#8217;re very excited about the future ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>As with the U.S. exchanges, tech companies are fueling a lot of the action on the LSE at the moment, with four out of the last five IPOs valued at over £1.5 billion in the last five years coming from tech companies.</p>
<p>Regardless of how Deliveroo fares, the labor controversy facing the company in its main market is one that will continue to play out. A report from the Bureau of Investigative Journalism in the UK found that one in three Deliveroo couriers made less than £8.72, which is the UK national minimum wage for those over 25. In some cases, the disparity of earnings was especially stark: a cyclist in Yorkshire worked 180 hours and was paid the equivalent of £2 per hour, it found. <span class="il" style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Deliveroo</span><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> has typically said that its couriers are paid more than £10 an hour on average.</span></p>
<p>One reason that the story might continue to persist is because it&#8217;s about more than just Deliveroo. Earlier this month, Uber <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/uber-says-it-will-treat-uk-drivers-as-workers-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reclassified 70,000 drivers in the UK</a> as workers to give them benefits as the result of losing a court case, although Uber Eats &#8212; a rival to Deliveroo &#8212; was not included in the deal. However, it may not be legal but public pressure that will shift what happens with food delivery drivers. Just Eat, another competitor in the space, last year kicked off an <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/just-eat-expects-to-create-1-000-jobs-as-it-launches-new-agency-worker-model-12155974" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agency worker model</a> that gives drivers the option to work instead under an hourly wage rather than per ride. That becomes, in turn, one possible outcome for how to resolve the situation.</p>
<p>Whether or not investors have an opinion on this matter, it may not be that the so-called &#8220;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-29/deliveroo-tightens-ipo-price-range-to-lower-half-of-target" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investors revolt</a>&#8221; is directly related to a sense of justice for low-paid delivery people, as it is the threat of legal action, losing court cases, and generally finding more costs on the bottom line than originally anticipated in the company&#8217;s unit economics.</p>
<p>Those unit economics are indeed a focus for investors, who may be bullish on the basic idea even as disputes over how to run it as an equitable business continue. Going into the IPO, Deliveroo is not profitable, but <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/deliveroo-posted-narrowed-loss-of-309m-with-gross-transactions-surging-to-5-7b-in-2020-eitf-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its loss had been narrowing on a huge surge of sales during the Covid-19 pandemic</a>, not least because many restaurants have been forced to shut down their dine-in businesses and so consumers are turning to services like this to get their fixes of pre-prepared sushi, pizza, jerk chicken and burritos.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll update this post with more after the stock officially starts trading.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are fewer than 300,000 doctors in India actively practicing medicine. They serve hundreds of millions of patients who suffer from chronic illness in the world’s second most populous nation.</p>
<p>A doctor only has a few minutes to spend on a patient, remember the past diagnosis by glancing at their record, and formulate a plan of management.</p>
<p>HealthPlix, a Bangalore-based startup, believes it can help doctors serve these patients more efficiently with the limited time they have.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup has developed a software for doctors that helps them keep a tab on the symptoms a patient has displayed in the past, the medicine that was prescribed to them, and if they are showing any improvements in a methodical template.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t stop there, said Sandeep Gudibanda, co-founder of <a href="https://healthplix.com">HealthPlix</a>, in an interview with TechCrunch. The software has a knowledge base that is making determination of all the other factors that a doctor needs to assess as they treat the patient.</p>
<p>For instance, if a patient has diabetes, and they have mentioned that they had swollen feet and are experiencing more frequent visits to the washroom, said Gudibanda, the doctor can quickly assess that the patient’s symptoms are getting worse and she needs to start looking at the function of the kidney and other organs and monitor blood sugar.</p>
<p>“As a doctor, you are able to see how my disease is progressing, what medicine was prescribed to me and if they are working. So you are not going to prescribe me some medicine that didn’t work two months ago. Based on the data of more than 12 million patients we have, our software is also able to inform doctors what other things I am exposed to,” he said.</p>
<p>“Doctors have immense knowledge, but they have very little time. So how do we help them make better decisions on the few minutes they have with a patient,” he asked. &#8220;These few minutes matter most. It is in this precious interaction that health decisions get made, diagnostic tests get prescribed, pharmaceutical brands get chosen, surgical procedures get planned, and hospital referrals get made. This interaction is the moment of truth, where $88 billion of annual healthcare spend is decided.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2132438" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HealthPlix.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HealthPlix.jpg 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HealthPlix.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HealthPlix.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HealthPlix.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HealthPlix.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/HealthPlix.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Scores of healthtech startups in India today are attempting to serve patients. What distinguishes HealthPlix from most is the approach it has taken. Unlike other startups, HealthPlix&#8217;s solution puts doctors at its centre of universe, said Gudibanda, who has spent nearly two decades in entrepreneurship in healthtech.</p>
<p>He said in a country like India, where there are so many people suffering from chronic diseases, a doctor&#8217;s intervention is needed for best results. &#8220;While going through the patient&#8217;s route, we might achieve some scale, we realized that the stakeholder they reason with and listen to is the doctor. A doctor here serves hundreds of patients. You work with the doctor and you make a bigger impact,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Second, because of the immense workload on doctors, who can only spend 2-3 minutes to serve a patient, If he or she doesn&#8217;t have all the information, their thinking might get compromised. Hence the doctor had to be in the piece.&#8221;</p>
<p>HealthPlix initially started in late 2016 to help doctors connect with patients digitally. But that model, he recalled, wasn’t working. The current model is growing fast. More than 6,000 doctors today are using HealthPlix for over four hours a day, he said. The startup plans to reach over 50,000 doctors in two years.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the startup said it has raised $13.5 million in its ongoing Series B financing round. The round was led by Lightspeed Venture Partners. The startup has now raised about $23.5 million to date.</p>
<p>“What sets HealthPlix apart is its doctor-first B2B approach. Doctors are the most influential decision-makers in healthcare. We believe whichever platform wins their trust will have the sole right to orchestrate the entire $88 billion of healthcare spend,” said Vaibhav Agrawal, Partner at Lightspeed, in a statement.</p>
<p>“The impact is very clear — improved health outcomes for patients, better practices for doctors, 10x better Insights for pharma and med device companies, and superior underwriting capability for insurers.”</p>
<p>Gudibanda said the startup will also deploy the fresh capital to tackle some acute diseases.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.appier.com/">Appier</a>’s <a href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2021/03/31/2003754786">initial public offering on the Tokyo Stock Exchange yesterday</a> was a milestone not only for the company, but also Sequoia Capital India, one of its earliest investors. Founded in Taiwan, Appier was the fund’s first investment outside of India, and is now also the first company in its portfolio outside of India to go public. In an interview with TechCrunch, Sequoia Capital managing director Abheek Anand talked about <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/india/build/appier-ipo-the-science-and-art-of-building-a-global-software-business/">what drew the firm to Appier</a>, which develops AI-based marketing software.</p>
<p>Before shifting its focus to marketing, Appier’s founders—chief executive officer Chih-Han Yu, chief operating officer Winnie Lee and chief technology officer Joe Su—<a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252489391/The-inside-story-of-Taiwans-AI-whizz">worked on a startup called Plaxie</a> to develop AI-powered gaming engines. Yu and Su came up with the idea when they were both graduate students at Harvard, but found there was little demand at the time. Anand met them in 2013, soon after their pivot to big data and marketing, and Sequoia Capital India invested in Appier&#8217;s Series A a few months later.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“It’s easy to say in retrospect what worked and what didn’t work. What really stands out without trying to write revisionist history is that this was just an incredibly smart team,” said Anand. “They had probably the most technical core DNA of any Series A company that we’ve met in years, I would argue.” Yu holds a PhD in computer science from Harvard, Wu earned a PhD in immunology at Washington University in St. Louis and Su has a M.S. in computer science from Harvard. The company also filled its team with AI and machine learning researchers from top universities in Taiwan and the United States.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Taiwan&#8217;s Appier raises $80M for AI-based marketing technology&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/appier-series-d/embed/#?secret=35lqiHXE5W" data-secret="35lqiHXE5W" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>At the time, Sequoia Capital “had a broad thesis that there would be adoption of AI in enterprises,” Anand said. “What we believed was there were a bunch of people going after that problem, but they were trying to solve business problems without necessarily having the technical depth to do it.” Appier stood out because they “were swinging at it from the other end, where they had an enormous amount of technical expertise.”</p>
<p>Since Appier’s launch in 2012, more companies have emerged that use machine learning and big data to help companies automate marketing decisions and create online campaigns. Anand said one of the reasons Appier, which now operates in 14 markets across the Asia-Pacific region, remains competitive is its strategy of cross-selling new products and focusing on specific use cases instead of building a general purpose platform.</p>
<p>Appier’s core product is a cross-platform advertising engine called CrossX that focuses on user acquisition. Then it has products that address other parts of their customers’ value chain: AiDeal to help companies send coupons to the customers who are most likely to use them; user engagement platform AIQUA; and AIXON, a data science platform that uses AI models to predict customer actions, including the likelihood of repeat purchases.</p>
<p>“I think the number one thing that the company has spent a lot of time on is focusing on efficiency,” said Anand. “Customers have tons of data, both external and first-party, that they’re processing to drive business outcomes. It’s a very hard technical problem. Appier starts with a solution that is relatively easy to break into a customer, and then builds deeper and deeper solutions for those customers.”</p>
<p>Appier’s listing is also noteworthy because it marks the first time a company from Taiwan has listed in Japan since Trend Micro’s IPO in 1998. Japan is one of Appier’s biggest markets (customers there include Rakuten, Toyota and Shiseido), making the Tokyo Stock Exchange a natural fit, Anand said, even though most of Sequoia Capital India’s portfolio companies list in India or the United States.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Exchange also stood out because of its retail investor participation, liquidity and total volume. Some of Appier&#8217;s other core investors, including JAFCO Asia and SoftBank Group Corp., are also based in Japan. But though it has almost $30 billion in average trading volume, the vast majority of listings are domestic companies. In a <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Market-Spotlight/Tokyo-Stock-Exchange-revives-ambitions-to-lure-Asian-IPOs">recent report</a>, Nikkei Asia cited a higher corporate tax rate and lack of potential underwriters, especially for smaller listings, as a potential obstacles for foreign companies.</p>
<p>But Appier’s debut may lead the way for other Asian startups to chose the Tokyo Stock Exchange, said Anand. “Getting ready for the Japanese exchange meant having the right accounting practices, the right reporting, a whole bunch of compliance stuff. It was a long process. In some ways we were leading the charge for external companies to get there, and I’m sure over time it will keep getting easier and easier.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ugandan technology-enabled asset finance company <a href="https://gotugende.com/">Tugende</a> today announced that it has closed $3.6 million in a Series A extension round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investment, which, according to the company, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was agreed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on and structured in 2020, follows the <a href="https://gotugende.com/tugende-closes-6-3m-toyota-tsusho-backed-series-a-investment-round/">$6.3 million raised in November 2020</a> and led by Toyota Tsusho investment fund Mobility 54</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This brings Tugende&#8217;s total Series A financing to $9.9 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco and Paris-based VC firm, <a href="http://partechpartners.com/">Partech</a> led the round. Enza Capital participated, alongside some unnamed angel investors.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ug.linkedin.com/in/michaeljwilkerson">Michael Wilkerson</a> founded Tugende in 2012. The company </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">uses asset finance, technology and a customer support model to help micro, small and medium-sized enterprises own income-generating assets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> based in East Africa, the company wants to tackle the $331 billion credit gap facing these businesses across Africa. Its core product is for motorcycle riders in Kenya and Uganda, with a lease-to-own or hire-purchase package. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These riders get some training, medical and life insurance, safety equipment and hands-on support from their first use of the motorcycle to owning it</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Between 2006 and 2010, CEO Wilkerson, then a journalist and researcher, spent a great deal of time using motorcycles (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boda_boda">Boda bodas</a>) for quick and flexible transport</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It was such an effective means for transport for him that he built a large contact list of &#8220;go-to&#8221; boda boda riders he would call for rides when need be. This was long before ride-hailing made its way to East Africa.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132338" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132338" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2132338" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Michael-new-headshot-Tugende-CEO.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Michael-new-headshot-Tugende-CEO.jpg 1300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Michael-new-headshot-Tugende-CEO.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Michael-new-headshot-Tugende-CEO.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Michael-new-headshot-Tugende-CEO.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Michael-new-headshot-Tugende-CEO.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Michael-new-headshot-Tugende-CEO.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2132338" class="wp-caption-text">Michael Wilkerson (Tugende CEO). <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tugende</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These boda boda riders earned enough to pay motorcycle rent and survive, but not enough to build significant savings</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the little amounts they paid for rent could actually service a loan, traditional banks either required significant collateral or very high down payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So in 2010, Wilkerson launched Own Your Own Boda, a for-profit enterprise to put these riders on a path toward owning their motorcycles. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They began </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">informally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with handwritten contracts, but progressed into using technology to scale the solution from 2013 when it rebranded to Tugende</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once boda boda riders get on board, they can double their take-home profit from $5 per day to $10 per day after becoming owners, the CEO claims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With an average household of five people, this can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transform the lives of our client and their families. Besides </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> increased daily profit, ownership of an asset is also wealth in itself,&#8221; Wilkerson told TechCrunch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Some clients sell the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> owned motorcycle and use that lump sum of capital to make other investments while coming back to Tugende for a new lease, which is affordable from their daily cash flow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to motorcycle taxis, Tugende has broadened the productive assets it finances to boat engines, cars, equipment for retail shops, refrigerators and other income-generating equipment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company is also currently piloting financing for e-mobility assets. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The pivot to using technology in 2013 allowed Tugende to move </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fully</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to digital payments, build its own interoperable payment gateway in 2017 and launch an in-house credit score in 2019 to allow clients to see how they are performing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about clients, Tugende currently has more than 43,000 across Kenya and Uganda. Out of that number, 16,000 have achieved full ownership of at least one asset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year was a challenging one for the company, as the pandemic disrupted some of its activities; excluding 2020, Tugende has doubled in team size year-on-year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company currently has more than 520 employees, with 20 branches in Uganda and four in Kenya.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the pandemic presented challenges that the company has since maneuvered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it also brought a new investor in Partech. &#8220;Last year, in the middle of the pandemic, we decided to invest in Tugende&#8221;, said Tidjane Deme, partner at the firm that invested in 82 startups across 24 countries in 2020. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Tugende combines technology and strong operations to aid millions of professionals to grow their businesses and drive economies forward</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We will support Michael and his team to build up the tech platform, fine-tune the model and expand in new markets.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the years, Tugende&#8217;s demand has come </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> via word of mouth, a strategy Wilkerson says the company has struggled to keep up with. That&#8217;s the purpose of the new investment &#8212; to provide supply for growing demand. Also, the investment will</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> support the closure of new debt capital to fuel Tugende’s strong portfolio growth in Uganda and Kenya.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the nature of its business, Tugende needs a steady influx of debt capital. Since its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">inception</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it has raised more than $20 million from debt partners like Partners Group Impact Investments and the U.S. Development Finance Corporation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So why opt for equity financing this time when it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mostly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> thrives on debt capital? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wilkerson says with the company&#8217;s long waiting list of new clients, Tugende has been trying to close new capital fast enough to keep up with this demand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You see, most lenders </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">require</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">minimum</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> equity cushion, and even though Tugende has been net income positive for most of the last five years through 2019, its </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">internally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> generated equity couldn&#8217;t anchor enough debt to meet its word of mouth client demand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Now, when you add the company&#8217;s goals to grow in new geographies and new asset products, the reason for this equity financing is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">apparently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> clear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Debt is Tugende&#8217;s fuel for growth. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But good equity financing is like upgrading the engine, getting a top-notch mechanic and driving coach thrown in on top to help you handle the speed,&#8221; the CEO added</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="0JywosUNX8"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/african-countries-need-startup-acts-more-than-ever-to-support-innovation/">African countries need &#8216;startup acts&#8217; more than ever to support innovation</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also the need for balance sheet strength, leading to more capital runway with larger and better-priced debt deals. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there is the multiplier effect of having hands-on equity support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike many digital or digitally-enabled</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> lenders, Wilkerson says Tugende&#8217;s prime focus </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">on long-term value, not today&#8217;s credit transaction alone, is what will keep customers in the Tugende ecosystem in the coming years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are particularly enthused by the team&#8217;s innovative application of technology, which incorporates a range of social considerations to build a new type of credit score, and which will increase access to capital across a range of African markets where entrepreneurs currently have a limited credit history or access to collateral,&#8221; added Mike Mompi, partner at Enza Capital of the investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.otrium.com">Otrium</a> has raised a $120 million round just a year after raising its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/27/otrium-raises-26-million-to-sell-end-of-season-fashion-items/">$26 million</a> Series B round. BOND and returning investor Index Ventures are leading the round. Existing investor Eight Roads Ventures is also participating.</p>
<p>The concept behind Otrium is quite simple. When items reach the end-of-season status, brands can list those items on Otrium and keep selling them. Otrium is currently available in Europe. Right now, many brands have their own end-of-season sales. But there are some limits to this model.</p>
<p>Those companies often can’t sell their entire back inventory this way. Moreover, the most luxurious fashion brands don’t necessarily want to put a cheaper price tag on their items in their own stores. That’s why a lot of clothing produced stays unsold — and by unsold, it means that those items often get destroyed.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Otrium, brands can add another sales channel for those specific items. And selling those items online makes a ton of sense as you don’t want to manage small end-of-season inventories across multiple stores. One big online inventory is all you need.</p>
<p>And because some brands are reluctant about selling outdated items, Otrium tries to be as friendly as possible with fashion companies. They retain control over pricing, merchandising and visibility of their excess inventory.</p>
<p>The startup also recently launched advanced analytics. The idea here is that Otrium can help brands identify evergreen products that should remain available year after year.</p>
<p>“We believe that the fashion world will see a rebalancing in the next few years, with more sales being driven by iconic items that brands sell year after year, and will be less reliant on new seasonal launches,” co-founder and CEO Milan Daniels said in a statement.</p>
<p>And it would be a win-win for everyone involved. Otrium would end up selling items that remain relevant for a longer time. And fashion brands could slowly build an evergreen collection of items that would nicely complement their fast fashion collections.</p>
<p>With today’s funding round, Otrium plans to expand to the U.S. The company currently works with several well-known fashion houses, such as Karl Lagerfeld, Joseph, Anine Bing, Belstaff, Reiss and ASICS.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A lot has changed since <a href="https://www.monkshill.com/">Monk’s Hill Ventures</a> released its first report on tech compensation in Southeast Asia five years ago, with base salaries and competition for top talent jumping dramatically. But one thing has remained the same since 2016: startup compensation data, including information about base pay, bonuses and stock options, is still hard to find. To get more data for its latest Southeast Asia Tech Talent Compensation report, which covers startup hiring in Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam, Monk’s Hill Ventures teamed up with <a href="https://glints.com/">Glints</a>, one of its portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Glints is a recruitment platform that claims 4 million users each month and is used by 30,000 organizations. The report analyzed more than 1,000 data points from Glints’ proprietary database, including job advertisements and placements made through 2020, and surveyed 175 employees in both technical and non-technical roles. It also includes interviews with more than 20 founders, including from Bot MD, Carousell, Horangi, the Asianparent and Ninja Van. The full report can be downloaded <a href="https://www.monkshill.com/content-hub/the-southeast-asia-tech-talent-report-mhv">here</a>.</p>
<p>The report focused on Singapore, Indonesia and Vietnam because they are three of the fastest-growing markets in Southeast Asia. It found that startups are dealing with several major shifts at the same time. There are more Southeast Asian startups maturing into late stage, but at the same time, large American and Chinese tech companies are setting up regional operations, including TikTok, Tencent, Alibaba and Zoom. This means compensation packages are being driven up and startups face a talent crunch, especially in Singapore. Most of the founders interviewed by Monk’s Hill Ventures and Glints said that base salaries have at least doubled since 2016.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h3>Going remote even before the pandemic</h3>
<p>But the range of salaries and talent pool varies widely between Southeast Asian countries, and as a result, tech startups can build strong teams with a regionally distributed strategy. For example, this can look like an engineering team in Vietnam, data science team in Singapore and product management team in Indonesia. Vietnam had the highest salary differences between senior and junior roles, for both tech and non-tech talent, compared to Singapore and Indonesia, which the report said means there is “strong potential for upward salary growth within the Vietnamese tech sector.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Singapore is poised to become Asia&#8217;s Silicon Valley&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/singapore-is-poised-to-become-asias-silicon-valley/embed/#?secret=D7B8pugsmv" data-secret="D7B8pugsmv" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Oswald Yeo, co-founder and chief executive officer of Glints, told TechCrunch that many startups were building regionally distributed engineering hubs before COVID-19 because there was simply not enough talent in Singapore. Now even more founders have become open to remote teams because of the pandemic. But having teams in different countries doesn’t just address the talent crunch. It also lays the groundwork for regional expansion.</p>
<p>“Commercially in Southeast Asia, you can’t stay in a single market unless it’s maybe Indonesia,” said Yeo. “If you stay only in Singapore, Malaysia or even Vietnam, you will not be a large enough business and make the impact you want to make. A lot of startups have to venture out, so they end up having commercial teams in each market anyway and then it’s very normal for them to build product and tech teams in those markets.”</p>
<h3>Competing for specialized skills</h3>
<p>The report found that tech roles, including product, data science and engineering, earn 54% more than non-technical roles, like marketing, operations or finance. But the base salary between product and data science roles over non-technical roles was one to two times higher than for engineering, suggesting that “while engineering skills are becoming more common across the region, specialized product and data science skills remain hard to come by.”</p>
<p>Founders said that vice presidents of engineering in particular are seen as one of a startup’s most critical hires. Singapore-based startups at Series B and upward paid base monthly salaries ranging from $7,500 to $10,000, with equity compensation from 0.3% to 1.2%. In Indonesia, base salaries for engineering VPs ranged from $2,800 to $7,100 depending on the stage of company, and in Vietnam, early stage companies paid on average $1,000 to $5,000. That amount increased to $5,000 to $6,000 after raising Series A funding, and $8,000 to $10,000 for companies at Series B stage and above.</p>
<p>The competition for top tech talent is also reflected in C-level compensation. The report found that chief executive officers tend to hold more equity in their startups, but chief technology officers consistently have higher median base salaries, “suggesting that CEOs are often willing to take a pay cut in favor of their technical counterparts, who are typically highly valued and considered scarce assets to the company.”</p>
<p>Based on combined data from Singapore, Vietnam and Indonesia, CEO’s median salary increased from $2,600 a month at the $0 to $10 million funding stage, to $6,000 a month at $5 million to $10 million in funding. In comparison, at the same funding stages, CTO’s median salary increased from $3,300 to $7,550 respectively. CEO at startups with funding up to $5 million owned between 15% to 100% of their company’s equity, while the average ownership of CTOs at that stage is 19%.</p>
<h3>Cash versus equity</h3>
<p>Another noteworthy finding is that less than 32% of tech talent surveyed by Monk’s Hill Ventures and Glints are being compensated in equity. Founders said employees, especially junior-to-mid level hires, still prefer cash. But this is changing as founders spend more time educating their teams about the benefits of equity, and some startups are now also offering annual wage supplements, bonuses, restricted stock units or employee stock ownership plans.</p>
<p>Some founders reported that executives who have worked in the American or Singaporean startup ecosystems are keener on equity options, but in general, there needs to be more startup exits in Southeast Asia for candidates to become open to equity.</p>
<p>Before co-founding Monk’s Hill Ventures, Peng T. Ong was a venture partner at GSR Ventures in China. “In 2010, in that time frame, there were the same issues there. People wanted cash. Fast forward to three years later, when the IPOs started to happen, all that changed. People wanted options,” Ong told TechCrunch. He said that the same shift is gradually starting to happen in Southeast Asia, thanks to Sea Group and Razer’s IPOs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon will soon be a big part of the space economy in the form of its Kuiper satellite internet constellation, but here on Earth its ambitions are more commonplace: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/announcing-aws-space-accelerator-startups/">get an accelerator going</a>. They&#8217;ve partnered with space-focused VC outfit Seraphim Capital to create a four-week program with (among other things) a $100,000 AWS credit for a carrot.</p>
<p>Applications are open now for the AWS Space Accelerator, with the only requirement that you&#8217;re aiming for the space sector and plan to use AWS at some point. Ten applicants will be accepted; you have until April 21 to apply.</p>
<p><a href="https://seraphim.vc/aws/accelerator/">The program sounds fairly straightforward</a>: a &#8220;technical, business, and mentorship&#8221; deal where you&#8217;ll likely learn how to use AWS properly, get some good tips from the AWS Partner Network and other space-focused experts on tech, regulations and security, then rub shoulders with some VCs to talk about that round you&#8217;re putting together. (No doubt Seraphim&#8217;s team gets first dibs, but there doesn&#8217;t appear to be any strict equity agreement.)</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Selected startups may receive up to $100,000 in AWS Activate credit,&#8221; the announcement says, which does hedge somewhat, but probably legal made them put that in.</p>
<p>There are a good amount of space-focused programs out there, but not nearly enough to cover demand — there are a lot of space startups! And they often face a special challenge of being highly technical, have customers in the public sector and need rather a lot of cash to get going compared with your average enterprise SaaS.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll understand more about the program once the first cohort is announced, likely not for at least a month or two.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Clubhouse&#8217;s list of competitors is growing. LinkedIn has now confirmed it&#8217;s also testing a social audio experience in its app which would allow creators on its network to connect with their community. Unlike the Clubhouse rivals being built by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/23/facebooks-clubhouse-rival-looks-a-lot-like-clubhouse-right-now/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/twitter-spaces-arrives-on-android-ahead-of-clubhouse/">Twitter</a>, LinkedIn believes its audio networking feature will be differentiated because it will be connected with users&#8217; professional identity, not just a social profile. In addition, the company has already built out a platform that serves the creator community, which today has access to tools like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/20/linkedin-stories/">Stories</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/linkedin-debuts-linkedin-live-a-new-live-video-broadcast-service/">LinkedIn Live video broadcasting</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/111414">newsletters</a> and more.</p>
<p>And just today, LinkedIn formalized some of its efforts in this area with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-adds-creator-mode-video-profiles-and-in-partnership-with-microsoft-new-career-training-tools/">launch a new &#8220;Creator&#8221; mode</a> that lets anyone set their profile as one that can be followed for updates, like Stories and LinkedIn Live videos, for example.</p>
<p>This focus on creators puts LinkedIn on competitive footing in terms of expanding its own Clubhouse rival, compared with other efforts by Facebook, Twitter, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/19/telegram-voice-features-ios-update/">Telegram</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/BobbyAllyn/status/1376974352994856961">Discord</a> &#8212; all of which have their own audio-based networking features in various stages development at this time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Though Twitter&#8217;s Clubhouse rival, Twitter Spaces, is already live in beta testing, its full set of creator tools have yet to arrive. In fact, it was only last month that Twitter <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/111414">announced</a> its plans for a larger creator subscription platform via a new &#8220;Super Follow&#8221; feature, for instance. And it only this year entered the newsletter space via an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/twitter-acquires-revue/">acquisition</a>. Facebook, meanwhile, has historically offered a number of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators">creator-focused features</a>, but has just recently gotten invested <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255876/facebook-newsletter-tools-independent-journalists-writers-substack-revue">in tools like newsletters</a>.</p>
<p>LinkedIn says its development of an audio-based networking feature came about because its members and creatives have been asking for more ways to communicate on its platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re seeing nearly 50% growth in conversations on LinkedIn reflected in stories, video shares, and posts on the platform,&#8221; Suzi Owens, a spokesperson for LinkedIn, said when confirming its audio feature&#8217;s development. &#8220;We’re doing some early tests to create a unique audio experience connected to your professional identity. And, we&#8217;re looking at how we can bring audio to other parts of LinkedIn such as events and groups, to give our members even more ways to connect to their community,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>As a result of creators&#8217; interest in this space, the company moved quickly to develop its own Clubhouse-like feature, where there&#8217;s a stage showcasing the room&#8217;s speakers and a set of listeners below. There are also tools to join and leave the room, react to comments, and request to speak, according to screenshots of the interface first discovered in the LinkedIn Android app by reverse engineer<a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1376856556533379075"> Alessandro Paluzzi</a>.</p>
<p>Note that Paluzzi’s photo shows a user interface  populated with his own profile icon, shown in the image <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1376856556533379075">he tweeted</a>. That is not part of the LinkedIn mockup. Instead, LinkedIn shared its own conceptual UX mockup of its in-room experiences with TechCrunch, which shows a more fleshed out example of how the feature may look at launch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2132351" style="width: 339px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2132351" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2132351" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Concept-Mock.LinkedIn.jpg?w=329" alt="" width="329" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Concept-Mock.LinkedIn.jpg 1230w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Concept-Mock.LinkedIn.jpg?resize=73,150 73w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Concept-Mock.LinkedIn.jpg?resize=145,300 145w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Concept-Mock.LinkedIn.jpg?resize=768,1588 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Concept-Mock.LinkedIn.jpg?resize=329,680 329w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Concept-Mock.LinkedIn.jpg?resize=743,1536 743w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Concept-Mock.LinkedIn.jpg?resize=990,2048 990w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Concept-Mock.LinkedIn.jpg?resize=24,50 24w" sizes="(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2132351" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> LinkedIn</p></div></p>
<p>LinkedIn believes that because the audio experience will be connected with users&#8217; professional identities, they&#8217;ll feel comfortable speaking, commenting and otherwise engaging with the content, the company told TechCrunch. It will also be able to leverage its existing investment in moderation tools built for other features &#8212; like LinkedIn Live &#8212; to help to address any concerns over inappropriate or harmful discussions, like those that <a href="https://www.protocol.com/moderation-clubhouse-building-community">have</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3vkde/clubhouse-app-misinformation-problem">already</a> <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/12/the-murky-world-of-moderation-on-clubhouse">plagued</a> <a href="https://www.communitysignal.com/why-has-clubhouse-been-plagued-by-trust-and-safety-issues/">Clubhouse</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our priority is to build a trusted community where people feel safe and can be productive,&#8221; Owens noted. &#8220;Our members come to LinkedIn to have respectful and constructive conversations with real people and we’re focused on ensuring they have a safe environment to do just that,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Plus, LinkedIn says that audio networking makes for a natural extension of other areas, like Groups and Events &#8212; areas for networking that have continued to grow, and particularly during the pandemic.</p>
<p>In 2020, some 21 million people attended an event on LinkedIn, and overall LinkedIn sessions increased by 30% year-over-year. The company&#8217;s 740 million global members also last year built community, had conversations, and shared knowledge, with 4.8 billion connections made.</p>
<p>Like many companies which saw a pandemic boost, LinkedIn believes the pandemic only accelerated the natural progression towards online networking, remote work, and virtual events, which were already in place before lockdowns. For example, LinkedIn says that more than 60% of its members were working remotely by the end of 2020, versus 8% before the pandemic. LinkedIn believes the shift will stick, as more than half the world&#8217;s workforce is expected to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-07-14-gartner-survey-reveals-82-percent-of-company-leaders-plan-to-allow-employees-to-work-remotely-some-of-the-time">continue working from home</a> at least some of the time, even after the pandemic comes to an end.</p>
<p>That leaves room for new forms of online networking to grow, as well, including audio experiences.</p>
<p>LinkedIn doesn&#8217;t yet have an exact timeframe for its launch of the audio networking feature, but says it will begin beta testing soon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple has updated its native Maps app with more helpful information designed to assist with travel while mitigating the spread of COVID-19. Apple Maps on iPhone, iPad and Mac will now show COVID-19 health measure information for airports when searched via the app, either through a link to the airport&#8217;s own COVID-19 advisory page, or directly on the in-app location card itself.</p>
<p>The new information is made available through a partnership with the Airports Council International and provides details on COVID-19 safety guidelines in effect at over 300 airports worldwide. The type of information provided includes requirements around COVID-19 testing, mask usage, screening procedures and any quarantine measures in effect, and generally hopes to help make the process of traveling while the global pandemic continues easier, and as vaccination programs and other counterefforts are set to prompt a global travel recovery.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amazon has acquired a startup in India that is helping offline stores go online, the e-commerce group’s latest attempt to make inroads in the world’s second most populous nation where brick and mortar continue to drive more than 95% of sales.</p>
<p>The American e-commerce group said on Tuesday evening that it has acquired <a href="https://www.perpule.com">Perpule</a>, a four-year-old startup. A regulatory filing showed Amazon Technologies paid $14.7 million to acquire the Indian startup in an all-cash deal. The company is expected to spend an additional $5 million or so to compensate Perpule’s employees.</p>
<p>Perpule, which had raised $6.36 million (per insight platform Tracxn), offers a mobile payments device (point of sale machine) to offline retailers to help them accept digital payments and also establish presence on various mini app stores including those run by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/04/google-policy-cut-india-paytm-mini-app-store/">Paytm</a>, PhonePe and Google Pay in India.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“Perpule has built an innovative cloud-based POS offering that enables offline stores in India to better manage their inventory, checkout process and overall customer experience,&#8221; an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to have the Perpule team join us to focus on providing growth opportunities for businesses of all sizes in India while raising the bar of the shopping experience for Indian customers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Founded in late 2016, the Indian startup’s first product was focused on helping customers avoid queues at superchains such as Shoppers Stop, Spar Hypermarket and Big Bazaar. But the product, said Abhinav Pathak in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtUc4r8ReSY">a recent interview</a>, wasn’t scaling, which is when Perpule pivoted.</p>
<p>The Bangalore-based startup &#8212; which counts Prime Venture Partners, Kalaari Capital and Raghunandan G (founder of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/16/zolve-raises-15-million-for-its-cross-border-neobank-aimed-at-global-citizens/">neobank Zolve</a>) among its investors &#8212; has further expanded in recent years, launching products like StoreSE, which enables a business to support group ordering.</p>
<p>Last year, it also expanded geographically, bringing its <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/07/09/indian-retail-tech-start-up-perpule-expands-market-to-sea.html">offerings to Southeast Asian markets</a> including Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam.</p>
<p>Amazon has aggressively <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/amazon-launches-smart-stores-in-india-to-win-mom-and-pop/">engaged with physical stores in India</a> in recent years, using their vast presence in the nation to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/18/amazon-india-kirana-neighborhood-stores/">expand its delivery network</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/18/amazon-india-kirana-neighborhood-stores/">warehouses</a> and even just relying on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/23/amazon-begins-selling-items-from-neighborhood-stores-in-india-amid-facebooks-deal-with-jio/">their inventory to drive sales</a>.</p>
<p>The company’s push into physical retail comes as Flipkart, and Reliance Jio Platforms (backed by Facebook and Google), which last year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">raised over $20 billion</a>, also race to capture this market. The acquisition of Perpule comes less than a week after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/google-dotpe-india-27-5-million-investment/">Google backed DotPe</a>, a startup that offers several similar products.</p>
<p>These neighborhood stores offer all kinds of items, are family run and pay low wages and little to no rent. Because they are ubiquitous — there are more than 30 million neighborhood stores in India, according to industry estimates — no retail giant can offer a faster delivery. On top of that, their economics are often better than most of their digital counterparts.</p>

<p>SuperRare launched its art platform in 2018, since then it has differentiated by maintaining a closed early-access platform that more closely curates the art they sell. Everything on the platform is a single-edition 1/1 sale. The team has said they plan to launch the site widely next year. The company earns a 3% transaction fee on art sales on the platform in addition to a 15% gallery fee for primary sales. One unique facet of the platform is that creators can continue to earn on a piece&#8217;s appreciating value following with 10% commissions on secondary sales.</p>
<p>While NFT art sales have taken off in recent weeks, there are still many structural issues facing their mainstream adoption largely due to scalability issues with Ethereum&#8217;s mainnet, which SuperRare operates on. Plenty of firms are building layer-two infrastructure that improves speed and cuts down on energy usage and transaction fees. Today, ConsenSys launched a platform called Palm featuring artists Damien Hirst as the platform&#8217;s first artist drop.</p>
<p>After a lengthy crypto winter, blockchain startups are coming back with a vengeance amid a surge in startup investing, a surge in enthusiasm around NFTs and a surge in bitcoin prices. Today, NBA Top Shot maker Dapper Labs announced in had raised $305 million in venture funding.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">YouTube announced today it will begin testing what could end up being a significant change to its video platform: It&#8217;s going to try hiding the dislike count on videos from public view. The company says it will run a &#8220;small experiment&#8221; where it will try out a few different designs where dislike counts are no longer shown, however none will see the &#8220;dislike&#8221; button itself removed entirely.</p>
<p>The company announced the tests on <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube/status/1376942493481193475">Twitter</a>, but then explains further in a <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/104325801?hl=en">community forum post</a> that the goal is not to remove the ability for users to signal they disliked a video &#8212; creators will still have access to the video&#8217;s like and dislike count from YouTube Studio and dislikes will still help power YouTube&#8217;s recommendation algorithms.</p>
<p>Instead, YouTube says that the idea to try hiding dislikes is based on creator feedback.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve heard from creators that the public dislike counts can impact their well-being and may motivate a targeted campaign of dislikes on a creator’s video,&#8221; the announcement reads. &#8220;So, we&#8217;re testing designs that don’t include the visible like or dislike count in an effort to balance improving the creator experience, while still making sure viewer feedback is accounted for and shared with the creator.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, there can be a sort of mob mentality that accompanies the use of the Like and Dislike buttons on YouTube. But seeing the dislike count can also help to signal to others when videos are clickbait, spam or misleading, which can be helpful.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Creators, you&#39;ll still be able to see the exact number of likes and dislikes in YouTube Studio. For viewers, if you&#39;re in the experiment, you can still like or dislike a video to share feedback with creators and help tune the recommendations you see on YouTube.</p>
<p>&mdash; YouTube (@YouTube) <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube/status/1376942493481193475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 30, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>YouTube showed off one potential design being tested that simply shows the same button layout but instead of a number of dislikes, the word &#8220;Dislike&#8221; appears underneath the thumbs down icon.</p>
<p>There will be no way to opt out of the test if you see the changes appear when you&#8217;re logged into YouTube &#8212; you&#8217;ll only be able to share feedback, the company notes.</p>
<p>To be clear, however, YouTube isn&#8217;t yet committed to removing the dislike count for everyone at this time. The feedback from this test will help inform YouTube as to if, when or how it will release designs like this more broadly.</p>
<p>YouTube wouldn&#8217;t be the first to experiment with removing metrics from a social app. Instagram<a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/12/2/20983760/instagram-removing-likes-authenticity"> has also been testing removing the number of positive engagements (Likes)</a>, in order to make the experience feel more authentic and less about chasing clout. And Facebook this year <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/06/facebook-redesigns-pages-with-a-more-simplified-layout-and-no-like-button/">removed the &#8220;Like&#8221; button from Facebook Pages</a>, in favor of the more accurate &#8220;Followers&#8221; measurement. However, in the case of removing just the dislike count and not the likes, viewers may misunderstand a video&#8217;s true popularity.</p>
<p>The company told TechCrunch the tests will run globally over the next few weeks on Android and iOS while it gathers feedback from a handful of designs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This afternoon <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a>, a paid-newsletter startup, confirmed that it has raised $65 million, as initially reported <a href="https://www.axios.com/substack-andreessen-horowitz-newsletter-36cb98ea-a7b3-43b1-883a-fa45586eaad4.html">by Axios</a>. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/is-substack-really-worth-650m/">dug into the math</a> behind the financing here. As anticipated, a16z led the new financing.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s in store from the now Series B-backed company? Product work. The company <a href="https://blog.substack.com/p/investing-in-writers">wrote</a> that it intends to &#8220;rapidly&#8221; expand its Substack Pro program, which pays writers for a year to assist them in launching their own minipublication; Substack takes a larger cut of Pro user earnings during their first year, reverting to its usual split the next.</p>
<p>The Substack Pro model has <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22338802/substack-pro-newsletter-controversy-jude-doyle">attracted controversy</a> in recent days, with some writers &#8212; both on Substack and not &#8212; criticizing the startup for opacity in whom it pays via its Pro program; some <a href="https://doyles.substack.com/p/in-queers-we-trust-all-others-pay">have argued</a> that Substack is subsidizing anti-trans writers in particular.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company is motoring ahead on building out its infrastructure regardless, stating in its note that it intends to spend some of its new capital on creating &#8220;increasingly powerful subscription-publishing tools,&#8221; and &#8220;a support infrastructure for independent writers.&#8221; More tooling and more assistance could prove key to enticing more writers from their current employers &#8212; or Substack rivals &#8212; to its platform.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="j83G5vdKaq"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/is-substack-really-worth-650m/">Is Substack really worth $650M?</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Is Substack really worth $650M?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/is-substack-really-worth-650m/embed/#?secret=j83G5vdKaq" data-secret="j83G5vdKaq" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company also wrote that it plans to boost its community building and local news efforts.</p>
<p>Substack did not provide material new growth metrics, instead saying that it has &#8220;more than half a million people&#8221; paying for writers on its network; that figure is unchanged from a January figure <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/substack-newsletters-are-unbundling-the-news-industry">that Bloomberg reported</a>.</p>
<p>As Facebook and Twitter build out <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/28/twitter-is-already-working-on-integrating-newsletters-on-its-site-following-revue-acquisition/">their own newsletter efforts</a>, and rival startups like <a href="https://trypico.com/">Pico</a> and <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> offer related services, the paid-media space is a hot market today. At issue is more than the future homes for a handful of well-known writers with large audiences. The various tech companies competing in the space are each wagering that the long tail for paid writing is long, and that individuals of many profile sizes will be able to attract and hold a paid audience.</p>
<p>After what feels like decades in which online writing was devalued to commodity prices, we&#8217;re startling to find ourselves in a world where various well-financed companies are competing for our pens.</p>
