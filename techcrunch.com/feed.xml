										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.appsmith.com/">Appsmith</a>, which provides open source software that helps companies quickly build internal applications, announced an $8 million Series A round of funding this morning.</p>
<p>Unlike some upstart tech companies that we have seen in the internal application market, Appsmith doesn&#8217;t sport a no- or low-code approach. Instead, Appsmith targets traditional developers with its service, which provides user-interface components that can be connected to business data sources. Those data-infused interface modules can be combined to build calendars, dashboards and other apps.</p>
<p>Before its Series A round of funding, Appsmith had raised $2.5 million. Canaan led the funding event. Accel and Bessemer participated, among other investors.</p>
<p>Asked why the startup selected that particular lead investor, co-founder and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhisheknayak/?originalSubdomain=in">CEO Abhishek Nayak</a> told TechCrunch that his company had been in touch with Canaan&#8217;s Joydeep Bhattacharyya since its early days and that the investor had experience with internal apps at Microsoft.</p>
<p>Why did Appsmith decide to raise capital now? Per Nayak, rising usage of its service and a desire to build out its platform to support more use cases &#8212; things like mobile &#8212; were the impetus.</p>
<p>Appsmith doesn&#8217;t offer a paid product today. But as it currently offers a hosted version of its open source code, it isn&#8217;t hard to see where it could turn on monetization. Enterprise-specific features would be another obvious method of generating revenue in time.</p>
<h2>Why open source?</h2>
<p>There has been a trend of startups that build open source technologies <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/26/2170552/">raising capital in recent quarters</a>. Appsmith fits neatly into the group.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But the <em>why</em> is more interesting. The company told TechCrunch that its co-founders (Nayak and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikhil-nandagopal-05534241/">Nikhil Nandagopal</a>) want Appsmith tech to become part of their customers&#8217; technology stack, and that open source code is the way to achieve the goal. The logic there is simple: Open source code is at once less at-risk to the vicissitudes of startup viability and also easy to dig into. Good luck getting similar visibility into proprietary code.</p>
<p>Today, Appsmith&#8217;s open source project has over 100 external contributors.</p>
<p>The Appsmith team stressed to TechCrunch that feedback from the open source community is useful to making development decisions. And the startup said that by offering a version of its service for free through open source channels, it can provide a service to public-good companies like nonprofits, which might not eventually become paying customers.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, who are the company&#8217;s future customers?</p>
<h2>Who is Appsmith for?</h2>
<p>In the startup&#8217;s view, its open source software is a good fit for smaller companies and developers. Its paid products will fit more neatly into midsize and larger companies once they are rolled out.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have eyes on how Appsmith tackles monetization and customer segmentation, two areas of open source business model formation that we find fascinating. Not only because it&#8217;s an interesting academic question in the case of the startup itself, but also because we want to better understand how the next generation of open source upstarts decides how to make money. Their choices will set the standard for the next cohort of companies building code in an open manner.</p>
<p>Appsmith has lots of competition in the market, with each rival company taking a different tack to the internal application issue. In brief, companies of every shape and size need internal software, and building it is at once tedious, often thankless and unexciting. So, methods that can short-circuit the process of building internal tooling are in demand.</p>
<p>Stacker, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/stacker-raises-1-7m-to-help-nocoders-build-apps-from-spreadsheets/">wants to help non-developers build apps from spreadsheets</a>. Unqork wants <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/unqorks-207m-series-c-underscores-growing-enterprise-demand-for-no-code-apps/">to help enterprise customers build no-code internal apps</a>. UiFlow <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/30/y-combinator-backed-uiflow-wants-to-accelerate-no-code-enterprise-app-creation/">as well</a>. The list goes on.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll check back in with Appsmith when it turns on paid products, an event that it anticipates will occur before the end of Q1 2022. For now, the startup is flush and working in a growing market. Let&#8217;s see what it can get done with its new capital.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the past couple of years, <a href="http://streamlit.io">Streamlit</a>, a startup founded by machine learning veterans, has been working on an open source project to help data scientists build web apps to explore the data in machine learning models. Today the company announced the project has reached version 1.0.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two years ago we came out [with the initial version of Streamlit]. So we&#8217;re putting a stamp on it and saying this is ready to go. We are super, super proud of it, and in fact, there&#8217;s a great roadmap ahead of other things that we&#8217;re building for the community as our reach grows,&#8221; CEO and co-founder Adrien Treuille told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>He said that when they started they had a sense based on their own experience that there was a need for a tool that let data scientists take the data they were working on and share it with the rest of the organization, and over that time as thousands of people have downloaded the product, they have found that idea validated.</p>
<p>&#8220;The open source product is freely available and all the source code can be seen. It&#8217;s backed by a huge community of people who are finding bugs, making suggestions and even contributing to the code,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Amanda Kelly, who is co-founder and COO at the company, says they have gone from an early user base of a handful of customers to a huge community of users, partly driven by the popularity of Python.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you know the core thing is that if you understand Python, which tens of millions of people do now, even just a little bit of Python, you really can get started with Streamlit, so anybody who&#8217;s like looking to go from some type of data, some type of API&#8217;s where they&#8217;re all coming together, you can use Streamlit to really quickly get an answer,&#8221; she said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company reports that over half of the Fortune 50 is using the open source product, and a data scientist Facebook, Tyler Richards, completely independent of the company, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/getting-started-with/9781800565500/">wrote a book on how to use Streamlit</a>.</p>
<p>The company, which scored<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/streamlit-nabs-35m-series-b-to-continue-building-machine-learning-platform/"> a $35 million Series B</a> in April, has also been working on a commercial cloud service in addition to the open source project, which should be ready before the end of the year. The commercial product is currently in private beta at over 700 companies, which means they should hit the ground running when it is eventuall available.</p>
<p>The company launched in 2018 and has raised $62 million, according to Crunchbase data.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">With <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/facebook-grilled-in-senate-hearing-over-teen-mental-health/">Senate hearings</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/seeking-to-respin-instagrams-toxicity-for-teens-facebook-publishes-annotated-slide-decks/">leaked documents</a> galore, teen mental health on social media is a hot topic right now. But Gen Z founders Georgia Messinger and Ari Sokolov have been trying to create healthier online spaces <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/22/trill-project-aims-to-be-a-safe-community-for-people-to-express-their-true-selves/">since they were in high school</a>, when they started the anonymous virtual support app <a href="https://www.trillproject.com/">Trill</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;People ask us sometimes, &#8216;How did you guys decide you wanted to be entrepreneurs while being students?'&#8221; Messinger, now a Harvard undergraduate, told TechCrunch. &#8220;It was never that we set out to start a business, per se, it&#8217;s just that when we were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>seniors in high school, we set out to just solve a problem for our friend. One of our friends was bisexual and was really struggling with coming out, and we wanted to create an antidote to traditional social networks, which later has been coined &#8217;emotional media,&#8217; and it was just a passion project that grew bigger than we ever imagined.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trill has amassed over 100,000 downloads through organic marketing alone, facilitating anonymous support groups around identity, mental health and relationships. With about $100,000 in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/22/trill-project-aims-to-be-a-safe-community-for-people-to-express-their-true-selves/">seed funding</a> from sources like the Founders Bootcamp and Target Incubator programs, the app grew a team of thirty part-time staff (mostly high school and college students), as well as over 100 volunteer moderators. But the college student founders started to look into opportunities to be acquired during the summer of 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to be able to keep ourselves open to explore other interests, enjoy our time at school and take care of our own mental health &#8212; not doing this full-time job while juggling all of life&#8217;s other priorities,&#8221; Messinger explained. &#8220;But as you can see, it&#8217;s now October 2021, so we weren&#8217;t rushing into anything.”</p>
<p>Since a large community of young people use their app as a reprieve, Messinger and Sokolov wanted to make sure that if they were acquired, it would be by a company that shared their fundamental mission to develop supportive communities for young people online. Meanwhile, Greta McAnany was looking for opportunities to reach more Gen Z users on <a href="https://your.blue/39adFi6">Blue Fever,</a> an anonymous social network encouraging authenticity and community support. With McAnany as CEO and co-founder, Blue Fever has secured $4.2 million in <a href="https://board.fastcompany.com/blog/fast-company-executive-board-will-give-greta-mcanany-connections">venture backing</a> from investors like Amazon Alexa Fund, Bumble Fund, and Serena Williams.</p>
<p>McAnany wasn&#8217;t necessarily looking for an acquisition, but she told TechCrunch that when she met the founders of Trill, she was so impressed with them that she wanted to find a way to collaborate.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2211375" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2211375" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2211375" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/combined-1.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="628" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/combined-1.png 1300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/combined-1.png?resize=150,138 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/combined-1.png?resize=300,277 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/combined-1.png?resize=768,709 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/combined-1.png?resize=680,628 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/combined-1.png?resize=50,46 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2211375" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Blue Fever</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never forget when I met Georgia in person, and she was like, &#8216;Here&#8217;s how I see the future of emotional media,&#8217; which is what we call ourselves instead of social media,&#8221; McAnany said. &#8220;I was floored. I was like, &#8216;Okay, we need to bring you on the team as part of leadership,&#8217; and also, bring in the incredible community and user base that they built.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Blue Fever isn&#8217;t disclosing the terms of the acquisition, but with today&#8217;s announcement, Trill will begin incentivizing its users to move over to Blue Fever. By the end of October, Trill will no longer be functional. In the transition, Messinger and Sokolov will join Blue Fever as advisors on product development and audience strategy. They will also lead a Junior Advisory Board in collaboration with hundreds of beta testers who will provide input on the app&#8217;s features.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ve worked closely with Blue Fever’s head of product, and I think we’re very aligned on the future of the product in creating the same experience with slightly different features,&#8221; said Ari Sokolov, now a student in the University of Southern California&#8217;s Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation program.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if it&#8217;s not the same core user experience, it&#8217;s the same core essence behind it,&#8221; Messinger added. Blue Fever and Trill are both anonymous apps, but Blue Fever works by inviting users to post pages, which are essentially iPhone notes where users can share their insecurities, victories, worries and thoughts. Pages are posted to journals, which are themed collections of pages about topics like college, relationships, gender identity, magic moments and loneliness. To discourage negative commenting or the disclosure of personal information, Blue Fever currently only allows users to respond with a &#8220;hug&#8221; or a gif. But McAnany says the app will test commenting. The app also uses an AI called Blue, which McAnany says is like a &#8220;big sibling,&#8221; helping users find content on the platform that might help them &#8212; and if someone posts content indicating that they might be in danger, the AI provides resources for them to seek help.</p>
<p>Blue Fever also has human moderators who help keep the platform safe. Still, as more Gen Z-ers flock to Blue Fever from Trill, it will become even more important that Blue Fever&#8217;s combination of human and AI moderation can scale.</p>

<p>Mental health-focused apps like Blue Fever and Trill aren&#8217;t intended to be a substitute for seeking professional help, and they&#8217;re not trying to compete with giants like TikTok, Snapchat, or Instagram<strong>. </strong>While these platforms aim to comfort Gen Z users who are disillusioned with traditional social apps, anonymous platforms have a troubling track record online.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ari and I have been very open since day one that our solution might not be perfect, and there could be better solutions or iterations on the ideas we have,&#8221; said Messinger. &#8220;We&#8217;re not attached to our solution per se &#8212; we love Trill and we obviously think it&#8217;s a great solution &#8212; but we&#8217;re more attached to the problem we&#8217;re solving than to the solution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anonymous social apps like Snapchat&#8217;s <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-05-11/snapchat-suspends-yolo-lmk">Yolo and LMK</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/12/in-wake-of-teen-suicides-ask-fm-faces-a-myspace-problem/">Ask.fm</a> have been linked to teen suicides, while <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/10/secret-sharing-app-whisper-left-users-locations-fetishes-exposed-web/">Whisper</a> accidentally exposed anonymous posters&#8217; data. Blue Fever and Trill are different from these platforms, since they&#8217;re built with mental health considerations at their core, but as Blue Fever considers rolling out commenting and absorbs the Trill userbase, the platform&#8217;s ability to keep users safe will be tested. McAnany said that Blue Fever doesn&#8217;t store personal identifiable information (PII) alongside user-generated content, and that the app doesn&#8217;t maintain a publicly-accessible API, which was how data from apps like Whisper was leaked.</p>
<p>&#8220;We love technology. We&#8217;re coders, we&#8217;re computer scientists, and we don&#8217;t dislike our phones. I love social media. I like to make TikToks,&#8221; Messinger said. &#8220;It&#8217;s just about setting healthy boundaries and continuing to ask the question of how our new spaces are going to intervene to help Gen Z and especially marginalized communities within that.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Instagram head Adam Mosseri <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CQwNfFBJr5A/?hl=en">recently</a> said was &#8220;no longer a photo-sharing app,&#8221; noting the company was prioritizing a shift into video amid significant competition from TikTok and YouTube. Today, Instagram is taking another step towards its larger goal of making video a more central part of the Instagram experience with news that it will now combine IGTV&#8217;s long-form video and Instagram Feed videos into a new format called simply &#8220;Instagram Video.&#8221;</p>
<p>These videos, both longer and shorter, will be found on users&#8217; profiles in a new &#8220;Video&#8221; tab.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when people encounter videos on Instagram, they&#8217;ll be able to tap anywhere on the video to enter into a fullscreen viewing mode. After watching, they can then choose to keep scrolling to discover more video content from creators or tap the back button to exit.</p>
<p>None of these changes will impact what Instagram is doing with Reels, though. The company&#8217;s short-form video platform and TikTok rival will continue to remain separate, we&#8217;re told. They won&#8217;t be mixed into this feed of videos, if users choose to scroll.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212603" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212603" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2212603" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/244367723_884783532474523_6124902347763306887_n.webp?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2212603" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Instagram</p></div></p>
<p>IGTV was already losing ground as a standalone product and brand ahead of this change. In early 2020, Instagram <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/18/igtv-button-gone/">dropped the orange IGTV button</a> from Instagram&#8217;s home page due to lack of traction. The move came at a time when, at most, just 7 million of Instagram&#8217;s 1-billion plus users had downloaded the standalone IGTV app, TechCrunch previously reported, citing <a href="https://sensortower.com/">Sensor Tower</a> research.</p>
<p>Instagram had explained its decision to pull out the button by saying that most Instagram users were finding IGTV content through the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/instagram-thinks-you-want-igtv-previews-in-your-home-feed/">previews</a> shared to the Feed and in Explore. But the reality was that IGTV as a standalone product was largely leading to <a href="https://mashable.com/article/instagram-igtv-videos-in-feed">clutter</a> and confusion in the flagship app, critics and creators argued, while failing to drive a large number of downloads to the standalone IGTV app.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The IGTV app, however, isn&#8217;t going away. Instagram tells us it will now be rebranded as &#8220;Instagram Video&#8221; and will host the &#8220;Instagram Video&#8221; formatted content, along with Instagram Live videos. But it will not host Reels videos.</p>
<p>With today&#8217;s update, users will still be able to upload their non-Reels videos in the same way as before &#8212; by clicking on the plus sign (+) in the top-right corner of the Instagram home page and selecting &#8220;Post.&#8221; Videos can be up to 60 minutes in length.</p>
<p>Instagram is also adding new features like trimming, filters, and people and location tagging as part of the updated upload experience.</p>

<p>Longer videos, which would have previously been identified as IGTV videos, will show 60-second previews in the Feed, as they did before. However, if the video is eligible for ads, the preview will still be 15-seconds, also as before.</p>
<p>Obviously, &#8220;IGTV Ads&#8221; will no longer be called this, with today&#8217;s changes. Instead, they&#8217;ll be called &#8220;In-Stream video ads.&#8221; Creators can continue to monetize their long-form videos and brands can use the format, as well. And the videos will still be a part of Instagram&#8217;s revenue-sharing tests with creators &#8212; again, as before. (But if businesses want to boost their videos to reach more people, they&#8217;ll need to be no longer than 60 seconds long, Instagram notes.)</p>
<p>Creators will also continue to be able to cross-post their videos through Stories and share through Direct Messages, says Instagram.</p>
<p>Instagram&#8217;s goal with these changes will be a more streamlined video experience. However, by keeping Reels separate, the app will still differentiate videos by length. But this is similar to how YouTube is addressing the TikTok threat. Its TikTok competitor, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/2126652/">known as YouTube Shorts</a>, has its own dedicated button in the YouTube app, just like Instagram Reels does.</p>
<p>Instagram says the changes are rolling out globally starting today across both iOS and Android.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A year ago, we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/this-former-tesla-cio-just-raised-150-million-more-to-pull-car-dealers-into-the-21st-century/">told you</a> about the opportunity that former Tesla CIO Jay Vijayan was chasing. His plan? To pull car dealers into the 21st century with a snazzy end-to-end automative SaaS platform like the one he helped develop inside Tesla. Customers could use it to order a car to their precise specifications; dealers could use it to see in real time to understand their inventory and seamlessly check in customers for service appointment; OEMs could use it to see exactly which of their parts were where, relative to said dealerships.</p>
<p>The list of ways the software would produce savings and improve efficiencies for both dealers and OEMs went on and on, as Vijayan explained it. Apparently, his San Carlos, Calif., company, Tekion, is gaining meaningful traction, too.</p>
<p>According to Vijayan, the company&#8217;s revenue has grown threefold over the last year; the number of states where dealers are using Tekion&#8217;s software has grown to 39 from 28; and the company just began working with its first dealership in Canada as part of a plan to become an international outfit.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the company is today announcing $250 million in Series D financing that bumps its valuation a year ago from $1 billion to $3.5 billion today, and its total funding from $185 million to $435 million. Alkeon Capital and Durable Capital co-led the round. Other investors include Hyundai Motor Company, several dealer groups across the U.S., and earlier backers Advent International and Index Ventures.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the global chip shortage and other parts-supply disruptions that drove down new vehicles sales down a whopping 26% last month, is only having a positive impact on Tekion, and a <a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/stories/2021/10/05/some-car-dealerships-benefitting-from-semiconductor-chip-shortage">recent piece</a> in Morning Brew suggests why.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="pyLrqu2O3h"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/this-former-tesla-cio-just-raised-150-million-more-to-pull-car-dealers-into-the-21st-century/">This former Tesla CIO just raised $150 million more to pull car dealers into the 21st century</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;This former Tesla CIO just raised $150 million more to pull car dealers into the 21st century&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/this-former-tesla-cio-just-raised-150-million-more-to-pull-car-dealers-into-the-21st-century/embed/#?secret=pyLrqu2O3h" data-secret="pyLrqu2O3h" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>When the outlet talked with the president of an automotive group in Columbus, Ohio, he said that because inventory is scarce, a sale that would have taken four hours to make before the chip shortage now closes in 52 minutes. That scarcity is also driving profits through the roof, with buyers paying more for both new and used inventory, and auto retailers benefiting from lower operating costs with less inventor.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Courtesy of tech from Tekion and some of its legacy competitors, retailers are presumably also able to operate faster when it comes to servicing the consumers who are waiting out the shortage and hoping to make their cars last longer.</p>
<p>In fact, a dealership in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., tells Morning Brew that its profits jumped 197% in Q1 2021 compared to Q1 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;The supply is less but the demand is strong, so everyone is making a lot of money,&#8221; Vijayan tells TechCrunch. &#8220;The dealers, the OEMs &#8212; they&#8217;re making a good amount of margin.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tekion, he adds, has been &#8220;very strong through that growth,&#8221; but Vijayan anticipates that next year will be even better when inventory begins to catch up to demand.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="9L0uquEfd6"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/ford-expects-semiconductor-rebound-new-vehicle-demand-to-increase-2021-profits/">Ford expects semiconductor rebound, new vehicle demand to increase 2021 profits</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Ford expects semiconductor rebound, new vehicle demand to increase 2021 profits&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/ford-expects-semiconductor-rebound-new-vehicle-demand-to-increase-2021-profits/embed/#?secret=9L0uquEfd6" data-secret="9L0uquEfd6" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&#8220;I believe sometime next year there will be some level of correction in the market and that our technology platform will help both dealers and OEMs navigate the correction much more smoothly because the platform will continue to learn and evolve to provide insights on where they should focus their business.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, the growth of Tekion &#8212; whose operations are split between California and Bangalore, India &#8212;  appears to largely organic. Though the automotive world is known for spending lavishly on marketing and for aggressive sales tactics, just 17 of Tekion&#8217;s employees now 1,350 employees work in sales. &#8220;We don&#8217;t spend any money in marketing, or it&#8217;s very negligible. [We&#8217;re growing through] word of mouth.&#8221;</p>
<p>A deal struck back in March with General Motors &#8212; which is an early investor in Tekion, as is BMW and the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi Alliance &#8212; is also surely helping.</p>
<p>Though each franchise is invited to opt in, or out, GM dealers now are beginning to use Tekion&#8217;s white-labeled dealer management software to make it easier for customers to purchase an Chevy, Cadillac, Buick or GMC brand electric vehicle. And the platform reportedly operates similar to &#8212; but much better than &#8212;  GM’s existing <a href="https://gmauthority.com/blog/2020/11/market-scan-solutions-help-enhance-general-motors-shop-click-drive-program/">Shop. Click. Drive. program</a>, which allows users to search for certain GM vehicles at dealerships near them and complete a portion of the transaction over the internet.</p>
<p>At least, in conversation earlier this year with <a href="https://www.autonews.com/retail/gm-launch-ev-digital-retail-tool-powered-tekion">Automotive News</a>, a vice president of Chevrolet described the software as akin to GM&#8217;s internal program &#8220;on steroids&#8221; and a &#8220;game changer.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Rent the Runway has a truly epic selection of items, and shopping for designer items at rental prices is good fun. But is it a good business? ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Good news, everyone: The Q4 IPO cycle is now well and truly underway.</p>
<p>For those of us who prefer to read IPO filings to funding announcements, new S-1 documents from <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001607939/000119312521291460/d163445ds1.htm">Udemy</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001468327/000119312521291103/d194411ds1.htm">Rent the Runway</a> and others just touched down. But we care the most about those two, as they are listings from venture-backed companies that we&#8217;ve covered here at TechCrunch over the years.</p>

<p>This morning, we&#8217;re going to dig into the core business results of each company, discussing how they make money and the state of their recent results. This entry will dive into Rent the Runway; afterward, we&#8217;ll dig into Udemy. Today is a rare two-Exchange day. You are welcome.</p>
<p>Off the top, I&#8217;m incredibly curious what impact the pandemic had on Rent the Runway&#8217;s numbers &#8212; after all, no one needed a loaner gown for months and months &#8212; and how strong its gross margins have proved over time. I also want to understand how expensive it is to buy all the clothing items that the company needs to operate, and how those costs are accounted for in its reporting.</p>

The company&#8217;s most recent major investment was a $125 million Series F announced in March 2019. The company was valued at a flat $1.0 billion after that transaction, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/rent-the-runway-series-f--57b9ddfa">Crunchbase data indicates</a>. Fidelity, Bain Capital Ventures, Highland Capital Partners, Kleiner Perkins, TCV and others invested in the company during its private life. Let&#8217;s see how it has performed.</p>
<h2>Rent the Runway&#8217;s IPO filing</h2>
<p>You are likely familiar with the Rent the Runway model: It buys expensive clothing aimed at women, renting the pieces out to subscribers and customers for a fraction of their retail price. The idea is that customers want a more varied wardrobe and want to wear items that they would not be able to afford on their own. Customers can subscribe to the company&#8217;s service or rent individual items piecemeal.</p>
<p>By lucky happenstance, your servant got his first real tour of the Rent the Runway product a few days ago, so I am moderately read-up on how it works in practice. Rent the Runway has a truly epic selection of items, and frankly shopping for designer items at rental prices is good fun.</p>
<p>But is it a good business? It&#8217;s a little hard to say, but I am not leaning toward yes.</p>
<p>COVID-19 was not kind to Rent the Runway. This makes sense. Clothes are for wearing places, and the pandemic kept most of us at home. Naturally, then, revenues at the company declined during its fiscal 2020, a 12-month period that ended January 31, 2021:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When the dot-com bubble popped 20 years ago <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/CSCapacity/CSCapacity-History2000s.html">a lot of people</a> thought that software development was going to get broadly outsourced. Instead, Silicon Valley evolved a new ethos around technical, product-focused founders and strong, central engineering teams.</p>
<p>And yet, software development outsourcing is a thing once again.</p>
<p>Which is why we’re looking to profile great software development shops that work with startups. Founders, just leave <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl">a recommendation in the survey below</a> and we’ll use your feedback to pick our next interview subjects for TechCrunch.</p>
<p>So why, you may ask, is software development outsourcing becoming more of a trend these days? Plenty of reasons, most of which you are probably familiar with. The overall growth of the tech sector, especially over the past decade, has pushed engineering salaries up across Silicon Valley and other startup hubs, while also putting more pressure on other costs of living. The number of skilled engineers for hire has correspondingly shrunk.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, improving internet connections and globalized education programs have allowed more people to develop in-demand software skills and make themselves available for hire.</p>
<p>The pandemic made distributed work more normal for most people, too, which helped break down remaining divides between a central engineering team and remote contributors.</p>
<p>While you can still find plenty of startups of all sizes that want to maintain one big engineering group at a physical office, most companies we talk to have bought in to remote work in some form.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All of these factors make outsourcing software development a far more normal move for many startups than you would have encountered 10 or 15 years ago.</p>
<p>So, tell us which great software consultants to profile below! If you&#8217;re a software consultant, share this <a href="https://oathtechevents.typeform.com/to/MXehi2kl">survey</a> with your clients.</p>
<p>This is part of our ongoing Experts series, where we profile the service providers who startup founders love to work with (based on founder recommendations). Software is our second service vertical after growth marketing, which we’re continuing as well — and we have more planned in the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Both Anchor and Descript have made their names as being among the most significant Podcast creation platforms of recent times, but hoving into the rear-view mirror recently has been <a href="https://podcastle.ai/">Podcastle</a>, an all-in-one platform that can cover off recording, production and publishing, all on the one platform.</p>
<p>It’s now raised $7 million in an early-stage funding round co-led by RTP Global and Point Nine Capital. S16 VC and the company&#8217;s previous investors Sierra Ventures and AI Fund also participated.</p>
<p><a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/creator-earnings-benchmark-report/">Podcastle</a> is tapping into the booming creator economy, valued by one report at around $104.2 billion, with there being at least 2 million podcasts out there these days.</p>
<p>Podcastle says it has around 150,000 creators so far, but says it’s adding to that number quickly with easy-to-use tools for podcast creators such as enabling studio-quality remote interviews using consumer-grade mics, multitrack recording and editing, and the ability to isolate the speech in the podcasts and improve it. It can also convert text to speech and vice-versa, allowing creators to edit their audio like text documents.</p>
<p>Artavazd Yeritsyan, founder and CEO of Podcastle and former VP of Engineering at Picsart, said: “In 2022, the average time spent listening should rise to 1 hour and 37 minutes per day, meaning the industry becomes one of the most influential categories in storytelling. We at Podcastle strive to remove all technical barriers and allow creators to focus on the thing that really matters — producing and delivering content they’d like to share with others”.</p>
<p>He says that while Descript is an editing tool, Podcastle is closer to a &#8220;creation&#8221; platform where creators can start with the remote interviews and continue editing without leaving the platform. “It’s like comparing Microsoft doc with Google Docs. Or Sketch versus Figma. In those cases, we are Google Docs and Figma,” he told me.</p>
<p>Alexander Pavlov, managing partner at RTP Global said: “The podcasting market reached $11.46 billion in 2020, and Podcastle offers a unified solution to satisfy aspiring hosts and creators. We see the huge potential behind the platform and are happy to further support Podcastle on its way to success”.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Louis Coppey, partner at Point Nine Capital said: &#8220;At Point Nine, we’ve invested in several creative software over the past few years such as PlayPlay in Paris, GravitySketch in London or Shapr3D in Budapest. These three businesses are radically simplifying the creation of videos and designs in VR or 3D. Podcastle is paving the way for the democratization of audio content production.&#8221;</p>
<p>Podcastle offers four pricing plans and its base features are available for free.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When Eric Tarczynski was first building Contrary Capital, he noticed there was an absence of venture capital firms focused on entrepreneurs within universities. So, he launched a $2.2 million debut fund to exclusively back the world&#8217;s top talent, or the student entrepreneurs that are spinning ambitious ideas out of their universities.</p>
<p>Years later, every investor wants to back founders earlier than their friends and foes. Contrary believes it has kept its competitive edge in backing early founders thanks to its secret: The firm has a community of 350 entrepreneurial students at colleges across the country that help it with deal flow. About 45% of the cohort identifies as female, and 65% identifies as non-white. It gives the firm the ability to learn about talented individuals before they even associate themselves with entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of funds out there where most of what they do is basically swap deal flow,” he said. “I don’t think we’ve ever backed a company through any other way other than simply finding it and discovering it ourselves or through our community.”</p>
<p>Sixty-five investments later, Contrary Capital announced today that it has raised its second fund, a $20 million investment vehicle that will cut checks between $100,000 to $2 million to pre-seed founders. While the check size is bigger than Tarczynski initially estimated, the total fund is less than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/16/part-fund-part-accelerator-contrary-capital-invests-in-student-entrepreneurs/ ">Contrary’s original target of $35 million</a>, a move he said was done in a “deliberate, intentional, and methodical way” to grow the portfolio in a “slow and steady” way.</p>
<p>But, does slow and steady work in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/reid-hoffman-on-the-evolution-of-blitzscaling-amid-the-pandemic/">world of $500 million seed funds? </a></p>
<p>“We really don&#8217;t find ourselves competing,” he said. “Prices have definitely gone up in aggregate, for sure, but we&#8217;re not going toe to toe with those kinds of groups because we&#8217;re just swimming in a different pool.” Some could argue that reality is an argument for community-centric, community-first firms.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4ZEGI2GQRE"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/02/what-a-community-means-in-the-modern-world-of-startups/">What a community means in the modern world of startups</a></p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Tarczynski’s ability to attract notable investors for his firm may show that he’s not alone in his vision. Investors in Contrary Capital include DoorDash executive Gokul Rajaram, Facebook CPO Chris Cox, GitHub COO Erica Brescia, a16z GP Vineeta Agarwala and Twitter CTO Parag Agrawal.</p>
<p>The firm targets between 5% to 10% ownership in each deal it makes. Its track record of investments include Lightyear, Brightland, Aryeo, Chums, Anduril and Ramp.</p>
<p>“Contrary is our secret hiring weapon. They’ve built a remarkably unique firm, and are easily one of our most helpful partners,” said Karim Atiyeh, co-founder and CTO at Ramp, a fintech <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-raises-300m-at-a-3-9b-valuation-makes-its-first-acquisition/">company recently valued at $3.9 billion.</a></p>
<h2>The next tech mafia</h2>
<p>Last year,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/contrary-capital-wants-to-invest-the-next-big-tech-mafia/"> Contrary announced Contrary Talent</a>, a new arm within the fund that will invest and support early-career folks and students to grow their tech ambitions. Contrary Talent, which now has hundreds of members, sources the top engineers, designers and managers at top tech companies and pairs them with top operators in tech for mentorship and job consultancy. It’s giving startup employees access to great minds before they have a pitch deck, or even know how to make one.</p>
<p>“As time went on and we spent more time on the ground at tech campuses, we realized not only were the number of young founders going up, but so were the number of top engineers, designers and product heads who were interested in working in tech,” Tarczynski said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/contrary-capital-wants-to-invest-the-next-big-tech-mafia/">when announcing Talent. </a></p>
<p>The arm will be a larger and larger part of Contrary Capital as time goes on, making it more of a venture franchise than a single vertical focus.</p>
<p>Even if the star employees don&#8217;t start their own funds, Talent is acquiring a database of some useful potential hires for their portfolio companies to poach. Tarczynski estimates that five out of the first 50 employees and interns at Ramp, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/24/ramp-raises-300m-at-a-3-9b-valuation-makes-its-first-acquisition/">one of its unicorn portfolio companies</a>, had an affiliation with Contrary Capital.</p>
<p>One bit that has changed for Contrary is that it is no longer doing Demo Days for founders that go through its summer accelerator program.</p>
<p>&#8220;We realized that specifically in this environment, doing things in a programmatic and an annual fashion, is not the move,&#8221; the investor said. &#8220;I think the idea of telling founders that &#8216;oh, now is the time that you should raise for your company&#8217; when their timelines can be totally different, didn&#8217;t make much sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Contrary&#8217;s second close and expansion so far is clearly adding confidence to the eight-person team. SEC filings show that <a href="https://formds.com/issuers/contrary-capital-iii-l-p">Contrary Capital is already raising its third fund.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://sureapp.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an insurance infrastructure startup, announced today that it has closed on $100 million in Series C funding at a $550 million valuation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York-based Declaration Partners and European growth investor Kinnevik co-led the financing, which also included participation from WndrCo and existing backers W. R. Berkley and Menlo Ventures. The round brings the Santa Monica-based startup’s total raised to $123.1 million since its 2015 inception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure launched its first (enterprise SaaS) product in early 2016, and today counts traditional financial services and fintech companies alike among its customers. Customers include </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Farmers Insurance, Chubb, Intuit, Betterment, Revolut, Carvana, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">several automotive manufacturers and a leading global credit card network</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. All offer insurance programs built on Sure’s infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Sure would not disclose hard revenue figures, it does claim to have been profitable since 2019. Also, CEO and co-founder Wayne Slavin says its annual recurring revenue (ARR) has grown “by more than 3X every year over the past several years.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a nutshell, Sure says it has created technology infrastructure that modernizes the entire insurance process and “allows it to be embedded into consumer experiences.” In other words, using Sure’s infrastructure, companies can sell insurance directly to consumers “in a matter of milliseconds,” the company claims, through an entirely digital experience that does not involve paper or humans.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is at the &#8220;forefront&#8221; of embedded insurance, according to Slavin.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That embedded insurance, he said, is “insurance that is integrated into the brand’s existing digital products across all industries,” he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This can range from car insurance included in the online purchase of a new electric car or buying a used car on Carvana to purchasing business insurance when you start your company’s new bank account,” Slavin added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefits of using its APIs allow companies to go to market with new insurance product offerings faster, simpler and cheaper compared to other methods, Slavin says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure differentiates in the three pillars that matter to our customers: tried and tested technology infrastructure, fastest speed to market, and the ability to offer fully embedded customer experiences,” Slavin told TechCrunch. “Like any legacy industry being disrupted there are many players trying to ride the wave of ‘embedded’ by rebranding their 1.0 experiences with a fancy new name. True embedded insurance experiences are unique and pioneered by Sure because they’re built from the ground up to fulfill an end-to-end transaction in the embedded channel.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital from its growth round to accelerate its global expansion, speed up new product launches and continue to “streamline embedded insurance customer experiences.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">International expansion will come in the form of new customers  &#8212; and offices &#8212;  in Europe, Latin America and Asia, as well as existing customers with successful domestic programs that plan to expand their insurance solutions to international customers, according to Slavin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure also plans to continue hiring. Sure’s current employee count is 80, which is up over 50% since last year. The company plans to triple its engineering headcount in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Stern, a partner at Declaration Partners, said his firm was drawn to Sure because of its view that Slavin is “a visionary leader” as well as “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the massive global market for this transformational technology.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sure is focused on the consumer experience, convenience and the power of embedding this capability into a consumer’s relationship with a brand,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kinnevik’s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ola Nordbye said a couple of his firm’s portfolio companies already use Sure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We like how it enables better customer experiences at the same time as it unlocks a massive untapped profit pool for the brands that have already acquired their customer base,” he wrote via email. “One of the most difficult fintech spaces to get right when it comes to this is within insurance. We were impressed by Sure’s state-of-the-art tech platform, which is advanced far beyond what you would expect from a company at this stage, a founder with a crystal clear vision of what he wants to create combined with deep sector knowledge, and stellar financial KPIs such as growth and profitability.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nordbye added that Sure is unique in how it enables new revenue streams on both ends of the equation (insurance companies as well as brands), and that they do that as a software play and without being a risk carrier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The fact that they can provide holistic offerings that can be delivered at incredible implementation speed is really unique as well,” she added.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For more than 20 years, <a href="https://www.dwavesys.com/">D-Wave</a> has been synonymous with quantum annealing. Its early bet on this technology allowed it to become the world&#8217;s first company to sell quantum computers, but that also somewhat limited the real-world problems its hardware could solve, given that quantum annealing works especially well for optimization problems like protein folding or route planning. But as the company announced at its <a href="https://www.qubits.com/schedule">Qubits</a> conference today, a superconducting gate-model quantum computer &#8212; of the kind IBM and others currently offer &#8212; is now also on its roadmap.</p>
<p>D-Wave believes the combination of annealing, gate-model quantum computing and classic machines is what its businesses&#8217; users will need to get the most value from this technology. &#8220;Like we did when we initially chose to pursue annealing, we’re looking ahead,&#8221; the company notes in today&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;We’re anticipating what our customers need to drive practical business value, and we know error-corrected gate-model quantum systems with practical application value will be required for another important part of the quantum application market: simulating quantum systems. This is an application that’s particularly useful in fields like materials science and pharmaceutical research.&#8221;</p>

<p>Early on, the company argues, annealing provided the fastest path to building quantum applications. Today, about 250 D-Wave customers have built applications for its hardware, which virtually all of its users access through its Leap cloud service. And since there&#8217;s clearly value in quantum annealing, too, D-Wave won&#8217;t do away with it. &#8220;Annealing remains core to our roadmap,&#8221; the company says, and it plans to continue to invest and develop its current systems. Indeed, D-Wave believes that annealing &#8212; and the optimization use cases it enables &#8212; will account for about a third of the quantum application market.</p>
<p>But the company is also clearly aware that this is a major change in its strategy and that it has a bit of explaining to do. For years, after all, D-Wave argued that its annealing technology might one day be able to be used for a general quantum computer, too. Now, however, the company notes that since the technology and theory behind it has matured &#8212; and D-Wave itself has learned a lot about the materials engineering challenges involved &#8212; it&#8217;s &#8220;exactly the right time from a technical and theory perspective to face the challenges of gate-model implementation head-on.&#8221;</p>
<p>D-Wave is also quite open about the fact that this isn&#8217;t going to be a straightforward journey. After all, this is still quantum computing we are talking about. Given this, it&#8217;s not surprising that the company&#8217;s roadmap for its gate-model processor doesn&#8217;t feature any dates, but instead phases that range from building a first qubit (phase 1) to building a general-purpose quantum processing unit (QPU).</p>
<p>While the gate-model news is obviously the headline event today, D-Wave also made a few other announcements. It&#8217;s launching a performance update to its latest 5,000+ qubit Advantage-class machines today, for example, that promises to allow its users to solve larger and more complex problems. It&#8217;s also launching its <a href="https://docs.ocean.dwavesys.com/en/latest/docs_dimod/reference/constrained.html">Constrained Quadratic Model</a> (CQM) solver today, which complements the existing range of solvers in D-Wave&#8217;s Leap service.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As for its overall roadmap, D-Wave expects to launch its latest Advantage machine with over 7,000 qubits &#8212; which will have a new design, too &#8212; and 20-way connectivity in a new topology, somewhere around 2023 or 2024, for example. And starting next year, it plans to launch new hybrid solvers that can solve mixed integer problems to help its users tackle more drug trial and chemical process optimization, logistics, scheduling and similar problems.</p>
<p>The real end-goal here, though, is to be able to offer a deeply integrated stack that offers its customers access to a set of hardware and software options that will allow them to tackle virtually any problem in quantum computing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our full-stack approach to quantum technology, everything from chip fabrication to system development, and from hybrid software solvers to robust open source developer tools, means that we’re the only company in the world that can both deliver on regular product innovations and bring a cross-platform stack to market quickly. That’s practical,&#8221; said D-Wave CEO Alan Baratz.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Snapchat is rolling out a new ‘Run for Office’ in-app tool to encourage young adults to run for local office. The company says the new Run for Office tool is designed to help younger users engage with democracy in an easy way. The goal of the tool is to tackle common barriers that young people face when determining whether they want to get involved in local politics.</p>
<p>“Powered with information from BallotReady, this simple tool will help Snapchatters explore hundreds of opportunities to run for local office based on the issues they care most about — from City Neighborhood Board and Township Council to School Board and State Representative,” the company said in <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/run-for-office">a statement.</a></p>
<p>The tool includes a centralized portal that curates over 75,000 upcoming elections on the federal, state and local levels that users may be eligible to take part in. Users will also be asked to identify issues that they are passionate about so that the tool can surface roles that they may be interested in. The new tool also provides access to candidate recruitment organizations and training programs such as Emerge America, Women’s Public Leadership Network, LGBTQ Victory, Vote Run Lead and more.</p>
<p>Snapchat users will also be able to nominate their friends to run for office through the tool. Users will be able to share stickers through the tool to start campaigning on Snapchat with their friends. Further, the tool includes a personalized campaign hub that shows users the steps they need to take to get on the ballot. The hub also provides information about filing deadlines and signature requirements.</p>
<p>“We know this next generation is the most diverse, yet currently only 6 percent of state legislators are under the age of 35. We hope our Run for Office initiative will help shape a more equitable, and reflective, democracy that includes all Americans, including young people,” the company said.</p>
<p>Snap says its app reaches 90 percent of 13-24 year olds in the U.S. and that this gives it an opportunity to encourage young users to become engaged citizens. Any Snapchat user in the U.S. can now access Run for Office by swiping down on the app’s camera screen or by searching for the tool within Snapchat.</p>
<p>The new tool isn’t the first time Snapchat has tried to get users involved in politics. During the U.S. election last year, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/register-to-vote-twitter-facebook-snapchat/">launched a voter-focused initiative</a> aimed at getting users registered to vote. The initiative featured a handful of celebrities including Snoop Dogg, Arnold Schwarzenegger and former President Barack Obama. Snapchat also rolled out a tool that prompted users to make a plan to vote with friends and request a mail-in ballot.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors is building a new facility at its Warren, Michigan, campus aimed at unlocking breakthrough cell technology that will drive down the cost of batteries while improving their range.</p>
<p>The automaker said Tuesday that the initial phase of the Wallace Battery Cell Innovation Center, which will be about 300,000 square feet and located on the campus of GM&#8217;s Global Technical Center, is already under construction and is expected to be completed in mid-2022. The center is projected to expand at least three times its initial footprint as needed. GM did not reveal the cost of the build except to say &#8220;hundreds of millions&#8221; of dollars were being invested.</p>
<p>The facility is named after Bill Wallace, a GM director who led the team that designed the battery systems in the Chevrolet Volt 1, Volt 2, Malibu Hybrid and Bolt EV. Wallace, who died in 2018, also pioneered GM&#8217;s relationship with LG Chem R&amp;D (now LG Energy Solution).</p>
<p>GM already has labs and an R&amp;D facility working on the development of cheaper and more energy-dense batteries. This new center is supposed to tie all of GM&#8217;s various efforts together, including work done at its chemical and materials subsystems and battery systems labs.</p>
<p>GM aims to develop batteries with an energy density of up to 1,200 watt-hours per liter and slash costs by at least 60%. The goal is ambitious — some might say lofty. It&#8217;s also viewed as a critical step for GM if it wants to compete with every other automaker, all of which have announced plans to shift to an all- or mostly electric vehicle portfolio.</p>
<p>Right now, the foundation of GM&#8217;s shift to EVs is its Ultium platform and Ultium lithium-ion batteries. That new electric architecture and battery system, which were revealed in 2020, will support a wide range of products across its brands, including compact cars, work trucks, large premium SUVs and performance vehicles.</p>
<p>GM has already announced plans to invest $5 billion into an Ultium cell battery manufacturing joint venture with LG Energy Solutions. The companies are establishing a battery cell assembly plant on a greenfield manufacturing site in the Lordstown area of Northeast Ohio that will create more than 1,100 new jobs and a factory in Spring Hill, Tennessee.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The Ultium batteries will use less of the rare earth material cobalt and feature a single common cell design that can be configured more efficiently for higher energy density and a smaller space than current GM batteries, the company has said.</p>
<p>The Wallace center will be a key part of GM&#8217;s plan to build cells that will be the basis of more affordable EVs with longer range in the future, according to Doug Parks, GM executive vice president of global product development, purchasing and supply chain. These breakthroughs won&#8217;t show up in this coming generation of Ultium batteries.</p>
<p>Work at the Wallace Center is expected to speed up the development of new technologies, including lithium-metal, silicon and solid-state batteries. The center will also focus on improving production methods that can be used at battery cell manufacturing plants, including GM&#8217;s joint ventures with LG in Lordstown and Spring Hill and other undisclosed locations in the U.S., the company said.</p>
<p>Notably, the new facility will have the capacity to build large-format prototype lithium-metal battery cells for vehicle usage beyond the small-scale lithium-metal cells typically used in handheld devices or research applications. These cells could be as large as 1,000 mm, nearly twice the size of the initial Ultium pouch cells and will be based on GM&#8217;s proprietary formula, the company said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">At the Nintendo Direct livestream a few weeks back, fans speculated that they might learn who the last remaining character in the extensive &#8220;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&#8221; lineup would be. Instead, we found out that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/nintendo-announced-that-chris-pratt-will-play-mario-on-the-big-screen/">Chris Pratt will be playing Mario</a> in a feature film.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But today, in Nintendo&#8217;s final &#8220;Mr. Sakurai Presents&#8221; livestream, game director Masahiro Sakurai revealed that the last fighter to be added to &#8220;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&#8221; will be Sora from the &#8220;Kingdom Hearts&#8221; series. The &#8220;Kingdom Hearts&#8221; games, first released in 2002, feature characters from the Disney and Pixar universes. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Sora is the main character in the franchise, wielding a keyblade &#8212; but a small chain with a Mickey Mouse logo dangles from his weapon. Though Sora is a video game fan favorite, some might find it a little jarring to see a Mickey Mouse shape alongside characters like Mario and Pikachu. Sora comes with nine songs and a new stage, the Hollow Bastion, which is a castle from the &#8220;Kingdom Hearts&#8221; games. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">This marks the 82nd playable character to be added to the beloved game, which was </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/06/super-smash-bros-ultimate-is-good-clean-butt-kicking-fun/">released for Nintendo Switch</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> in December 2018. But &#8220;Doom&#8221; fans can at least pretend to be &#8220;Doom Slayer&#8221; with a new Mii outfit &#8212; other Mii outfits include characters from &#8220;Splatoon.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Sakurai said in the livestream that six years ago, when &#8220;Super Smash Bros.&#8221; for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U posted a ballot asking fans to vote for which characters they wanted in &#8220;Smash,&#8221; the most requested new fighter was Sora. The game director added that Sora will be an easier character to play with, making the fighter suitable for beginners.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">To use Sora, available on October 18, players can download the <a href="https://smashbros.nintendo.com/buy/dlc/">Fighters Pass Vol. 2</a> expansion, which costs $29.99, but individual expansion characters can also be added to the game for $5.99. </span>Other characters in this expansion pack include Steve/Alex from &#8220;Minecraft,&#8221; Sephiroth from &#8220;Final Fantasy 7,&#8221; Pyra/Mythra from &#8220;Xenoblade Chronicles 2,&#8221; Kazuya Mishima from &#8220;Tekken,&#8221; and Min Min from &#8220;Arms.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amid a deluge of new creator platforms, a startup called <a href="https://firesidechat.com/">Fireside</a> is launching today with what it believes will be a compelling proposition for professional creators in need of a more robust set of tools for content creation, distribution, measurement, and monetization. The service, which offers a platform for live and interactive shows, had been making waves during its beta period thanks to financial backing by Mark Cuban, who has also taken the rare step of naming himself as co-founder. He&#8217;s joined by former Googler, YouTuber, and Node co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/falon/">Falon Fatemi</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/sugarcrm-acquires-node-to-gain-predictive-customer-intelligence/">who sold her last company to SugarCRM</a>, and early Yammer employee <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-ihbe/">Miek Ihbe.</a></p>
<p>The platform is now exiting its beta period, where it was tested with over 500 creators whose collective audience reach has topped 100 million, the company says.</p>
<p>While there had been some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315866/mark-cuban-fireside-app-podcast-platform-clubhouse">early</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnbbrandon/2021/02/15/mark-cuban-is-ready-to-completely-destroy-the-clubhouse-app/?sh=5d9aece772db">comparisons</a> between Fireside and <a href="https://musically.com/2021/02/09/startup-fireside-will-be-a-cross-between-podcasts-and-clubhouse/">live</a> <a href="https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tech/news/here-is-what-upcoming-clubhouse-rival-fireside-may-look-like-71615094079474.html">audio</a> platforms like Clubhouse or Twitter Spaces, hosting live audio content is only a part of Fireside&#8217;s feature set. The company&#8217;s hesitance to speak about its plans pre-launch, however, allowed rumors to circulate to the point where many seemed to believe Fireside would be yet another Clubhouse clone.</p>
<p>The reality is that Fireside is offering a broader set of services.</p>
<p>The platform today offers the ability for creators to broadcast either live audio or video content, which can be simulcast to other social networks, streamed live in Fireside, recorded, saved, and edited for later distribution to other social platforms or podcast destinations, or viewed on-demand within Fireside itself. In other words, it&#8217;s attempting to combine everything that makes participating with live shows engaging with the need creators have to turn that content into something that has a longer life outside of the platform where it was originally hosted or recorded.</p>
<p>Along the way, Fireside also offers a slate of tools for promotion, editing, measurement, distribution, monetization, and audience growth. These aren&#8217;t meant to serve only as optional add-ons, but are part of Fireside&#8217;s end-to-end content production experience &#8212; an experience that creators today often manage today by using a multitude of single-purpose tools.</p>

<p>&#8220;The biggest challenge to generating quality content is both identifying the best professional creators that can do that as well as attracting audiences. And the reality is the best professional creators are able to do both,&#8221; explains Fatemi, who serves as Fireside&#8217;s CEO. &#8220;The Holy Grail around understanding what makes quality content, or a hit, is understanding how audiences are reacting to it as they&#8217;re consuming it live. If you can understand this, you can not just engineer the hits &#8212; you can create the hits,&#8221; she says.</p>
<p>In Fireside, creators can choose whether they&#8217;re hosting live audio, live video, or a combination of both. Like other live platforms, Fireside includes the concept of a digital stage where co-hosts and guests can join the show and the audience react in the form of emojis &#8212; like clapping hands, thumbs up, hearts, laughter, and more. The show itself is automatically recorded in high fidelity and a copy is saved locally in case of network issues.</p>
<p>When the recording has wrapped, creators gain access to a transcript and the ability to edit the content before further distribution. In the editing interface, creators can cut out audio or video segments with a tap. This part is aided by how Fireside presents the data it recorded related to user sentiment and engagement. For example, if a portion of the show included negative sentiment or low engagement, a creator may choose to pull that piece out before distributing the show to other platforms. They can also edit the transcript text accordingly.</p>

<p>During a live show, the content can be simultaneously streamed to social platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitch, or any platform offering a server URL or Stream Key, like <a href="https://vimeo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040582051-Introduction-How-to-go-live-using-Vimeo">Vimeo</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/128901/go-live-using-a-custom-stream-rtmp-?lang=en">LinkedIn Live</a>, and others. (Instagram is not supported as it doesn&#8217;t have an open API. But creators so far have been uploading their content as IGTV videos after the fact). When editing is completed, the show can also be distributed anywhere you can upload audio or video content, like social media platforms, podcast services, or RSS (for podcasts).</p>

<p>Creators can also monetize their audience directly on Fireside in addition to whatever revenue they&#8217;re generating externally on social platforms or through podcast subscriptions. At launch, Fireside aims to support subscriptions and ticketed events where creators set their own prices. It supports in-show advertising in partnership with <a href="https://libsyn.com/">Libsyn</a>. It plans to support brand integrations, including gifting and tipping. It even supports NFTs.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212500" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212500" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2212500" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.26.24-AM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="665" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.26.24-AM.jpg 706w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.26.24-AM.jpg?resize=150,147 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.26.24-AM.jpg?resize=300,293 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.26.24-AM.jpg?resize=680,665 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.26.24-AM.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.26.24-AM.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.26.24-AM.jpg?resize=64,64 64w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2212500" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fireside</p></div></p>
<p>With tickets and subscriptions, Fireside only takes a 3% cut to cover its costs up until the creator makes $30,000 in revenue. It then takes 15% &#8212; a decision the company made after analyzing the state of the market and speaking to creators about what they felt was fair.</p>
<p>With NFTs, it plans to allow creators to clip a moment of their show as an NFT and then distribute it to other NFT marketplaces in a few taps.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think NFTs are a really powerful vehicle for allowing creators to turn their content into currency,&#8221; notes Fatemi, adding that NFTs are a part of &#8220;the future of entertainment,&#8221; in the company&#8217;s opinion.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212498" style="width: 343px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212498" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2212498" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.55-AM.jpg?w=462" alt="" width="333" height="490" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.55-AM.jpg 474w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.55-AM.jpg?resize=102,150 102w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.55-AM.jpg?resize=204,300 204w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.55-AM.jpg?resize=462,680 462w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.55-AM.jpg?resize=34,50 34w" sizes="(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2212498" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fireside</p></div></p>
<p>But Fireside, which had been hesitant to talk about its product pre-launch, is still saving some details for a later date. Currently, that includes which specific NFT partners it plans to work with on this feature &#8212; one of the bigger differentiators between its platform and other creator tools in its same space.</p>
<p>The company is also unwilling to detail the state of outside investment in its business, though already it&#8217;s been established that Cuban has taken a role as both co-founder and investor, and that Fireside was apparently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22601191/fireside-app-mark-cuban-falon-fatemi-libsyn-rode-invest">soliciting investment earlier this summer.</a></p>
<p>Cuban&#8217;s role as co-founder is not typical for the entrepreneur turned investor, Shark Tank star, and Dallas Mavericks owner.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s incredibly involved,&#8221; touts Fatemi. (Though not so involved as to join a press interview, we should note!) She says Cuban has been offering Fireside great guidance, particularly from the product side of things. &#8220;He is an example of someone who&#8217;s built a new media empire by themselves. So he deeply understands the challenges that professional creators are facing,&#8221; Fatemi adds.</p>
<p>The company is in the process of closing on its Series A, which is why it won&#8217;t talk about its backers for the time being.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212499" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212499" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2212499" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.34-AM.jpg?w=650" alt="" width="650" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.34-AM.jpg 854w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.34-AM.jpg?resize=143,150 143w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.34-AM.jpg?resize=287,300 287w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.34-AM.jpg?resize=768,804 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.34-AM.jpg?resize=650,680 650w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.34-AM.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-05-at-8.28.34-AM.jpg?resize=48,50 48w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2212499" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fireside (brand activations example)</p></div></p>
<p>Though now officially launched, Fireside isn&#8217;t necessarily wide open to anyone. The creators it&#8217;s choosing to onboard must be professionals, even if they&#8217;re still in the early days of growing their fandom. So far, the company has been working with creators including Michael Dell, who&#8217;s launching a new book; true-crime podcaster Robert Riggs; the cast and creator of &#8220;Entourage;&#8221; comedians from the Laugh Factory; author and research Daniel Pink; and others.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking at [whether they have] invested in their brand and their community. Are they actually content creators&#8230;is this what they&#8217;re wanting to do full-time?,&#8221; explains Fatemi. There&#8217;s no requirement to have a certain number of existing fans, she notes. &#8220;It&#8217;s more about where they are at in their journey and how serious they are in building a media business.&#8221;</p>
<p>This focus on pre-vetted professional creators and domain experts, the company believes, may help it to cut down on some of the content moderation issues facing live streaming tools used by the general public. But since <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/jul/26/joe-rogan/spotifys-joe-rogan-repeats-inaccurate-claim-they-a/">even professionals can spread misinformation</a>, Fireside will still need to decide where it stands as a platform in terms of the content it, itself, chooses to host.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of our approach, we haven&#8217;t seen many challenges,&#8221; Fatemi says, of these sorts of broader culture-setting decisions it will ultimately need to make. &#8220;But obviously, as we start to open the platform up more, we need to be very thoughtful about this,&#8221; she adds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://hotglue.xyz/">Hotglue</a>, an early stage startup that wants to make it easier for developers to connect to business applications like Salesforce, announced a $1.5 million seed today led by Uncommon Capital and a group of angels. The company is the brainchild of a couple of 20 year old founders, CEO Hassan Syyid and CRO David Molot, who dropped out of the University of Maryland last year to build their startup.</p>
<p>Syyid explained that the idea that caused them to shift their life plans is a product for developers that makes it easier to build integrations with business apps like Salesforce, QuickBooks and HubSpot. Today the pair has built 250 such connectors based on the open source project<a href="https://meltano.com/"> Meltano</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re a developer and you want to build a product that serves businesses, you generally have to access that data from wherever it lives. And so whether that is a Salesforce account or QuickBooks account, accessing the data can have a lot of challenges, and so we make it easier by giving you an embeddable way to solve that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>While using connectors to access data on business systems isn&#8217;t necessarily a new idea, Syyid says that their focus on developers is different. &#8220;I think traditionally if you think about products in the data [integration market], you&#8217;re thinking about FiveTran or Stitch because they can help consolidate your company&#8217;s internal data into a data warehouse. The difference here is that our users are actually engineering teams,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Syyid came up with the idea for the company while interning at an accounting startup where he saw the company&#8217;s customers struggling to access Quickbooks data and deal with issues like exceeding the number of calls allowed for the API. So he built a connector to handle all of that.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;YC grad Wasp lands $1.5M seed to help developers build web apps faster&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/04/yc-grads-wasp-land-1-5m-seed-to-help-developers-build-web-apps-faster/embed/#?secret=1itoeaDgvP" data-secret="1itoeaDgvP" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>At this point, he connected with his friend Molot and the two decided to drop out of school to pursue their idea full time. While their parents were worried about their decision, they initially accepted the idea of taking a semester off to work on building the company. They each moved home and went to work. Getting into the Y Combinator Summer 21 cohort helped convince their parents that they were onto something.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We took a gap semester technically initially, and then we got into Y Combinator and then our parents were like &#8216;okay maybe this is legitimate&#8217;, and that kind of gave them the vote of confidence to allow us to pursue this,&#8221; Molot said.</p>
<p>At YC, they learned about building a business and listening to customers and building connectors that solved the problems their target developer audience was facing as they tried to build these integrations themselves. It also prepared them to build a business and revenue engine to start selling the product, knowledge that they have continued to build on.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have spent a lot of time reading and building our knowledge base internally and making sure that we&#8217;re always on point using knowledge tools that have helped us understand these business metrics and ideas,&#8221; Molot said.</p>
<p>They also began writing content early on, publishing about the nature of the data integration <a href="https://hotglue.medium.com/">on Medium</a>, and this <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/why-i-used-an-embedded-etl-tool-for-my-b2b-app-56d0b3d8ac6?source=user_profile---------14----------------------------">content marketing approach</a> helped them get their name out there and further refine the problem as they built their products.</p>
<p>Today they have around 15 customers with a similar number in the pipeline. They are generating revenue and growing the active user base by 50% month over month. With the seed investment, they hope to hire a couple of engineers and continue building the company.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Tesla has been ordered to pay $137 million in damages to a Black former worker who accused the company of turning a blind eye to discrimination and racial abuse at the company&#8217;s EV plant in Fremont California, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/business/tesla-racism-lawsuit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1"><em>Washington Post</em></a> has reported. A San Francisco federal court jury awarded the judgement — reportedly one of the largest in an individual race discrimination employment case — to Owen Diaz, an elevator operator who worked as a contract employee in 2015 and 2016.</p>
<p>In the lawsuit, Diaz alleged that he faced discrimination &#8220;straight from the Jim Crow era,&#8221; in which he was subjected to racial slurs. He alleged that Tesla employees left drawings of swastikas, racist graffiti and offensive cartoons around the plant, while supervisors neglected to halt the abuse. &#8220;Tesla&#8217;s progressive image was a façade papering over its regressive, demeaning treatment of African-American employees,&#8221; according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>The jury awarded Diaz $6.9 million for emotional distress, but the majority, $130 million, was punitive damages against Tesla. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great thing when one of the richest corporations in America has to have a reckoning of the abhorrent conditions at its factory for Black people,&#8221; said the lawyer for Diaz, Lawrence Organ.</p>
<p>&#8220;It took four long years to get to this point,” Diaz told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/business/tesla-racism-lawsuit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1"><em>New York Times</em></a>. “It’s like a big weight has been pulled off my shoulders.”</p>
<p>In response to the verdict, Tesla downplayed the allegations in a <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/regarding-todays-jury-verdict" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">blog post</a>written by human resources VP Valerie Capers Workman. &#8220;In addition to Mr. Diaz, three other witnesses (all non-Tesla contract employees) testified at trial that they regularly heard racial slurs (including the N-word) on the Fremont factory floor,” she wrote. “While they all agreed that the use of the N-word was not appropriate in the workplace, they also agreed that most of the time they thought the language was used in a ‘friendly’ manner and usually by African-American colleagues.”</p>
<p>Tesla added that it was responsive to Mr. Diaz&#8217;s complaints, firing two contractors and suspending another. She said that while the facts didn&#8217;t justify the verdict, the company was &#8220;not perfect&#8221; in 2015 and 2016, &#8220;but we have come a long way.&#8221; The company has yet to say whether it plans to appeal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chile’s </span><a href="https://www.buk.cl/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which has developed a human resources management platform for Latin American companies, announced today that it has raised $50 million in a Series A funding round that values the company at $417 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a few notable things about this financing. For one, it represents one of the largest (if not the) largest Series A rounds raised by a Latin American startup to date. Secondly, it makes Buk the third most valuable startup in Chile after Cornershop and NotCo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, Brazil and increasingly as of late Mexico, have received the bulk of venture dollars from venture investors. But more and more, other regions in Latin America such as Chile are also attracting global investor interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also of note is that Buk was bootstrapped for the first five years of its SaaS operations. Its first institutional investors include San Francisco-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">based Greenoaks, which led the Series A round, and SoftBank. Interestingly, a group of founders from unicorns such as Rappi, Kavak, Konfio, GBM, Ualá and Brex also put money in the round.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded in 2017 by Chileans Jaime Arrieta, Santiago Lira, Teresita Morán, Felipe Sateler and Ricardo Sateler, Buk is building a cloud-based platform that it says allows companies to manage their human resources </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">end to end” &#8212; from the payment of salaries to professional development. Buk also includes tools like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">company climate surveys, performance evaluations, recruitment modules and attendance monitoring </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the mission to &#8220;build a happier workplace&#8221;.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buk CEO Jaime Arrieta said the company has been growing organically, and has historically been financing its growth with revenues from its sales. While Arrieta declined to reveal hard revenue figures, he told TechCrunch that Buk saw its annual recurring revenue (ARR) increase by 151% in September compared to September of 2020.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have been able to double our size year over year [without institutional funding],” he said. “However, our</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">excellent results, differentiated offering, and the comprehensiveness of our product, which distinguishes us</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">from competitors, attracted funds like Greenoaks and SoftBank, who wanted to invest in Buk to boost our </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">growth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Buk has</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over 4,000 clients that hail from a variety of industries in Latin America, including educational institutions, investment banks, fast food chains, law firms and others.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">It powers payroll for over 400,000 employees of Buk customers every month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buk’s infrastructure is hosted on AWS servers, which means it is able to access multiple tools across its technological ecosystem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">performs daily backups of its customers&#8217; information, allowing it to keep the service running even in the event of third-party data failures. Buk says it also offers a “friendly” programming language that has many facilities &#8220;to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly develop functionalities.&#8221;  </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212493" style="width: 2010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212493" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2212493 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sin-título-7506-e1633436896228.jpg" alt="Buk Series A" width="2000" height="1334" /><p id="caption-attachment-2212493" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Buk</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buk also has a social good component. As the COVID-19 pandemic raged last year, the company launched Buk Starter, a free digital remuneration </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">tool for companies with up to 20 employees. Today, the tool is used by 4,000 SMEs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital primarily to accelerate its growth in Mexico, consolidate the market in Colombia and Peru (Where it expanded in 2019 and 2020), double down on technology and product development and toward the acquisition of new companies at the regional level. Buk recently acquired CTRL, an assistance company in Chile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next several years, the company also aims to increase its market share in each of the countries where </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">it operates. In September alone, Buk says it grew 7% in Chile, 20% in Colombia, and 23% in Peru month-over-month</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buk has more than 300 employees, and says that 50% of the company’s workforce are women.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenoaks has previously also backed the likes of Kavak, Discord, Robinhood, Stripe, Rippling and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toast. SoftBank has backed companies like Slack, Uber, Rappi, Alibaba, Didi, Flipkart and Bytedance.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;HR software is the core source of truth for a company&#8217;s employee data, underpinning critical functions </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">like payroll, benefits, and people management,” said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neil Mehta, founder and partner at Greenoaks, in a written statement. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But until now, businesses in Latin America have relied </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">primarily on homegrown solutions that don’t scale or imported software that&#8217;s poorly tailored to local </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">needs. Buk is building an HRIS suite made in and for Latin America, enabling more efficient workflows </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">throughout the full employee lifecycle, from recruiting to off-boarding. We think the company is poised to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> build the region&#8217;s #1 HR technology platform.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/yubico/">Yubico</a>, the maker of hardware security keys, has unveiled the YubiKey Bio, its first key to support biometric authentication for passwordless logins and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/two-factor-authentication/">multi-factor authentication</a> (2FA)</p>
<p>The launch of the YubiKey Bio comes as tech giants transition away from traditional password-based logins, a prime target for cyberattacks. Microsoft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/microsoft-now-lets-you-sign-in-without-your-password/">recently rolled out a passwordless sign-in option</a> to all consumer accounts, and Google this year <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/a-simpler-and-safer-future-without-passwords/">announced plans to eventually eliminate the password</a>.</p>
<p>The YubiKey Bio — first teased almost two years ago at Microsoft Ignite in November 2019 — jumps on the passwordless bandwagon by embedding a built-in fingerprint reader to the key. Yubico describes this as the “next logical step” for the company, particularly as most modern laptops still don’t feature built-in biometric security.</p>
<p>Once a fingerprint is enrolled on the device, the data is stored in a secure element, while the biometric subsystem runs independently of the key’s core security functionality. All communication between the secure element and the rest of the key is encrypted to help thwart replay attacks.</p>
<p>“With the launch of the YubiKey Bio Series, we are proud to raise the standard for biometric security keys, enabling simple and strong passwordless authentication for our enterprise customers and everyday YubiKey users,” said <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/fireside-chat-with-stina-ehrensvard-yubico-disrupt-berlin-2018/">Stina Ehrensvärd</a>, CEO and co-founder of Yubico.</p>

<p>The company also notes that while no security system is foolproof, a hacker with a fake print would need to get their hands on the user’s physical device to take advantage of that print, which dramatically reduces the threat to the average YubiKey customer. Yubico will allow users to use their PINs to login in case biometric authentication does not work due to variables in skin texture related to moisture or temperature.</p>
<p>Like Yubico&#8217;s other hardware security keys, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/09/yubico-reveals-new-yubikey/">such as the YubiKey 5C NFC</a>, the YubiKey Bio is a plug-and-play device; it doesn&#8217;t require any batteries, drivers, or associated software, and it will work across macOS, Windows and Linux machines. YubiKeys also support open security and authentication standards — FIDO U2F, FIDO2, and WebAuthn protocols — so they work on Macs, iPhones, Windows PCs, and Android devices, as well as apps and services that support FIDO protocols out-of-the-box.</p>
<p>The YubiKey Bio is out now in both USB-A ($80) and USB-C ($85) versions.</p>
