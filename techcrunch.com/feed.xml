										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tel Aviv’s <a href="http://www.orca-ai.io/">Orca AI</a>, a computer vision startup that can be retrofitted to cargo ships and improve navigation and collision avoidance, has raised $13 million in a Series A funding, taking its total raised to over $15.5 million. While most cargo ships carry security cameras, computer vision cameras are rare. Orca AI hopes its solution could introduce autonomous guidance to vessels already at sea.</p>
<p>There are over 4,000 annual marine incidents, largely due to human error. The company says this is getting worse as the Coronavirus pandemic makes it harder for regular crew changes. The recent events in the Suez Canal have highlighted how crucial this industry is.</p>
<p>The funding round was led by OCV Partners, with Principal Zohar Loshitzer joining Orca AI’s board. Mizmaa Ventures and Playfair Capital also featured.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company was founded by naval technology experts, Yarden Gross and Dor Raviv. The latter is an former Israel navy computer vision expert. Customers include Kirby, Ray Car Carriers and NYK.</p>
<p>Orca AI’s AI-based navigation and vessel tracking system supports ships in difficult to tricky to navigate situations and congested waterways, using vision sensors, thermal and low light cameras, plus algorithms that look at the environment and alert crews to dangerous situations.</p>
<p>On the raise, Yarden Gross, CEO, and co-founder said: “The maritime industry… is still far behind aviation with technological innovations. Ships deal with increasingly congested waterways, severe weather and low-visibility conditions creating difficult navigation experiences with often expensive cargo… Our solution provides unique insight and data to any ship in the world, helping to reduce these challenging situations and collisions in the future.” </p>
<p>Zohar Loshitzer, Principal from OCV added: “Commercial shipping has historically been a highly regulated and traditional industry. However, we are now “witnessing a positive change in the adoption of tech solutions to increase safety and efficiency.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Samsung announced Galaxy Upcycling a few years back, but has largely been quiet on that front, aside from some stage time at CES back in January. Today the company announced that Upcycling at Home is being opened to beta today for users in the U.S., Korea and the U.K.</p>
<p>It’s a pretty novel program, in a world where consumers are encouraged to scrap their old devices every two to three years for something shiny and new. The program is designed to breathe new life into handsets that might otherwise be tossed in a landfill or stashed away in a drawer.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2141393" style="width: 1290px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141393" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2141393 size-full" style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-Sound-Sensor.gif" alt="" width="1280" height="800" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141393" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Samsung</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We are rethinking how we use existing resources, and we believe the key to upcycling is to enable solutions that transform old technology into something new by adding value,” VP Sung-Koo Kim said in a release tied to the news. “We are committed to integrating sustainable practices into our day-to-day lives, and through Galaxy Upcycling at Home, users can join our journey toward a more sustainable future.”</p>
<p>Specifically, the products can be revamped into smart home devices, like childcare and pet monitors.</p>
<p>The feature can be accessed within the SmartThings Labs feature found in Samsung’s SmartThings App. When enabled, the product can send alerts when things like a crying baby or barking dog are detected. The recorded sound will be sent as part of the alert. Another feature uses built-in sensors to turn on a room&#8217;s lights when things get dark. The service will optimize device battery so it can operate for an extended period while detecting these inputs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Excel and Google Sheets can only address pure ‘number crunching’ in a limited way. A new UK startup, <a href="https://www.causal.app/">Causal</a> hopes to tackle this issue and has now raised a $4.2 million seed round led by Accel. Existing investors Coatue, Passion Capital, Verissimo Ventures, Naval Ravikant, Varadh Jain and others, also participated. The raise brings Causal&#8217;s total funding to $5.5 million, which the company will use to grow the engineering team and launch on Product Hunt next month.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that spreadsheets are crucial to normal business operations, there are multiple use cases for sales teams, finances teams etc, all of which are very different. Causal hopes to address these with a more data-driven, collaborative approach.</p>
<p>Founded in 2019 by Taimur Abdaal and Lukas Koebis, Causal is &#8220;aiming to replace Excel&#8221; by starting with the spreadsheet&#8217;s foundation: formulas&#8221;. Causal says its formulas “read like plain English” such “as Profit = Revenue &#8211; Costs&#8221;  and also claims it typically takes “100x fewer formulas” in Causal to build exactly the same model in Excel.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Business planning and forecasting should involve every team in a company, but the complexity of spreadsheets means that it’s often siloed within finance,” said Taimur Abdaal, CEO and co-founder in a statement. “We want to democratize this process with a truly horizontal product that every knowledge worker can use, and we’re excited to have Accel join us on the next phase of our journey.”</p>
<p>Over a call Abdaal told me: “We started really because we saw how difficult it is to actually work with numbers and spreadsheets. You have these esoteric formulas that are really hard to understand which is why something like 80% of spreadsheets have errors in them. Spreadsheets are also really disconnected from the other tools that companies use. Finance teams typically spend days with everyone manually pulling in data from accounting systems. So, these are some of the problems that we&#8217;re trying to solve. Right now we are a pretty small team of five, mostly engineers, and we&#8217;re really focused on building a very horizontal product that every team in a company can use for number crunching. As a seed investment it&#8217;s really, really nice because it lets us double down on some of the traction that we&#8217;ve gotten.”</p>
<p>“Many of us have felt the pain that comes with building and managing large spreadsheets across teams and data sources firsthand,” added Seth Pierrepont, Partner at Accel. “Taimur and Lukas are talented, product-focused founders who have taken the intuitive Excel-like interface that we’re all familiar with, and supercharged it with data integrations, collaboration features, and high-quality visualizations. Beyond that, they’ve leveraged their data science and mathematics backgrounds to offer sophisticated models out of the box, giving all users the ability to harness much more powerful predictive capabilities.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last five years have seen </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a plethora of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> fintech applications in Nigeria (and Africa, in general) grow at an astonishing rate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But most of these companies and developers find it difficult to access real-time banking data</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This, in turn, creates a bottleneck when onboarding and verifying customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2019, Plaid-esque companies, but with different twists to their offerings, have emerged to solve these issues</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Nigeria&#8217;s <a href="https://okra.ng/">Okra</a>, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">arguably</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the first to gain mainstream attention, is announcing that it has closed a seed round of $3.5 million</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S.-based Susa Ventures led this latest tranche of investment. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other investors include TLcom Capital (the sole investor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/nigerias-okra-raises-1m-from-tlcom-connecting-bank-accounts-to-apps/">from its $1 million pre-seed round</a> in 2020), </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">newly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> joined Accenture Ventures and some angel investors</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In total, Okra has raised $4.5 million in two rounds and the company will use the investment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to expand its data infrastructure across Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.   </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okra likes to describe itself as an API “super-connector” that creates a secure portal and process to exchange real-time financial information between customers, applications and banks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/faraashiru/">Fara Ashiru Jituboh</a> and <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/david-peterside-793297123">David Peterside</a> founded the company in June 2019. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its launch in January 2020, Okra has aggressively pushed by connecting to all banks in Nigeria and even claims to have a 99.9% guaranteed uptime</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its business model provides integrations to developers and businesses into existing banking services and takes commissions off </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> transactions</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These integrations include accounts authorization, balance, identity, income, payments and transactions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per partners (developers and businesses), they are well over 100 with some big names like Access Bank, Aella, Interswitch and uLesson</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ashiru Jituboh tells TechCrunch that besides making APIs, Okra is in the business of selling &#8220;digital first-experiences and transformation&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are building an open finance infrastructure that enables developers and businesses to offer digital-first experiences and financial products,&#8221; she said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re at a point where businesses are realizing that digital transformation is one of the most conversation happening in most boardrooms</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So for us, we&#8217;re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">essentially</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> making tools and services needed to achieve digital transformation at scale with our APIs</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positioning the company in such a way might be the reason for its immense growth in over a year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company says it has recorded over 150,000 live API calls noticing an average month-on-month API call growth of 281%</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okra has also analyzed more than 20 million transactions; last month, it analyzed 27.5% of this figure at over 5.5 million transaction lines</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a bit of context, Plaid has analyzed more than 10 billion transactions in its eight years of existence</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it&#8217;s a good indicator that we&#8217;re on the right trajectory </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> traction,&#8221; COO Peterside added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If anything one can learn from the Nigerian fintech ecosystem over the past two years is that with growth comes regulatory scrutiny</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since last year, different regulatory moves from some of the country&#8217;s financial bodies have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been targeted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> toward payments, crypto and wealth tech startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While these regulators claim to foster the interests of the Nigerian public and protect consumers, their moves reek of innovation stifling and jurisdictional play</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, these regulators appear not to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be concerned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the activities of API fintech infrastructure startups</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But will they be prepared to deal with the situation should that change?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Peterside, Okra is preparing for unforeseen circumstances by taking the initiative and engaging with the regulators in its space</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since 2018 when the EU released the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to deal with data protection and violations resulting from it, most African countries have mirrored these laws for their region</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Nigeria, there&#8217;s the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR), and due to its similarities with the GDPR, Peterside believes Okra has nothing to worry about &#8212; at least for now</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what the law says, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the fine print is clear not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in Nigeria but globally, so how we operate as a business is straightforward</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But in terms of what we think, the regulators whether they make the necessary decisions&#8230; we can&#8217;t </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> speak about that but generally, the laws and global standards are clear,&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the company succeeds in keeping harmful regulations at bay, it can grow at whatever pace it wants. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a bane that might threaten this pace is hiring, according to the CEO. &#8220;The one challenge I&#8217;ll say we face has to be hiring,&#8221; Ashiru Jituboh said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, one of the significant reasons Okra proves attractive despite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over a year in operation is how it prioritizes speed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims to onboard new clients in 24 hours or less while supporting them through the use cases specific to their product</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An increasing clientele means increased problems which means more personnel to handle them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">So besides using the recent check to expand its data infrastructure across Nigeria, Okra will put a sizeable chunk into sourcing for talent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We want to ensure that we&#8217;re solving our customers&#8217; problems as fast as possible and give the clients the support they need</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We want to make sure our hiring speed is the same as the speed of our growth and I think being able to raise capital is one of the solvers of that problem&#8230; making sure we&#8217;re bringing great talent and building a great team,&#8221; she added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ashiru Jituboh understands the need for great engineering talent because of her engineering-heavy background. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before starting Okra with Peterside, she worked with JP Morgan, Fidelity Investments and Daimler Mercedes Benz</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Okra, she doubles as the chief executive and CTO, staking a claim as one of the most promising founders in Africa&#8217;s male-dominated fintech scene</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Omobola Johnson, a senior partner at TLcom Capital, maintains that these qualities and Okra&#8217;s proposition made the company its first fintech investment. It was more than enough to convince the firm to follow up in this round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A year on, Okra has managed to make its investor list more impressive. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Susa Ventures, its lead investor, has</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made notable early investments in Robinhood, Flexport and Fast</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. However, Okra is the only African-based startup the VC firm has invested in asides from Andela.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re thrilled to partner with Okra as they enable developers across the African continent to transform digital financial services,” general partner at Susa, Seth Berman said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re blown away by the quality of Okra’s team, pace of development and the excitement from the customers building on their API</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of a Fortune Global 500 company, Accenture Ventures has invested in more than 30 startups. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Okra is the first Black founded startup in its portfolio. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tom Lounibos, the firm&#8217;s president and managing director, said the reason behind the investment stems from partnering with Okra to bring open finance to Africa, the calibre of founders and their technology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The founders tell me that Accenture and Susa represent smart money investors </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">aligned</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Okra&#8217;s vision and technology infrastructure play</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;For us, if we&#8217;re building an API infrastructure for the continent, we thought Accenture would be a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">really</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> good partner because we&#8217;re </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">essentially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> building an API which is a technology-based infrastructure</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the investors will be pivotal to the company&#8217;s hiring and imminent pan-African expansion plans to Kenya and South Africa, where Okra is currently in beta</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accenture coming onboard to Okra as an investor marks the latest in a line of major companies jumping in on the African fintech wave &#8212; Stripe with the acquisition of Paystack and Visa and WorldPay partnership with Flutterwave</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investments, Accenture Ventures continues the list of first-time U.S. investors in African fintech</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Names like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/african-fintech-startup-chipper-cash-raises-30m-backed-by-jeff-bezos/">Bezos Expeditions</a> in Chipper, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Tiger Global and Avenir Growth Capital</a> in Flutterwave and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/18/kuda-raises-25m-more-led-by-valar-to-become-the-neobank-for-every-african-on-the-planet/">Valar</a> in Kuda come to mind</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond Susa and Accenture Ventures, Okra also brought on three angel investors to the round</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rob Solomon, chairman at GoFundMe and former partner at Accel; and two ex founding engineers at Robinhood &#8212; Arpan Shah and Hongxia Zhong</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okra is not the only company looking to capitalize on the budding API financial infrastructure space</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Stitch, another South African API fintech, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/stitch-emerges-from-stealth-with-4m-for-its-api-fintech-play-in-africa/">came out of stealth with $4 million</a> in funding. Pngme <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/11/pngme-a-financial-data-platform-closes-3m-seed-to-accelerate-growth-in-sub-saharan-africa/">raised $3 million</a> in February. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others like Nigeria&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/02/mono-a-startup-that-wants-to-build-plaid-for-africa-gets-backing-from-y-combinator/">Mono</a> and <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/12/16/onepipe-raises-950k-pre-seed/">OnePipe</a> have raised six-figure pre-seed rounds and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are backed by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Y Combinator and Techstars</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite seeming competition, the infrastructure business, unlike a commoditized business, is one with room for many winners</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook and its family of apps have long grappled with the issue of how to better manage &#8212; and eradicate &#8212; bullying and other harassment on its platform, turning both to algorithms and humans in its efforts to tackle the problem better. In the latest development, today, Instagram is announcing some new tools of its own.</p>
<p>First, it&#8217;s introducing a new way for people to further shield themselves from harassment in their direct messages, specifically in message requests by way of a new set of words, phrases and emojis that might signal abusive content, which will also include common misspellings of those key terms, sometimes used to try to evade the filters. Second, it&#8217;s giving users the ability to proactively block people even if they try to contact the user in question over a new account.</p>
<p>The blocking account feature is going live globally in the next few weeks, Instagram said, and it confirmed to me that the feature to filter out abusive DMs will start rolling out in the UK, France, Germany, Ireland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand in a few weeks’ time before becoming available in more countries over the next few months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Notably, these features are only being rolled out on Instagram &#8212; not Messenger, and not WhatsApp, Facebook&#8217;s other two hugely popular apps that enable direct messaging. The spokesperson confirmed that Facebook hopes to bring it to other apps in the stable later this year. (Instagram and others have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/instagram-adds-new-anti-bullying-features-including-tag-controls-comment-management-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regularly issued updates on single apps</a> before considering how to roll them out more widely.)</p>
<p>Instagram said that the feature to scan DMs for abusive content &#8212; which will be based on a list of words and emojis that Facebook compiles with the help of anti-discrimination and anti-bullying organizations (it did not specify which), along with terms and emoji&#8217;s that you might add in yourself &#8212; has to be turned on proactively, rather than being made available by default.</p>
<p>Why? More user license, it seems, and to keep conversations private if uses want them to be. &#8220;We want to respect peoples&#8217; privacy and give people control over their experiences in a way that works best for them,&#8221; a spokesperson said, pointing out that this is similar to how its comment filters also work. It will live in Settings&gt;Privacy&gt;Hidden Words for those who will want to turn on the control.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2141514" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hidden-Words-Messages.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="343" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hidden-Words-Messages.png 4056w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hidden-Words-Messages.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hidden-Words-Messages.png?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hidden-Words-Messages.png?resize=768,388 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hidden-Words-Messages.png?resize=680,343 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hidden-Words-Messages.png?resize=1536,776 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hidden-Words-Messages.png?resize=2048,1034 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Hidden-Words-Messages.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>There are a number of third-party services out there in the wild now building content moderation tools that sniff out harassment and hate speech &#8212; they include the likes of Sentropy and Hive &#8212; but what has been interesting is that the larger technology companies up to now have opted to build these tools themselves. That is also the case here, the company confirmed.</p>
<p>The system is completely automated, although Facebook noted that it reviews any content that gets reported. While it doesn&#8217;t keep data from those interactions, it confirmed that it will be using reported words to continue building its bigger database of terms that will trigger content getting blocked, and subsequently deleting, blocking and reporting the people who are sending it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the subject of those people, it&#8217;s been a long time coming that Facebook has started to get smarter on how it handles the fact that the people with really ill intent have wasted no time in building multiple accounts to pick up the slack when their primary profiles get blocked. People have been aggravated by this loophole for as long as DMs have been around, even though Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/477434105621119/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/477434105621119/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619072671239000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHB5wWj33Bnme6JsjM6oi2m83BY9Q">harassment policies</a> had already prohibited people from repeatedly contacting someone who doesn’t want to hear from them, and the company had already also prohibited recidivism, which as Facebook describes it, means &#8220;if someone’s account is disabled for breaking our rules, we would remove any new accounts they create whenever we become aware of it.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2141516" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blocking-Future-Accounts.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="343" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blocking-Future-Accounts.png 2028w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blocking-Future-Accounts.png?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blocking-Future-Accounts.png?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blocking-Future-Accounts.png?resize=768,388 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blocking-Future-Accounts.png?resize=680,343 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blocking-Future-Accounts.png?resize=1536,776 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Blocking-Future-Accounts.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">The company&#8217;s approach to Direct Messages has been something of a template for how other social media companies have built these out.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In essence, they are open-ended by default, with one inbox reserved for actual contacts, but a second one for anyone at all to contact you. While some people just ignore that second box altogether, the nature of how Instagram works and is built is for more, not less, contact with others, and that means people will use those second inboxes for their DMs more than they might, for example, delve into their spam inboxes in email.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The bigger issue continues to be a game of whack-a-mole, however, and one that not just its users are asking for more help to solve. As Facebook continues to find itself under the scrutinizing eye of regulators, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/attorneys-general-from-twenty-states-call-on-facebook-to-do-more-to-fight-discrimination-disinformation-and-harrassment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harassment &#8212; and better management of it &#8212; has emerged as a very key area</a> that it will be required to solve before others do the solving for it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A week after the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase staged a direct listing, much of the focus remains on the wealth that the listing generated for executives at the company, its board members, and its private investors. Citing data from Capital Market Laboratories, Cointelegraph on Monday noted, for example, that 12,965,079 <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-insiders-dump-nearly-5-billion-in-coin-stock-shortly-after-listing">shares worth close to $5 billion</a> at the time had been sold by insiders by the close of stock market on Friday.</p>
<p>One early investor who sold some of those shares is Garry Tan of the venture firm Initialized Capital. Tan worked previously as a partner with Y Combinator, where he helped ensure that Coinbase was accepted into the program and he remained the primary contact for founder and CEO Brian Armstrong, backing Armstrong three more times with seed checks after launching Initialized Capital with two other YC alums: Alexis Ohanian and Harjeet Taggar. Before the listing, Initialized still owned .08% of Coinbase, which currently boasts a market cap of $64 billion.</p>
<p>We talked with Tan late last week, who spoke candidly about the event and its impact on him personally. Tan also gave a fairly specific reason why he&#8217;s holding on to the &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of his stake for the foreseeable future. You can hear our longer conversation<a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/850276/8350564"> here</a>; we&#8217;re also featuring excerpts from that discussion below.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>TC: What year was that when you wrote that first check to Coinbase [on behalf of Y Combinator]?</strong></p>
<p>GT: It was 2012. I believe it would have been in April or May and then the batch started in June and I had just raised $7 million from <a href="https://www.thetrustedinsight.com/investment-professional/AlexBangash/">Alex Bangash</a>, who&#8217;s a great fund of funds operator. He does direct [investing] now, too. But he&#8217;d been trying to invest with Y Combinator for many years., and Jessica [Livingston] and Paul [Graham] said, &#8216;There&#8217;s probably not a way for you to do that. But here, you should meet Garry and Harj and Alexis, who are raising a very small $7 million fund.&#8217; And he ended up giving us $5 million of the $7 million and Coinbase was one of our very first checks; we wrote a $50,000 check [with a] $9 million pre-money cap.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Did that create any complications with Y Combinator as Coinbase started to take off? Did Initialized end up with a bigger stake in the company than Y Combinator?</strong></p>
<p>GT: I think YC still ended up getting more. The other thing that was true back then was it was commonplace for YC partners to invest in YC companies. And it is true that we were quite successful. And we were asked to stop doing that, and we did. And that&#8217;s when I helped raise YC Continuity. And once that got up and running in 2015, that&#8217;s when I decided to spin out.</p>
<p>I love YC. It was in super great shape. And it&#8217;s more fun to be a pirate than to join the Navy. So I jumped ship and worked on our third $125 million seed fund back in 2016. But [we&#8217;re] still close friends with all of our friends back at YC and I think super fondly of my time back there.</p>
<p><strong>TC: A lot of numbers have been published about who owns much and how much it&#8217;s worth. If you detangle Initialized&#8217;s stake from YC&#8217;s, your stake [would be valued around] $800 million. Were you restricted in any way from selling?</strong></p>
<p>GT: No.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Nobody was?</strong></p>
<p>GT: The company didn&#8217;t need to raise money. It&#8217;s a profitable company. That&#8217;s a super powerful thing to really know. This is not a speculative, cash-burning entity. This is a kind company with a durable moat and hyper profitability.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Would you share what percentage of your stake you sold?</strong></p>
<p>GT: I sold basically a fraction of my shares. As [with] many early employees, to be frank, this exit to me and my family is actually quite meaningful, just like it is for a lot of the other people who started off as engineers, I myself am an engineer [who] had credit card debt as recently as 2011 before I became an investor at Y Combinator and Initialized. We have to remember that Silicon Valley is where a lot of skilled builders are creating their own first wealth.</p>
<p>And all that being said, like a lot of other people who are also long with the company, I&#8217;m holding the majority and vast majority [of my shares] because I&#8217;m super long on both crypto and Coinbase.</p>
<p><strong>TC: How do you think about its valuation and whether it&#8217;s sustainable? So much of the company&#8217;s revenue derives from transaction fees and invariably, competition is going to drive those down to potentially zero. Robinhood already offers commission-free trades on crypto [and is also expected to go pubic soon]. </strong></p>
<p>GT:  In the short term, you think about it as an exchange. In the long term, you need to think about it as what is: a trusted on-ramp and user experience, and then [there&#8217;s] also the infrastructure.</p>
<p>We were actually the first seed investors and largest institutional holder of stock in <a href="https://bisontrails.co/">Bison Trails</a> [a firm that specializes in building blockchain infrastructure for banks and other companies] and was<a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/19/coinbase-acquires-bison-trails-crypto-builder-deal/."> bought by Coinbase</a> late last year [though the deal was announced in January for undisclosed terms]. This is a company that I think a lot of people should pay attention to even now, because all of crypto is switching from proof of work &#8212; [an energy intensive process] that is how Bitcoin and Ethereum currently get to consensus &#8212; to [a new way of mining called] proof of stake, which is far more efficient and pretty much all of the newer blockchains are shifting to [and that rewards miners with transaction fees].</p>
<p>So this was a huge strategic buy for Coinbase and sets them up to be like a cloud infra company the way AWS is. And if you spend time with Amazon&#8217;s annual report, you realize that [infrastructure] is a massively profitable space. So that is the way to think about Coinbase.</p>
<p><strong>TC: And Coinbase has customers of this cloud infrastructure service already.</strong></p>
<p>GT: It&#8217;s already the preferred infra company for a great number of the top 100 new crypto blockchains.</p>
<p>Long term, Microsoft is not one revenue stream, it&#8217;s not a one trick pony. They started with an OS. They used their advantage in operating systems to build applications, and then OS and applications together allowed them to also build server software.</p>
<p>[The best] companies stack durable advantages in multiple industries, and they do it on the back of hiring the best software engineers, the best designers, and the best product people, and that is enabled by a being extremely profitable, and then being a great place to work. And that&#8217;s the same for Coinbase as it is for Google, Facebook, for Amazon &#8212; any of the big tech giants.</p>
<p><em>(Again, you can check it out this chat in its entirety <a href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/850276/8350564">here</a>. We&#8217;re also talking soon with Bison Trails CEO Joe Lallouz, so stay tuned for more on this front.)</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Restaurants rode a wave of usage of food delivery services like Deliveroo, Uber Eats and DoorDash in the last year, discovering new revenues and ways to connect with diners to offset the fact that in-person trade for many of them had disappeared overnight. But they also discovered something less appetizing: dealing with the mess of apps and hardware that they need to use to manage orders from their various services is a nightmare, worse than a deflated souffle or a botched Beef Wellington.</p>
<p>Today, a startup out of Belgium called <a href="https://www.deliverect.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deliverect</a>, which has built a platform to manage all of that through one seamless app, is today announcing a big round of funding.</p>
<p>Underscoring the demand for its technology and the bumper year it&#8217;s just had, the company has raised $65 million &#8212; funding that it will be using to expand its business. That will include the services and integrations that it provides with a wider range of physical point of sale terminals and third-party service providers, and targeting more customers &#8212; restaurants, dark kitchens and consumer goods companies building direct-to-consumer strategies &#8212; in a wider range of markets.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding is being co-led by DST and Redpoint Ventures, with OMERS, Newion, Smartfin and the founders also participating. It brings the total raised by Deliverect to $90 million, and while the valuation is currently not being disclosed, it comes on the heels of big growth. In the last year, the company processed some $1 billion across 30 million orders for its customers, with business growing almost 750% in the last year.</p>
<p>Customers number 10,000 and include the likes of chains like KFC and Pret a Manger, smaller restaurants like Dishoom (an Indian restaurant in London, for readers outside of London), a dark kitchen startup called <a href="https://www.eatcasper.com/how-it-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Casper</a>, and consumer goods giant Unilever.</p>
<p>For some further context on valuation, <a href="https://pos.toasttab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toast</a>, a company that provides similar SaaS out of the US, but also sells an all-in-one product that also includes the point-of-sale hardware, is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/restaurant-software-provider-toast-prepares-for-ipo-11613938981?mod=djemalertNEWS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly working on an IPO right now</a> that would value it at $20 billion.</p>
<p>Zhong Xu, the CEO who co-founded Deliverect with Jan Hollez (CTO), Jelte Vrijhoef (CIO), and Jerome Laredo (CRO), recalled in an interview that the idea for the company stretches back to a time when his dad, an Asian transplant to Belgium who had built a point of sale system that he sold to Chinese restaurants, had hoped that his son would take over the family business. He had the entrepreneurial itch, however, and also saw that the problem was bigger than just the range of businesses that his dad was targeting. (His dad is still in business, and they still talk, Xu confirmed.)</p>
<p>That first led Xu and Hollez, also friends outside of work, in 2010, to found POSiOS, which was the first iPad-based point of sale solution in Europe. That business four years later was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/10/22/lightspeed-now-caters-for-restaurants-after-buying-belgian-startup-posios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Lightspeed</a>, to spearhead its move into POS for restaurants just ahead of its IPO.</p>
<p>That wasn&#8217;t the end of the line for these two, though. &#8220;We saw that tens of thousands of customers were using our iPad system, but they were asking for something else. They wanted to remove all their tablets altogether,&#8221; Xu said.</p>
<p>What he is referring to is a pretty big issue for the typical ready-made food provider. Be it a restaurant, a chain, a dark kitchen or a food company itself, the market for taking and filling food orders is traditionally very fragmented. You will have one proprietary system that is used to manage orders in your restaurant itself, and another for orders that people call in to come pick up and takeaway, and a third for delivery orders taken via third-party platforms.</p>
<p>And that third can be more than one, depending on how many delivery networks your restaurant is using. All of these could feasibly require their own pieces of hardware, and these customers wanted that simplified down to one device alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just try to imagine being in a restaurant: there could be people there, others calling in, and between 5 and 10 tablets screaming for attention,&#8221; Hollez said in an interview. &#8220;It is just not possible to manage this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The solution that Deliverect, founded in 2018, has built essentially brings all of that into a single SaaS platform that manages all of these different channels in one place.</p>
<p>This gives the food provider a way of adequately monitoring and managing what stock is being used up and which dishes are subsequently off the menu, what orders are coming in and where and how to better manage that across their operations, and critically to update their customers on what they can actually order and how long it might take to fill that order out (a provider like Deliveroo will then also use that data to calculate how long it will take to not just make the order but to pick it up and get it to a customer). Deliverect also provides some analytics that can help its customers figure out how to manage all this better in the future.</p>
<p>While this state of affairs has been a problem for years, it definitely escalated in the last year, Xu said, with between 10% and 30% more orders coming from delivery platforms. The company claims that using its software helps its restaurant customers work significantly more efficiently, leading to an average increase of 25% in revenues and &#8212; importantly &#8212; an 80% decrease in order failures that resulted from all that chaotic fragmentation.</p>
<p>The work it&#8217;s doing with FMCG companies is also interesting: the idea here is that brands themselves have been in a bind that has only tightened in the last year, with usually only a very indirect relationship with customers: perhaps a strong bond in terms of marketing, but not when it comes to actually selling food items to customers: its sales typically involve intermediaries such as stores or restaurants.</p>
<p>But as the D2C trend has taken off in food, those big brands are leaving a lot on the table for competitors to pick up, and that&#8217;s even more of an issue when the restaurants and stores are being shut or just seeing less footfall due to Covid-19. So many of them have started to explore what they might do to bridge that gap. Xu said that by and large the focus at the moment is really about running marketing campaigns and getting physical items to people as a part of that, but it does present some very interesting ideas about how Deliverect might develop in the future.</p>
<p>For example, a new wave of ultra-fast grocery delivery startups are emerging, and those could represent a new wave of customers for the company and be a tool for helping the Unilevers of the world supply those platforms with steady streams of its products, or indeed the FMCG companies could leverage those to become direct sellers of their fizzy drinks, pretzels and chocolates (or whatever items they want to sell). Xu noted in fact that Spain&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/spains-glovo-picks-up-528m-as-the-food-deliver-market-continues-to-heat-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Glovo</a>, one of these startups, is already a partner.</p>
<p>All of this spells an interesting future, despite the many other companies also chasing the opportunity, one reason why these founders and this startup out of Ghent have been backed by these high-profile international investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;The explosive rise of online food delivery is forcing restaurants to change how they operate,&#8221; said Elliot Geidt, Managing Director, Redpoint Ventures, in a statement. &#8220;Zhong and the Deliverect team are building the tools and infrastructure to help restaurants thrive in a world where navigating online food delivery is a matter of success or failure. Zhong has a unique empathy for restaurant owners, an unmatched technical understanding of the food delivery tech stack, and a raw ambition and vision that leaves us very excited.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Restaurants, consumer goods companies and other businesses increasingly want to enable on-demand ordering by their customers,&#8221; added Tom Stafford, Managing Partner, DST Global Partners, in his own statement. &#8220;But many do not have the tools or technology to efficiently work with  on-demand delivery providers. Deliverect is providing key software and integrations to enable these businesses to integrate on-demand offerings seamlessly. We are excited to partner with the Deliverect team as they continue to roll out their technology globally and further develop their product offering.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Robotic process automation has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/rpa-market-surges-investors-vendors-capitalize-pandemic-tech-shift/">become buzzy</a> in the last few months. New York-based UiPath is on course to launch an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/a-first-look-at-uipaths-ipo-filing/">initial public offering</a> after gaining an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robotic-process-automation-platform-uipath-raises-750m-at-35b-valuation/">astounding valuation of $35 billion</a> in February. Over in China, homegrown RPA startup Laiye is making waves as well.</p>
<p>Laiye, which develops software to mimic mundane workplace tasks like keyboard strokes and mouse clicks, announced it has raised $50 million in a Series C+ round. The proceeds came about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/23/lightspeed-leads-laiyes-42m-round-to-bet-on-chinese-enterprise-it/">a year after</a> the Beijing-based company pulled in the first tranche of its Series C round.</p>
<p>Laiye, six years old and led by Baidu veterans, has raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/laiye/company_financials">over $130 million</a> to date according to public information.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Leading investors in the Series C+ round were <a href="https://www.pingan.com/us-en.shtml">Ping An Global Voyager Fund</a>, an early-stage strategic investment vehicle of Chinese financial conglomerate Ping An, and <a href="http://www.guojianjituan.com/index_m.php/Index/news_details/id/705">Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Industry Equity Investment Fund</a>, a government-backed fund. Other participants included Lightspeed China Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sequoia China and Wu Capital.</p>
<p>RPA tools are attracting companies looking for ways to automate workflows during COVID-19, which has disrupted office collaboration. But the enterprise tech was already gaining traction prior to the pandemic. As my colleague, Ron Miller <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/02/rpa-market-surges-investors-vendors-capitalize-pandemic-tech-shift/">wrote</a> this month on the heels of UiPath&#8217;s S1 filing:</p>
<p>&#8220;The category was gaining in popularity by that point because it addressed automation in a legacy context. That meant companies with deep legacy technology — practically everyone not born in the cloud — could automate across older platforms without ripping and replacing, an expensive and risky undertaking that most CEOs would rather not take.&#8221;</p>
<p>In one case, Laiye&#8217;s RPA software <a href="https://laiye.com/case/social_security">helped the social security workers</a> in the city of Lanzhou speed up their account reconciliation process by 75%; in the past, they would have to type in pensioners&#8217; information and check manually whether the details were correct.</p>
<p>In another instance, Laiye&#8217;s chatbot helped automate the national population census in several southern Chinese cities, freeing census takers from visiting households door-to-door.</p>
<p>Laiye said its RPA enterprise business achieved positive cash flow and its chatbot business turned profitability in the fourth quarter of 2020. Its <a href="https://laiye.com/about#">free-to-use edition</a> has amassed over 400,000 developers, and the company also runs a <a href="https://store.uibot.com.cn/">bot marketplace</a> connecting freelance developers to small-time businesses with automation needs.</p>
<p>Laiye is expanding its services globally and boasts that its footprint now spams Asia, the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Laiye aims to foster the world’s largest developer community for software robots and built the world’s largest bot marketplace in the next three years, and we plan to certify at least one million software robot developers by 2025,&#8221; said Wang Guanchun, chair and CEO of Laiye.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that digital workforce and intelligent automation will reach all walks of life as long as more human workers can be up-skilled with knowledge in RPA and AI”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The 19th annual Shanghai Auto Show delivered a bevy of electric and tech-centric vehicles this year. Chinese, European and U.S. automakers showed off their latest offerings in every price segment, from the budget-minded ​​Wuling Hong Guang Mini via a joint venture between SAIC Motor Corp., General Motors Co. and Liuzhou Wuling Motors Co. to the luxury Mercedes EQS  — and everything in between.</p>
<p>Several automakers touted the capabilities of their driver assistance systems, using terminology that suggested they <em>could</em> be autonomous if only regulators allowed it. Let&#8217;s be clear, these systems are not autonomous. Other automakers stopped short of those claims, but did publicize the software capabilities of their vehicles — a movement that has been underway since Tesla rose in popularity.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what caught our eye at the show. Don&#8217;t miss TechCrunch&#8217;s Rita Liao&#8217;s Chinese automotive coverage that also came out of the auto show, including how Tesla is working on vehicles<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/tesla-china-backlash/"> tailored to Chinese consumers</a> as complaints increase about the quality of its electric vehicles.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Audi</h2>
<p>Audi shared the spotlight with its Chinese partner companies FAW and SAIC this year. The companies showed four world premieres, including the Audi A6 e-tron concept vehicle, an updated Audi Q5L, the Audi A7L and an SUV study, which is still under wraps, named Audi concept Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Audi Q5L SUV will continue to be manufactured in the Changchun plant in the FAW-VW joint venture. Meanwhile, the Audi A7L limousine, which will go into production in 2021, will be manufactured by the SAIC Audi joint venture. The Audi A7L is in Shanghai and reserved for the Chinese market and includes features such as adaptive air suspension, rear-wheel steering and four-wheel drive.</p>
<h3>A6 etron</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2141391" style="width: 5056px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/audi-6-etron-GettyImages-1313314432.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141391" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2141391 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/audi-6-etron-GettyImages-1313314432.jpg" alt="audi a6 etron" width="5046" height="3364" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/audi-6-etron-GettyImages-1313314432.jpg 5046w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/audi-6-etron-GettyImages-1313314432.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/audi-6-etron-GettyImages-1313314432.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/audi-6-etron-GettyImages-1313314432.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/audi-6-etron-GettyImages-1313314432.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/audi-6-etron-GettyImages-1313314432.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/audi-6-etron-GettyImages-1313314432.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/audi-6-etron-GettyImages-1313314432.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5046px) 100vw, 5046px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141391" class="wp-caption-text">An Audi A6 e-tron on display. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Wu Kai/VCG via Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>The A6 etron concept is not the A6 with which you might be familiar. This all-electric vehicle is built off of Audi&#8217;s &#8220;Premium Platform Electric,&#8221; or PPE platform, which will be the underlying architecture for its C- and B-segment production cars beginning in late 2022.</p>
<p>The Audi A6 e-tron concept shares the same dimensions as the A6 and that&#8217;s about it. The A6 etron is designed as a sportback with a wide coupe roof arch and short overhangs. The large 22-inch wheels complete the look. The A6 e-tron concept is outfitted with two electric motors that can deliver a total output of 350 kW and a torque of 590 pound-feet. The vehicle has 800-volt charging architecture — the same as its Porsche Taycan cousin — with an estimated range of 434 miles based on the WLTP measurement.</p>
<h2>BYD</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warren Buffet-backed BYD has competed for high sales with Tesla, with units sold increasing steadily on the &#8220;Han&#8221; series since its launch last year. </span></p>
<h3>BYD Han</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2141376" style="width: 2136px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1313514243.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141376" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2141376 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1313514243.jpg" alt="" width="2126" height="1418" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1313514243.jpg 2126w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1313514243.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1313514243.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1313514243.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1313514243.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1313514243.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1313514243.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1313514243.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2126px) 100vw, 2126px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141376" class="wp-caption-text">A BYD Han car is on display. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> VCG/VCG via Getty Images</p></div></p>
<p>BYD’s Han flagship series<span style="font-weight: 400;"> includes three electric vehicles and one hybrid vehicle. Named after China’s Han dynasty, the luxury electric sedan series launched sales last year. BYD’s long-range EV can go for about 375 miles, and the company claims its vehicle’s “blade” battery pack is safer than traditional battery packs.  </span></p>
<h2><strong>Geely Holdings Inc.</strong></h2>
<p>The Chinese automotive conglomerate took up a lot of the Shanghai Auto Show floor this year with several of its brands &#8212; including a brand new one &#8212; on display. Polestar, Volvo Cars, Lynk &amp; Co, Geometry and the new Zeekr brand all brought EVs to the show.</p>
<h3><strong>Geometry Pro</strong></h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2141319" style="width: 6730px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/几何A-Pro.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141319" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2141319 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/几何A-Pro.jpeg" alt="Geely Geometry ev" width="6720" height="4480" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/几何A-Pro.jpeg 6720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/几何A-Pro.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/几何A-Pro.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/几何A-Pro.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/几何A-Pro.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/几何A-Pro.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/几何A-Pro.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/几何A-Pro.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6720px) 100vw, 6720px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141319" class="wp-caption-text">The 几何A-Pro revealed at the 2021 Shanghai Auto Show. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Geometry/Geely Holdings</p></div></p>
<p>Geely&#8217;s mass market brand launched the new extended-range version of its Geometry A vehicle. The so-called Geometry A Pro comes with a 150kW battery and can travel 600 km (372 miles) on a single charge. The brand launched in 2019 and unveiled three models to date. The A and C models are on sale in the Chinese market. The brand has plans to export the Geometry C later this year to select global partners.</p>
<h3><strong>Lynk &amp; Co. 05</strong></h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2141337" style="width: 5392px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lynk-and-co-1.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141337" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2141337 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lynk-and-co-1.jpg" alt="lynk-and-co-shanghai electric" width="5382" height="3588" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lynk-and-co-1.jpg 5382w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lynk-and-co-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lynk-and-co-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lynk-and-co-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lynk-and-co-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lynk-and-co-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lynk-and-co-1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lynk-and-co-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5382px) 100vw, 5382px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141337" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Geely holdings/Lynk &amp; Co.</p></div></p>
<p>The company unveiled their newest plug-in hybrid variant of the Lynk &amp; Co. 05. The company also showcased the Scalable Product Architecture for the first time that will be used by a future Lynk &amp; Co. products to be unveiled later this year with an electrified powertrain.</p>
<h3><strong>Polestar 1 Special Edition</strong></h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2141320" style="width: 5482px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/polestar-3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141320" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2141320 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/polestar-3.jpg" alt="polestar lineup shanghai auto show" width="5472" height="3648" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/polestar-3.jpg 5472w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/polestar-3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/polestar-3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/polestar-3.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/polestar-3.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/polestar-3.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/polestar-3.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/polestar-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5472px) 100vw, 5472px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141320" class="wp-caption-text">The lineup of Polestar vehicles at the 2021 Shanghai Auto Show. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Polestar/Geely Holdings</p></div></p>
<p>The EV performance brand of Volvo, which is owned by Geely, displayed the Polestar 1 hybrid electric and the all-electric Polestar 2. It was the 2021 Special Edition in matte gold that got our attention. Granted this is not an all-electric vehicle, just a hybrid, but this special version is worth noting.</p>
<p>This special edition has a lightweight body made from carbon fiber reinforced polymer, twin rear electric motors with genuine torque vectoring and high-performance components like Akebono brakes and adjustable Öhlins dampers. The vehicle&#8217;s powertrain produced 619 hp and 738 lb.-ft. of torque, and a purely electric driving range of 60 miles based on the WLTP standard. The vehicle also features a bespoke matte gold exterior paint job with matching calipers and black wheels</p>
<h3><strong>Volvo XC40 Recharge</strong></h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2141330" style="width: 6058px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/volvo-xc40.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141330" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2141330 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/volvo-xc40.jpg" alt="" width="6048" height="4024" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/volvo-xc40.jpg 6048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/volvo-xc40.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/volvo-xc40.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/volvo-xc40.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/volvo-xc40.jpg?resize=680,452 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/volvo-xc40.jpg?resize=1536,1022 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/volvo-xc40.jpg?resize=2048,1363 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/volvo-xc40.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 6048px) 100vw, 6048px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141330" class="wp-caption-text">A Volvo XC40 car is seen during the Shanghai Auto Show on April 20, 2021. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Hector RETAMAL / AFP via Getty</p></div></p>
<p>The Swedish brand, which plans to only sell pure battery-electric models beginning in 2030, brought its first all-electric vehicle to the show: the XC40 Recharge. The company&#8217;s next EV will be the C40, the company announced.</p>
<h3><strong>Zeekr 001</strong></h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2141323" style="width: 3840px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zeekr-1-3.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141323" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2141323 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zeekr-1-3.jpg" alt="Zeekr-electric-shanghai auto" width="3830" height="2553" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zeekr-1-3.jpg 3830w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zeekr-1-3.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zeekr-1-3.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zeekr-1-3.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zeekr-1-3.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zeekr-1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zeekr-1-3.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Zeekr-1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3830px) 100vw, 3830px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141323" class="wp-caption-text">Zeekr revealed its first electric vehicle at the 2021 Shanghai Auto Show. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zeekr/Geely Holdings</p></div></p>
<p>And finally, Zeekr brought its flagship (and first) EV called the Zeekr 001. What is a Zeekr? It&#8217;s the combination of Z as in Generation Z and &#8220;geek,&#8221; and its aim is to put software at the forefront.</p>
<p>Zeekr said its cars will also be sold online and through experience centers across China, with plans also to eventually expand to Europe and North America. The Zeekr 001 comes with a dual motor, which sends power to all four wheels &#8212; delivering 566 lb-ft. of torque and allowing it to accelerate from 0 to 60mph in less than 4 seconds. The car has a claimed estimated range of more than 700 km (434 miles) on a single charge.</p>
<p>The Zeekr brand said it plans to bring five cars to market in the next five years, all of which will be based on Geely Holdings&#8217; pure electric SEA architecture.</p>
<h2><strong>Mercedes </strong></h2>
<p>The German automaker showed off several vehicles at the Shanghai Auto Show, notably the EQB and EQS. Both of these all-electric vehicles are part of the company&#8217;s growing EQ brand.</p>
<h3><strong>EQB</strong></h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2141362" style="width: 8202px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mercedes-eqb.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141362" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2141362 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mercedes-eqb.jpg" alt="Mercedes-Benz's new EQB Shanghai auto show2021" width="8192" height="5464" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mercedes-eqb.jpg 8192w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mercedes-eqb.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mercedes-eqb.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mercedes-eqb.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mercedes-eqb.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mercedes-eqb.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mercedes-eqb.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mercedes-eqb.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 8192px) 100vw, 8192px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141362" class="wp-caption-text">Mercedes-Benz&#8217;s new EQB. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Mercedes-Benz</p></div></p>
<p>The German automaker revealed the compact mass-market all-electric SUV at the show. The vehicle, which looks a lot like the GLB, especially the interior, will launch in China this year. A global variant will be produced in Hungary for Europe followed, by the U.S. market launch in 2022.</p>
<p>While there are some obvious links to the internal combustion engine GLB, the EQB does have some differences in the exterior design, including the continuous light strip at front and rear that is consistent with other models in the electric EQ brand. The EQB also has light-alloy wheels in a bi- or tri-color design that come in up to 20 inches in size. Some even have rosé gold-colored or blue decorative trim.

<p>Mercedes-Benz held its own world premiere of its EQ brand flagship ahead of the Shanghai Auto Show. The EQS is the first all-electric luxury sedan under the automaker&#8217;s new EQ brand. The first models being introduced to the U.S. market will be the EQS 450+ with 329 hp and the EQS 580 4MATIC with 516 hp. This will be an important vehicle for the Chinese market as well.</p>
<p>This all-electric counterpart to the S-Class is loaded with tech. For instance, there are 350 sensors in the vehicle that are used to record distances, speeds and acceleration, lighting conditions, precipitation and temperatures, the occupancy of seats as well as the driver’s blink of an eye or the passengers’ speech. TechCrunch also had a chance to take the EQS for a spin. Here&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/11/the-2022-mercedes-benz-eqs-stakes-its-claim-on-a-luxury-electric-future/">what we thought</a>.</p>

<h2>NIO</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nio revealed the interior of its flagship sedan at the auto show, giving us more details on the ET7 which was initially revealed in January. It also announced it will deploy a total of 100 of its branded power swap stations as well as other infrastructure, including 500 charging stations and more than 10,000 destination chargers in eight provinces in China. </span></p>

<h3>Nio ET7</h3>
<p>The ET7 is Nio&#8217;s electric flagship sedan. The company officially debuted the interior of the vehicle, which it described as a second living space. <span style="font-weight: 400;">The interior comes in three earth-tone color schemes: Storm Gray, Sand Brown and Edelweiss White. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company dropped some hints about possible exterior colors, as well, such as Sunrise Beige, Luminous Orange and Arctic Green, in addition to the established Cloud White, Star Gray, Deep Black and Southern Star.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ET7’s 150kWh battery gives the car a whopping range of 621 miles under China’s NEDC testing protocol. The NEDC testing is notorious for providing optimistic estimates and will likely be much less than that under Europe’s WLTP testing. </span></p>
<p>Nio also boasted about its so-called NIO Autonomous Driving technology, which it claims will  &#8220;gradually deliver the relaxing and safe point-to-point autonomous driving experience in scenarios like an expressway, urban, parking, and battery swap.&#8221; That phrasing suggests that this is aspirational and is still squarely under the driver assistance system category. Plus, China regulations require drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and be able to take control at any time.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Nio is expected to begin production of the ET7 in the coming months, with a launch scheduled for Q1 2022. </span></p>
<h2>SAIC-GM</h2>
<p>SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile Co., a joint venture between SAIC Motor Corp., General Motors and Liuzhou Wuling Motors Co. showed off their latest vehicle: the budget-friendly Hong Guang Mini EV that costs less than $5,000.</p>

<p>The Wuling Hong Guang Mini EV, which is also the main photo in this article, <span style="font-weight: 400;">is one of the most popular EVs in China this year, with more than 57,000 units sold in February alone, and at $4,230, it’s not hard to see why. The featherweight EV is produced with max efficiency and few parts. A new car is made every minute at the Lizhou, Guangxi factory, and it only takes about four hours to make one from start to finish. The most basic models are truly made for that A to B utility. Both the interior and what’s under the hood make for a very simple, yet functional, vehicle. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The smooth ride of this adorable mini won’t go faster than 62 miles per hour, and a cap of around 75 to 110 miles of range per charge makes it the perfect car for short trips around urban environments. Upgrading to the $5,600 model includes air conditioning and power windows, which really points to the near Spartan nature of the standard model, which comes with an HVAC ventilation system and a simple radio.</span></p>
<h2>Toyota</h2>
<p>The Japanese automakers said it will introduce 15 all-electric vehicles, including seven Toyota bZ branded models, globally by 2025. The new bZ brand debuted at the Shanghai Auto Show.</p>
<h3>Toyota bZ46</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2141342" style="width: 3034px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1232412570.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141342" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2141342 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1232412570.jpg" alt="" width="3024" height="1701" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1232412570.jpg 3024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1232412570.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1232412570.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1232412570.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1232412570.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1232412570.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1232412570.jpg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-1232412570.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 3024px) 100vw, 3024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141342" class="wp-caption-text">The Toyota bZ4X on display during the 19th Shanghai Auto Show on April 20, 2021. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> (Photo by Hector RETAMAL / AFP via Getty Images)</p></div></p>
<p>The Toyota bZ4X is technically just a concept, but its importance shouldn&#8217;t be disregarded. The concept, which was revealed at the Shanghai Auto Show, kicks off a new all-electric lineup for Toyota.</p>
<p>Toyota&#8217;s new bZ brand &#8212; which stands for beyond zero &#8212; will have a dedicated underlying platform that can be used with multiple variations in terms of size and design. The company said that since it is difficult to prepare such a wide range of choices by itself, it is jointly developing the series with partners who boast expertise in various fields. Toyota tapped Subaru to develop the bZ4X. BYD, Daihaitsu and Suzuki are other partners in the bZ line.</p>
<p>Toyota plans to produce the Toyota bZ4X in Japan and China said it hopes to begin worldwide sales of the model by the middle of 2022.</p>
<h2>Volkswagen</h2>
<p>The German automaker used the Shanghai Auto Show to reveal its third electric vehicle in its ID brand. And this one is designed specifically for the Chinese market.</p>
<h3>VW ID 6</h3>

<p>The VW ID.6 will be available in two versions: The ID.6 CROZZ, which will be manufactured in the north of China and the ID.6 X in the southern part of the country. The ID.6 is VW&#8217;s most spacious ID branded model, with room for up to seven people. The vehicle, which is available in four configurations, has a range of up to 588 km (China NEDC).</p>
<h2>Xpeng</h2>
<p>Xpeng revealed its third vehicle at the Shanghai auto show, one that intends to use lidar in an effort to boost the capabilities of its advanced driver assistance system.</p>
<h3>Xpeng P5</h3>
<p><div id="attachment_2141457" style="width: 4010px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/xpeng-GettyImages-1232399467.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141457" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2141457 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/xpeng-GettyImages-1232399467.jpg" alt="Xpeng P5 electric vehicle" width="4000" height="2667" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/xpeng-GettyImages-1232399467.jpg 4000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/xpeng-GettyImages-1232399467.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/xpeng-GettyImages-1232399467.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/xpeng-GettyImages-1232399467.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/xpeng-GettyImages-1232399467.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/xpeng-GettyImages-1232399467.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/xpeng-GettyImages-1232399467.jpg?resize=2048,1366 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/xpeng-GettyImages-1232399467.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 4000px) 100vw, 4000px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2141457" class="wp-caption-text">The XPeng Inc.

<p>The Xpeng P5 is the Chinese automaker’s third vehicle, but it’s among the first to be produced with a built-in lidar sensor. The company says the two sensors, which are built into both sides of the sedan’s front, can detect and identify pedestrians, other cars, cyclists, scooters and more, no matter the weather or darkness.</p>
<p>Xpeng&#8217;s chairman and CEO He Xiaopeng called the P5 is its most advanced and technically ambitious model yet.</p>
<p>The lidar sensors combined with software deliver an advanced driver assistance system that the automaker says pushes it toward full automation. While the sensor and software system is robust, the vehicle is not self driving. As TechCrunch&#8217;s Liao reported, Xpeng&#8217;s Navigation Guided Pilot system is benchmarked against Tesla’s Navigate On Autopilot and can automatically change lanes, enter or exit ramps, overtake other vehicles and maneuver another car’s sudden cut-in, a common sight in China’s complex road conditions. However, drivers&#8217; hands must remain on the wheel. The carmaker’s ambition is to remove the driver, that is, reach Level 4 autonomy two to four years from now, but real-life implementation will hinge on regulations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today&#8217;s Apple event, chock-full of the company&#8217;s products that will help decide whether the company meets, exceeds or undershoots Wall Street expectations for its future growth and performance, had little to no impact on its share price.</p>
<p>By now this is the theme: Apple announces a slew of new products, services, software or peripherals, and its share price does nothing. It&#8217;s almost humorous; certainly Apple&#8217;s shares can move in the wake of an earnings release, but a new product digest? Not so much.</p>
<p>Or at least not as long as TechCrunch has been paying attention (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/22/heres-how-apples-stock-fared-during-the-wwdc-keynote/">here&#8217;s more evidence</a>). It&#8217;s almost like Apple&#8217;s customers &#8212; and the press &#8212; care rabidly about what the company builds. And are very vocal about it. While investors are essentially at lunch the entire time.</p>

<p>Today, for example, Apple shares closed the day off 1.28% and have since fallen a further 0.36%. Apple stock closed the day worth $133.11 per share and was worth $133.40 at the time its event kicked off. So, the event hardly prevented the company from losing more ground.</p>
<p>The broader Nasdaq index lost 0.92%, per <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Finance</a>.</p>
<p>Put another way, news that Apple is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-announces-apple-card-family-for-spouses-to-build-credit-together-and-over-13s-to-use-it-too/">revamping its credit card</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/">rebuilding its podcast app</a> and will support paid subscriptions, that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-adds-a-new-purple-color-option-to-its-iphone-12-and-iphone-12-mini-lineup/">purple iPhones are coming</a>, that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-officially-unveils-its-lost-item-finder-airtag/">AirTags are real</a>, that there is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/the-new-apple-tv-4k-comes-with-a-new-siri-remote/"><em>finally </em>a new Apple TV</a>, that there are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-introduces-a-colorful-new-imac/">new iMacs coming that look hot as heck</a>, that there are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/the-new-ipad-pro-features-apples-m1-chip/">new iPads (including a new iPad Pro) on the way</a> and more, was essentially a shrug from investors.</p>
<p>To avoid being cliché I won&#8217;t paste the <em>are you not entertained </em>gif here, but it&#8217;s warranted. In short, this is what Apple stock did today, as investors were too focused on numbers to look upstream from revenue at the products that will drive the numbers that they later parse and come to a firm conclusion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Smartphones will be included in the scope of a planned &#8220;security by design&#8221; U.K. law aimed at beefing up the security of consumer devices, the government said today.</p>
<p>It made the announcement in its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulating-consumer-smart-product-cyber-security-government-response">response</a> to a consultation on legislative plans aimed at tackling some of the most lax security practices long-associated with the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
<p>The government introduced a security <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-practice-for-consumer-iot-security">code of practice</a> for IoT device manufacturers back in 2018 &#8212; but the forthcoming legislation is intended to build on that with a set of legally binding requirements.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>A draft law was aired by ministers<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/01/uk-connected-devices-security/"> in 2019</a> &#8212; with the government focused on IoT devices, such as webcams and baby monitors, which have often been associated with the most egregious device security practices.</p>
<p>Its plan now is for virtually all smart devices to be covered by legally binding security requirements, with the government pointing to <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/news/2020/12/mobile-phone-brands-putting-customers-at-risk-with-inadequate-update-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.which.co.uk/news/2020/12/mobile-phone-brands-putting-customers-at-risk-with-inadequate-update-support/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1619005307421000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGRYFl9wyYzqVCRupVejmxcaVtruw">research</a> from consumer group &#8220;Which?&#8221; that found that a third of people kept their last phone for four years, while some brands only offer security updates for just over two years.</p>
<p>The forthcoming legislation will require smartphone and device makers like Apple and Samsung to inform customers of the duration of time for which a device will receive software updates at the point of sale.</p>
<p>It will also ban manufacturers from using universal default passwords (such as &#8220;password&#8221; or &#8220;admin&#8221;), which are often preset in a device’s factory settings and easily guessable &#8212; making them meaningless in security terms.</p>
<p>California already passed legislation banning such passwords in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/05/california-passes-law-that-bans-default-passwords-in-connected-devices/">2018</a> with the law coming into force last year.</p>
<p>Under the incoming U.K. law, manufacturers will additionally be required to provide a public point of contact to make it simpler for anyone to report a vulnerability.</p>
<p>The government said it will introduce legislation as soon as parliamentary time allows.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, digital infrastructure minister Matt Warman added: “Our phones and smart devices can be a gold mine for hackers looking to steal data, yet a great number still run older software with holes in their security systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are changing the law to ensure shoppers know how long products are supported with vital security updates before they buy and are making devices harder to break into by banning easily guessable default passwords.</p>
<p>“The reforms, backed by tech associations around the world, will torpedo the efforts of online criminals and boost our mission to build back safer from the pandemic.&#8221;</p>
<p>A DCMS spokesman confirmed that laptops, PCs and tablets with no cellular connection will not be covered by the law, nor will secondhand products. Although he added that the intention is for the scope to be adaptive, to ensure the law can keep pace with new threats that may emerge around devices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Netflix added 4 million net new subscribers in the first quarter of 2021, bringing its total subscriber base to 207.6 million, according to <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/FINAL-Q1-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">its latest earnings report</a>.</p>
<p>Any year-over-year comparison was inevitably going to make this latest quarter seem disappointing, since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/21/neflix-q1-earnings/">Netflix grew by an unprecedented rate</a> (15.77 million net new subscribers) during the same period last year, when the pandemic first trapped global audiences at home. But these new numbers also fall short of the 210 million subscribers that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/netflix-q4-earnings-4/">Netflix had been predicting</a>.</p>
<p>While the streaming market has certainly become more competitive (with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320332/disney-plus-100-million-subscribers-marvel-star-wars-wandavision">Disney+ recently passing 100 million subscribers</a>), Netflix suggested that its lackluster growth had less to do with &#8220;competitive intensity&#8221; and more with the simple fact that it released fewer original shows and movies, thanks to pandemic-related production delays.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We believe paid membership growth slowed due to the big COVID-19 pull forward in 2020 and a lighter content slate in the first half of this year, due to COVID-19 production delays,&#8221; the company said. &#8220;We continue to anticipate a strong second half with the return of new seasons of some of our biggest hits and an exciting film lineup. In the short term, there is some uncertainty from COVID-19; in the long term, the rise of streaming to replace linear TV around the world is the clear trend in entertainment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Netflix noted that retention was &#8220;in line with our expectations,&#8221; and that the main issue was new user acquisition. It also said that &#8220;in early Q1, with the benefit of &#8216;Bridgerton,&#8217; &#8216;Lupin&#8217; and &#8216;Cobra Kai,&#8217; we were following a growth trajectory similar to recent years,&#8221; before growth dipped in March.</p>
<p>Pandemic-related delays will also affect the release schedule in Q2, so Netflix is only projecting 1 million net new subscribers. The release of high-profile titles should pick up again in the second half of the year, the company said, with production having resumed &#8220;in every major market, with the exception of Brazil and India.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for the company&#8217;s finances, revenue grew 24% year over year to $7.2 billion (in line with the forecast), with diluted earnings per share of $3.75. (Analysts had been <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX/analysis?p=NFLX">predicting EPS of $2.97</a>.) Netflix shares were down more than 11% in after-hours trading, as of 4:33 p.m. EDT.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://www.blablacar.com">BlaBlaCar</a> has raised a new $115 million funding round (€97 million). While the company is better known for its long distance carpooling marketplace, BlaBlaCar has also added a bus marketplace with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/12/blablacar-to-acquire-ouibus-and-offer-bus-service/">acquisition of Ouibus</a> and an online bus ticketing platform with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/blablacar-to-acquire-online-bus-ticketing-platform-busfor/">acquisition of Busfor</a>.</p>
<p>Existing investor VNV Global is leading the round. Two new investors are also participating — Otiva J/F AB and FMZ Ventures. Otiva J/F AB is a fund created by Avito founders Jonas Nordlander and Filip Engelbert. If you’re not familiar with Avito, they specialize in classified ads for the Russian market. Classified giant and global tech investor <a href="https://www.naspers.com">Naspers</a> acquired Avito. As for FMZ Ventures, it’s a growth fund created by Michael Zeisser, who previously led investments for Alibaba and was a board member at Lyft and Tripadvisor.</p>
<p>It’s a convertible note, which means that the valuation will depend on the next financial event, such as another fundraising round or an initial public offering. But BlaBlaCar co-founder and CEO Nicolas Brusson consider it as a “pre-IPO convertible” round as BlaBlaCar still has a ton of cash on its bank account.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We already had a lot of cash before this round and we still have more than €200 million in cash following this funding round,” Brusson told me.</p>
<p>Even if BlaBlaCar doesn’t go public right away (or doesn’t raise), there’s a clause with a time frame. After a while, those $115 million will convert into BlaBlaCar shares at a $2 billion valuation in case there’s no financial event.</p>
<p>BlaBlaCar’s strategy and goal with today’s funding round could be summed up with three pillars — carpooling, buses and aggregation.</p>
<p>Let’s start with carpooling, BlaBlaCar’s core business. The company started 15 years ago with a simple goal — matching empty car seats with passengers going in the same direction. While last year’s lockdown has impacted carpooling, it shouldn’t be compared with trains or flights.</p>
<p>“With our carpooling network, there’s no fixed costs,” Brusson said. So BlaBlaCar isn’t paying to put empty cars on the road as everything is community-powered. But, of course, as BlaBlaCar takes a cut from each transaction, revenue took a hit during last year’s lockdown.</p>
<p>Activity bounced back last summer and it’s been up and down ever since depending on current restrictions. “Car is and will be the universal connector that doesn’t rely on train stations or bus stops,” Brusson said.</p>
<p>The carpooling marketplace will always remain a strong revenue generator. In 2020 alone, BlaBlaCar had 50 million passengers across 22 markets overall. In other words, never bet against carpooling.</p>
<p>For the past few years, BlaBlaCar’s second pillar has been buses. In particular, buses represent a huge opportunity in emerging markets and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>There are already a ton of buses on the road, you simply can’t buy tickets online. BlaBlaCar’s total addressable market in this category is huge and the company is mostly focused on moving offline supply to its online marketplace.</p>
<p>That’s why the company is also acquiring Octobus, a Ukrainian company working on an inventory management system for bus supply. “It consolidates our tech stack in the region,” Brusson said.</p>
<p>Finally, BlaBlaCar’s third pillar is all about creating loyal users that keep coming back to the platform. The company wants to build a multimodal app where you can find all shared travel — carpooling, buses and soon trains.</p>
<p>The startup will add train operators on its marketplace by the end of 2021 or early 2022. I asked Brusson whether he wanted to build an <a href="https://www.omio.com">Omio</a> competitor. Formerly known as GoEuro, Omio lets you book train tickets, bus tickets and flights on a single platform.</p>
<p>BlaBlaCar wants to follow a different strategy. It wants to focus first on a handful of countries so that it can sell everything a local would expect.</p>
<p>Eventually, you could imagine opening the BlaBlaCar app to find the best way to go from A to B. It could involve a train ticket followed by a carpooling ride to reach a tiny town. Or it could mix carpooling with bus rides. Thanks to BlaBlaCar’s reach, the French startup is uniquely positioned to connect two small cities through shared transportation.</p>

<p>The two companies were deep in acquisition talks that valued Discord at around $10 billion before Discord walked away. According to the WSJ, three companies were exploring the possible acquisition, though only Microsoft was named.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Discord&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/30/discord-now-has-a-3-5b-valuation-and-100m-for-a-sales-pitch-lighter-on-the-gaming/">valuation doubled in less than six months last year</a> and its stock is only looking hotter in 2021. A well-loved voice chat app originally built for gamers, Discord was in the right place well ahead of the current voice chat trend that Clubhouse ignited. As companies from Facebook to Twitter scramble to build voice-based community tools, Discord rolled out its own support for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/discord-stage-channels-voice-events/">curated audio events last month</a>.</p>
<p>Discord&#8217;s decision to veer away from a sale makes sense for a company keen to keep its unique DNA rather than being rolled into an existing product at a bigger company. The choice could also keep the company distant from a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/klobuchar-antitrust-law-enforcement-reform-act-booker-markey/">protracted antitrust headache</a>, as lawmakers mull legislation that could block big tech deals to prevent further consolidation in the industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After visits by unnamed masked intruders and the cancellation of its lease, <a href="https://imaguru.by/">Imaguru</a> — the country’s key startup hub, event and co-working space in Minsk — has effectively been shut down by the Lukashenko regime, which has led a brutal crackdown on its own people in recent months. But the company behind the space says it will defy the authorities and continue its activities online.</p>
<p>Since 2013, Imaguru had become known as being the birthplace of a large number of startups from Belarus, including MSQRD, acquired by Facebook in 2017 — as well as a landing pad for international investors visiting the country. Startups that have emerged from the space have attracted over $100 million in investments in recent years.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Imaguru Startup HUB&#8221; leased the space from &#8220;Horizon Holding&#8221; in 2013, when it took over a dilapidated building from a state-owned company. But on April 16, 2021, Horizon told Imaguru it was unilaterally terminating its lease and the startup space has been given until April 30 to vacate.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Imaguru says there has been no reason given for the lease termination, despite Horizon calling Imaguru a “flagship” leasehold for its property business.</p>
<p>To outside observers, it looks like Horizon has come under pressure because of Imaguru&#8217;s active support of the pro-democracy protests inside the country.</p>
<p>In early March, unidentified men wearing masks broke into the office, &#8220;blocked the exit, put young event attendees against the wall, and brought them to the police station” said the company.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://help.imaguru.by/en?fbclid=IwAR3yUYfDt_aCKrFCsS77oLSUx6WtnqMeoJ6h0qCrb-ZnVyetIlrx8925okk">statement</a>, Imaguru said it is &#8220;not silent about lawlessness, repressions and persecution against civilians who defend their rights to an honest and fair choice … Not silent about the regime shutting down the business, investment and startup environment … Not silent about the massive relocation of startups from Belarus, about the catastrophe of this for the country and the role of the HTP in this process.”</p>
<p>Named after the phrase “I’m a guru,&#8221; and transcribed literately by Belarusian entrepreneurs, Imaguru held countless conferences, events, startup pitches and courses. It also organised <a href="https://venturedayminsk.com/">Venture Day Minsk</a> (which will still be run online on April 29).</p>
<p>Since 2013 Imaguru says it has helped over 300 Belarusian startups, including Splitmetrics, MSQRD, PingFin, DEIP and TrackDuck; created 250+ jobs; educated over 12,000 people; held over 3,500 events; organised study tours to the U.S., U.K., Finland, Spain and, most recently, launched the TechMinsk accelerator program.</p>
<p>In recent months, the startup hub came out in solidarity with the protests inside the country following last year’s tainted elections, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/11/belarus-tech-industry-rallies-around-arrested-pandadoc-colleagues-in-new-video/">recorded videos</a> of solidarity with PandaDoc, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/05/pandadoc-employees-arrested-in-belarus-after-founders-protest-against-lukashenko-regime/">who’s employees have been jailed,</a> and supported the general strike on October 26, 2020.</p>
<p>The Global Entrepreneurship Week Belarus, which was organized by the Imaguru team, was opened by the Belarusian leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.</p>
<p>Imaguru was founded by Belarusian businesswoman Tania Marinich (<a href="https://twitter.com/taniamarinich">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taniamarinich/?originalSubdomain=by">Linkedin</a>, <a href="http://t.me/tmarinich">Telegram</a>) whose husband died in jail after standing at elections in opposition to the Lukashenko regime.</p>
<p>The below is a statement by Marinich on the closure of the Imaguru space:</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/LQfD39hc4gs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>A startup hub in Minsk was a totally new idea in Belarus in 2013, but Marinich has championed the ecosystem ever since.</p>
<p>After the protest last year, Marinich joined the core team of the opposition party’s Coordination Council, leading the business group.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Privacy isn&#8217;t dead, as many would have you believe. New regulations, stricter cross-border data transfer rules and increasing calls for data sovereignty have helped the privacy startup space grow thanks to an uptick in investor support.</p>
<p>This is how we got here, and where investors are spending.</p>
<h2><b>The rise of privacy tech</b></h2>
<p>With strict privacy laws such as GDPR and CCPA already listing big-ticket penalties — and a growing number of countries following suit — businesses have little option but to comply. It&#8217;s not just bigger, established businesses offering privacy and compliance tech; brand-new startups are filling in the gaps in this emerging and growing space.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the last decade, privacy tech was trumpeted as one of the next &#8216;big things&#8217; for investors, but never delivered. Startup business models were too academic, complex and did not appeal to VCs, or crucially, consumers were used to getting free web services,&#8221; Gilbert Hill, chief executive at Tapmydata, told Extra Crunch.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Some privacy companies — including privacy hardware companies — are chasing profits and less focused on hustling for outside investment.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Today, privacy is big business. Crunchbase lists <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/privacy-startups">207 privacy startups</a> (as of April 2021) that have together raised more than $3.5 billion over hundreds of individual rounds of funding. The number of privacy companies rockets if you take into account enterprise privacy players. Crunchbase currently has 809 listed <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/privacy-companies">under the wider &#8220;privacy&#8221; category</a>.</p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/2021TechVendorReport.pdf">Privacy Tech Vendor Report 2021</a> names 356 companies exclusively dealing in enterprise privacy technology solutions, up from 304 companies a year earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since 2017, the privacy landscape underwent a metamorphosis,&#8221; the report said. &#8220;The emergence of the California Consumer Privacy Act, Brazilian General Data Protection Law and other privacy laws around the world have forced organizations to adhere to a new array of compliance requirements, and in response, the demand for privacy tech grew exponentially.&#8221;</p>
<p>That also presents an opportunity for investors.</p>
<h2><b>Increasing investments</b></h2>
<p>Privacy tech was catching the attention of investors even before the recent wave of new privacy laws came into effect. The sector amassed nearly $10 billion in investment in 2019, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/almost-10b-invested-in-privacy-and-security-companies-in-2019/">according to Crunchbase,</a> compared to just $1.7 billion in 2010. Investments remained active in 2020, despite the pandemic.</p>
<p>Case in point: In December, enterprise privacy and compliance firm OneTrust <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/21/onetrust-nabs-300m-series-c-on-5-1b-valuation-to-expand-privacy-platform/?tpcc=ECTW2020">announced</a> a $300 million Series C funding. The deal valued the 4-year-old privacy tech firm at $5.1 billion, making it one of the first modern privacy unicorns. Three months later, <a href="https://www.onetrust.com/company/news/press-releases/onetrust-extends-series-c-softbank-franklin-templeton/">it extended its Series C funding</a>, with SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and Franklin Templeton pumping in another $210 million.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Now that Apple&#8217;s lost item finder AirTag has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/04/apple-introduces-airtag/">officially been introduced</a>, competitor Tile is going on record ahead of its <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-19/senate-to-call-spotify-match-at-apple-google-antitrust-hearing?sref=gni836kR">testimony</a> in front of Congress tomorrow about how it perceives Apple&#8217;s latest product. The company says it will be asking Congress on Wednesday to take a closer look into Apple&#8217;s business practices, and specifically its entry in this lost item tracking category.</p>
<p>Tile has been a strong Apple critic since it learned that Apple would soon launch its own device to take on Tile&#8217;s leading lost item finder beacons. Tile had successfully carved out a market for its Bluetooth-powered keychain dongles that allow consumers to find the lost items Tile attaches to &#8212; like purses, luggage, keys, bikes, wallets and more. It also introduced the idea of a &#8220;finding network,&#8221; where everyone with the Tile app installed on their phone could help to locate someone else&#8217;s Tile, in the case that a lost item was out of Bluetooth range of its owner.</p>
<p>With AirTag, Apple is reproducing these capabilities, while also adding support for more precise ultra-wideband technology, integrating AirTag into its first-party &#8220;Find My&#8221; app, and leveraging its larger iPhone install base to help find missing items. This presents significant competition to Tile, which is not only expected to face off with Apple&#8217;s AirTag across Apple&#8217;s own devices, but also share a portion of its subscription revenues from in-app purchases with Apple thanks to App Store policies.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ahead of AirTag&#8217;s launch, Apple moved to head off any sort of anti-competitive claims by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/e-bikes-and-earbuds-among-the-first-third-party-hardware-to-support-apples-find-my-tracking/">opening up access to its &#8220;Find My&#8221; app to third parties</a>. It even partnered with a Tile competitor, the Chipolo ONE Spot, to serve as proof that it&#8217;s giving other lost item finders that compete with AirTag equal footing on its iPhone platform. But Tile&#8217;s argument to date has been that it doesn&#8217;t want to give up the direct relationship it has with customers via its own iOS app to instead support Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Find My&#8221; users, and that Apple&#8217;s mere decision to enter this market with its own item-locating tracker will allow it to easily dominate because of its first-party advantage and ecosystem power.</p>
<p>Tile had <a href="https://www.congress.gov/116/meeting/house/110386/witnesses/HHRG-116-JU05-Wstate-DaruK-20200117.pdf">previously testified</a> before Congress about Apple&#8217;s alleged anti-competitive behavior back in 2020 and will now <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-19/senate-to-call-spotify-match-at-apple-google-antitrust-hearing?sref=gni836kR">do so again on Wednesday</a> alongside other Apple critics, including Match and Spotify.</p>
<p>The companies are arguing against Apple&#8217;s in-app commissions, the so-called &#8220;Apple tax,&#8221; which Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/apple-to-reduce-app-store-fees-for-small-businesses-with-under-1-million-in-revenues/">recently reduced</a> for smaller businesses. Many larger companies do not want to pay Apple at all &#8212; they want to process their own payments directly to retain all the revenue collected. They also want a more direct relationship with customers, not one where Apple is the middleman. And in some cases like Tile and Spotify, the companies don&#8217;t feel it&#8217;s fair that they&#8217;re paying money to Apple when Apple directly competes with their business through its own first-party apps.</p>
<p>In addition, Tile intended to compete with AirTag via its own ultra-wideband powered device, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/05/tile-to-launch-to-launch-a-new-tracker-powered-by-ultra-wideband-technology/">announced earlier this year</a>. But it has yet to receive access to Apple&#8217;s U1 chip to make such a device work, we understand  (Apple has released a draft specification for chipset manufacturers would come later this Spring.)</p>
<p>In a statement released today following Apple&#8217;s event, Tile CEO CJ Prober again publicly criticized Apple&#8217;s move into a market Tile created, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our mission is to solve the everyday pain point of finding lost and misplaced things and we are flattered to see Apple, one of the most valuable companies in the world, enter and validate the category Tile pioneered.</p>
<p>The reason so many people turn to Tile to locate their lost or misplaced items is because of the differentiated value we offer our consumers. In addition to providing an industry leading set of features via our app that works with iOS and Android devices, our service is seamlessly integrated with all major voice assistants, including Alexa and Google. And with form factors for every use case and many different styles at affordable prices, there is a Tile for everyone.</p>
<p>Tile has also successfully partnered with top brands like HP, Intel, Skullcandy and fitbit to enable our finding technology in mass market consumer categories like laptops, earbuds and wearables. With over 30 partners, we look forward to extending the benefits of Tile to millions of customers and enabling an experience that helps you keep track of all your important belongings.</p>
<p>We welcome competition, as long as it is fair competition. Unfortunately, given Apple’s well-documented history of using its platform advantage to unfairly limit competition for its products, we’re skeptical. And given our prior history with Apple, we think it is entirely appropriate for Congress to take a closer look at Apple’s business practices specific to its entry into this category. We welcome the opportunity to discuss these issues further in front of Congress tomorrow.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple, in response, points out that its Find My network pre-dates Tile&#8217;s founding, and that Tile is able to use Find My if it chooses. It also notes Tile has 90% market share and Apple will need to sell a lot of AirTags to catch up with that lead.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s statement reads, as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have worked from the very beginning of iPhone to help protect the privacy of users&#8217; location data, giving them transparency and control over how all apps may access and share their location. Apple created Find My over a decade ago to help users locate and manage lost devices in a private and secure way. Since then, we have expanded Find My to help users keep tabs on the other important things in their life — from sharing location with friends and family members, to locating third-party products like Van Moof bikes and Chipolo item finders. We have always embraced competition as the best way to drive great experiences for our customers, and we have worked hard to build a platform in iOS that enables third-party developers to thrive.</p></blockquote>

<p>From tweaks to the Apple Card to all new iMacs and iPads, Apple crammed this one-hour event with news. Don&#8217;t have time to sit down and click through every last announcement? We&#8217;ve slimmed it down to just the key points for maximum skimmability. Enjoy!</p>
<h2>Apple Card</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_1864387" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1864387" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-1864387" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-1.37.32-PM.png?w=680" alt="Apple Card" width="680" height="424" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-1.37.32-PM.png 1119w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-1.37.32-PM.png?resize=150,93 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-1.37.32-PM.png?resize=300,187 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-1.37.32-PM.png?resize=768,478 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-1.37.32-PM.png?resize=680,424 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Screen-Shot-2019-03-25-at-1.37.32-PM.png?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1864387" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Apple kicked things off with a quick but key mention outlining a shift <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-announces-apple-card-family-for-spouses-to-build-credit-together-and-over-13s-to-use-it-too/">in how Apple Card works</a>. &#8220;Apple Card Family&#8221; will allow you to share your card with anyone in your family over the age of 13, with customizable spending limits for each added user. You&#8217;ll also now be able to &#8220;co-own&#8221; an Apple card with another adult, with both owners building up their credit equally.</p>
<h2>Apple Podcasts</h2>

<p>Apple will launch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-unveils-podcast-subscriptions-and-a-redesigned-apple-podcasts-app/">a redesigned Podcast app</a>, including an option for paid subscriptions (monthly or annual) to individual podcasts.</p>
<h2>Purple iPhones</h2>

<p>No new iPhone this time (those come later in the year, generally), but the existing iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-adds-a-new-purple-color-option-to-its-iphone-12-and-iphone-12-mini-lineup/">getting a new color option: purple</a>. They used a song from Willy Wonka to announce it, because … well, purple.</p>
<h2>AirTag</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2141048" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141048" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2141048" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/air-tag-99.jpg?w=680" alt="apple airtag $99 4 pack" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/air-tag-99.jpg 1894w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/air-tag-99.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/air-tag-99.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/air-tag-99.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/air-tag-99.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/air-tag-99.jpg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/air-tag-99.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141048" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>After literal <em>years</em> of rumors and leaks, Apple has at long last officially announced its accessory for tracking things like keys, wallets and bags through the same &#8220;Find My&#8221; app you use to find your various Apple devices when you lose them in the couch.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-officially-unveils-its-lost-item-finder-airtag/">Called &#8220;AirTag&#8221;</a> (curiously, not &#8220;AirTags&#8221;), Apple says they&#8217;ll cost $29 each or $99 for a four pack, and launch on April 30. They&#8217;ll have user-replaceable batteries but, oddly, no built-in attachment loop; if you want to attach it to something like a keyring, you&#8217;ll need to add a case. Which, of course, they&#8217;ll be making and selling.</p>
<p>Each AirTag has a built-in speaker for helping you track down lost items, and you can engrave them with texts and/or select emoji for free when you buy them online.</p>
<h2>Next-gen Apple TV 4K</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2141067" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2141067" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2141067" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg 1894w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?resize=1536,865 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/apple-tv-4k-remote.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2141067" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Apple</p></div></p>
<p>Apple announced a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/the-new-apple-tv-4k-comes-with-a-new-siri-remote/">big refresh to the Apple TV 4K</a> it first launched back in 2017. Here&#8217;s the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Powered by Apple&#8217;s A12 Bionic chip.</li>
<li>You can use an iPhone to calibrate the picture. Start the calibration process, put your iPhone&#8217;s front-facing camera near the TV, and Apple TV 4K will automatically optimize its own color/contrast output accordingly.</li>
<li>They&#8217;ve redesigned the remote! They&#8217;ve moved away from the much lamented touchpad remote, building this new remote around a five-way clickpad complete with iPod-esque scroll wheel. There&#8217;s a Siri button on the side, in case you feel like talking to your TV instead of pushing buttons. Word is (via <a href="https://twitter.com/JoannaStern/status/1384565971193585664">WSJ&#8217;s Joanna Stern</a>) they&#8217;ll also be selling this remote separately for $59 for use with the previous-gen Apple TV 4K and Apple TV HD.</li>
<li>$179 for 32 GB model or $199 for 64 GB.</li>
</ul>

<p>Time for the iMac to shift over to M1! Apple announced a new lineup of iMacs — and in a throwback to the iMacs of yesteryear, these new ones <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-introduces-a-colorful-new-imac/">will come in an array of fancy colors</a>. Here are the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Built around the absurdly zippy M1 chipset Apple first introduced into its laptops last year.</li>
<li>24-inch &#8220;4.5K&#8221; display.</li>
<li>At last, a decent webcam! These new iMacs will ship with a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apples-new-imac-finally-gets-an-actually-good-webcam/">1080p FaceTime camera.</a></li>
<li>Pre-orders start April 20, shipping in late May.</li>
<li>$1,299 gets you an 8-core CPU/7-core GPU setup, while $1,499 will bump it up to 8-core CPU/8-core GPU.</li>
<li>It&#8217;ll come in seven colors: green, yellow, pink, orange, blue, purple and silver. Some colors will only be available in the more expensive model.</li>
<li>Both models come with a 256 GB SSD, and two Thunderbolt ports. The $1,499 model adds two USB 3 ports.</li>
<li>Apple will ship a new version of its Bluetooth Magic Keyboard, now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-brings-touch-id-to-the-magic-keyboard/">complete with a Touch ID fingerprint sensor</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Apple just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-introduces-a-colorful-new-imac/">announced the new iMac</a> powered by Apple&#8217;s own M1 silicon. Among the numerous <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apple-brings-touch-id-to-the-magic-keyboard/">updates</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/apples-new-imac-finally-gets-an-actually-good-webcam/">upgrades</a> is a new power brick that sports something special to Apple&#8217;s lineup: an Ethernet port. On the surface, this seems like a silly placement of a critical I/O port, but there&#8217;s a good chance this feature could hit future Apple laptops where it makes much more sense.</p>
<p>The M1 iMac sports a new design that&#8217;s much thinner than the last generation and Apple likely didn&#8217;t want to make room for the Ethernet port. The only I/O ports appear to be a 3.5mm jack and several USB-C ports. The power adapter itself has a new magnetic connector and doesn&#8217;t use one of the computer&#8217;s USB-C ports. The Ethernet port was relegated to the power supply.</p>
<p>There are several advantages for this placement. It reduces clutter on the back of the computer and streamlines connectivity &#8212; items that are even more critical in a portable computer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple famously shares components and accessories across its product line, making it very likely this power brick will come to other products. Apple started removing the magnetic MagSafe power connector when its laptops adopted USB-C in 2016, and it would be fantastic to see a similar product return to the product line. Apple removed the Ethernet port on the MacBook Pro in 2012.</p>
<p>Several companies offer add-ons for Apple power adapters. These, like the Twelve South PlugBug Duo, add  USB ports to the adapters, but none have yet to offer Ethernet.</p>
