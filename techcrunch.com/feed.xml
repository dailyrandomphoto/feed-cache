										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">EV charging companies have been showing their wares at CES for years now. But this year, the stakes — and opportunities — are a bit higher.</p>
<p>With dozens of electric passenger cars and commercial fleets expected to hit the market in just a few years, EVs are pushing into the mainstream. That larger market comes with a price: Mainstream consumers expect charge times that are akin to gas refueling times, are accustomed to good user experience design and probably haven&#8217;t ever had to think about peak and off-peak energy grid hours.</p>
<p>Charging companies and smaller startups that showed up at CES this year seemed cognizant of that shift and pitched products that were faster, more connected, easier to use, easy to install and built to work with the electrical grid. The takeaway: EV charging companies, keen to reach this bigger customer base, revealed products designed to hit just about every use case, from commercial fleet charging to at-home charging, from vehicle-to-grid tech to monetizing advertising space on chargers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254210" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>With the <a class="c-link" tabindex="-1" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211203005183/en/Global-Electric-Vehicle-Charger-Market-Report-2021-BEV-PHEV-HEV-On-board-Off-board-Resident-Commercial-Analysis-Forecasts-2015-2020-2020-2025F-2030F---ResearchAndMarkets.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211203005183/en/Global-Electric-Vehicle-Charger-Market-Report-2021-BEV-PHEV-HEV-On-board-Off-board-Resident-Commercial-Analysis-Forecasts-2015-2020-2020-2025F-2030F---ResearchAndMarkets.com" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-remove-tab-index="true">global EV charger market expected to grow from $3.23 billion in 2020 to nearly $11 billion in 2025</a>, the industry still has space for new entrants before it consolidates around a few giants, many of whom did not grace CES with demos or news. The smaller companies that showed off tech at CES are standing out with unique solutions, lots of connectivity and upgraded charge speeds.</p>
<h2>Blink Charging</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blink came to play, with four new charging products this year, including one DC-fast wall-mounted charger and three Level 2 chargers &#8212; one designed for fleet and multiunit applications, another for home applications and the last for integrating advertising displays. All of the chargers come with 4G LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity, as well as smart capabilities that allow for things like fleet management integration, load sharing technology and energy use management. </span></p>
<h3>Blink MQ 200 for fleet EV charging stations</h3>
<p>Specifically designed for fleets, workplace and multifamily locations, this 50 amp charger comes with Plug &amp; Charge functionality, which can automatically identify vehicles through the unique and encryption flow of information from the vehicle to the charging station. As its name suggests, this means drivers will simply have to plug in to begin a charging session.</p>
<p>The MQ 200, which will be available by the end of Q1 this year, comes with Smart Grid functionality for direct utility communications and local load management across two or more chargers, which allows for the installation of two to 20 chargers on a single circuit, ideal for overnight fleet charging. It also communicates with the Blink Network, software that connects Blink chargers to the cloud, as well as the Blink Fleet <span style="font-weight: 400;">Management </span>Portal, which was also launched at CES. The portal gives fleet managers a dashboard to track charging and load management, chargers, vehicles and drivers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h3>Blink HQ 200, next-gen home charging</h3>
<p>The HQ 200 is Blink&#8217;s updated residential charger, a Level 2 charger with 50 amps, up from last generation&#8217;s 30 amps. The extra power at home, as we&#8217;ll see with other EV charging companies, is a trend this year as companies race to find ways to decrease charge time.</p>
<p>While customers can choose to go for a basic charger with no bells and whistles, the smart, Wi-Fi-enabled version is really the one that intrigues us. The HQ 200 is one of Blink&#8217;s first chargers to come with vehicle-to-grid technology (V2G), which allows EVs to charge during off-peak hours and give back to the grid from energy stored in the EV battery during peak hours when there&#8217;s high demand.</p>
<p>The HQ 200 also connects to the Blink Mobile App to instantly start a charge, schedule charging times and set reminders. It will be available by the end of Q1 this year.</p>
<p><strong>DC Fast wall-mounted for two cars at once</strong></p>
<p>The DC Fast Wall 50 kW can be wall-mounted or set up on a pedestal, and it can charge two cars at once, which makes it ideal for fleet, retail and streetside charging and high-traffic locations. It has up to 150 amps of output and V2G tech, a 10-inch touchscreen display and the ability to bill for charges based on time, kWh or per session. It also allows for remote management and energy usage reports via the Blink Network, and an RFID reader allows for users with a member card, RFID credit card or mobile app to start a charge.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The price point will also make it attractive for locations that otherwise may not feel they can afford DC fast,&#8221; a Blink spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;The DC Wall 50 kW costs less than $20,000, while existing equipment today typically starts at $35,000.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3>Vision IQ 200 for advertising</h3>
<p>This Level 2 charger comes with one or two 30-inch LCD screens for dynamic digital media displays, allowing for full-service advertising capabilities &#8212;<span style="font-weight: 400;"> ideal for retail, hospitality, municipal and high-traffic locations. Property hosts will be offered revenue share opportunities for both charging and advertising income, the latter of which will be managed through a third-party vendor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Vision IQ 200 is equipped with one or two 80-amp IQ 200 chargers, and it features easy payment via RFID, Apple Pay, Google Wallet and all major credit cards, as well as other smart functionalities like remote management and real-time energy usage reports. </span></p>
<p>The DC Fast Wall will be available later this year, said Blink.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 1.625rem; letter-spacing: -0.06px;">E-Lift</span></h2>
<p>E-Lift came to CES to introduce its new customizable GS Pop-Up charging station, which the Dutch company hopes to launch in North America soon. The little station comes with up to four plugs for simultaneous charging, and it can be equipped with sensors that link to E-Lift&#8217;s Sustainable and Smart Energy Management System (SENSE).</p>
<p>The SENSE platform is a management system for users&#8217; mobility and energy needs. Customers can log in remotely to monitor and manage their mobility and energy-consumption data, &#8220;resulting in a cost-effective energy transformation that is beneficial for governments and companies looking to reshape their future with the use of renewable energy resources,&#8221;<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/e-lift-to-announce-new-smart-and-sustainable-pop-up-charging-station-at-ces-2022-301451922.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the company said in a statement</a>.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 1.625rem; letter-spacing: -0.06px;">JuiceBar</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JuiceBar, a Connecticut-based EV charging company that’s really playing the Made in America card, unveiled its first residential charger at CES &#8212; the Cheetah, aptly named for being quick, so the company says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, which says it will credit $1,000 for every old charger that is exchanged for one of its new chargers, will be selling its Cheetahs sometime in 2022. JuiceBar has hundreds of commercial chargers, both public and private, across the U.S. and Canada, the same markets that will see the new at-home charger. </span></p>
<p>The Cheetah will be available in 16, 32, 40 and 48-amp configurations <span style="font-weight: 400;">and 120, 208 and 240 input voltages</span>, which after seeing what Blink is putting out, doesn&#8217;t make JuiceBar the fastest Level 2 on the market, but it&#8217;s close. The Cheetah also has Bluetooth, Ethernet, Wi-Fi and cloud connectivity, which helps for Smart Grid charging. It has a 25-foot cord with an optional tangle-free cord retractor.</p>
<p>For peace of mind when charging at home, the Cheetah also is built with dual safety relays, which allows the second relay to open and break the circuit in the event that the first closes and fuses shut. The charger&#8217;s power is backed by 100% certified carbon reduction projects that offset the carbon footprint of the charger, according to JuiceBar. The company is buying carbon offsets for the first year. After that, buyers can continue to purchase carbon offsets on a subscription basis of less than $1 per week.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Cheetah will be available for consumers in late Q2 or early Q3, a spokesperson told TechCrunch. They&#8217;ll initially be sold through third parties such as auto dealers, house builders and utility companies in the U.S. and Canada. </span></p>
<h2>Wallbox</h2>
<p>Wallbox introduced its Quasar 2 at CES this year, the latest generation of its bidirectional home charger. This one not only allows EV owners to charge and discharge their EV to power their home or the grid, but it also allows owners to isolate their home from the grid and use their EV for backup power during a blackout, even if it&#8217;s caused by a natural disaster. Wallbox says its Quasar 2 can power a home for more than three days during a blackout.</p>
<p>The vehicle-to-home (V2H) functionality should help EV owners save money on home energy costs, says the company, particularly in states where power rates are related to demand. Users can schedule charging sessions to happen when rates are low, and those who have solar power installations can store excess energy in their EV during low usage periods.</p>
<p>The Quasar 2 provides 48 amps of power, comes with CCS compatibility for rapid-charging vehicles like the Jaguar I-Pace or BMW i3 and connects to the myWallbox app through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet or 4G.</p>
<p>Wallbox didn&#8217;t share how much the Quasar 2 would cost, but said it would be comparable to Quasar 1, which costs about $4,000. It plans to launch by the end of the year.</p>
<h2>Meredot</h2>
<p>Electric cars aren&#8217;t the only vehicles hitting the market. Micromobility vehicles need some love, too. That&#8217;s why Meredot unveiled its first commercial Wireless Charger designed for e-scooters, e-mopeds and other vehicles like food delivery robots and wheelchairs. The charger takes the shape of a physical pad that can either be placed above or below ground, and it charges vehicles that have been equipped with a receiver when they are parked on top of it.</p>
<p>Meredot is targeting micromobility OEMs and fleet operators for its Wireless Charger. It&#8217;s ready to go to market and license its tech to companies that want to offer a novel and potentially hassle-free way of giving vehicles a charge. For micromobility fleets in particular, charging scooters and bikes, even when they have swappable batteries, is one of the major cost-suckers, so this kind of tech could potentially be a game changer.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “The Meredot Wireless Charger delivers a new, distributed architecture that helps achieve greater site capital efficiency and scalability, saving energy and costs,&#8221; said Roman Bysko, CEO and co-founder of Meredot, in a statement. &#8220;The Meredot Wireless Charger can become an infrastructural foundation to a new micromobility charging experience benefitting both operators and riders.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company claims its tech can charge 50% more e-scooters on the same surface compared to traditional cable charging systems, which can lead to serious savings for charging sites. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mosquitos <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/stories/world-deadliest-animal.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kill more people</a> than any other creature in the world, and there&#8217;s no shortage of potential tech solutions. One such solution comes from <a href="https://bzigo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bzigo</a>, which markets a device that finds mosquitos in your home, points at them with a laser and can notify you on your phone when a mozzy is buzzing about.</p>
<p>Walking the halls at CES, I often find the odd company where I have to push my cynicism down deep. It turns out that &#8220;walking&#8221; those halls virtually &#8212; after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/23/google-cancels-ces-show-presence-amid-omicron-concerns/">TechCrunch announced</a> that we are not attending in person &#8212; doesn&#8217;t shield your friendly correspondent from the odd moment of &#8220;wait, what?&#8221; in the context of a trade show. In this case, the magic of pointing at a mosquito with a laser pointer is a super neat tech challenge, and I can absolutely see how this could be the first step along a path toward productizing an autonomous mosquito eliminator.</p>
<p>The device itself consists of a light source (infrared LED), a hi-res wide camera and enough electronic brains crammed into the little package to do the rest. The AI built into the device can, according to the company, tell the difference between man&#8217;s worst friend and a speck of dust, by analyzing the movement patterns of the would-be pest.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2251537" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>I could let all of this excitement slide in the (virtual) hustle-bustle of a CES show floor, but there are two issues.</p>
<p>The first issue is that the device doesn&#8217;t actually do anything to eliminate the insects, it merely sends a notification to your phone that it&#8217;s time to dust off your nerf gun (or whatever your favorite mosquito-dispensing method might be), and points at the little flying good-for-nothing with a little red laser pointer. The company assured me that it&#8217;s a Class 1 &#8220;absolutely safe&#8221; laser. I can see why the company chose to do that &#8212; I can&#8217;t imagine the legal and health risks involved with a laser that&#8217;s powerful enough to actually zap the skeeters to whence they came. But that also introduces a fundamental question about this product.</p>
<p>&#8220;Locating the mosquito is the real challenge; killing the mosquito is the easy part,&#8221; says Benjamin Resnick, product manager at Bzigo, as he refers to the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHOECBFpy04" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DoHOECBFpy04&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1640705788215000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0W4VjsAkCjUrSEU9eiRbLL">demonstration video</a>. &#8220;Once Bzigo uses its laser pointer to show you where it lands, you can easily kill the mosquito yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have to admit, as someone who grew up in a country where the mosquitos are the size of small propeller planes, I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;ve ever had that particular challenge.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The second &#8212; and much more troubling &#8212; issue with the product is that the company is planning to ship what they have so far as a consumer-facing product. Bzigo claims that thousands of customers have reserved orders for the $199 device, with a product launch and delivery to pre-order customers coming up &#8220;later this year&#8221;.</p>
<p>My most heart-felt kudos to any marketing team at any company that can sell thousands of $199 mosquito-marking laser pointers, but in the grand scheme of things, it is essentially a useless product. Mosquitos are crepuscular (i.e. they feed at dawn and dusk) &#8212; when people are least likely to be awake to hunt for mosquitos. And there&#8217;s already a spectacularly efficient solution out there: Long-lasting, insecticidal bed nets (LLINs) are a simple, cost-effective solution to protect families from malaria while they sleep. <a href="https://nothingbutnets.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They cost $10, fully delivered</a>, and create a physical barrier against malaria-carrying mosquitoes, and the insecticide woven into the nets kills the mosquitoes before they can transmit the disease from one person to the next.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m as big a nerd as the next guy, and I love a good science experiment or creative prototype. My question: Does the economic and environmental impact of shipping thousands of fancy laser pointers around the world &#8212; which will invariably all find their way to landfills in the next 10 years, without having killed a single mosquito or saved a single life &#8212; really outweigh the benefits?</p>
<p>I look forward to a version of this product that has some sort of mosquito-murdering tech on it. Until that happens, I hope that the founders re-think their plan of shipping this prototype as a consumer product. There are so many real problems out there worth solving; putting on a late-night silent rave laser light show for a couple of mosquitos ain&#8217;t it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://linedock.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Line</a> is a regular staple at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces-2022/">CES</a>, showing off its high-end milled-aluminium docking stations. This year, the company is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/ces-2022/">back in Las Vegas</a> with an accessory aimed squarely at the gamers among us. Line Frzr is a therm-electric active cooling device that pre-cools the air before it goes into your gaming laptop.</p>
<p>Traditional laptop cooling solutions might increase airflow into the laptop, but Line&#8217;s solution takes that strategy a couple of steps further. The Line Frzr cools the air from room temperature to mid-winter frost that a freezer would be proud of, -5°F (or -15°C), before injecting the freezing cold air into the laptop. The theory is that this keeps the computer&#8217;s CPU and GPU much cooler, enabling them to run cooler, and therefore at a higher clock speed with greater performance, for longer.</p>
<p>The cool-looking tech is using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoelectric_cooling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thermoelectric cooling</a>, but instead of bonding the Peltier elements directly to the processors (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX2NQ1lq4ZM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which is a well-documented <em>awful</em> idea</a>), Line&#8217;s team came up with a different approach &#8212; pre-cooling the air with a pair of little cooling towers, and blasting it into the laptop from there. The design relies on the most common design architecture for gaming laptops, the company tells me. The battery lives underneath the keyboard, and the laptop is lifted up on little feet for maximum air circulation, typically with two air-thirsty fans.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253435" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;Electronic components have recommended operating temperatures; the same goes for thermal paste on CPU/GPU, and most importantly the battery,&#8221; explains Nancy de Fays, co-founder at Line, explaining why blasting the laptop with sub-zero temperature air won&#8217;t harm it. &#8220;The Line Frzr does not freeze the entire laptop: it blasts sub-zero temperature air into the laptop air intake. Said air then flows into the fan and finally through the heatsink radiator; laptop fans are rated at subzero temperatures, and on top of that, the system is regulated by infrared sensors monitoring the laptop temperature. When the GPU/CPU drops below 50°C, the system stops cooling.&#8221;</p>

The holes are designed to align with the air intakes on a gaming laptop &#8212; and the little three-pointed star is the temperature sensor. <strong>Image:</strong> Line, Inc.</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;We blow the air into the fans, not into the electronics of the laptop. The Frzr itself isn&#8217;t meant to be portable &#8212; it is meant to add a huge amount of extra cooling to your gaming laptop when you&#8217;re playing at home, and you can harness the power of a real desktop computer,&#8221; explains Quentin Malgaud, CEO and co-founder at Line, Inc. &#8220;We actually started working on this concept when we were <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/linedock#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working on the original Indiegogo campaign</a> [in 2017], but we put it on the back burner because it wasn&#8217;t efficient enough to be battery powered. In our tests on this bad boy [Malgaud is gesturing at the technical prototype at the company&#8217;s CES booth], we saw an up to 25% CPU score improvement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to create a gaming look, which is why our design has these little cooling towers,&#8221; de Fays explains.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I was mildly skeptical as to whether this product is a good idea in the first place. As a layperson, rapidly heating and cooling components that have different thermal properties could cause issues. The company assures me that my worries are unfounded, however, preventing any issues by using the infrared thermostat system that monitors the temperature of the laptop placed on top of Frzr. This automatically activates cooling if and when required, without the need to install drivers. The device takes care of the cooling independently by averaging data from the temperature sensors.</p>

<p>The company has a patent on the IR sensors that keep the laptop, with a slew of additional patents in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The product does not have an official price tag yet, but Malgaud suggests that end-users should expect a sub-$300 price tag, and that the company is hoping to get the price down to under $200 by the time the production version is finalized. The company is expecting to start shipping it to eager semi-mobile gamers in October this year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://linkedin.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>, now with more than 800 million people listing their professional profiles to build out their careers, is taking its next steps to get them to spend more time on the platform. The company is rolling out a new events platform, where it will be listing, hosting and marketing interactive, virtual live events. It is starting out first with an audio-only product that it will be launching this month in beta, followed by a video version that it will launch in the spring, initially targeting Creators that use LinkedIn as organizers and hosts.</p>
<p>With virtual events finding a lot of traction in the last couple of years of pandemic life, the plan for now is for LinkedIn&#8217;s new events product to be an all-virtual offering, and to open up the format to be shaped by those running the events themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our philosophy is to put the organizers in control,&#8221; said product manager Jake Poses in an interview. &#8220;We want to make it easier to host virtual round tables, fireside chats, and more. Some may want the event to be more formal, or less formal. Some might want to communicate with their audience, to open up to the floor. We&#8217;re giving professionals interactivity and support.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254452" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If the audio event feature it is launching this month sounds familiar, it is: this is the Clubhouse rival that we <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first reported</a> LinkedIn was working on back in March 2021. LinkedIn has over the last year been experimenting with other features that it might add to this events service, such as a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/27/linkedin-is-testing-a-new-paid-ticketed-events-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paid, ticketed option</a> that it started testing in September last year &#8212; although for now, Poses confirmed that interactive events are being launched as a free service, with no plans for ticketing at this point.</p>
<p>(LinkedIn should probably not wait too long to introduce ticketing&#8230; I asked, and a Clubhouse spokesperson confirmed to me, that the startup is, as &#8220;part of [its] creator-first mantra&#8221;, Clubhouse is &#8220;exploring multiple options to allow creators to further monetize their work which includes ticketed events,&#8221; but with no timeframe specified. She also confirmed that video is not on the roadmap for now: &#8220;The company remains focused on social audio experiences, and is continuing to explore how new audio-centric features can enhance that experience for the community,&#8221; she added.)</p>
<p>A mock-up of how the audio event will look is here:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2254487" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LinkedIn-Audio-Event-Desktop-Overlay-Mode.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="477" /></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>When it launches later this month, the new events platform will include tools to run interactive content end-to-end, with no need to use any other third-party software: hosts will be able to record and run the event straight from LinkedIn, and it will feature tools for online attendees and hosts to speak to each other in live conversations and to moderate discussions; and for attendees to communicate to each other both during and after events take place. LinkedIn will also, naturally, list events and help get the word out about them across its platform.</p>
<p>As for who will be hosting these events, the platform initially will be targeting individuals who are already using LinkedIn to connect with wider audiences &#8212; its own stable of Creators, as you might get on other social platforms like TikTok, except these are building content aimed at career development, professional topics and other LinkedIn-centric areas of expertise.</p>
<p>LinkedIn has been working on cultivating a wider and more active Creator community in the last several months. To this end, it even <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/linkedin-is-launching-its-own-25m-fund-and-incubator-for-creators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched a $25 million fund and incubator</a> last autumn, and Poses said that there are now 1.5 million Creators using LinkedIn Live, the broadcast product. Creating and hosting events is a natural fit to extend that strategy.</p>
<p>Poses added that over time LinkedIn also hopes to get businesses and bigger organizations to build events on LinkedIn. With the bigger organizations, however, often come bigger budgets, more infrastructure aimed at higher production values, and potentially ticketing and other services. He said the idea will be that those who need or want to will be able to integrate third-party apps and software into the production mix. (Indeed, he also confirmed that for now the whole stack has been built at LinkedIn itself &#8212; rather than leaning on any video or other software from Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn.)</p>
<p>A mock-up of how the video feature might appear in the feed is here:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2254486" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LinkedIn-Live-Broadcast.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="477" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LinkedIn-Live-Broadcast.png 2311w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LinkedIn-Live-Broadcast.png?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LinkedIn-Live-Broadcast.png?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LinkedIn-Live-Broadcast.png?resize=768,538 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LinkedIn-Live-Broadcast.png?resize=680,477 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LinkedIn-Live-Broadcast.png?resize=1536,1077 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LinkedIn-Live-Broadcast.png?resize=2048,1436 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LinkedIn-Live-Broadcast.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>LinkedIn&#8217;s interest in doing more in events goes back some way, starting with an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/15/linkedin-gets-physical-debuts-new-events-hub-for-people-to-plan-in-person-networking-events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Events hub that it first debuted in 2019</a>, before the days of the pandemic and with a focus on in-person get-togethers. Some months into the COVID-19 pandemic, LinkedIn formalized some of the ways that it was being used in more virtual events scenarios with the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/linkedin-ads-polls-and-live-video-based-events-in-a-focus-on-more-virtual-engagement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch of online polls and broadcast-style video events</a> aimed at virtual engagement.</p>
<p>Those have been doing well for the company. Poses noted that annual virtual event creation has grown by 150% over the last year, and it has seen a 231% increase in LinkedIn Live virtual event attendees in the same period. The topics covered have included<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/events/leadingconversationsinai-extend6844345029847195648/"> AI innovations</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/video/live/urn:li:ugcPost:6853718457247113216/">opening keynotes</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/video/live/urn:li:ugcPost:6739706686547783681/"> financial planning</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/video/live/urn:li:ugcPost:6739916123795468288/"> live home installations</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/video/live/urn:li:ugcPost:6739976627914063872/">mentorship</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/video/live/urn:li:ugcPost:6739221625050304513/">cybersecurity</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/video/event/urn:li:ugcPost:6874794673030987776/">award ceremonies</a>. (These also point to how LinkedIn longer term may well have more than just individual creators running these events.)</p>
<p>LinkedIn has also been using its size and financial muscle to invest in and acquire other interesting companies working in the events space. <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210609005239/en/Hopin-Announces-LinkedIn-as-Latest-Strategic-Investor-and-Partner" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last June, LinkedIn disclosed</a> that it was investing in virtual events juggernaut Hopin — which was<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210805005315/en/Hopin-Raises-450-Million-to-Accelerate-Platform-Expansion-and-Continue-to-Build-the-Future-of-Experiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> valued at $7.75 billion</a> in its most recent funding round in August 2021. Last August, it also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/whats-next-us-jumprope-jake-poses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> a startup called Jumprope, which let creators make and share how-to and other mentoring videos. (In fact that is how Poses came to join the company and lead product covering creators, events and video.)</p>
<p>All of this is not only the next logical step for LinkedIn in its own content strategy, but it also definitely feels like a sign of the times, given how, two years into the pandemic, many of us are still working from home, and Covid-19 remains a threat to many.</p>
<p>Still, you can&#8217;t help but wonder how and if LinkedIn will be impacted by the fatigue that has set in for a lot of us around virtual videoconferencing and frankly virtual everything, and if LinkedIn could adjust if it turns out that one more virtual events option, is one too many.</p>
<p>Poses&#8217; answer to this is both to defend virtual events as a must-have for more democratization, but that some event creators might also choose to take a hybrid approach.</p>
<p>Virtual and hybrid may be &#8220;the future&#8221;, Poses said, but interactive events are setting out to fix something completely different.</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as I could remember, I have gone to talks and meetups. These are the mainstays of how professionals communicate and learn things,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But they require money, time to travel, courage to go into a room and speak, and space to run an event. Our belief is that moving from in person to virtual is actually democratizing and opening up access to many more people.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Dave.com hopes to join SoFi in the ranks of the fintech startups that did just fine in their SPAC debuts. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) boom did not play out as some folks in the technology and business worlds hoped. Despite a wave of optimism through early 2021, private companies that pursued public debuts with the help of blank-check companies have frequently failed to cover themselves in glory in the intervening quarters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even more, a wave of SPACs failed to take a market-changing number of unicorns and other high-priced private companies public; the number of private unicorns continues to grow more quickly than even a SPAC-juiced public market has been able to receive them.</span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But not shaking up the dynamics of the unicorn market doesn’t mean that blank-check companies have had no impact on the startup market. The list of SPAC casualties is lengthy. Latch, to pick one particular tech shop </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/for-unicorns-how-much-does-the-route-to-going-public-really-matter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">that TechCrunch spoke to concerning its SPAC process</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, has seen its share price fall from an all-time high of $19.70 to just $6.56 today. That’s pretty brutal, but hardly a set of returns unique to Latch among SPAC debuts in recent history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve also seen SPAC deals announced or completed with companies of imperfect repute. But not every company going public via a SPAC is </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/dogs-of-lordstown/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an EV company with an issue telling the truth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/inside-the-trump-spac-deal-taking-on-twitter-disney-cnn-and-every-major-tech-company/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a social networking &#8220;company&#8221; of a former president</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> famous for sporting a lack of connection to reality. SoFi is perhaps a good example of a company that went public with the help of a blank-check company that appears to be doing just fine.</span></p>

Its main pitch to consumers, summarizing if we may be so bold, is that overdraft fees are a tax on the poor, and that technology can help offer a better banking experience to folks of all income brackets.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Spotify is today <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2022-01-06/spotify-introduces-call-to-action-cards-for-podcast-ads/">introducing</a> is introducing a new ad format aimed at podcasters which it&#8217;s calling &#8220;Call-to-Action Cards&#8221; &#8212; or CTA cards, for short. The feature, which is powered by Spotify&#8217;s streaming ad insertion technology, will display a visual ad in the Spotify app when the audio ad begins to play. The cards can be customized by advertisers with their own images, text and other clickable buttons that direct listeners to &#8220;shop now&#8221; or take some other action the advertiser is hoping to encourage.</p>
<p>While the ads are capable of capturing users&#8217; attention while streaming, Spotify knows that listening to podcasts is often an activity where the app is running in the background while the user is doing something else &#8212; like going for a walk, exercising at the gym, doing housework, driving and more. That&#8217;s why Spotify is also making the new CTA cards available on both the podcast&#8217;s show and episode pages. This allows the targeted listeners to interact with the ad at some later point when they&#8217;re browsing through the Spotify app, the company explains. These cards will remain available for up to seven days after the listener has heard the ad, or less if the campaign wraps before that.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254448" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254448" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2254448" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CTA-ULTA-3Screens.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="463" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CTA-ULTA-3Screens.jpg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CTA-ULTA-3Screens.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CTA-ULTA-3Screens.jpg?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CTA-ULTA-3Screens.jpg?resize=768,523 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CTA-ULTA-3Screens.jpg?resize=680,463 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CTA-ULTA-3Screens.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254448" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254444" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In the future, Spotify believes the format will evolve to do more than simply directing users to a landing page of some kind.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think about these cards as an important step towards modernizing the format &#8212; a format that will become more capable over time, as we add shoppable and video and other interactive features into them,&#8221; said Jay Richman, Spotify&#8217;s Head of Ads Business &amp; Platform, when introducing the format during a press briefing as a part of the company&#8217;s virtual participation at this week&#8217;s Consumer Electronics Show.</p>
<p>Advertisers who adopt the format will also have access to reporting and measurement based on confirmed ad impressions made possible through streaming ad insertion.</p>
<p>Spotify has heavily invested in the streaming ad insertion technology, which brought real-time targeting and reporting to podcasts. Before, when podcasts were delivered through the more open RSS format, they were also hampered by the technical limitations that came with being downloadable content only. Ads were embedded, not dynamically inserted, into shows. And the audio players couldn&#8217;t differentiate between which part of the program was the show&#8217;s content and which part was the ad &#8212; it was all one single file. With streaming audio insertion, the content itself is paused, the ad is inserted, and then the content resumes after the ad completes.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>All of this takes place in real-time &#8212; but it doesn&#8217;t prevent the listener from skipping past the ads as they had before, if they don&#8217;t enjoy hearing the message.</p>
<p>In 2020, Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/spotify-buying-podcast-hosting-and-ad-company-megaphone-for-235m/">acquired the podcast hosting and ad company Megaphone</a> for $235 million to help scale streaming ad insertion beyond its own shows to reach publishing partners through the Spotify Audience Network &#8212; a network that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/spotifys-podcast-creation-tool-anchor-gains-access-to-the-companys-larger-audio-ad-network/">now includes shows from independent creators</a> using Spotify&#8217;s Anchor platform. And just last month, Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/16/spotify-acquires-podcast-tech-company-whooshkaa-which-turns-radio-broadcasts-into-on-demand-audio/">acquired podcast tech company Whooshkaa</a> to bring the technology to radio broadcasters who want to release their audio content as podcasts after first airing it on the radio.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254460" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254460" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2254460" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Ulta-Beauty-CTA.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="463" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254460" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Because streaming ad insertion already knows when the ad appears in the program, Spotify can then pop up the accompanying CTA card as well to display the advertiser&#8217;s creative. For listeners, the experience may be a better one for seeking out the products and services they heard the host promoting during the program, as they&#8217;ll no longer have to try to remember a URL or a coupon code the creator had spoken.</p>
<p>However, the addition also makes using Spotify to stream podcasts feel even more like an ad-supported experience than before, as even Premium (paying) subscribers will be subject to the new, arguably distracting ads and will see them appear on both podcast show and episode pages even after they&#8217;ve finished listening.</p>
<p>Spotify tested the new CTA cards with select advertisers, including Ulta Beauty, ahead of today&#8217;s launch. According to Ulta&#8217;s Head of Content, Social, &amp; Integrated Marketing, Christine White, the company reached around 250,000 unique Spotify listeners with one of its campaigns and around half of those saw at least one CTA card after hearing the audio message, including those who saw the card later while browsing the app.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254455" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254455" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2254455" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Poll-QA-Screens.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="463" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Poll-QA-Screens.jpg 1440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Poll-QA-Screens.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Poll-QA-Screens.jpg?resize=300,204 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Poll-QA-Screens.jpg?resize=768,523 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Poll-QA-Screens.jpg?resize=680,463 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Poll-QA-Screens.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254455" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div></p>
<p>Spotify sees the CTA cards as another step toward making podcast content more interactive. The company is already experimenting in this area through features like voice commands and podcast audience polls and Q&amp;As, which engage listeners in real-time &#8212; making them more likely to return to the app while the podcast is playing, too. More recently, it&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/21/spotify-opens-up-access-to-video-podcast-publishing-to-anchor-creators/">been expanding access to video podcasts</a>, via Spotify&#8217;s Anchor platform. Podcaster creators can add a video to their podcast to show themselves recording the show or they can use the functionality to add the occasional graphic, chart, or slide. This feature is now rolling out to more creators and listeners, said Anchor co-founder and Spotify&#8217;s Head of Talk, Mike Mignano, during the same briefing.</p>
<p>Spotify notes that no incremental work will be required by creators to enable the new CTA cards, which will initially be available across select Spotify Original &amp; Exclusive podcasts in the U.S., starting today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rupifi has raised $25 million in a new financing round as the Indian startup, which currently provides buy now, pay later service to several marketplaces to serve their merchants, looks to expand its business-to-business payments offerings.</p>
<p>Tiger Global and Bessemer Venture Partners co-led the two-year-old startup’s $25 million financing round. Existing investors Quona Capital and Ankur Capital also participated in the round, a top executive said Thursday.</p>
<p>The new investment, especially from high-profile global investors, shows the appetite many have for the buy now, pay later space, a category that has made deep inroads globally in recent years, and their bullishness on young firms in India.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254469" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><a href="https://www.rupifi.com">Rupifi</a> works with over two dozen business-to-business marketplaces including Walmart, Flipkart and Jumbotail to serve their merchant partners, many of whom are mom and pop shop operators, with credit (working capital). The ticket size of these checks ranges from ₹10,000 ($135) to ₹10,000,00 ($13,500).</p>
<p>The startup sifts through the partner marketplace’s data for its underwriting – on who should get a credit and its size. Rupifi, which largely works with non-banking financial companies to source the capital, has provided credit to over 50,000 sellers so far, Anubhav Jain, co-founder and chief executive of the startup, told TechCrunch in an interview.</p>
<p>“Our B2B BNPL is currently operating at some of the category leading B2B marketplaces in India across sectors such as FMCG, pharma, fashion, electronics, agriculture and food,” he said.</p>
<p>Access to capital is the biggest challenge merchants face in the world&#8217;s second most populous nation. Small businesses, especially mom-and-pop shops, rely on money they secure from selling their existing inventory for buying their next batch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2254472" style="width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254472" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2254472 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rupifi-tiger-bessemier.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="206" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rupifi-tiger-bessemier.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rupifi-tiger-bessemier.jpg?resize=150,31 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rupifi-tiger-bessemier.jpg?resize=300,62 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rupifi-tiger-bessemier.jpg?resize=768,158 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rupifi-tiger-bessemier.jpg?resize=680,140 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rupifi-tiger-bessemier.jpg?resize=50,10 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254472" class="wp-caption-text">The workflow of Rupifi&#8217;s BNPL service. (Image credits: Rupifi)</p></div></p>
<p>A timely shot of working capital enables these merchants, who otherwise run some of the world’s most economically sound businesses, to significantly boost their revenues, several industry figures have shown.</p>
<p>Buy now, pay later is Rupifi’s marquee offering today, but Jain, who previously worked at American Express, Razorpay, and sold his edtech platform StudyBud in an all-cash deal, said that the startup will be expanding its product offerings in the next few months.</p>
<p>“What we are saying is that BNPL is just one of the payment instruments that the merchants are using,” he said. The startup is now building an embedded checkout product – which, like its BNPL offering, will sit within the partner firm’s app and website – and will power any payment option including cash to process the payment. “The goal is now to move to B2B payments and checkout.”</p>
<p>&#8220;B2B payments and B2B credit are large problems with technology being the future to solve these and Rupifi team is building around that keeping the SMEs at the core,&#8221; said Vishal Gupta, Managing Director of Bessemer Venture Partners, in a statement.</p>
<p>Another product it has started trialing is a commercial card. Jain said the card is aimed at small businesses and enterprises that has exceedingly demonstrated good behavior with our BNPL service. &#8220;They can use the card at any place, even if we are not integrated with that business,&#8221; said Jain.</p>
<p>“We have had the experience of working with more than hundred B2B and SaaS founders,&#8221; said John Curtius from Tiger Global in a statement. &#8220;We understand that globally B2B payments are broken and largely manual. In the $1 trillion B2B commerce and payments space in India, Rupifi has demonstrated rapid growth and proven product leadership.”</p>

Transmit Security <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/525-million-a-round-transmit-security-passwords-insight-2021-6">broke records</a> last summer with their $543 million Series A, and in Q3 2021, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/q3-2021-na-startup-funding-report/">$26.4 billion was invested in North American</a> early stage startups, compared with $12.1 billion a year earlier. There have been warnings that these landmark fundraises are driven by too much capital available and a highly competitive venture market.</p>
<p>However, despite the twofold growth in dollars invested, the number of companies receiving funding has grown by less than 30% compared with Q3 2020. Simply put, 2021 has seen startups raise the bar for what a good company looks like and investors have been willing to pay a high price for a piece of the pie.</p>
<h2>Key takeaways</h2>
<p>Recent benchmark data shows that qualifying for the top quartiles in key SaaS Metrics was harder in 2021 than ever before, particularly when you consider the growth and net dollar retention metrics.</p>
<ul>
<li>From 2018-2020, growing at 140% would put business in the top quartile as a Series A company.</li>
<li>Beyond growth, formerly impressive metrics like 110% net dollar retention no longer make the cut.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking a closer look at each of these early rounds highlights that investors might not be going crazy with their recent investments as startups redefine what &#8220;good&#8221; looks like.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Mine&#8217;d, a <a href="https://www.doyoumined.com/">digital platform</a> and wellness network that connects consumers with emotional health experts and community, has raised a $3.5 million seed round led by Listen Ventures. The round was also funded by WNDRCO and Able Partners, Joyance Partners, Route 66 Ventures as well as angel investors Ed Baker, the former vice president of growth at Facebook and Uber, and Jillionaire from Major Lazer. Mine&#8217;d features interactive and short-form live and on-demand classes to users based on a wide range of topics, including dating, breakups, career and purpose. Since launching six months ago, Mine&#8217;d has built a community of over 100,000 users and one million videos.</p>
<p>The platform was co-founded by wellness-tech entrepreneur Aaron Albert and emotional wellness content creator <a href="http://www.instagram.com/createthelove">Mark Groves</a>. Albert, who is now the company&#8217;s CEO, says the idea for Mine&#8217;d was prompted by his experience with trying to find support after a breakup. He says he found traditional therapy to be expensive and time-consuming, while modern solutions like teletherapy lacked in their quality of care. <span style="font-weight: 400;">A friend of his who knew he was having a hard time sent him one of Mark Groves&#8217; wellness videos. Albert says he was immediately taken with Groves&#8217; content and reached out to him, after which the pair began working together. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I started to explain all of the challenges I faced as a consumer wanted to get emotional support and he expressed to me all of the challenges he faced as a creator of emotional wellness content, not feeling like there was a safe space for his peers amidst the creator economy explosion,&#8221; Albert told TechCrunch. &#8220;It was very clear there was a real opportunity here, and so Mine’d was born.&#8221;</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253946" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Once users join Mine&#8217;d, <span style="font-weight: 400;">they&#8217;re asked to select the areas they want to improve on. Users are then shown a selection of experts where they can see what areas they specialize in and browse content before choosing who to follow. Users are able to join live sessions where they can ask experts questions and get or give support to the community.</span></p>
<p>In terms of the new funding, Albert says Mine&#8217;d plans to use it to bring on an additional 100-200 experts to the platform. Mine&#8217;d currently has 20 wellness experts, including marriage and family therapist Vienna Pharaon, marriage, family and relationship expert Dr. Alexandra Solomon and sex therapist Shadeen Francis. The company also plans to launch creator tools that will allow its experts to offer more support to their community. Mine&#8217;d also aims to focus on email marketing and content production. Lastly, the company plans to use the funding to launch exclusive Mine&#8217;d courses within the app.</p>
<p>When asked what sets Mine&#8217;d apart from other wellness apps, Groves said other platforms are focused on how to scale one-on-one therapy, coaching and group therapy. Although Mine&#8217;d believe in those methods, Groves believes that by the time someone goes to therapy, it&#8217;s very late in their personal growth journey.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We wanted to meet people, with curated and incredible content, at step one, the frictionless space where people are beginning to search for answers to their problems, challenges and making sense of their feelings,&#8221; Groves stated. &#8220;W</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">e wanted to create a space where they could be themselves, be curious, be vulnerable, and decide on the depth of intimacy that they are comfortable with given their familiarity with personal growth, therapy, and consuming content that is sometimes challenging and emotional.&#8221;</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Regarding the future, the company plans to continue developing Mine&#8217;d in a way that still feels personal and vulnerable. Groves outlined that Mine&#8217;d will help its experts<span style="font-weight: 400;"> reach the people who need support while allowing them the ability to get paid for their expertise. In addition, Albert said the company also plans to expand its offerings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are looking to become the unifier in the emotional wellness space,&#8221; Albert said. &#8220;We want to give our community the chance to not only get help through our many content offerings, but ultimately be able to book 1:1 and small group coaching. We are planning to launch a Mine’d Coaching Certification, allowing people to step into their calling and become coaches themselves.&#8221;</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Verb’s customer-facing analytics tools are built specifically to live inside multi-tenant SaaS applications.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Nine months after its public launch, <a href="https://www.verbdata.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Verb Data</a>, a customer-facing analytics company, took in $3 million in funding to continue developing technology so that SaaS companies can build better in-product dashboards for their customers.</p>
<p>Founders Dave Hurt and Oleg Fridman started the Boston-based company in January 2020 and started its private beta program with five customers in August 2020, then launched to the public in April 2021.</p>
<p>Verb’s customer-facing analytics tools are built specifically to live inside multi-tenant SaaS applications, CEO Hurt told TechCrunch via email. What makes it different from competitors is the way it makes simpler the process of building and maintaining customer-facing dashboards by non-technical team members by reporting and automating the data infrastructure that supports those data experiences.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254176" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“For example, every chart that is built and embedded into a customer’s application is backed by a data warehouse that is specifically optimized for that chart without requiring any developer effort,” he added. “This allows software teams to focus on their core product while also providing their end-users with high-performing analytics dashboards.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The funding round was led by El Cap Holdings and lead investors Stew Bradley and Kunal Tandon. Individual investors also participating include Stan Garber, Alex Yakubovich, Matt MacInnis, Steve Garrity and Packy McCormick.</p>
<p>The company counts dozens of companies as customers, including Encamp, BidOps, SwipeBy and ReviveMedia. Hurt attributes Verb’s flexibility for enabling customers to use the tools in a way that is unique to their needs.</p>
<p>Some are using it for embedded product dashboards, some are using it inside of Notion as a client analytics portal and others use Verb for customer success management or as a sales tool.</p>
<p>“Verb has allowed us to supercharge our efforts around both internal and customer reporting,” Ben Leiken, CTO at Bid Ops, a predictive sourcing software company, said via email. “Thanks to their powerful features, we’re able to instantly deploy changes and test new features with customers — all without needing to wait for our next release.”</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;How to be one of the &#8216;haves&#8217; of SaaS&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/27/how-to-be-one-of-the-haves-of-saas/embed/#?secret=xINGyYi8zY" data-secret="xINGyYi8zY" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Prior to this new funding, Verb Data raised an undisclosed pre-seed round in 2020 that helped it complete its private beta and get to the public launch, Hurt said. He plans to invest in building out the company’s engineering team and on product development. Verb has 15 employees, up from seven at this time last year.</p>
<p>Some of the features coming down the pipeline in the first quarter include map data and charts for greater flexibility and use with Verb’s modularized drag-and-drop editor. Users will also be able to visualize their data on maps on existing dashboards to allow for better reporting.</p>
<p>In addition, Verb is working on additional data source integrations from existing partners, an updated design styles library and Slack integration for quicker and easier communication when a dashboard is created, Hurt said.</p>
<p>Hurt said the company was focused on customer growth over revenue, so he did not have year over year metrics to share, but did say that over the past six months, Verb had 65 new signups with an overall conversion rate of 20%. In July that rate increased to 30%. The company intends to raise another round of funding in the third quarter of 2023 and expects to have 100 paying customers by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>“The SaaS market is becoming more vertical-specific, which means that companies are competing on core functionality in their respective niche,” Hurt said. “While this generally means that end-customers are benefiting from software that more closely aligns with their needs, it also means that product teams have to focus on their core functionality to keep up with competition, making the analytics dashboard an even more difficult feature to prioritize on the roadmap.”</p>

		Pete Buttigieg currently serves as the 19th Secretary of Transportation, having been sworn in on February 3, 2021.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Millennia ago, some unnamed innovator created humanity’s most famous early invention: the wheel. And ever since, the story of transportation has been one of human creativity, innovation, and technology. From e-scooters to spacecraft, technology shapes most human journeys, whether it’s a historic spaceflight or a daily cross-town commute.</p>
<p>At the U.S. Department of Transportation, my colleagues and I think every day about how transportation technologies are evolving, and we use our policy tools to support these innovations and make sure they deliver convenience, safety, and economic opportunity for the American people.</p>
<p>At any time in history, and certainly in ours, innovation shapes and reshapes how people and goods move to where they need to be. But in recent years, “innovation” has become such a buzzword that it risks losing its meaning—and policymakers risk losing our focus as we contend with the constantly shifting and rapidly developing world of transportation technology.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253276" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As policymakers, we must prioritize. We need to assess which important innovations will develop on their own, and which require federal support for basic research. We must consider when a technology should be given as much room as possible to develop experimentally, and when it raises concerns that require regulation to keep people safe.</p>
<p>The current decade is especially full of challenges and opportunities from developments in transportation technology. We are witnessing the rise of electric and autonomous vehicles, the widespread adoption of recreational and commercial drones, renewed attention to cybersecurity vulnerabilities in our infrastructure, increasingly routine commercial space travel, and, perhaps most urgently, the high-stakes race to dramatically reduce transportation’s impact on our climate before it’s too late.</p>
<p>Amid these changes, the role of public policy is not always obvious, but it’s always important. To inform our work, today our department is establishing a set of six guiding principles for our work on innovation in transportation.</p>
<p>Innovation is not an end in itself, but a chance to improve. Our innovation efforts should serve our most important public policy goals, like creating economic opportunity, advancing equitable access to transportation, and helping to confront the climate crisis.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Innovation should be shaped in ways that help America win the 21st century, with transportation systems and infrastructure that make communities more competitive, adaptable, and resilient.</p>
<p>Our innovation strategy must support workers, knowing that our choices will help to define whether any given technological development meets its potential to create economic benefits for all.</p>
<p>A good innovation strategy allows for experimentation and learns from setbacks, because these are indispensable parts of the scientific method that underpin all invention and discovery.</p>
<p>Our approach to innovation should center on opportunities to collaborate, recognizing the distinct but related roles of the public, private, and academic sectors.</p>
<p>And finally, our policies should be flexible and adapt as technology changes, because we can’t prepare for an evolving future with policy that only makes sense under present or past conditions.</p>
<p>These principles will help us to ensure that the enormous potential of U.S. transportation innovation benefits our nation and its people. To some, “government” and “innovation” are not words that go together naturally. But in reality, the public sector has always played a vital role in unlocking the innovative capacity of the American people.</p>
<p>Consider the smartphone, an invention that transformed the way we live in a matter of just a few years. Smartphones could only be the result of private-sector inventions and marketing—the natural role of private companies, not government departments. But the technologies on which smartphones depend—like microprocessors, lithium batteries, touchscreens, GPS, and indeed the internet itself—were all supported or invented by government researchers.</p>
<p>Some of our largest tech companies—including Google, Apple, and Tesla—benefited from government subsidies, loan guarantees, or other public support early in their growth.</p>
<p>And while government is far from the source of all invention, it does have a responsibility to help ensure that all inventions are safe and practical for the public.</p>
<p>Government didn’t invent planes, trains, or automobiles, but it did build airports, lay tracks, and construct highways. It enacted laws requiring seat belts and air bags, and created an air traffic control system so that people could travel safely.</p>
<p>As secretary of Transportation, I’ve had the privilege of seeing firsthand the latest frontiers of transportation innovation in our country.</p>
<p>In Georgia last year, I saw the nation’s first-ever solar roadway, which provides clean power for nearby electric vehicle (EV) chargers. In Oregon, I test-drove one of the electric buses that cities around the country are embracing as cleaner and quieter alternatives to outdated diesel vehicles. And in North Carolina, I visited an advanced research lab working on an extremely important, if unglamorous, subject: the future of pavement, including more durable asphalt and even materials that can recycle carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>American companies and scientists are at work every day pushing the boundaries of what is possible in transportation. And our department is at work every day supporting basic research and maintaining the guardrails that ensure those technologies unfold in ways that are safe, equitable, and clean. In the years ahead, these core principles will guide that work—and thanks to President Biden’s historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we have new resources to support those efforts.</p>
<p>These investments will help more Americans adopt electric vehicles and save money on fuel. They will help more children take the bus to school without being exposed to toxic fumes. And they will put more people to work creating the infrastructure of the future.</p>
<p>When it comes to transportation innovation, perhaps the hardest thing to predict is the timing of how and when these developments will impact our everyday lives. Less than 60 years passed between the first flight at Kitty Hawk and the first crewed American spaceflight. Less than 10 years after the first smartphones hit the market, ride-sharing was overtaking taxi use in many American cities. Electric vehicles were in commercial production in 1902 at Studebaker factories in my hometown of South Bend, Indiana—only to all but disappear for most of the 20th century, then re-emerge as a dominant force in the 21st.</p>
<p>It’s not the job of policymakers to guess or dictate how and when these advancements will unfold. But our role in supporting, fostering, and safeguarding the work of transportation innovation is vital, and it comes at an exceptionally important time in the story of American transportation. The decade ahead will bring countless transformative changes in how people and goods move around the country and the world. And the Department of Transportation will be here to help support those innovations and ensure they benefit us all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never before has the importance of a smooth-flowing supply chain been as clear as it has been in the COVID-19 pandemic era. For manufacturers in particular, managing intricate supply chains can be particularly challenging.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enter </span><a href="https://www.assentcompliance.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assent Compliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8212; a Canadian company focused on supply chain sustainability management. Put more simply, Ottawa-based Assent aims to help manufacturers make smarter decisions regarding “who they do business with and how their products are sourced,” notes CEO Andrew Waitman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today, the company is announcing it has raised $350 million at a valuation of more than $1 billion in a funding round led by Vista Equity Partners. The financing follows a $131 million Series C raise led by Warburg Pincus, which remains the company’s largest shareholder.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254258" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, Assent was bootstrapped for the first five years of its life &#8212; from 2010 to 2015. In the subsequent years, after Waitman came on as CEO, the company has raised over $500 million and grew its headcount from about 20 to 820 today (45% of which identify as female). While half a billion dollars raised in the U.S. is not uncommon, it’s a bit more rare in the Canadian tech scene.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assent’s trajectory continues to grow and Waitman projects the SaaS company will cross $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) this year after growing ARR by over 50% in the past 12 months. Its customers include the likes of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">GE Appliances, Polaris, Stryker and Escatec.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company delivers enterprise-wide supply chain sustainability solutions across product compliance, trade compliance and ESG &#8212; better known as</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental, Social and (Corporate) Governance</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Assent has made a name for itself by being exclusively focused on complex manufacturing. Doubling down on that niche has allowed it to build what it claims is “the industry&#8217;s largest network of supplier intelligence.” Specifically, it works to help complex manufacturers proactively identify and manage risk, accelerate market access and growth and promote brand reputation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assent’s compliance platform provides centralized access to supply chain data for use by teams across a given company. It automates data collection and validation and provides &#8220;configurable&#8221; reporting so that its customers “can stay ahead” of their data requirements.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The increasing complexity and scale of regulations and varying requirements globally, combined with a heightened focus on ESG, presents challenges for companies across industries, particularly for manufacturers,” Waitman said. “Assent enables deep insight and rapid transparency to help ensure products are made with environmental and human rights standards necessary to compete — and win — in markets of the future.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company plans to use its new capital mostly to continue expanding in Europe, eventually enter the Asian market and grow its headcount by 40% across its sales, services, engineering, customer success and marketing teams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Manufacturing represents 20% of GDP,” Waitman told TechCrunch. “It’s an enormous market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vista’s Foundation Fund, which invests in middle-market companies seeking to scale and accelerate their growth trajectory, led the investment. Vista’s Patrick Severson, co-head of the Vista Foundation Fund, and Jake Hodgman, managing director of the Foundation Fund, will join the Assent board of directors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies globally are facing increased demand to ensure they source their components and raw materials in an ethical and responsible manner, either from government regulators who oversee them or from customers and partners whose expectations hold them to higher standards, noted Severson. Assent is “ahead of the curve” when it comes to solving enterprise supply chain challenges through technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assent’s solution empowers companies to mitigate their brand and reputation risk and become better corporate citizens,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Severson added. “The scrutiny being placed on complex manufacturers in how they manage their supply chains is only increasing. Assent is uniquely positioned to be a clear leader in a future focused on manufacturers adopting supply chain sustainability best practices.” </span></p>

Its original developers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-03-15-torrent-front-end-popcorn-time-made-streaming-movies-free-and-ea.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1">took the service down</a> and abandoned the project merely a few days after it launched in 2014. But since the project was open source, other developers were able pick up where they left off, and it&#8217;s been killed and revived a few more times ever since. It remains to be seen whether Popcorn Time is now gone for good, but it looks like the biggest contributor to its most recent demise is the dwindling interest in the app.</p>
<p>On its website, the developers posted a graph of &#8220;popcorn time&#8221; searches over the past seven years. While the app enjoyed a ton of searches in the months after its launch in 2015, the graph shows a sharp decline in interest by 2016. Its popularity continued to wane, and it never really recovered after that, at least based on Google Trends.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-04/popcorn-time-alternative-is-hard-to-find-as-app-shuts-down?sref=10lNAhZ9" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the group behind Popcorn Time announced its closure in an email. While they didn&#8217;t say whether law enforcement action was a factor behind their decision to shut down the app this time around, Popcorn Time has had brushes with the law in the past. The original version may have closed after authorities got involved, and Hollywood studios even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-02-popcorn-time-hollywood-lawsuit.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">sued individual users</a> who allegedly downloaded and shared copies of movies illegally.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254401" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Developers associated with Popcorn Time previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-03-20-popcorn-time-p2p.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1">talked about</a> how they&#8217;re not responsible for piracy themselves, because the service doesn&#8217;t actually host any content. Instead, it relied on a peer-to-peer sharing system and only provided a way for users to access content hosted on other people&#8217;s computers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Biometrics, and specifically facial recognition, have seen a surge of usage in the last several years, first as a tool to help organizations verify identities digitally against rising waves of fraud and cybercrime; and second as a way to help enable that process even further in our socially-distanced, pandemic-punctuated times. Today, a startup called <a href="https://www.iproov.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iProov</a>, which provides face authentication and verification technology to a number of governments and other big organizations &#8212; attracting some controversy in the process &#8212; is announcing $70 million in funding to keep up its growth momentum.</p>
<p>The funding is coming from a single investor, Sumeru Equity Partners out of the Bay Area, which originally started life as a part of Silver Lake before spinning off as an independent operation in 2014. Valuation is not being disclosed, nor is the total raised by the company to date.</p>
<p>London-based iProov has seen a lot of business traction so far in its home market of the U.K., and now it plans to use capital specifically to continue building out its present in the U.S. and other international markets where it&#8217;s already started to get a foothold. iProov works at the large enterprise level and its customer base currently includes U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.K.&#8217;s Home Office and National Health Services (NHS), the Australian Taxation Office, GovTech Singapore and banks Rabobank and ING. iProov said 2021 was a bumper year for the company: it tripled its revenues over the year before (although it&#8217;s not disclosing how much that works out to in actual terms).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254345" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>As a measure of how much, and how, iProov is getting used, the NHS says that as of <a href="https://www.nhsx.nhs.uk/news/milestone-hit-with-over-16-million-nhs-app-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September 2021</a>, usage of its NHS app &#8212; &#8212; which uses iProov to power the facial verification that is used to register for the app, which then lets you check and show your vaccination status; book doctor appointments; re-order prescriptions; view your medical records; get advice; and more &#8212; ballooned to 16 million users, from just 4 million in May 2021 (now it&#8217;s January and there are likely more).</p>
<p>To be clear, this isn&#8217;t facial recognition &#8212; which founder and CEO Andrew Bud describes as a mere &#8220;commodity&#8221; these days &#8212; but technology, sold as <a href="https://www.iproov.com/iproov-system/technology/genuine-presence-assurance">Genuine Presence Assurance</a> and <a href="https://www.iproov.com/iproov-system/technology/liveness-assurance">Liveness Assurance</a> by iProov &#8212; that lets an organization capture an image of an individual, verify that it&#8217;s real against another piece of ID and not a deepfake or other counterfeit image, and proceed with whatever transaction is going on, all by way of cloud-based remote, virtual mobile technology.</p>
<p>Its peak usage last year last year typically would see iProov getting pinged for more than 1 million facial verifications per day.</p>
<p>But that growth has not come without scrutiny and other controversial attention.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Critics have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/sep/24/undisclosed-private-companies-analysing-facial-data-from-nhs-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slammed</a> iProov and the UK government for a lack of transparency over how user data is handled in process of capturing and authenticating images for biometric verification, particularly given that iProov is a private company working for a public organization; related to that there have been other ethical questions raised between the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/sep/15/nhs-app-storing-facial-verification-data-via-contract-with-firm-linked-to-tory-donors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">links</a> between some of the startup&#8217;s earliest backers and the Tory Party (which is currently in power in the UK).</p>
<p>And as of this week (timed to coincide with the funding news?) iProov has also been the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facetec-sues-iproov-over-alleged-biometric-technology-patent-infringement-501051/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subject of a patent lawsuit</a> from a U.S. rival called FaceTec, which claims that iProov has copied parts of its technology and is demanding an injunction (something that could be tricky as iProov increases its focus on the U.S.).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, iProov has also been involved in early work to see how and if its facial authentication technology might be applied in other use cases, such <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/03/boris-johnson-to-give-go-ahead-for-trials-of-covid-passports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these trials</a> to speed up Covid vaccination certification, another potential avenue for scrutiny.</p>
<p>In an interview, Bud was quick to counter the controversial currents that have swirled around his company and the technology that it&#8217;s built.</p>
<p>On the issue of privacy and security, Bud is a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewbud/?originalSubdomain=uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">longtime veteran</a> of the telecoms and mobile worlds, initially as an engineer and then an executive, who said that his interest in biometrics was sparked after being burned at his previous company, mBlox, where malicious hackers exploited the company&#8217;s SMS infrastructure and stole millions of dollars from customers.</p>
<p>The experience made him realize how critical security needed to be both at the end of the provider, but as something that was easy for consumers to engage with too. &#8220;It needed to be ultra-inclusive and simple,&#8221; Bud said. &#8220;How can we ensure something like that would never happen again? I had to solve that problem.&#8221; That, he said, was what spurred him to start looking at biometrics, which he believes is the best answer to that question. And from that he built his next company, which became iProov.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are fair questions,&#8221; he said in response to me raising the issue of privacy and data protection at iProov and its work with public and private institutions. &#8220;Privacy is extremely important to iProov and our systems are built to protect users.&#8221; Everything is compliant with GDPR or other government-mandated data protection rules, related to data and how it may or may not be used, he added, and the methods that iProov uses to process user data are built to keep customers and their identities safe from being compromised. He also confirmed that none of the data that passes through its system is used for commercial purposes. iProov runs a policy of not knowing the identities or other personal information realted to any photos, but it does store imagery, specifically to help track and block malicious actors and to track anomalies.</p>
<p>On the subject of the patent infringement lawsuit from FaceTec, Bud dismissed it as &#8220;completely unfounded,&#8221; with a spokesperson sending me a more complete statement after my interview (as well as asking we keep this part out of the story altogether&#8230;):</p>
<p>&#8220;All of our products have been developed in-house and are covered by granted patents. Accusations that we have used [FaceTec] technology in our products are completely unfounded, and iProov will take all appropriate actions to defend itself and its customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>And as for future applications, although the UK government hasn&#8217;t yet shown a willingness to mandate so-called &#8220;Covid passports&#8221; widely &#8212; where people have to provide quick verification of their vaccination status to gain entry to events, public venues, workplaces and more &#8212; the basics of that technology are already there and being used by a number of other customers, Bud said. These include a recent launch from Eurostar (which runs the train under the English Channel between London and cities on the European continent) for passengers to authenticate their various credentials at home, to reduce the amount of dwell time at check in, where they then can walk through simply by showing their faces to a screen.</p>
<p>Facial-related biometrics, Bud said, are likely to remain the mainstay of what iProov and others will develop going forward for these and similar use cases, although the company also offers a palm-based identification method, too. Primarily, however, iProov and others will have to follow the lead of the organizations they work for: their tech will only be as useful as whatn ever biometric information the original organization collects. (And these days, government-issued IDs, with photos, remain the main source of that data.)</p>
<p>As we move ever more processes to digital and cloud-based platforms, finding ever more watertight methods of verifying identities of users, while evading the increasingly sophisticated approaches of fraudsters and malicious hackers, will continue to be a huge priority. Investors seem willing to place bets on iProov being one of the strong players in keeping those services working as they should.</p>
<p class="m_-6092298163636487534gmail-m5006224922490917439msolistparagraph">&#8220;We see iProov as becoming the industry standard to establish the genuine presence of anything (a person, a document etc),&#8221; said Kyle Ryland, a managing partner at Sumeru, in a statement to TechCrunch. &#8220;We hope that iProov will be used not only to accelerate digital onboarding and verification for both online and physical experiences, but also to replace the use of insecure passwords for frictionless authentication and much more. We have a platform that is constantly learning and allows us to remain at the forefront of emerging technologies and new security threats.&#8221;<u></u><u></u></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adam Goulburn, a partner at Lux Capital, was first struck by <a href="https://www.eikontx.com/">Eikon Therapeutics’</a> pitch to use super microscopes to develop drugs when founder Eric Betzig posed a simple question: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can you understand life if you don’t look at it live? </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was such a simple statement, but it was kind of eye opening to me,” Goulburn tells TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The environment within our cells is in perpetual motion: proteins twist, turn and shift in place. But this environment has, even under most microscopes, remained invisible. </span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254132" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is, until scientists Eric Betzig</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stefan W. Hell</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">William E. Moerner, developed techniques allowing us to </span><a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2014/press-release/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“peer into the nanorealm” inside living cells</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – a feat that earned the team a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2014.  Betzig, specifically, was the first to develop super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, which allowed the movement of single molecules to be seen in detail. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2254158" style="width: 1568px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2254158" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2254158 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/368042-U2OS-0002_WellD02_Point00_ChSPT_10fps_v2-1.gif" alt="" width="1558" height="923" /><p id="caption-attachment-2254158" class="wp-caption-text">The movement of proteins within live cells.</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That innovation has formed the basis of a startup that’s been raking in funding since its founding in 2019. Eikon Therapeutics, co-founded by Betzig, is a biopharmaceutical company with plans to use super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, the data collected by these high powered microscopes, and a host of other tools to develop new drugs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, the company announced s $517.8 million Series B round. This follows a $148 million Series A announced in May 2021, and brings the company’s total funding to over $668 million. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New investors in the Series B round include include funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price Associates, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments), EcoR1 Capital, UC Investments (Office of the Chief Investment Officer of the Regents of the University of California), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), Stepstone Group, Soros Capital, Schroders Capital, Harel Insurance, General Catalyst, E15 VC, Hartford HealthCare Endowment, and AME Cloud Ventures.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Column Group, Foresite Capital, Innovation Endeavors, Horizons Ventures, and Lux Capital, all investors in the company’s Series A round, are returning for the Series B. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A lot of people throw around the world proprietary technology, but what Eikon, has, in my view, is truly proprietary,” Goulburn said. “We certainly see its ability to give us a unique advantage in finding new biology.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s little doubt that super-resolution microscopy contains vast biological potential, but how does it apply to drug development? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One way to think about it is to recall that proteins do most of the work within our cells: they help send signals, carry out chemical reactions, or transport smaller molecules throughout the body, for instance. When we take a drug, we’re introducing another component into that busy workforce with the hope that it will bind to a certain target, and change what’s already going on inside the body (which, presumably, is causing an issue). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tools like super-resolution microscopy allow scientists to see exactly what’s happening when a drug is introduced into a living cell, rather than inferring what’s happening through other types of experiments. And, perhaps, it could also reveal new targets that haven’t been visible before. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have these super resolution, single particle tracking microscopes that could look into cells,” explains Goulburn. “Then if you add millions of cells in a well, and then add millions of wells, and add millions of drug-like compounds to that well you can really start to explore drug discovery, in the live sense of the word, at scale.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, Eikon has been focusing on the “industrialization” of their drug discovery platform – i.e. Developing a process and tools that allow this detailed protein data to be used to make new drugs, or better understand the ones that currently exist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This process is being overseen by some of the best in the business: namely Roger Perlmutter, former president of Merck Research Laboratories, who </span><a href="https://www.biospace.com/article/merck-s-perlmutter-to-retire-effective-january-1-2021/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced his retirement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the Merck in 2020. But with this most recent funding round, the company has landed six more C-suite hires. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daniel Anderson, former VP of biology at Recursion Pharmaceuticals, will join as Chief Scientific Officer. Russ Berman, formerly VP of Engineering at Pacific Biosciences will join as Chief Technical Officer. Alfred Freddie Bowie, Jr., former VP of corporate and business development at Veracyte will join as Chief Financial Officer. Barbara Howes, formerly Chief Human Resources officer at Pliant Therapeutics will join as Chief People Officer and Executive Vice President. Ashish Kheterpal, former Chief Information Officer of PACT Pharma will join as Chief Information Officer, and Ben Thorner formerly Senior Vice President and Head of BD&amp;L at Merck Research Laboratories will join as General Counsel and Chief Business Officer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goulburn argues that the Eikon’s technology is ready for industry right now. In a press release, John Hall, an investment analyst at T. Rowe Price also noted that Eikon’s research was already “generating significant volumes of quantitative information about the dynamic behavior of proteins.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “It’s, in my view, industrialized right now,” Goulburn says. “We’re running drug screens 24/7. It’s the biofactory of the future in my mind.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is pursuing four unnamed target programs and has one undisclosed partner, but Goulburn did not provide specifics on how those programs are proceeding. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this most current round of funding, the company will look to grow its 100-person team (ideally, doubling in size, says Goulburn), to accelerate the development of its platform, and advance the discovery programs already in motion.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Malnutrition is very common among hospitalized patients in the U.S., and its coded prevalence is increasing. Amid this problem lies an opportunity to optimize the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">overall</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quality of patient care, improve clinical outcomes and reduce costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s the drive for South Africa-based health tech startup <a href="https://www.healthleap.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HealthLeap</a>, which focuses on a global healthcare market starting from the U.S. The startup provides a clinical assistant for dietitians working in hospitals. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s emerging from stealth to announce its $1.1 million pre-seed round led by deep tech investor Fifty Years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Malnutrition happens when there’s a deficiency, excess or imbalance of nutrients in people’s bodies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This can cause significant adverse effects on people’s physiology and clinical outcomes.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254236" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People with diseases can develop malnutrition when they cannot consume adequate quantities or quality of food, or their diet does not reach the proper levels of nutrients to compensate for the specific nutritional needs created by the disease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HealthLeap </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">says it is building AI-assisted tools for healthcare professionals to better address hospital malnutrition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“As a clinical dietitian, I saw many patients suffer due to malnutrition being </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">insufficiently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> addressed in hospitals, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">partially</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because clinical dietitians </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are understaffed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and other clinicians are not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">adequately</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trained in clinical nutrition,” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">clinical dietitian and chief research officer</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jemimameyer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Jemima Meyer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wanted to help dietitians with the complex clinical calculations that they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">constantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tailor to each patient case and their changing medical condition.”</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meyer hacked the first version of a research-backed productivity tool to help her colleagues perform calculations, make decisions using the latest clinical research and treat more patients in less time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With her brother and CEO</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/josiah-meyer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Josiah Meyer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and CTO</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/raybotha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Ray Botha</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they standardized the process, and that was how HealthLeap was launched in April 2021</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company’s AI-based clinical assistant product </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is called</span><a href="https://www.healthleap.io/nutrileap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">NutriLeap</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Its mobile app, which is HIPAA-compliant, helps hospital dietitians (and soon the other healthcare providers they collaborate with) with automated clinical calculations and research-backed suggestions. With this, they can determine precise, personalized nutritional needs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> faster for patients. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are predicting optimal treatment steps to ensure patients receive adequate nutrition,” said CTO Botha. “The decisions clinicians make inside our app combined with data from other sources, including an EHR integration, will further improve our predictions.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app is used by 50 dietitians in a private beta program. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company said it has a <a href="https://www.healthleap.io/nutrileap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">waitlist</a> nearing 1,000 dietitians, pharmacists and physicians</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Malnutrition in hospitals </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is associated</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with</span><a href="https://aspenjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ncp.10771"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">3</span></a><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24247093/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">-5x mortality</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during a hospital stay. It</span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212267213006412" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">affects 30-50%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of patients, but only</span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212267216315544" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">5%</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">are diagnosed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. HealthLeap says it wants to eradicate hospital malnutrition globally. But for now, it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is focused</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the U.S. because of the possibilities the new United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) standards unlock. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a future where nutrition is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">uniquely</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> optimized for the health of every person. We want to help make nutrition data-driven for everyone, and we’re starting with the people that need it most </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">urgently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: hospital patients,” said the chief executive Josiah Meyer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One important data source that got unlocked is Electronic Health Record data due to the USCDI standards</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The USCDI standards, approved in July last year, allow health tech organizations to access </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unavailable health data sources. And with the pandemic </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">massively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accelerating healthcare professionals’ adoption rates of digital tools, HealthLeap </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is poised</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to capture a significant market share with its software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to helping clinical dietitians and other healthcare providers (hospital pharmacists, physicians, nurses) identify patients at risk of malnutrition, HealthLeap also prescribes daily quantities of oral, tube, and IV feeding to the patient’s ever-changing needs. The company said it plans to help dietitians to treat patients even after discharge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HealthLeap is still very much in the pre-revenue stage. But it won’t stay that way much longer. According to preliminary pricing research carried out by the company, 97% of its target users are willing to pay a monthly subscription fee out of pocket for access to NutriLeap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Figuring out revenue is good news for startups and the investors backing them. For</span><a href="https://fiftyyears.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Fifty Years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, HealthLeap’s lead investor that recently</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/fifty-years-a-deep-tech-investor-has-raised-90-million-from-tens-of-unicorn-founders/#"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised $90 million </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">for its third and newest fund, investing in “the next generation of founders that will change the world for the better” is paramount as well. That’s why the firm, which is made up of 44 unicorn founders, backed HealthLeap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a tragedy that so many die </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">needlessly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> because they don’t get the nutrition they need while in the hospital,” said Fifty Years founding partner Seth Bannon in a statement. “By addressing hospital malnutrition in a scalable way using machine learning, HealthLeap will save dietitians time, save healthcare providers money, and most </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">importantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> save patients’ lives. That’s easy to get excited about.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HealthLeap says it will use this pre-seed capital to hire software engineers and data scientists to continue creating smart tools to help clinicians prevent and treat hospital malnutrition.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Reliance Retail has led a $240 million funding round in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/google-backs-indias-dunzo-in-40-million-funding-round/">Google-backed hyperlocal delivery startup Dunzo</a> as the largest Indian retail chain expands to the instant commerce space, a category that has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/20/zepto-a-10-minute-grocery-delivery-app-in-india-raises-100-million/">made inroads</a> in the South Asian market in recent quarters.</p>
<p>Reliance Retail is investing $200 million in the round for a 25.8% stake in the six-year-old startup, which operates an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/04/dunzo-hyperlocal-ecommerce-delivery/">eponymous hyper-local delivery service</a> in seven cities in India. The new round, a name for which was not disclosed, values the Bengaluru-based startup at $775 million. Existing investors Lightbox, Lightrock, 3L Capital and Alteria Capital also participated in the round.</p>
<p>“We are seeing a shift in consumption patterns online and have been highly impressed with how Dunzo has disrupted the space. Dunzo is the pioneer of Quick commerce in India and we want to support them in furthering their ambitions of becoming a prominent local commerce enabler in the country,” said Isha Ambani, Director of Reliance Retail Ventures Limited, in a statement.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254366" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Our merchants will get access to the hyperlocal delivery network of Dunzo to support their growth as they move their business online through Jio Mart,” she added.</p>
<p>Dunzo allows its customers to buy a wide range of items across several categories, from grocery, perishables, pet supplies and medicines to dinner from their neighborhood stores and restaurants. They can also use Dunzo to move their own items &#8212; such laptops, chargers, medicines, and lunch &#8212; around the city.</p>
<p>Last year, it entered the instant delivery space in Bengaluru, offering customers delivery within 15 to 20 minutes. The startup said it is seeing over 20% week-on-week growth without disclosing any figures.</p>
<p>Dunzo said Thursday that it plans to expand to more geographies &#8212; an additional eight cities &#8212; and broaden its quick commerce play with the fresh funds.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>E-commerce accounts for less than 3% of all retail sales in India, according to industry estimates. Mom and pop stores and other neighborhood outlets that dot tens of thousands of cities, towns, villages and slums across the country drive most of the sales in the nation.</p>
<p>Dunzo, which counts Blume Ventures among its investors, is attempting to reimagine how e-commerce and delivery is done in India, thereby posing a challenge to Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart, as well as local food and grocery delivery startups such as Swiggy, Zomato, and new comer Zepto.</p>
<p>Kabeer Biswas, cofounder and chief executive of Dunzo, said in Reliance Retail &#8212; which is run by India&#8217;s richest man, Mukesh Ambani &#8212; the startup has found a &#8220;long-term partner with whom we can accelerate growth and redefine how Indians shop for their daily and weekly essentials.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re excited by the traction and velocity that Dunzo Daily has achieved and over the next 3 years, we aim to establish ourselves as one of the most reliable quick commerce providers in the country.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Chalk another one up for decentralized enforcement: France&#8217;s data protection watchdog has slapped headline-grabbing fines on Facebook and Google for failing to respect local (and pan-EU) cookie consent rules.</p>
<p>Today, the CNIL <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cookies-cnil-fines-google-total-150-million-euros-and-facebook-60-million-euros-non-compliance">said</a> it&#8217;s fined Google €150M (~$170M) and Facebook €60M (~$68M) for breaching French law, following investigations of how they present tracking choices to users of google.fr, youtube.com and facebook.com.</p>
<p>The regulator said it was acting after receiving a number of complaints.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2254341" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>In a clear breach of EU and French law, it found the pair do not offer an option for users to reject non-essential cookies as easily as the option they offer for them to accept all tracking.</p>
<p>So, in short, the tech giants were using manipulative dark patterns to try to force consent.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an illustrative snippet from the CNIL&#8217;s <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cookies-facebook-ireland-limited-fined-60-million-euros">press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8221; &#8230; the information given by the company is not clear since, in order to refuse the deposit of cookies, Internet users must click on a button entitled &#8220;Accept cookies&#8221;, displayed in the second window. It considered that such a title necessarily generates confusion and that the user may have the feeling that it is not possible to refuse the deposit of cookies and that they have no way to manage it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The restricted committee judged that the methods of collecting consent proposed to users, as well as the lack of clarity of information provided to them, constitute violations of Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Under EU law, if consent is the legal basis being claimed for processing people&#8217;s data there are strict standards that must be adhered to &#8212; consent must be informed, specific and freely given in order for it to be obtained legally.</p>
<p>Long running complaints against Facebook and Google over similarly problematic consent issues continue to languish on the desk of the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), meanwhile &#8212; which under the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)&#8217;s one-stop-shop (OSS) mechanism is a quasi centralized enforcer for most of big tech.</p>
<p>The DPC has been accused of dragging its feet on GDPR oversight of tech giants and creating a bottleneck for effective enforcement of the regulation, as the OSS encourages forum shopping &#8212; and Ireland&#8217;s low corporate tax economy appears only too happy to oblige client corporates with low resolution regulatory oversight too.</p>
<p>Notably, the CNIL is taking action against Facebook and Google under an earlier piece of EU legislation &#8212; the ePrivacy Directive &#8212; which gives competence to national agencies in their own territories. So the French continue to find creative ways to apply GDPR data protection standards nationally, despite the OSS and Irish GDPR blockage.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a particular irony here, in that Google and Facebook involved themselves in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/digging-into-googles-push-to-freeze-eprivacy/">regional lobbying efforts to delay a planned update to the ePrivacy Directive</a> &#8212; which would have replaced it with a regulation, as we&#8217;ve reported before.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/07/eprivacy-an-overview-of-europes-other-big-privacy-rule-change/">ePrivacy Regulation</a> still hasn&#8217;t been adopted &#8212; despite being proposed back in 2017! Which creates inconsistencies between EU law. But does also leaves Member State-level regulators such as CNIL free to enforce ePrivacy rules within their own jurisdictions, retaining decentralized power to sanction big tech on its home turf under the ePrivacy Directive. So, er, oopsy! That&#8217;s turned into a fairly expensive mistake for Facebook and Google in France at least.</p>
<p>France&#8217;s regulator has been especially busy on this front &#8212; fining Google €100M back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/france-fines-google-120m-and-amazon-42m-for-dropping-tracking-cookies-without-consent/">December 2020</a> for dropping tracking cookies without consent. At the same time it also stung Amazon €35M over the same issue.</p>
<p>Earlier, the CNIL even managed to get an early GDPR fine in against Google &#8212; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/21/french-data-protection-watchdog-fines-google-57-million-under-the-gdpr/">all the way back in 2019</a> &#8212; before the company realized its legal exposure and switched the legal entity handling EU users&#8217; data from the US to Ireland so that its regional business would fall under the DPC&#8217;s &#8216;less muscular&#8217; oversight.</p>
<p>To date, Google has not faced a single sanction under GDPR out of Ireland &#8212; despite a number of very substantial and very long running complaints filed against it, including over <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/25/facebook-google-face-first-gdpr-complaints-over-forced-consent/">forced consent</a>; <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/googles-location-tracking-finally-under-formal-probe-in-europe/">its handling of location data</a>; and its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/22/googles-lead-eu-regulator-opens-formal-privacy-probe-of-its-adtech/">adtech</a>.</p>
<p>Complaints are not only continuing to stack up against tech giants over systemic breaches of EU data protection law and against the DPC for its embarrassingly thin record on enforcement &#8212; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/facebooks-lead-eu-privacy-supervisor-hit-with-corruption-complaint/">even for alleged corruption, in a more recent charge against Ireland</a> &#8212; but also against the European Commission itself which <a href="https://twitter.com/johnnyryan/status/1478683243193024512">stands accused</a> of failing in its duty to monitor GDPR enforcement at a Member State level.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The Commission did intervene verbally <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/02/gdpr-centralized-enforcement/">late last year</a> &#8212; with a direct warning to data protection agencies that GPDR enforcement must become &#8220;effective&#8221; fast or else it suggested DPAs would face having such power taken out of their hands &#8212; in favor of centralized enforcement by the EU executive.</p>
<p>At the same time, Google and Facebook were also blasted by the Commission which accused adtech giants of choosing legal tricks over genuine compliance with the bloc&#8217;s privacy standards, with commissioner Vera Jourová warning: &#8220;I<span lang="EN-GB">t is high time for those companies to take protection of personal data seriously. I want to see full compliance, not legal tricks. It’s time not to hide behind small print, but tackle the challenges head on.”</span></p>
<p>But despite firing a few pot-shots, the Commission appears reluctant to actually step in and sanction Ireland, though. So it&#8217;s been left to Member States like France to make the point in another way &#8212; i.e. by having its agencies illustrate that enforcement is not only possible but happening.</p>

<p>In addition to today&#8217;s headline-grabbing fines, the CNIL has ordered Facebook and Google to change how they present cookie choices to users in France &#8212; giving the pair three months to provide local users with a means of refusing cookies that&#8217;s as simple as the existing means of accepting them &#8212; &#8220;in order to guarantee their freedom of consent&#8221;.</p>
<p>Failure to comply with the order will mean the companies face further penalties &#8212; of €100,000 per day of delay.</p>
<p>The CNIL has been focusing its oversight on cookie consents for some time.</p>
<p>The regulator set a deadline of March 31, 2021 for websites to comply with <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/cookies-et-autres-traceurs-la-cnil-publie-des-lignes-directrices-modificatives-et-sa-recommandation">updated cookie guidance</a> which it published back in October 2020. And, since the end of March, says it has adopted nearly 100 &#8220;corrective measures&#8221; (aka, orders and sanctions) related to non-compliance with the legislation on cookies.</p>
<p>Ireland also published <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/sites/default/files/uploads/2020-04/Guidance%20note%20on%20cookies%20and%20other%20tracking%20technologies.pdf">updated cookie guidance</a>, back in April 2020 &#8212; when it said it would give websites and data controllers six months to come into compliance before taking any enforcement action.</p>
<p>However the DPC has once again shown itself to be all mouth and no trousers: Failing to issue any public sanctions in relation to cookie consent violations against commercial entities (and certainly nothing against Facebook or Google on this front).</p>
<p>A DPC decision against Facebook-owned WhatsApp that was issued late <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/whatsapp-faces-267m-fine-for-breaching-europes-gdpr/">last year</a> focused on transparency breaches.</p>
<p>The size of that eventual penalty for WhatsApp &#8212; $267M &#8212; was also substantially inflated after interventions by other EU DPAs and the European Data Protection Board; Ireland&#8217;s draft decision had only suggested a fine of up to €50M. Facebook, meanwhile, is seeking to evade the sanction by appealing against it.)</p>
<p>Reached for comment on the CNIL&#8217;s spank for disingenuous cookie consents, a Meta/Facebook spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;​​We are reviewing the authority&#8217;s decision and remain committed to working with relevant authorities. Our cookie consent controls provide people with greater control over their data, including a new settings menu on Facebook and Instagram where people can revisit and manage their decisions at any time, and we continue to develop and improve these controls.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The tech giant also pointed to an <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/updating-our-cookie-controls-in-europe/">announcement </a>it made in September last year about an update to its local &#8220;cookie controls&#8221; &#8212; when it said it would be giving people in Europe &#8220;a more granular level of control over their cookie choices and more information on what we use different kinds of cookies for, including what information we receive from other apps and websites&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;This work is part of our ongoing efforts to give people greater control over their privacy and align with evolving privacy requirements, such as the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and the ePrivacy Directive (ePD),&#8221; it added at the time.</p>
<p>Whatever the specific fiddles Facebook made back then the changes don&#8217;t seem to have impressed the French.</p>
<p>At the time of writing Google had not responded to a request for comment on CNIL&#8217;s sanction but we&#8217;ll update this report if we get one.</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>A Google spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;People trust us to respect their right to privacy and keep them safe. We understand our responsibility to protect that trust and are committing to further changes and active work with the <span class="il">CNIL</span> in light of this decision under the ePrivacy Directive.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Namibian business-to-business e-commerce startup <a href="https://www.gojabu.com/">JABU</a> confirmed to TechCrunch that it has raised a $3.2 million financing round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The seed round, which was closed last year, welcomed investors such as Afore Capital, Y Combinator, FJ Labs, Quiet Capital, Kli Capital, Pareto Capital and unnamed angels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a last-mile distribution e-commerce company, JABU joins a list of startups across the continent that help small retailers order and stock their products and, at the same time, provide data-driven services to suppliers and manufacturers.</span></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253794" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO <a href="https://na.linkedin.com/in/davidakinin">David Akinin</a> founded JABU in mid-2020 to fix Namibia’s inefficient and almost nonexistent supply chain and distribution.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Its platform connects over 6,000 retailers to local and multinational suppliers — such as Namibia Breweries Limited, ABInBev, Bokomo, Coca-Cola, Namibmills — and digitizes orders, payments and logistics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Namibian startup has its fleet of vehicles along with eight distribution centers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Suppliers using the platform have dashboards to see where their products are being delivered, check key performance indicators and book merchandising. They can also make advertising and marketing campaigns at shops, perform product giveaways and tap</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into merchandising revenue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JABU operated in stealth mode for much of last year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It got into Y Combinator during the accelerator’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/here-are-all-the-companies-from-y-combinators-summer-2021-demo-day-part-1/">summer batch</a> in 2021, the first time for a Namibian startup</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The startup doesn’t appear in our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/this-yc-summer-batch-features-the-largest-group-of-african-startups-yet/">curated list</a> because it deferred its Demo Day until this year’s winter batch, where up to 15 African startups </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been selected by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Y Combinator, according to some sources.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last year saw venture capital firms and institutional investors scramble to back newly formed and existing business-to-business e-commerce retail startups. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the earliest in the space, Nigerian B2B e-commerce platform <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/06/tradedepot-raises-110m-from-ifc-novastar-to-extend-bnpl-service-to-merchants-across-africa/">TradeDepot</a>, raised a combined $110 million in debt and equity</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Startups from other parts of Africa that raised investments include Morocco’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/chari-a-moroccan-startup-digitizing-mom-and-pop-stores-raises-5m-at-70m-valuation/">Chari,</a> Egypt’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/13/egyptian-startup-capiter-raises-33m-to-expand-b2b-e-commerce-platform-across-mena/">Capiter</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/maxab-the-egyptian-b2b-food-and-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-40m-for-expansion/">MaxAB</a>, and Kenya’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/kenyas-twiga-raises-50m-to-scale-affordable-food-solutions-across-africa/">Twiga</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/08/kenyas-marketforce-raises-2m-plans-to-focus-on-its-b2b-retail-marketplace-rejareja/">MarketForce</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JABU shines a light on the Southern Africa region. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company operates in three cities in Namibia and recently expanded into two Zambian cities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Its monthly GMV has grown 25x and the average growth of delivered SKUs stands at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nearly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 53% monthly since March. The company said that revenue has also seen a 35x growth within the same time frame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with most African countries, Namibia is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">heavily</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reliant on cash. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And JABU — profiting from owning its supply chain — is making efforts to digitize its physical cash collection processes via wallets</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the money from retailers arrives at JABU distribution centers, it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> takes 48 hours to settle into the banks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Instead of going through this mundane process, JABU’s wallets will allow merchants to deposit and withdraw money immediately in sync with these centers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our volumes growth grew so much and we’ve picked up so much money in physical currency, the banks and others have sat down and said, ‘How can we fix this</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">?’ I mean, we went from having a couple R100,000 (rands) a week to having millions of Namibian dollars. And we realized there’s something better and bigger than we originally tapped into,” Akinin said about why the company is creating wallets for its merchants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akinin said the next stage of JABU’s wallet system would see merchants offering other services to consumers on top of their digitized cash. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The only way to do that is by partnering with the merchants, and they go through a [know your customer] process, we make sure the merchants have the right space and the right account </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> back their float. And then they transact with their customers. So we’re entering the B2B2C space through the merchants that we work with,” he said.</span></p>
<p>JABU’s revenue largely comes from distribution it carries out itself or via third-party fleets<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Merchandising and targeted marketing and advertising also bring in bucks for the company. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will take commissions from transactions performed on merchants’ wallets in the future</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akinin, who had a stint at Google as a sales and goods analyst, also spent parts of his professional career as an investment banker at Credit Suisse</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He would later make a series of visits to top African cities like Johannesburg, Lagos and Addis Ababa, but it was in Windhoek that he found the spark to try something new.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Namibia had huge housing demand at the time. Akinin launched a startup to offer digital mortgages but pivoted to a construction company with a presence in Namibia, Zambia and Cameroon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the pandemic, Akinin’s construction company embarked on a COVID relief program to donate food supplies in Namibia</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Then, he stumbled on the country’s B2B e-commerce retail opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We went into the informal sector and realized that the city had shut down every single informal retailer</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And when they did that, we had this software we had developed to like digitize housing demand,” he said, describing how JABU started. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hired 40 people from the community and in about one or two weeks, we registered 1,000 shops that had </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been affected by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this shutdown. We realized that there’s a huge opportunity here to not only help them reopen but understand something very key here that they have no supply chain and also no way of sourcing their products at an affordable rate.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Informal retail is still king in Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A<a href="https://www.pwc.co.za/en/press-room/retail-in-africa.html"> study by PwC</a> reported that informal channels such as kiosks and mom-and-pop stores account for 90% of sales in Africa’s major economies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The opportunity is so large that some startups, such as Nigerian B2B retail platform Sabi (a Rensource spinoff), said it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/25/rensource-spinoff-sabi-closes-6m-bridge-round-expands-b2b-retail-platform-outside-nigeria/">processing almost $12 million monthly GMV,</a> TechCrunch learned in an interview with its founders in November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">JABU, with more than 200 employees, is gearing for a Series A fundraising this quarter, Akinin told TechCrunch. The startup will use the seed round and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">subsequent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> growth round </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to expand into Botswana and South Africa, grow its tech and operations team, and train its field agents.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://payfit.com/en/">PayFit</a> just announced that it closed a new $289 million Series E round (€254 million) before the holidays. Following this round, the startup has reached a post-money valuation of $2.1 billion (€1.82 billion).</p>
<p>The company has been building a payroll and HR software-as-a-service platform for small and medium companies. It is operating in a handful of European countries — around 150,000 people currently get paid through PayFit.</p>
<p>General Atlantic is leading the round, while some of PayFit’s existing investors are participating once again, such as Eurazeo, Bpifrance&#8217;s Large Venture fund and Accel.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2253954" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup has been on a roll as it raised a Series D round <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/payfit-raises-107-million-for-its-payroll-and-hr-platform/">in March 2021</a>. I asked about PayFit’s valuation and how it has changed since the Series D.</p>
<p>“It’s true that we had never communicated about our valuation before. We only shared the size of our funding rounds,” co-founder and CEO Firmin Zocchetto told me. “I can only tell you that our valuation has greatly increased.”</p>
<p>He listed two reasons why PayFit has had little issues raising at a higher valuation. First, the company is doing well when it comes to revenue. The startup’s annual recurring revenue has increased by 70% in 2021.</p>
<p>Second, there’s a lot of money floating around for the best performing tech companies. He said that the current climate is “extremely favorable.” And I bet a lot of people would recommend taking advantage of the situation.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>The market opportunity</h2>
<p>But let’s try to dissect PayFit’s business a bit more to find out how the company ended up here. PayFit lets you manage your payroll from a web browser and automate as many steps as possible.</p>
<p>PayFit has a product advantage compared to other solutions as you don’t need to be an expert and work for an accounting firm to generate payroll. The startup makes sure you remain compliant and hides the complexity. For instance, if there are regulatory changes, PayFit will update the logic of its application.</p>
<p>The company also has a big market opportunity. Every company needs a payroll solution <em>and</em> it’s incredibly hard to switch from one solution to another — it’s the perfect Venn diagram for a software-as-a-service product.</p>
<p>There are currently 6,000 companies using PayFit. Around 80% of them are based in France. Other customers are located in Spain, Germany or the U.K. Most importantly, when someone creates a company from scratch, many of them choose PayFit and stick with it.</p>
<p>When you think about it, 150,000 employees getting paid through PayFit is not that much. There are tens of millions of employees in France, the U.K., Spain and Germany. Before opening a branch in new countries, PayFit wants to capture more market share in these four markets.</p>
<p>Labor laws vary from one country to another, which means that there could be different geographical leaders as there’s a natural barrier to entry. For instance, <a href="https://gusto.com">Gusto</a> and <a href="https://justworks.com">Justworks</a> are doing well in the U.S. but they don’t operate in other markets. It&#8217;s going to be important to see if PayFit has what it takes to become the clear market leader in France, the U.K., Germany and Spain.</p>
<p>Finally, once PayFit owns the relationship with the HR or admin specialist in the client company, it can provide additional services. “We started with payroll, but what we really care about is the employer-employee relationship,” Zocchetto said.</p>
<p>PayFit offers different tools to manage vacation, facilitate onboarding, manage time sheets and track employee expenses. Soon, the company will also offer a way to handle annual performance reviews in PayFit.</p>
<p>Essentially, PayFit is part of a cohort of startups that are reinventing the admin stack. PayFit’s founder names Qonto and Alan as two companies that are also working on overhauling back-end tools. <a href="https://qonto.com/en">Qonto</a> offers bank accounts for SMBs while <a href="https://alan.com">Alan</a> offers health insurance products for companies.</p>
<p>With 700 employees in Paris, Berlin, Barcelona and London, PayFit now wants to diversify its product offering, integrate with more third-party products and improve its customer service. The company wants to “offer small companies the same perks that you would get by working for big companies,” Zocchetto said.</p>
