										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Well that was fast. London grocery delivery upstart, <a href="https://jiffygrocery.co.uk">Jiffy</a> &#8212; which was only founded in April this year &#8212; has nabbed $28 million in Series A funding around half a year after initial £2.6M <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/jiffy-grocery/">seed raise</a>. It says it&#8217;s now raised a total of $35M.</p>
<p>The grocery delivery startup operates a network of its own dark stores to do fulfilment &#8212; enabling it to offer the promise of &#8220;fresh groceries in 15 minutes&#8221;.</p>
<p>Currently it has eight London stores &#8212; now with the funds to expand.</p>
<p>Jiffy tells TechCrunch is has amassed around 20,000 customers so far across its six delivery zones (all in London for now).</p>
<p>The Series A round is led by family-owned investment company Heartland, with Boston-based international VC fund Flint Capital also participating, along with gaming firm Playrix and existing investors Baring Vostok Capital Partners and LVL1 among others.</p>
<p>The fast-following financing is a measure of how hyper competitive the on-demand grocery space has become in the UK capital &#8212; as well as being a clear signal investors are impressed with the startup&#8217;s early execution.</p>
<p>Other on-demand grocery delivery players operating in London include <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/gorillas/">Gorillas</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/">Weezy</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/instant-grocery-startup-getir-makes-its-first-acquisition-to-expand-into-spain-and-italy/">Getir</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/zapp/">Zapp</a>. The U.S. unicorn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gopuff-funding/">goPuff</a> is also in the mix &#8212; having acquired UK startups <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210506006037/en/Gopuff-Jumpstarts-International-Expansion-with-Acquisition-of-UK-Based-Fancy">Fancy</a> and <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/gopuff-acquires-dija/">Dija</a>.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Jiffy&#8217;s founders describe themselves as &#8220;Q-Commerce veterans&#8221;. Co-founder Vladimir Kholiaznikov was ex-CEO of Russia’s e-grocery player X5 Food Tech, while fellow co-founder, Artur Shamalov, has also founded a previous food-related startup in Russia. Both have also dabbled in investing themselves &#8212; so likely have a burgeoning contacts book to tap when they go fundraising.</p>
<p>Jiffy says its typical customers are families and <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">middle aged grocery shoppers who are switching to its app from traditional convenience supermarkets and online weekly shops. </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We are betting this trend will only accelerate as we become a more mature service,&#8221; says Kholiaznikov.</span></p>
<p>The Series A funds will go on expansion within London &#8212; and maybe also further afield, as Jiffy eyes moving into other urban locations in the UK.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are definitely aiming to cover London inside of the M4 by end of the year,&#8221; Kholiaznikov tells TechCrunch. &#8220;Jiffy might move to towns as pilot this year but we will see later.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;long term&#8221; plan is that &#8220;all towns with 100k+ population are on our radar&#8221;, he adds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are building a nationwide company but will also explore other markets though an alternative route &#8212; we are providing our Q-commerce tech platform to selected local players in international markets (for example, we are a partner of Send in Australia),&#8221; Kholiaznikov also says, adding: &#8220;We will continue this route as well to add value to our core business and shareholders.&#8221;</p>
<p>While there is a smorgasbord of startups vying to delivery groceries and/or snacks to citydwellers in the UK, Jiffy&#8217;s offer puts speedy delivery of fresh produce front and center which looks like a smart differentiation vs operators that mostly want to ship easy to handle produce like bottles of pop and crisps.</p>
<p>Additionally, though, there are a raft of food delivery apps also trying to nibble into the traditional weekly grocery shop &#8212; very familiar names like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/deliveroo-posted-narrowed-loss-of-309m-with-gross-transactions-surging-to-5-7b-in-2020-eitf-shows/">Deliveroo</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/just-eat-takeaway-confirms-its-gobbling-up-grubhub-in-a-7-3b-deal/">JustEat</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/uber-eats-beefs-up-its-grocery-delivery-offer-as-covid-19-lockdowns-continue/">Uber Eats</a> &#8212; mostly focused on meal delivery from restaurants but some have been bolting on light groceries picked from stores they don&#8217;t operate.</p>
<p>Going after the full weekly grocery shop, as Jiffy and multiple other startups are, looks like a bigger logistics and execution challenge &#8212; certainly with a promise of 15 minute delivery &#8212; but also has the potential to be a more sustainable and lucrative business vs just catering to sporadic convenience needs and snack cravings, even if the ops are more complicated.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are not only startup rivals for Jiffy and co to worry about here too; traditional supermarkets have made huge profits during the pandemic &#8212; and could certainly splash plenty of cash to dial up their delivery services. But this is also where leaner startups can steal a march by delivering on their promise of hyper fast delivery, albeit with less product choice.</p>
<p>In addition to grocery delivery, Jiffy is adding &#8216;Click &amp; Collect&#8217; ordering &#8212; which is currently offered at two of its London stores, giving its customers more choice about how they get their groceries.</p>
<p>It is also avoiding the myriad (legal, ethical, reputational and logistical) pitfalls of gig work; Its e-bike and moped-riding delivery couriers are liveried employees.</p>
<p>Another differentiating twist to its model is the aforementioned open Q-Commerce play.</p>
<p>&#8220;This <span lang="EN-US">means, we provide our ready-to-go IT platform that other companies can use to launch their own quick-commerce stores,&#8221; notes Kholiaznikov.</span></p>
<p>Commenting on Jiffy&#8217;s Series A in a statement, Lise Kaae, CEO of Heartland said: “The Jiffy team has managed to impress us with their ambitious plans and effective execution, and we are excited about the journey ahead operating in a highly dynamic and exciting growth market.</p>
<p>“We strongly believe in the large and untapped potential of the e-groceries market in the UK and the ultra-fast delivery business model developed by Jiffy. The company is led by a very experienced team of founders and the current round would enable Jiffy to further accelerate growth. We are glad that the fund of Baring Vostok is a part of this exciting story.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google on Thursday filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court against the Competition Commission of India following the leak of a damning confidential report detailing the watchdog&#8217;s interim fact-finding in an antitrust probe.</p>
<p>The report, which Google has yet to formally receive or review, said the American giant had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/18/google-abused-dominant-position-of-android-in-india-antitrust-probe-finds/">abused the dominant position of Android in India</a> to illegally hurt competitors in the world’s second-largest internet market. The Indian antitrust watchdog began its probe into Google&#8217;s alleged abuse of Android in the country two years ago. About 98% of smartphones in India run Google&#8217;s mobile operating system, according to research firm Counterpoint.</p>
<p>Google said it is seeking &#8220;redress in this matter, specifically protesting against the breach of confidence which impairs Google&#8217;s ability to defend itself and harms Google and its partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last week&#8217;s report said Google had reduced device manufacturing firms’ ability and incentive to develop — and sell — devices running alternative versions of Android. Additionally, the report found Google’s requirement to make it mandatory for device manufacturers to pre-install its apps to be in violation of India’s competition law.</p>
<p>The company said today it has not yet had the opportunity to review the report&#8217;s findings, &#8220;much less submit its defence of any allegations.&#8221;</p>
<p>India is a key overseas market for Google where the company reaches over half a billion internet users, according to Comscore. The Android-maker has also made significant investments in the country. Last year, it announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/google-to-invest-10-billion-in-india/">plans to invest $10 billion in the country</a> over the course of five to seven years, and has already spent a considerable amount of it, thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/google-invests-4-5-billion-in-indias-reliance-jio-platforms/">a $4.5 billion check to Indian technology giant Jio Platforms</a>.</p>
<p>“We are deeply concerned that the Director General’s Report, which contains our confidential information in an ongoing case, was leaked to the media while in the CCI’s custody,&#8221; a Google spokesperson said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Protecting confidential information is fundamental to any governmental investigation, and we are pursuing our legal right to seek redress and prevent any further unlawful disclosures. We cooperated fully and maintained confidentiality throughout the investigative process, and we hope and expect the same level of confidentiality from the institutions we engage with.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://paystack.com/">Paystack</a>, the African fintech company that powers and processes payments for businesses, today announced that it is launching Pay with Apple Pay on its platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company, in a statement, called the integration &#8220;the fastest, secure way for Nigerian businesses to accept international payments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple Pay, Apple&#8217;s mobile payments and digital wallet service, provides users with a secure and private way to pay on their iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches and Macbooks</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite having a presence in almost every continent since 2014, Apple Pay only <a href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/mobile/479503/apple-pay-launches-in-south-africa/">made its way into Africa this March through South Africa</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users in the country with Visa, Mastercard and American Express cards can access the payment service from five banks &#8212; Nedbank, Absa, FirstRand Bank, Investec and Discovery</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the launch in South Africa showed Apple&#8217;s keen interest in increasing its penetration in sub-Saharan Africa, the tech giant didn&#8217;t say if it would expand to other countries like Nigeria and Kenya. Like South Africa, these countries have also seen</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the adoption of digital payments significantly increase these past few years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, instead of waiting for Apple&#8217;s next move, Paystack has taken the initiative to integrate the payment service on its platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company is now the first payment gateway in Nigeria to support Apple Pay. Doing so gives Nigerian businesses access to millions of Apple Pay users in the more than 60 countries where the payments service </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is active</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2207325" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207325" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2207325" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1632370659871_12-2-PWAP-In-Action-Dark-BG.gif?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="357" /><p id="caption-attachment-2207325" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Paystack</p></div></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how it works: <span style="font-weight: 400;">A customer with Apple Pay enabled will see the option to checkout using Pay with Apple Pay when they tap to buy from a Paystack merchant. Using Touch ID or Face ID, they can then go ahead and pay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay with Apple Pay is available to Nigeria-based businesses that use Paystack. They can accept payments made through any of the Paystack-hosted Commerce tools &#8212; Paystack Storefronts or Invoices &#8212; and via </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> payment channels including cards, mobile money, USSD, QR codes and EFT</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few years, Paystack merchants have accepted international payments from customers following the integration with global commerce platforms Wix and Shopify</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Africa, the YC-backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/">Stripe subsidiary</a> has also integrated with regional payment channels. One with SnapScan for QR payments in South Africa &#8212; the most recent country it expanded to &#8212; and one with local partners for mobile money in Ghana, the third African country it operates in</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/khadijah-abu-pm">Khadijah Abu</a>, the head of product expansion at Paystack, told TechCrunch that the integration with Apple Pay is the platform&#8217;s first global payment channel integration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re the first payment platform to support this channel in Nigeria, and we intend to integrate more global payment channels in the future to help connect Paystack merchants to the global economy,&#8221; she said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;We&#8217;ve integrated with Apple Pay because we want to give our merchants and their customers more payment choices. Customers also love Apple Pay, the conversions are great and our merchants can now reach an even larger audience.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paystack integration with Apple Pay is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what Flutterwave, another big-name African payments platform, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/flutterwave-and-paypal-partner-to-allow-african-merchants-to-accept-and-make-payments/">did with PayPal back in March</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While reporting on that, I referenced how PayPal and Flutterwave would coexist if PayPal decided to expand to Nigeria and other African countries where Flutterwave offers the integration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he same applies to Paystack and Apple Pay, the playing ground is quite different. In Nigeria, <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/nigeria">Android is king</a> in the mobile operating system market, where the OS commands a more than 87% share, compared to 7.75% for Apple&#8217;s iOS. Little wonder why the iPhone maker isn&#8217;t too keen on expanding Apple Pay into Nigeria (in South Africa, iOS has a <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/south-africa">14.89% market share</a>).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This statistic might be behind</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Paystack&#8217;s optimism that its integration with Apple Pay will not be affected should Apple decide to extend the payment service in Nigeria. If anything, the company is looking to eat into Apple Pay&#8217;s market by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> replicating the integration for businesses in South Africa and Ghana</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing impressive growth in South Africa, with thousands of new businesses of all sizes joining us every month,&#8221; Abu said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regarding</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Paystack&#8217;s progress in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. &#8220;Apple Pay is super convenient and secure, and while we&#8217;re beginning with Nigeria, we aim to bring this payment channel to all our markets.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Giving her opinion on how this would impact e-commerce in Nigeria, Abu said that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to merchants being able to sell to an international audience, the success rates of international transactions on the platform would </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">improve significantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s an existing eagerness to connect with the global market. This new payment channel makes it </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">significantly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> easier to access and sell to that market.&#8221;  </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.lg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LG Electronics</a>, the Korean tech giant that once was a leading player in mobile phones but is now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/04/lg-is-shutting-down-its-smartphone-business-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">winding down that business</a>, is making an acquisition that points to its ambitions in another, emerging area: next-generation automotive hardware and services. Today the company announced that it will be snapping up <a href="http://www.cybellum.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cybellum</a>, an Israeli automotive cybersecurity specialist that detects and assesses vulnerabilities in connected vehicle services and hardware by way of a &#8220;digital twin&#8221; approach.</p>
<p>The deal is coming in several parts, LG said.</p>
<p>Initially, it is taking a 64% stake in Cybellum for $140 million, and it will contribute a further $20 million in the form of a simple agreement for future equity (SAFE) note, &#8220;upon conclusion of the trading process in the fourth quarter.&#8221; The remaining shares will then be acquired the &#8220;near future&#8221; (no specified date), which is also when the final valuation and investment will be confirmed.</p>
<p>As it stands now, if the valuation remains consistent, the deal in total will be worth some $240 million (market forces or the company&#8217;s own business funnel could impact this).</p>
<p>LG has been <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/lg-chem-will-invest-5-2b-in-battery-materials-through-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">building</a> a profile as an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/aurora-labs-ramps-self-healing-software-with-23m-from-lg-technology-ventures-porsche-se-toyota-tsusho/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investor</a> in interesting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/auto-software-company-sonatus-raises-35-million-from-hyundai-motor-group-saic-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automotive startups</a>, but this is its first acquisition out of Israel &#8212; Cybellum is based in Tel Aviv &#8212; and points to the bigger company&#8217;s interest not just in hardware but in providing software solutions to the automotive industry.</p>
<p>“It’s no secret the critical role software plays in the automotive industry and with it comes the need for effective cybersecurity solutions,” said Dr. Kim Jin-yong, president of the LG Electronics Vehicle component Solutions Company, in a statement. “This latest deal will further strengthen LG’s solid foundation in cybersecurity, enabling us to be even more prepared for the era of connected cars.” This is an <a href="https://www.insideindustry.com/index.php/news2/automation/328-lg-and-honeywell-demo-automotive-cybersecurity-solution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">area</a> that LG has been <a href="https://swsolutions.lge.com/insights/trends/automotive-cybersecurity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eyeing up for a while</a>.</p>
<p>This is a good return for Cybellum&#8217;s investors, which included Blumberg Capital, Target Global and RSBG Ventures (the venture arm of German industrial giant RAG). Cybellum had raised just over $14 million prior to this.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The startup &#8212; which was founded in 2016 by Slava Bronfman and Michael Engstler, two cybersecurity alums from the Israeli Defense Forces &#8212; has over the years picked up a number of big-name customers using its technology, including Jaguar Land Rover and Nissan, with its partners including Harman, Toyota Tsusho, and PTC.</p>
<p>Bronfman told us in an emailed interview that the plan will be to continue working with all of these companies for the time being, and to continue operating as an independent entity.</p>
<p>Cybellum&#8217;s technology, and LG&#8217;s acquisition of it, underscore some significant trends in the world of connected cars and cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Connected vehicles represent a new attack vector for malicious hackers, and a very complicated one, when you consider the multiple components that go into vehicles, and the numerous OEMs and automotive companies at work in the bigger ecosystem of the vehicle. That will only become more complex as vehicles evolve to be &#8220;smarter,&#8221; more connected, and eventually more autonomous: there will be more connected systems, and even more reliance on them working correctly to work safely.</p>
<p>One of the big challenges has been having a joined up approach to cybersecurity across all of that. LG, as an existing player in the market with ambitions to grow that position, is making an investment both in its future business, and to address a wider services need in the industry.</p>
<p>Cybellum&#8217;s approach is to create a so-called &#8220;digital twin&#8221; of the system &#8212; an approach also taken in the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/lacuna-raises-16-million-in-series-a-to-help-cities-manage-mobility-via-digital-twin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worlds</a> of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/ibm-acquires-italys-myinvenio-to-integrate-process-mining-directly-into-its-suite-of-automation-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enterprise IT</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/20/unlearn-ai-nabs-12m-to-build-digital-twins-to-speed-up-and-improve-clinical-trials/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">healthcare</a> &#8212; and to monitor this as a way of capturing the full picture to identify and assess threats. This is one way of bridging fragmentation among individual components, while being able to monitor events in real time without straining the systems of the vehicle itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is first and foremost a security investment,&#8221; Bronfman said. &#8220;Cybellum is a cybersecurity company. As one of the leading automotive suppliers, LG is prioritizing cybersecurity as they understand that it&#8217;s an essential part of the current era of connected vehicles and the transition toward autonomous vehicles.&#8221;</p>
<p>LG is not currently a partner of Cybellum&#8217;s but Bronfman said that the first integrations between the two are likely to come out in 2022.</p>

		Alexander Chachava is a serial entrepreneur, investor and managing partner at <a href="https://en.leta.vc/">LETA Capital</a>, a technology investment firm.	</div>
	
	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Russian-speaking and Eastern European technology entrepreneurs are acknowledged as some of the most technically skilled in the world.</p>
<p>As a case in point, Coursera’s <a href="https://blog.coursera.org/announcing-the-coursera-2020-global-skills-index/">2020 Global Skills Index</a> found that Russian learners had the highest proficiency in technology and data science among 65 million learners across 60 countries. Levels of entrepreneurship also remain high and are still growing.</p>
<p>Beyond their technical abilities and entrepreneurial flair, a question remains: Are they investable?</p>
<p>Estimates suggest there are already some 17,000 Russian-speaking and Eastern European entrepreneurs operating in key hubs in the U.K., Europe, United States and farther afield.</p>
<p>Unbeknown to many, high-profile success stories include Telegram, Revolut, TradingView, PandaDoc, Preply and more. In 2019 alone, companies founded by Russian-speaking entrepreneurs were sold to U.S. entities for more than $12.5 billion. Some of the most prominent deals included the $5 billion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/09/insight-partners-acquires-data-management-company-veeam-for-5b/">sale</a> of Veeam to Insight Partners, MagicLab’s $3 billion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/08/badoos-andrey-andreev-sells-his-stake-in-bumble-to-blackstone-valuing-the-dating-app-at-3b/">sale</a> to U.S. investment management company Blackstone and DXC Technology’s $2 billion <a href="https://www.luxoft.com/pr/dxc-technology-completes-acquisition-of-leading-digital-innovator-luxoft/">acquisition</a> of Luxoft.</p>
<p>Our funds at Leta have also supported startups acquired by international firms, including the <a href="https://www.zurich.com/en/media/news-releases/2017/2017-1222-01">sale</a> of Bright Box HK to Zurich Insurance Group in 2017 and WeWork’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/wework-unomy/">acquisition</a> of sales and marketing platform Unomy.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this track record and success, I believe Eastern European entrepreneurs, even when operating from their home countries, remain overlooked and undervalued by investors.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<h2>Stigma of a Russian heritage</h2>
<p>The reasons are probably myriad, including perceived cultural differences, lack of understanding, trust and confidence, and, sadly, greater risk aversion, probably too often fueled by negative Russian and Eastern European stereotypes. In fact, many entrepreneurs go to significant lengths to downplay their heritage and backgrounds in an attempt to level the playing field with their “Western” peers.</p>
<p>Research conducted recently by our analysts suggests a significant proportion of Russian-speaking and Eastern European entrepreneurs continue to find it challenging to win over investors and are not successfully raising seed funding.</p>
<p>Where they have been successful and raised seed, Series A or Series B funding, they are on average raising 65% less than their U.S. peers and over 40% less than U.K. and EU entrepreneurs. In terms of funding raised per employee, this is almost 2x less than the U.S. and U.K. average, and the ratio of acquisition events for these companies is around 5%, compared with 17% and 20% for U.S. and EU companies, respectively.</p>
<p>Are we then to take it that these companies are less successful or demonstrate different growth characteristics?</p>
<p>This is not the case. The entrepreneurs and companies in our analysis are punching well above their weight in terms of growth and investor returns. Compared to their peers, they generate strong growth (in particular at seed and Series A phases), have smaller burn rates and are highly efficient in converting investments into return for investors.</p>
<h2>A mine of opportunities</h2>
<p>Despite some of the success stories, I believe many Eastern European startups are still overlooked and undervalued. For investors, this represents a massive untapped opportunity.</p>
<p>As an IT entrepreneur myself, fortunate enough to be in a position to put my money where my mouth is; I see it as my mission to help others succeed the way I did, and in the process bring the world some very exciting companies and disruptive technologies.</p>
<p>We are also committed to working with other investors –- in need of greater comfort and convincing &#8212; to better understand and navigate this significant and exciting untapped segment of the market, which we know from our analysis and the performance of our own funds delivers an attractive return to investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cobo.com/">Cobo</a>, a Singapore-based crypto asset management platform, raised a $40 million Series B to accelerate the development of decentralized finance as a service (DFaaS).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The round was co-led by <a href="https://dst-global.com/">DST Global</a>, <a href="https://capitalant.com/">A&amp;T Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.imo.vc/en">IMO Ventures.</a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The company will use its proceeds for the development of DeFi as a service (DFaaS) infrastructure and its existing custody services such as wallet as a service (WaaS), trading and staking as a service (StaaS). The funding will also be used to apply for regulatory licenses to ensure strict compliance to the relevant anti-money laundering (AML) and counter the financing of terrorism (CFT) requirements.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the growing interest for cryptocurrencies among Asian investors, institutional investors and retail investors are seeking diversification options to hedge against inflation and other risks, the company said in its statement.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">“With interest in the crypto revolution soaring across Asia, it’s high time to expand blockchain infrastructures to meet the rising demand, especially as we’re seeing growing enthusiasm among institutions,” said the company CEO and co-founder Discus Fish, also known as Shixing Mao. “In the past, we’d witness crypto applications evolve from Bitcoin to DeFi and now NFTs … Ultimately, this fundraising takes us another step closer to Cobo’s foundational vision of empowering 1 billion users to access crypto.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Cobo was founded in 2017 with a mission to bridge the gap between crypto and users, both retail and institutional, for increasing access to blockchain for all. Cobo’s founders are CEO Discus Fish, the co-founder of F2Pool, and CTO Changhao Jiang, a former platform engineer at Facebook and Google who co-founded Chinese encrypted digital wallet Bihang.</p>
<p>&#8220;As blockchain technology and innovation advances, we are observing a wave of increasing institutional demand,&#8221; said Jasmine Zhang, partner of A&amp;T Capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;ConsenSys raises $65M from JP Morgan, Mastercard, UBS to build infrastructure for DeFi&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/consensys-raises-65m-from-jp-morgan-mastercard-ubs-to-build-infrastructure-for-defi/embed/#?secret=EYcJPixvuj" data-secret="EYcJPixvuj" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">DeFi typically requires professional managers including fund managers or C-level executives to interact directly with cryptocurrency lending protocols like Curve, Compound, Uniswap and AAVE, the company CEO said. Unlike those existing DeFi platforms, Cobo’s DeFi as a service (DFaaS) allows the institutional investor users to empower staff, even computerized bots, to perform operations of various risks, the company CEO told TechCrunch. Low-risk operations can be automated by bots, whereas high-risk operations such as moving large sums still require multisignature confirmations by managers and/or CXOs, he added.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Cobo’s DFaaS infrastructure underpins its multisignature crypto wallet platform and crypto asset custodial services for retail and institutional investors, respectively. Cobo has served more than 300 institutional clients, including Deribit, F2Pool, BitMart and Pionex through its custody services such as Cobo Custody and DFaaS with a cumulative transaction volume of $20 billion. Its retail investor clients use Cobo Wallet.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Cobo, which also has offices in Hong Kong and Seattle, raised a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/17/cryptocurrency-wallet-startup-cobo-raises-13m-series-a-to-enter-the-u-s-and-southeast-asia/">$13 million Series A round</a> in October 2018 to enter new international markets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cobo supports more than 50 public chains, over 1,000 tokens and serves a total of 75,000 high-net-worth individuals, the company CEO said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The amount of plastic pouring into our oceans <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/about/news-room/press-releases-and-statements/2020/07/23/research-finds-plastic-flows-into-the-ocean-expected-to-triple-by-2040">is set to triple by 2040</a>, and the bulk of the un-recycled plastic in the world is generated by an enormous industry: consumer packaged goods (CPG). The world is rife with waste from such goods, but as people become more aware and look to minimize the waste they produce, tech startups are coming up with novel solutions to help people and companies meet their sustainability goals.</p>
<p>At TechCrunch Disrupt this week, we spoke with Svanika Balasubramanian, the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://repurpose.global/">rePurpose Global</a>, a &#8220;plastic credits&#8221; platform dedicated to making planetary action accessible; Brian Bushell, the co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://byhumankind.com/">by Humankind</a>, a personal care brand designed around reducing single-use plastic waste; and Lauren Singer, founder and CEO of <a href="https://packagefreeshop.com/">Package Free</a>, an online retailer that sells products that help us to live a zero or low-waste lifestyle.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			&#8220;People want to behave sustainably, but above that, they want products that they love. They want products that work for them, and they don&#8217;t want to sacrifice the quality or the convenience that they had before.&#8221; 					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>The founders discussed how they plan to eliminate plastic and create valuable businesses at the same time, and shared insights about growing and succeeding in the sustainable tech space.</p>

</ul>
<p>These companies will take the stage one more time on Thursday, September 23, the final day of TechCrunch Disrupt 2021. This time around, they’ll have six minutes to pitch and will take nine minutes of questions from some of the best investors and execs in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Wish them luck.</p>
<h2>Tatum</h2>

<p><a href="https://tatum.io/">Tatum</a> is a blockchain infrastructure startup that wants to make it much easier to develop your own blockchain-based product. The company operates a platform-as-a-service product so that you don’t have to manage your own nodes and learn how to interact with each client.</p>

<p><a href="https://nthcycle.com/">Nth Cycle</a> has developed an electro-extraction system that stands at less than 1,000 square feet and can process 5 tons of material per day &#8212; a key differentiator from big, traditional recyclers that use hydro- and pyrometallurgical techniques that require more capital and generate a greater footprint. The system can accept “black mass,” a powdery waste substance that’s generated from the battery recycling process, and turn that waste into valuable minerals like nickel, cobalt and manganese.</p>

Its first product is a savings app that allows consumers to deposit, save and earn interest on their money. Since beta launching in April 2021, the company has onboarded around 5,000 customers who use its savings product. But with savings being the lowest-hanging fruit for fintech apps, the CEO says the plan for Koa is to offer more products along the line.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Indian budget hotel chain startup Oyo is looking to file for an initial public offering as soon as next week, people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch, joining a handful of firms in the world’s second-largest market that are working to explore the public markets.</p>
<p>The seven-year-old startup, founded by 27-year-old Ritesh Agarwal, is planning to raise as much as $1.2 billion in the IPO, banker sources said, requesting anonymity discussing private matters.</p>
<p>The aforementioned terms could slightly change in the next few days and the startup may take an additional few days to file the paperwork, the people said.</p>
<p>Like Zomato, and a handful of firms, including Paytm and PolicyBazaar, Oyo plans to list on Indian stock exchanges, one person said.</p>
<p>The firm, which counts SoftBank, Lightspeed Partners and Airbnb among its investors and was most recently valued at $9.6 billion, had about $780 million to $800 million in the bank as of three months ago (per Agarwal’s public comment at a recent conference) and raised $660 million in debt in July.</p>
<p>Oyo, which recently<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/29/microsoft-in-talks-to-back-india-oyo/"> raised about $5 million in a strategic investment from Microsoft</a>, operates in nearly three dozen countries. The startup, one of the most valuable in the South Asian nation, has developed an operating system of sorts to help hoteliers accept digital bookings and payments. Oyo, using its technology stack, helps hoteliers determine the best price for a room and helps them with discoverability and integrations with third-party hotel booking services such as booking.com and MakeMyTrip.</p>
<p>Like most others in the travel and hospitality business, Oyo was severely hit by the pandemic, but has recovered considerably in recent months.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Most of the startup’s revenue today comes from a handful of markets, including India, Malaysia, Indonesia and Europe, which have relaxed their lockdown restrictions as more people get vaccinated.</p>
<p>In an interview with Bloomberg TV in July, Agarwal said the startup was &#8220;already operating like a public company,&#8221; but declined to share whether it was looking to list anytime soon. The company has made no other comment on an IPO plan.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Schneider shares insight into her personal thinking about a range of issues including crypto lending, SPACs, NFTs and what startups can do to stay out of regulators' cross hairs.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If startups were looking for more specifics about crypto lending, new rules by which blank-check companies might have to abide, or whether the SEC views NFTs (non-fungible tokens) as securities, they didn&#8217;t get any this week from Erin Schneider, the regional director of the SEC&#8217;s powerful San Francisco office.</p>
<p>While speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021, Schneider — whose team has helped wring settlements out of Theranos, Elon Musk and, more recently, the app analytics company App Annie — was clear from the outset that she was limited in what she could say.</p>
<p>She did, however, share insight into her personal thinking about a range of these issues, which, given her position, seems very much worth knowing (watch the full interview with Schneider below).</p>
<p>For starters, we asked Schneider about Coinbase&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/following-sec-lawsuit-threat-coinbase-cancels-launch-of-lend-product/">now-shelved</a> crypto lending product, and why BlockFi, a crypto lending company, has been grappling with state regulators that want it to stop offering its own interest-bearing products. (The SEC — a federal agency — put the kibosh on Coinbase&#8217;s plans.)</p>
<p>Schneider said startups should expect to abide by both federal regulations and state regulations, which can differ widely depending on the state. But she also used the question to answer something she wasn&#8217;t asked: Can financial products like Coinbase&#8217;s proposed offering confuse consumers? Her answer to this was, no surprise, resoundingly affirmative.</p>
<blockquote><p>I do think over the last couple years, we&#8217;ve seen companies that started out calling [themselves] very disruptive, but they&#8217;re starting to add on features that look very similar to traditional financial structures, and especially in that sort of situation, the risk for investor confusion is high. [So] any regime, be it a state or a federal regime, is going to look very closely at how these companies are advertising their products and what regimes they are subject to, because I do think there&#8217;s potential for investor risks and investor confusion.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Synergy Research released some <a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/european-cloud-providers-double-in-size-but-lose-market-share">seemingly paradoxical numbers</a> from the European cloud market this week. The good news was that the firm found for the period beginning in 2017 through the second quarter of this year, the market grew fourfold, to €7.3 billion ($8.8 billion USD), while European cloud vendor revenue doubled.</p>
<p>The bad news? Those same European-based cloud vendors actually lost ground in market share. You may be wondering how such a scenario is possible, but the vast majority of that revenue went to the Big Three U.S.-based cloud infrastructure vendors: Amazon, Microsoft and Google.</p>
<p>What else is new?</p>
<p>These are the same three firms that control the vast majority of the cloud infrastructure market across the world, so it shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise that Synergy sees a similar pattern in Europe. But Synergy&#8217;s principal analyst John Dinsdale says that in spite of that, the EU vendors should be happy about that good news instead of fretting over the bad.</p>
<p>&#8220;While they have missed out on the higher-growth opportunities afforded by mainstream public cloud services, some have carved out sustainable positions for themselves as national champions or strong niche players,&#8221; Dinsdale said in a statement about the numbers.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="o3nrGtLm4M"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/eu-bodies-use-of-us-cloud-services-from-aws-microsoft-being-probed-by-blocs-privacy-chief/">EU bodies&#8217; use of US cloud services from AWS, Microsoft being probed by bloc&#8217;s privacy chief</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;EU bodies&#8217; use of US cloud services from AWS, Microsoft being probed by bloc&#8217;s privacy chief&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/27/eu-bodies-use-of-us-cloud-services-from-aws-microsoft-being-probed-by-blocs-privacy-chief/embed/#?secret=o3nrGtLm4M" data-secret="o3nrGtLm4M" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The Big Three account for almost 70% of the total revenue in Europe over the four-year time period. The European cloud leader over that time was Deutsche Telekom, with just 2% of the pie. Others with even smaller slivers included OVHcloud, SAP and Orange, with countless others having even smaller bits.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While these numbers are clearly paltry compared to the market leaders, the fact is that the market is so large, and growing so fast, that even a small amount can add up to a good chunk of revenue. In Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s case, that 2% share translates into €146 million ($170.7 million USD), which isn&#8217;t terrible as a side hustle for its wider telecommunications business.</p>
<p>To give these regional numbers some context, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/cloud-infrastructure-market-kept-growing-in-q2-reaching-42b/">worldwide cloud infrastructure revenue</a> was $42 billion last quarter after reaching <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/the-cloud-infrastructure-market-hit-129b-in-2020/">$129 billion in 2020</a>. It&#8217;s growing at a rapid rate, and as cloud adoption increases across the world, Europe is no exception to this trend. In fact, Dinsdale projects that the market will continue to expand in the coming years.</p>
<p>The Big Three certainly recognize this, as these companies continue to invest heavily into building data centers in Europe, spending ​​€14 billion ($16.3 billion USD) in capex over the last four quarters. In spite of this, the European vendors can still rake in hundreds of millions of euros simply by sticking to their strengths.</p>
<p>&#8220;The key for them is to stay focused on use cases that have stricter data sovereignty and privacy requirements and on customer segments that require a strong local support network,&#8221; Dinsdale said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for September 22, 2021. Disrupt Day Two is racing along as I write to you, which means I am missing some Battlefield presentations. But good news for both of us: We have posts below about each of the companies showing off what they are building. We won’t miss out!</p>
<p>Tomorrow we’re <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/#0affacde-e0ed-4a3c-abc4-988cb1c0eb3e">crowning a new winner of Battlefield</a>, by the by. See you there! &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/microsoft-now-more-focused-on-killing-zoom-than-slack-says-stewart-butterfield/"><strong>Microsoft wants to kill Zoom, not Slack:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s according to Slack CEO and possible Salesforce successor Stewart Butterfield. There’s some logic to the point &#8212; Microsoft’s Teams product competes with Zoom and Slack, but that doesn’t mean that it’s going after each equally. Butterfield also noted during Disrupt that many Slack customers are also Office 365 customers.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/microsoft-announces-surface-laptop-studio-and-duo-2-ahead-of-windows-11-launch/"><strong>Microsoft details new Surface hardware:</strong></a> Rudely, I have to say, Microsoft also held an event today. However, unlike our startup-focused shindig, Redmond wanted to talk hardware. Namely new Surface gear, one piece of which has a laptop screen unlike anything I’ve ever seen in production before. If you are into computers, take a peek.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/facebook-stock-drops-after-company-warns-apples-privacy-changes-to-have-bigger-q3-impact/"><strong>Facebook sheds value on revenue warning:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Changes that Apple is making to the larger digital ecosystem are having effects on Facebook, TechCrunch reports. The social giant also noted that it underreported a metric that may have caused customers to think that their ads were underperforming by some 15%. Facebook stock fell nearly 4% on the day.</li>
<li>If you want to have some fun, observe how your humble servant <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/the-nft-on-ramp-is-still-too-steep/">tried (and failed) to buy an NFT</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>As we did yesterday, we’re kicking off our startup notes with a Battlefield roll-call. A big shoutout to Startup Battlefield Editor <a href="https://twitter.com/NeeshaTambe">Neesha Tambe</a>, one of the TechCrunch staff that you don’t get to see much on the site. She’s amazing and helped the companies below prep for the event &#8212; not to mention taking point in making the hard calls about whom to include.</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>Big companies were busy as well, which means we have a little bit more news to nosh on. Enjoy!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/patreon-to-roll-out-tools-to-help-its-adult-creators-meet-mastercards-new-standards/"><strong>Patreon wants to support adult-content creators:</strong></a> Maybe you haven&#8217;t heard, but porn is a big deal on the internet. OnlyFans is a good reminder of that fact.

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/fedex-to-test-auroras-self-driving-trucks-on-dallas-to-houston-route/"><strong>More evidence that self-driving tech is slowly parallel parking its way into our lives:</strong></a> This time it’s news that FedEx is going to work with Aurora’s self-driving tech on an intra-Texas route. Slowly, and then all at once? When it comes to self-driving, let’s hope.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/intuit-launches-venture-arm-to-invest-in-startups-with-innovation-for-small-businesses-consumers/"><strong>Hot off buying Mailchimp for $12B, Intuit wants to buy startup equity a bit earlier:</strong></a> So it’s launching a venture capital arm. Yes, it’s almost odd that the software company &#8212; and rent-seeker via lobbying the federal government &#8212; didn’t have a venture arm before. But now it does. Corporate VC efforts are akin to corporate blogs a while back, something that was once rare and quickly became the norm.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There are few challenges messier and more fraught than the U.S. healthcare system, but a growing number of startups are looking at ways to address shortcomings in standards of care through tech. We had three such companies share our virtual stage at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 this year, including <a href="https://www.cityblock.com/">Cityblock Health</a> president and co-founder Toyin Ajayi, <a href="https://goforward.com/">Forward</a> CEO and founder Adrian Aoun, and <a href="https://carbonhealth.com/?lng=en">Carbon Health</a>&#8216;s Eren Bali.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just say this conversation got heated — fast.</p>
<p>The main point of contention arose around defining what constitutes customer-centric healthcare and Aoun&#8217;s stance that, regardless of what else is involved in a company&#8217;s approach, starting from a point of working with insurers disqualifies a company from making any consumer-centricity claims.</p>
<p>&#8220;We keep saying that these companies are kind of consumer-centric,&#8221; Aoun said, referring to the panelists. &#8220;But in many ways I think one of the things that you realize is that when you get in bed with the insurance companies, which, whether it&#8217;s a Carbon or a Cityblock, at the end of the day, [if] you get in bed with the insurance companies, unfortunately, your incentive is basically not to go build a good consumer product.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your incentives are actually not the right thing — they&#8217;re not what the consumer needs,&#8221; he added. &#8220;So at the end of the day, you&#8217;re [referring to Eren and Carbon] launching a scheduling feature. We&#8217;re launching a heart health program that eliminates high blood pressure for 40% of our members. You&#8217;re launching a new way to bill; I&#8217;m launching cancer prevention.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ajayi took issue with the binary Aoun was trying to establish and explained why it&#8217;s actually not such a clear-cut division between working with insurers and having a real and meaningful focus on patient outcomes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adrian has said, either you get reimbursed by insurance, or you build a consumer or patient-centered company. And you know, in parentheses, that only very wealthy people can afford. What we found is actually that&#8217;s not binary; there is another path, which is partner with insurers, but take risk on the total cost of care and outcomes. So we do not bill for a community health worker coming to your home, holding your hand, telling you that you matter and helping understand what goes on in your life. But we absolutely are incentivized to do that and to innovate in that space, because that allows us to earn the right to provide healthcare to people that make them healthier.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hello and welcome back to <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/equity/id1215439780" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:Equity" data-rapid_p="7" data-v9y="1">Equity</a>, TechCrunch’s venture-capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines.</p>
<p>Today we got the gang together &#8212; <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://twitter.com/nmasc_" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:Natasha" data-rapid_p="8" data-v9y="1">Natasha</a> and <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://twitter.com/dannycrichton" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:Danny" data-rapid_p="9" data-v9y="1">Danny</a> and <a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="http://twitter.com/alex" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-ylk="slk:Alex" data-rapid_p="10" data-v9y="1">Alex</a> &#8212; to chat about the most recent IPOs in tech-land, namely debuts from Freshworks and Toast.</p>
<p>TechCrunch has covered their pair of firms somewhat closely during their IPO run, as they each have some notable characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Freshworks&#8217; IPO provided a fresh window into how public market investors are willing to value growth-oriented software companies out the gate. The news is good. Which means that we could see more unicorns looking to list in coming months.</li>
<li>Toast&#8217;s IPO provided a lens by which we could gauge public-market sentiment for hybrid software-and-payments companies. The answer? That the stock market is pretty dang enthused about the companies in question.</li>
</ul>
<p>So it&#8217;s a good news day for unicorns, for tech startups, and for Boston, a city that Danny has many thoughts about. Please send him your complaints, and not the show. We take no responsibility.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Disrupt week, so we&#8217;ll have more in a few days but until then we&#8217;ll see you at the event!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The fervor around Dogecoin delivered big revenues for stock-trading app Robinhood, and the company announced Wednesday that it&#8217;s wandering deeper down the crypto rabbit hole, sharing that it will soon begin testing crypto wallets for its users.</p>
<p>The crypto wallets, which Robinhood says it will begin rolling out next month over time to users on its <a href="https://www.wenwallets.com/">waitlist</a>, will allow users to trade, send and receive crypto tokens inside the app. The update brings Robinhood an oft-requested feature for crypto users, and brings the app deeper into the crypto ecosystem. Users had previously been able to buy and sell a few cryptocurrencies including Dogecoin and Bitcoin, but had been unable to send those coins to external wallets or receive them from elsewhere.</p>
<p>The move will open Robinhood up to many of the opportunities in the crypto space that rivals like Coinbase have been able to capitalize on. It simultaneously pushed the company into an area with even more regulatory obscurity. This week, Coinbase <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/following-sec-lawsuit-threat-coinbase-cancels-launch-of-lend-product/">abandoned</a> a long-planned lending product after the SEC threatened to sue the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket Lab long ago graduated from underdog launch provider to industry heavyweight (with funding to match). Now the company is planning to go to the moon, Mars and Venus in the next decade. But it may come as a surprise that the company planned to go beyond Earth&#8217;s orbit from the very beginning, as founder Peter Beck explained at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021. In fact, it was in plain sight the whole time.</p>
<p>Beck explained with a touching anecdote that his own ambition to explore and learn from space goes back to his youth. &#8220;You know, the earliest childhood memory I have is standing outside in the bottom of the South Island, a little town in New Zealand called Invercargill, on a cold winter&#8217;s night looking at a crystal clear sky with my father,&#8221; he recalled. &#8220;He was pointing out to me that all the stars in the sky have planets on them, and perhaps on one of those planets, that could be somebody looking back and asking the same questions that I was asking.</p>
<p>&#8220;That really was the point in time where I decided that space was the thing that I was going to do. That memory stuck with me, you know, forever. I always felt that, if I could have the opportunity to go out into those stars and explore and perhaps ask or answer, one of the biggest questions in mankind&#8217;s history — &#8216;Are we the only life in the universe or not?&#8217; — I would take that chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, many of us as children had aspirations to become astronauts and intrepid space explorers, but he put in the work, and has been &#8220;tremendously fortunate,&#8221; as well, he noted.</p>
<p>But more to the point, he said that the plan to go from low-lift rides to orbit to designing spacecraft and interplanetary missions has been part of the company all along.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Qikfox isn’t your average browser. Not only has it been built to protect consumers from the proliferation of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/scams/">online scams</a>, but it&#8217;s also on a mission to democratize content publishing and bring it to the masses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>Qikfox, which has already raised seed capital from longtime venture investor Tim Draper and is exhibiting at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021/startup-alley/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Startup Alley</a> this week, first started life as a browser extension. It has since morphed into a full-fledged premium <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/browser/">browser</a> that comes complete with its own search engine, built-in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/antivirus/">antivirus</a> and the “world’s first” browser-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/decentralized/">decentralized</a> identity system.</p>
<p>“The motivation behind the product was that internet browsers are not taking ownership of what they are serving the consumers,” Tarun Gaur, founder and CEO of Qikfox told TechCrunch. “They are hosting a buffet of 4 billion web pages, and the internet was not conceived for this deluge of content.</p>
<p>“Other internet browsers are focused on either the developer or primarily on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/privacy/">privacy</a>. However, you cannot solve privacy if you don’t first solve safety and security.”</p>
<p>The idea for Qikfox came after Gaur’s tech-savvy mother fell victim to an online scam after clicking on a fake advertisement hosted on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/google/">Google</a>. To ensure the growing boomer population doesn’t follow suit, Qikfox employs 78 different signals that are able to ascertain if online businesses are legitimate.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“Our browser is able to identify these websites and blocks you from accessing them,” Gaur says. “It’s almost impossible for a consumer to get scammed.”</p>
<p>This, combined with its built-in antivirus system that not only scans and protects the browser but also the users’ entire system, makes Qikfox the safest browser on the market, according to Gaur. “Benchmarks show that we completely beat our competitors hands-down on privacy and security,&#8221; he claims.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Gaur, who previously founded Tringapps, a mobile and cloud-first turnkey software consulting company, doesn’t want to stop there. He’s also developing an advanced feature that will flag counterfeit products on e-commerce websites such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/amazon/">Amazon</a>, and even plans to turn Qikfox into a full-fledged operating system.</p>
<p>However, his ultimate mission is to make the web more participatory and democratic through the use of zero-code content publishing and universally discoverable handles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>“There have been many attempts to build a decentralized internet but these have all failed. Not because the technology isn’t there, but because nobody knew how to control spam,&#8221; Gaur said. “So we built a very disruptive IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) kind of technology that goes far beyond what IPFS and decentralized internet technologies do today. It completely eliminates the need for domain name systems.”</p>
<p>Gaur, in a bid to reduce the entry barrier for non-tech consumers to participate in the digital economy, has developed Smart Stacks, a zero-code content publishing platform that makes content universally discoverable.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>“We want to create a decentralized replacement for whatever Google is doing today with the cloud,” Gaur added.</p>
<p>Qikfox, which costs $180 per year, is currently available on an invite-only basis in North America, has so far amassed more than 4,000 subscriptions. Gaur plans to bring the browser to the U.K. and Europe in the next 90 days.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[What will an AI-infused world look like in 20 years? Sinovation founder and AI thought leader Kai-Fu Lee and breakout sci-fi author Chen Qiufan (aka Stanley Chen) make an educated guess in "AI 2041."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Where will today&#8217;s technologies lead us over the next 20 years, and what will an AI-infused world look like across the globe? Sinovation founder and AI thought leader Kai-Fu Lee and breakout sci-fi author Chen Qiufan (aka Stanley Chen) make an educated guess in <a href="https://www.ai2041.com/">&#8220;AI 2041: Ten Visions for Our Future&#8221;</a> a set of 10 stories and 10 essays exploring and explaining the potential and pitfalls of AI.</p>
<p>After reading the book — I&#8217;ll be publishing a review shortly and TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/the-next-healthcare-revolution-will-have-ai-at-its-center/">recently posted an excerpt</a> — I talked with Lee and Chen at TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 about how the collaboration came about, how their points of view coincided and differed, and why they think the future will be how they describe it.</p>
<p><em>(Quotes have been lightly edited for clarity.)</em></p>
<p>Lee and Chen found each other a few years ago — one a successful thought leader and entrepreneur in AI, the other an author whose incisive depictions of near-future dilemmas earned him international acclaim. They decided to collaborate on a hybrid work that would have narratives born out of informed speculation and expository pieces illustrated by narrative.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2207109" style="width: 308px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AI_currency.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2207109" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-full wp-image-2207109" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AI_currency.jpeg" alt="" width="298" height="450" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AI_currency.jpeg 298w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AI_currency.jpeg?resize=99,150 99w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AI_currency.jpeg?resize=199,300 199w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AI_currency.jpeg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2207109" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Currency | Random House</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really to tell the whole story of AI, because AI is so important. Everyone should know more about it, but it&#8217;s also a little bit intimidating because it sounds technical,&#8221; Lee told me. &#8220;And what better way to tell the story than by truly telling stories?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew each other briefly back in the day in Google, and I was always thinking about writing a book about future technology, based on very specific science, facts and theories,&#8221; Chen said. &#8220;But without Kai-Fu, I couldn&#8217;t do that, because I&#8217;m not the expert in the domain.&#8221;</p>
<p>The result of their collaboration is &#8220;AI 2041&#8221;: Ten stories by Chen set in the titular year, all over the world, with people from all walks of life encountering AI in the many ways that the authors think it may come to shape society over the next two decades. Each story is followed by an explanatory essay by Lee that goes into the technical aspects and why they might lead to that future.</p>
<p>The stories are independent but happen in something like a shared world, each illustrating a potential application, conflict or change in thinking that AI could lead to. Importantly, the AI is recognizable as an evolution of existing technologies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started with a framework of four things,&#8221; said Lee. &#8220;One is I wanted to cover around 15 technologies in 10 stories. I also wanted to order them so that they go from easy to hard, so it&#8217;s kind of like an AI textbook — you know, you learn it by reading stories. Then we both wanted it to be in different industries, like education and healthcare and so on, to show that AI impacts everywhere. And then lastly, Stanley wanted it to be in 10 different countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Take for example the story &#8220;Gods Behind the Masks.&#8221; It concerns a talented deepfake creator working out of Lagos who knows the ins and outs of generative adversarial networks, image inspection, media pathways and so on. He is tasked with creating a video of a long-dead celebrity that fools not just people watching it, but the hosting service’s automated scanners, the government’s facial recognition algorithms and all the rest — but he begins to suspect there’s an unsavory motive behind it all (I won’t spoil the rest).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Facebook Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer just announced that he will stepping down from the role next year and transition to a part-time position as a &#8220;Senior Fellow&#8221; at the company. It&#8217;s one of the biggest leadership departures for Facebook in recent memory.</p>
<p>He will be replaced in the role by long-time executive Andrew Bosworth who has most recently led the company&#8217;s Facebook Reality Labs. Bosworth will continue to lead the AR/VR organization in his new role.</p>
<p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/note-from-mark-zuckerberg/">shared a note</a> on the departure in the company&#8217;s newsroom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">I want to take a moment to thank Schrep for his extraordinary contributions to our community and our company over the last 13 years. He has played a critical role in almost everything we’ve done — from building and scaling our teams to mentoring many of our key leaders, and from helping us develop new technologies like AI and VR to operating our infrastructure and business services at global scale. Schrep and I have had a close partnership over the years, and in addition to being a great leader, he’s also a great person and a close friend. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Schroepfer joined the company in August of 2008, according to his LinkedIn, a time when Facebook was riding high on a $15 billion valuation but was soon to encounter a harsher investment environment during the recession that led it to raise a series of down rounds. The company went on to have the biggest technology IPO in history and is currently trading at a market cap just south of $1 trillion.</p>
<p>The road to riches has left Facebook with plenty of tech challenges that have led to more than a handful of controversies. Schroepfer&#8217;s lengthy tenure has been most notably marked by Facebook&#8217;s embrace of artificial intelligence and the algorithmic news feed that promotes content to users based on what Facebook believes will interest the user the most. The company also relies heavily on artificial intelligence for tasks like content moderation. The company&#8217;s reliance on algorithmic promotion and data collection have been controversial, to say the least, at times.</p>

<p>Schroepfer&#8217;s exit from Zuckerberg&#8217;s inner circle is an important moment for the company. Though Facebook has seen a handful of high-profile exits in recent years, including Facebook app chief Fidji Simo, ad boss Carolyn Everson, Chief Revenue Officer David Fischer and VR head Hugo Barra, none have been as close to the CEO as Schroepfer.</p>

<p>Bosworth, who joined Facebook in January of 2006, has been one of the company&#8217;s more vocal executives, sharing, at times, controversial opinions about the company and technology industry at large. He has previously led the company&#8217;s hardware divisions and ad divisions, most recently helming AR/VR operating, which Facebook has long promoted as a major pillar for the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a difficult decision because of how much I love Facebook and how excited I am about the future we are building together,&#8221; Schroepfer wrote in a<a href="https://www.facebook.com/schrep/posts/10159715842464443"> Facebook post</a>. &#8220;This change in role will allow me to dedicate more time to my family and my personal philanthropic efforts while staying deeply connected to the company working on key initiatives including recruiting and developing technical talent and continuing to foster our AI investments in critical technologies like PyTorch.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you&#8217;ve never struggled to click the correct one of three different download buttons on one of those &#8220;YouTube to mp4&#8221; websites, well, haven&#8217;t you led an honorable internet life! But now, YouTube is testing a feature for Premium subscribers that might render those bootleg websites somewhat obsolete.</p>
<p>From now through October 19, Premium users can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/new">test a feature</a> that lets them download videos from their browser. This test, which brings an existing mobile feature to the web, is part of an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/youtube-premium-subscribers-get-a-new-perk-with-launch-of-testing-program/">ongoing program</a> that allows Premium users to test out what the platform is working on.</p>
<p>Videos will be downloadable by default for Premium users &#8212; uploaders don&#8217;t need to opt-in. Subscribers with access to the latest versions of Chrome, Edge or Opera browsers can click a &#8220;Download&#8221; button while watching a video, or click a 3-dot menu while browsing. Then, users will be able to access their downloaded videos on a downloads feed, which is also accessible via sidebar navigation.</p>

<p>Unlike those third-party sites, YouTube won&#8217;t give you a video file to store on your hard drive forever.</p>
<p>Instead, YouTube tells TechCrunch, the viewer gains access to a cached version of the video &#8212; it&#8217;s like downloading a Netflix show to watch offline while you&#8217;re on a plane. Users can view their downloaded videos by navigating to the YouTube website while they&#8217;re offline. Then, they will see text showing that they are offline, which will take them to a new page showing the videos they&#8217;ve downloaded.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The feature also works on YouTube&#8217;s <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/24/youtube-install-pwa/">Progressive Web App</a> (PWA). Downloaded YouTube videos will remain available as long as the user&#8217;s device connects to the internet at least once every 30 days.</p>
<p>The feature was first spotted by <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/09/22/youtube-gets-official-video-downloads-on-the-web-saving-you-from-using-some-very-sketchy-sites/">Android Police</a>, which noticed the changes to the YouTube.com/new website. YouTube declined to say if and when it may have more officially communicated the test to its users, but typically, Premium members can browse the available experiments as a perk that comes with a YouTube Premium subscription.</p>
