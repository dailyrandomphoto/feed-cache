										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Volkswagen, once a dabbler in electric vehicles, is now betting its future on the technology. And the new Volkswagen ID.4 — a five-passenger, fully-electric crossover with a starting price of $33,995 (before federal or state incentives) — is its first global effort to make EVs a mainstream product and part of its larger goal to become carbon neutral by 2050.</p>
<p>The upshot: The VW ID.4 offers a balanced blend of technology, comfort and design for a more affordable price and seeks to capture some of the market left vacant by the lack of an affordable Tesla Model Y. The VW ID.4 offers solid technology without being so out-of-this-world that your average crossover buyer will balk with one exception. The lack of seamless charging makes finding and then connecting to a third-party charging station a clunky, even complex experience.</p>
<p>As Mark Gillies, Senior Manager of Product at VW said during our interview, “We want to be the company that builds electric cars for the millions, not just for the millionaires.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While that may be true, there are a few niggling concerns like a somewhat laggy infotainment system that should improve with updates coming soon, and the previously mentioned miss of seamless charging. If Volkswagen can address those problems, the VW ID.4 could take a solid bite out of the booming crossover market. But will the masses flock to a fully-electric future that delivers a near-to-gasoline driving experience and become the “car for the millions?”</p>

<p>The 2021 Volkswagen ID.4 crossover might be the first global, dedicated all-electric vehicle from the VW brand, but it&#8217;s not the first consumer-available electric vehicle from the VW Group as a whole. It launched the California-only Volkswagen e-Golf back in 2013 (discontinued last year), and the company’s luxury performance brand Porsche began sales of its all-electric Taycan in 2019.</p>
<p>When it launched, e-Golf represented more of a fringe case for the company. It was targeted specifically at the California market, where incentives for electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, as well as environmental regulations, are more robust. The ID.4, in contrast, represents one of the “most important Volkswagen debuts since the Beetle,” and it will be available across the country.</p>
<h2>The tech that stands out</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2124302" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-small-12261-2021ID.4.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124302" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2124302 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-small-12261-2021ID.4.jpg" alt="volkswagen id 4 crossover electric" width="1500" height="1000" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-small-12261-2021ID.4.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-small-12261-2021ID.4.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-small-12261-2021ID.4.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-small-12261-2021ID.4.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-small-12261-2021ID.4.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-small-12261-2021ID.4.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2124302" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Volkswagen</p></div></p>
<p>Rather than try to fit a gasoline-shaped peg into an electric-shaped hole, Volkswagen appears to have taken a page from Tesla’s book in its approach to the dash layout and cabin feel in the ID.4.</p>
<p>The interior design of the ID.4 feels like a glimpse of a self-driving future as you could visualize a day when both the steering column and even the infotainment system could simply be deleted. Even the center console, complete with modular cupholders, cubbies and NFC charging pad could eventually be modified to create more passenger space, making the interior of the ID.4. feel even more open and airy than it already does.</p>
<p>The ID.4 launches with three trims: the Pro, Pro S and 1st Edition. The Pro comes with a 10-inch touchscreen. The Pro S and 1st Edition trims come with a 12-inch infotainment touchscreen mounted at the center of the dashboard.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VW-ID4-TechCrunch-3.jpg"><img class="breakout wp-image-2124255 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VW-ID4-TechCrunch-3.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>As you reach towards the center screen, the icons respond thanks to an in-cabin camera that tracks hand motion towards the system. There are very few hard-touch buttons inside the ID.4, and those that do exist are more like medical-grade haptic buttons used to control everything from climate and audio to the opening and closing of the shade on the optional panoramic fixed-glass roof and even driving modes and driver assistance features. They take a little getting used to, but once familiar they tend to work like slider buttons, allowing you to adjust volume or temperature with slight pressure changes and small slides from left to right.</p>
<h2><b>Hello I.D.</b></h2>
<p>Instead of buttons, Volkswagen has decided to leverage hands-free voice control in the new ID.4, but during our time with the vehicle, the system felt like it was still in beta.</p>
<p>Both driver and passenger use the touchscreen or specific voice commands to many of the common features and infotainment of the ID.4.  Say “Hello I.D.” and a light strip along the base of the windshield lights up based on which side of the vehicle the voice came from (passenger or driver), indicating that it’s ready to receive the command you say next.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VW-ID4-TechCrunch-26.jpg"><img class="breakout wp-image-2124273 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VW-ID4-TechCrunch-26.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Commands are rather limited at this time and must be initiated by either saying the key phrase (“Hello I.D.”) or pushing the voice control button located on the steering wheel. You can say basic things like navigation commands but you can also say things like “I’m cold,” or “tell me a joke,” and the ID.4 system will respond by raising the temperature on that side of the car, or telling a seatbelt joke.</p>
<p>During the test drive, the response time from the system was very slow compared to other voice systems on the market, and it struggled to find connectivity to do things like change a Sirius XM channel, (repeatedly saying that it couldn’t find a specific channel number or name) even though my test drive didn’t stray beyond the bounds of Los Angeles and Long Beach. It also failed more often than naught, taking around ten seconds or more to finally cancel out of the voice control systems when it either couldn’t understand the command or it couldn’t get connectivity.</p>
<h2><b>Laggy nav</b></h2>
<p>The navigation system in the ID.4 was also a bit laggy and imprecise, which meant I reverted to using Google maps and the wireless Android Auto system (included along with Apple CarPlay throughout the ID.4 lineup) to get directions. One neat feature of the ID.4’s on-board navigation system, however, is that the light strip along the windshield illuminates on either side of the vehicle as you approach a turn to indicate which direction you should go.</p>
<p>The infotainment screen looks just like your phone or tablet screen: Swipe through the pages of apps or various windows to get to the page you want. Unfortunately, the combination of a laggy connection to the network (despite having three to five bars of 4G connectivity according to the infotainment system), and a laggy load time, the screens would occasionally freeze while swiping between pages, showing half of one page while still loading the next.</p>
<p>As a caveat: I was lucky enough to get three separate opportunities to spend extended time in different ID.4s in the Los Angeles press fleet and only experienced the lag/freeze with one of the vehicles, however. Volkswagen PR says that the software in the test vehicles is not the final version that customers will receive and it will be updated before getting to owners, which should solve for the strange stuttering and voice command issues that I experienced.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VW-ID4-TechCrunch-21.jpg"><img class="breakout wp-image-2124270 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VW-ID4-TechCrunch-21.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>The ID.4 will also get Alexa capability later this year through their Car-Net service which includes an app that can help you monitor your vehicle from afar. The app is simple enough to use: Owners login and can see the location, charge level, and status of their ID.4.</p>
<p>VW made a multitude of interesting design choices inside the ID.4 including the placement of the main instrument panel and the transmission selector. Rather than attaching these items to the dash or center console like you’d find in a typical vehicle, they’re attached directly to the steering column. When you move the steering wheel, the instrument panel and transmission rocker move with it. Volkswagen uses a 5.3-inch screen attached to the steering wheel to provide information about everything from speed and direction of travel to range, trip, and basic navigation information. You use a rhombus-shaped rocker at the right side of the steering wheel to toggle through driving modes rather than a standard button or shift lever.</p>
<p>There’s a start/stop button located in a rather hidden spot on the right side of the column to start the ID.4, but it’s largely superfluous. When you unlock the vehicle and sit in the driver’s seat, the ID.4 powers on and is ready to drive. When you unlatch your seatbelt and climb out, the ID.4 powers down. That makes things a bit complicated if you have friends or family in the vehicle while you dash into a place to run an errand, but the ID.4 allows passengers to keep things like the AC and heat going for a short period of time by using controls that appear on the infotainment screen, even if the driver isn’t in the vehicle.</p>

<h2>Converting drivers to EVs</h2>
<p>Volkswagen says that its research has shown that roughly 30% of crossover owners would consider an electric crossover. There’s no denying that the ID.4 enters a crowded crossover market complete with extremely popular gasoline and hybrid competitors like the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V. Volkswagen says that, based on its research, consumers shouldn’t feel any range anxiety since most crossover owners drive <a href="https://www.vwprevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-ID.4-Presentation.pdf">around 60 miles per day</a> and the battery system offers an EPA-estimated 250 miles of range. You can charge the ID.4 from 5% to 80% in 38 minutes at a 125 kW.</p>
<p>A full charge at home is estimated to take around 7.5 hours but, if you’re out and about, Volkswagen is offering free, unlimited charging at DC fast chargers by Electrify America at no additional cost for the first three years of ID.4 ownership, which sounds great, but comes with some caveats. VW says that it expects most people to charge overnight on typical residential power, and it’s clear that the company doesn’t expect owners to use public chargers all that frequently because the process of locating an available charger is not seamless, at least not at the ID.4’s launch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124316" style="width: 1510px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12222-ElectrifyAmericaandVolkswagenofAmericaannounceagreementprovidingunlimitedchargingplanforownersoftheall-new2021ID.4electricSUV.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124316" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2124316 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12222-ElectrifyAmericaandVolkswagenofAmericaannounceagreementprovidingunlimitedchargingplanforownersoftheall-new2021ID.4electricSUV.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="843" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12222-ElectrifyAmericaandVolkswagenofAmericaannounceagreementprovidingunlimitedchargingplanforownersoftheall-new2021ID.4electricSUV.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12222-ElectrifyAmericaandVolkswagenofAmericaannounceagreementprovidingunlimitedchargingplanforownersoftheall-new2021ID.4electricSUV.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12222-ElectrifyAmericaandVolkswagenofAmericaannounceagreementprovidingunlimitedchargingplanforownersoftheall-new2021ID.4electricSUV.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12222-ElectrifyAmericaandVolkswagenofAmericaannounceagreementprovidingunlimitedchargingplanforownersoftheall-new2021ID.4electricSUV.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12222-ElectrifyAmericaandVolkswagenofAmericaannounceagreementprovidingunlimitedchargingplanforownersoftheall-new2021ID.4electricSUV.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12222-ElectrifyAmericaandVolkswagenofAmericaannounceagreementprovidingunlimitedchargingplanforownersoftheall-new2021ID.4electricSUV.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2124316" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Volkswagen</p></div></p>
<p>Electrify America is a subsidiary of VW, yet they operate completely separately from Volkswagen. The company operates 550 charging stations and more than 2,400 DC fast chargers, across the country.  You can search for “charging stations,” through the on-board nav but the system brings up all charging stations in the vicinity and doesn’t show which are online and available and which ones are not. In order to find specific Electrify America chargers, owners have to pull out their phones and open the Electrify America app to see which stations are online and available. You can then send the location of a specific charger to AndroidAuto or Apple CarPlay to navigate. Unfortunately, at this point, the Electrify America app does not show up in Android Auto.</p>
<p>This process is rather clunky and would require owners to pull over and park to safely complete it before heading to the charging station&#8211;at least at this point in time. Volkswagen says that an over-the-air update coming later this year will further integrate Electrify America stations into the on-board nav in a more seamless way.</p>
<p>The good news is that the EPA-estimated fuel economy equivalent for the Pro S and 1st Edition models is 104 MPGe for city driving, while highway driving is rated at 89 MPGe, for a combined city/highway rating of 97 MPGe.</p>
<p>One of the striking features of the ID.4 is how it drives. Transmission modes on the ID.4 include a B or brake mode&#8211;a common and exceedingly convenient setting that allows for one-pedal driving on electric vehicles. Take your foot off the brake and the ID.4 slows slightly, regenerating electricity and sending it back into the battery. It’s a great feature in stop-and-go traffic and Volkswagen intentionally tuned the one-pedal driving to be less aggressive than those in other electric vehicles, with the aim of making the feel more familiar for first-time electric vehicle owners.</p>
<p>On the road, the ID.4 feels well planted and not nearly as large as it looks. It’s nimble but not exactly quick off the line (VW has not released 0-60 mph times) though it doesn’t leave you sweating to make a short merge. It’s certainly no tire-smoker or rocketship, however.</p>
<p>Since it’s a rather bulbous shape, there is some very minor wind noise at speed on the road, but the ride is comfortable and confident. At speeds below 20 miles an hour (and when you put it into reverse), it does make that characteristic electric car sound to alert pedestrians. It’s not noticeable inside the cabin when the windows are raised, but pass a neighbor who is working on a car in his garage, and you’ll be sure to arrive home to a text asking if that was you driving around in the car that sounds like a spaceship.</p>
<h2>ADAS form &amp; function</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VW-ID4-TechCrunch-23.jpg"><img class="breakout wp-image-2124271 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/VW-ID4-TechCrunch-23.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>VW’s Travel Assist is the branded name for the company’s Level 2 autonomous driving system, which works at speeds that range from 0-95 mph. Travel Assist uses both the adaptive cruise control and the lane-keeping systems to follow the road and other vehicles ahead. When a motorcycle suddenly hops into your lane, the instrument screen shows an image of a motorcycle directly in front of the vehicle. If said motorcycle decides to randomly slam on the brakes, the ID.4 responds and brakes automatically. If traffic comes to a stop ahead, the ID.4 Travel Assist waits until traffic moves again. It approximates a human response to traffic motion very well&#8211;neither waiting inordinately long and leaving huge gaps (which causes rubberbanding in traffic) nor accelerating aggressively.</p>
<p>The system makes long stints in heinous traffic bearable. I spent an hour commuting on the dreaded 405 freeway in Los Angeles during rush hour and only had to keep my hands lightly on the capacitive steering wheel to keep the system engaged.</p>
<h2>The skateboard powertrain</h2>
<p>The VW ID.4 is built on a new skateboard architecture called MEB or modular electric drive matrix, with an AC permanent-magnet synchronous motor that makes 201 horsepower and 229 lb-ft of torque mounted at the back of the vehicle, above the rear axle&#8211;much like the old Beetle. At launch, VW is only offering a rear-wheel-drive version, but an all-wheel-drive version will be available by the end of the year, offering 302 horsepower.<br />
Volkswagen is purchasing batteries from Panasonic for the ID.4 and assembling the 82-kWh, 12-module, 288-pouch-cell battery packs themselves at plants in China and Germany. There are plans to begin production in the U.S. soon. Volkswagen also builds its own electric motors.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12234-2021ID.4-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="breakout alignnone wp-image-2124299 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12234-2021ID.4-2.jpg" alt="" width="1500" height="843" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12234-2021ID.4-2.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12234-2021ID.4-2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12234-2021ID.4-2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12234-2021ID.4-2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12234-2021ID.4-2.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/vw-Small-12234-2021ID.4-2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></a></p>
<p>All in, the VW ID.4 makes electric vehicles more attainable for the crossover buying public who can’t afford the high price tags for the other luxury all-electric crossovers like a Jaguar I-Pace, Tesla Model Y, Polestar or Audi E-tron.</p>
<p>Yet it also competes well with popular gasoline-powered crossovers like the Honda CR-V and the Toyota RAV4, especially when you add in the potential for as much as $7500 in rebates. Where the VW ID.4 truly stands out is in its blending of advanced technology and affordability in a good-looking EV, that won’t give you range anxiety. Will it be the “car for the millions?” We’ll have to wait and find out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Gather helps people, well, gather in virtual spaces for any reason, whether it be for weddings, magic conventions, or, just a regular day at work. Over the past few months, as remote workers look for better ways to interact with each other, the startup has quietly amassed more than 4 million users, and today, an investment from the same elite Silicon Valley firm that has backed Zoom and Slack.</p>
<p>Gather CEO Phillip Wang tells TechCrunch that his startup has raised $26 million in a Series A round led by Sequoia Capital. Other investors include Index, YC Continuity and angels including Dylan Field, Jeff Weiner and Kevin Hartz.</p>
<p>Wang says his goal for the startup, which he began with friends after they all graduated from Carnegie Mellon, is simple: Focus on serving its most consistent users, bring in customization elements to make virtual spaces feel homey and hire a lot of engineers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>“We’re a much broader communication platform that is going to be used across all things, but we are leaning heavily into the virtual HQ [use case],” Wang said. The 37-person team has embedded features to promote spontaneity, such as “shoulder taps” to prompt a co-worker to chat, or pool tables where employees can circle around and start a virtual game of pool.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124265" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124265" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2124265 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png" alt="" width="1024" height="603" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png 1574w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png?resize=150,88 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png?resize=300,177 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png?resize=768,452 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png?resize=680,400 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png?resize=1536,905 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Gather-office.png?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2124265" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gather</p></div></p>
<p>The platform also uses spatial audio technology, which is popular in video games, so that users can get the feel of running into each other. The technology basically allows you to hear someone’s voice louder when you are near them, and softer as you walk away. Wang says that it built its own video-conferencing system from scratch because other solutions didn’t work well with spatial technology.</p>
<p>Wang wouldn’t point to any challenges within the company, but instead said that every startup has bugs it has to deal with. No (virtual) fires yet.</p>
<p>Gather is working on helping its users add in more customization to its platform so it&#8217;s easier for users to recreate their office space or apartments in real life. The office tour included seeing a corgi on the desk, jack-o&#8217;-lanterns and this reporter even added some floor plants to the setup.</p>
<p>Even though work is Gather’s current focus, a majority of its current monthly revenue, which hovers around $400,000, is coming from one-off events. The end goal, says Wang, is a world where someone can leave their Gather office and enter a Gather bar. If the company can successfully get remote teams to join its platform, it can then help those same teams have off-sites, team-building activities or networking events under its platform.</p>
<p>One of the challenges of building a community platform is figuring out monetization without extracting value. This is one of the reasons that Wang, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/virtual-hqs-race-to-win-over-a-remote-work-fatigued-market/">when I first talked to him in November</a>, always wanted to avoid venture capital money (because the incentives might rush the platform into pursuing business models that weren’t user-friendly).</p>

<p>Months later, Wang said his mind changed when he met with Sequoia Capital’s Shaun Maguire and saw an opportunity to scale the metaverse with venture dollars.</p>
<p>“Sequoia in particular helped Unity, the game engine company, figure out their business model and [that model] is unorthodox,” he said. “I&#8217;ve always looked at them [thinking] it would be great if we could do something like that.”</p>
<p>As for if Gather is simply a pandemic phenomenon, Maguire says that him and the Sequoia team believes that “work-from-anywhere is here to stay.”</p>
<p>“Phillip and [his] team’s motivations to create Gather precede the pandemic,” he said. “They realized that certain constraints in the physical world hinder your ability to stay connected with people outside of your immediate community — this was merely intensified during the pandemic.”</p>
<p>It’s true: Gather has been in the works for more than 18 months, since Wang and his friends graduated college. The team first tried to create custom wearables that would show you who was available to talk so you could tap into a conversation. When that didn’t work, they pivoted into apps, VR and full-body robotics. With new capital and millions of users, perhaps &#8220;Sims for enterprise&#8221; might be the route to go.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The alternative asset market showed promise pre-pandemic but amid a broader rally among traditional asset classes, the number of investors searching for and promoting value in the space has exploded. That has, in turn, promoted a pretty major influx of VC dollars into startups building platforms that wrangle these buyers into specific communities.</p>
<p>Enter, <a href="https://www.onlyalt.com/">Alt</a>. The young startup has received more than $31 million from top investors intrigued by the particularly hot space it has bulked up its expertise in &#8212; physical sports trading cards. The company provides a Goat-like marketplace for the cards, authenticating the transactions and providing buyers with the peace of mind that the slice of cardboard they&#8217;re dropping several thousands of dollars on is no fake. While entities like NBA Top Shot have rallied a new generation of buyers around blockchain era digital trading cards, its success has been enabled by the excitement that traditional collectibles markets have been garnering recently.</p>
<p>After years of stocking up on sports trading cards, Alt CEO Leore Avidar is just happy to have more people to talk about his obsession with. Like many in the sports card community, Avidar has spent years collecting cards and engaging with forums online, but it&#8217;s been an interest he hasn&#8217;t been able to share with friends and family given its somewhat fringe appeal. This isn&#8217;t the case today, Avidar says, with old collectors re-entering the market as they dust off aged collections and new collectors intrigued by skyrocketing prices and a more connected online community.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve talked with a lot of people in the community and one of the things I love is how intergenerational this is, I see a lot of like kids and their parents doing this together,&#8221; Avidar tells TechCrunch.</p>
<p>As the market has moved more mainstream, platforms like Alt have also begun seeing more investor interest. In the span of a few months, Alt wrapped a pair of funding rounds from investors hungry to embrace a play in the market &#8212; a seed round led by First Round and a Series A led by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian&#8217;s new firm Seven Seven Six. Other Alt investors include John and Patrick Collison, Kevin Durant, SV Angel, BoxGroup, Sue Wagner, and Jeff Morris&#8217;s Chapter One.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2124275" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Portfolio-View.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="460" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Portfolio-View.png 1266w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Portfolio-View.png?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Portfolio-View.png?resize=300,203 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Portfolio-View.png?resize=768,519 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Portfolio-View.png?resize=680,460 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Portfolio-View.png?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></p>
<p>Avidar wants Alt&#8217;s platform to increase transparency and liquidity in the alternative assets space and make acquiring assets here just as easy as platforms like Robinhood have made buying and selling stocks. Avidar&#8217;s central strategy to capturing this market and bringing it to his platform is by significantly undercutting the fees structure of other sites, with Alt charging 1.5% of the total sales price including processing fees.</p>
<p>In addition to authenticating its stock, Alt has had to build some infrastructure that&#8217;s somewhat custom to the trading cards market. Users that are less concerned with holding their physical cards and more worried about them being lost or damaged over time can opt to have Alt store their physical cards in a temperature and light-controlled vault (for a fee), ensuring that physical degradations of the card don&#8217;t affect its value. One of Alt&#8217;s key features that Avidar expects to be popular with collectors is their Zestimate-like <em>Alt Value</em> rating which will give card buyers and sellers a closer idea of what the market value of their card is based on historic transactions and the trending growth metrics.</p>
<p>The team is launching the Alt market with sports trading cards, but plans to expand its reach to other alternative assets as the marketplace matures further, with Avidar highlighting markets like watches, sneakers and art as potential growth areas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Pakistan has banned TikTok again in the country after reviewing a complaint that said the popular video app hosted immoral and objectionable content.</p>
<p>A high court in the city of Peshawar on Thursday ordered the nation’s telecom authority &#8212; Pakistan Telecom Authority (PTA) &#8212; to ban TikTok.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/PTAofficialpk/status/1370044117678444544">statement</a> Thursday evening, Pakistan Telecom Authority said it was complying with the order and had “issued directions to the service providers to immediately block access to the TikTok app.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>TikTok had about 33 million users in Pakistan last month, according to mobile insight firm App Annie (data of which an industry executive shared with TechCrunch). There are about 100 million internet users in the South Asian nation.</p>
<p>The Peshawar High Court’s Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan described some videos on TikTok as “unacceptable for Pakistaini society,” and said these videos were “peddling vulgarity,” according to local media reports.</p>
<p>TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time ByteDance’s app has been banned by Pakistan. PTA had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/pakistan-lifts-ban-on-tiktok/">briefly banned TikTok</a> in the country last year, saying at the time that the Chinese social app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/09/tiktok-pakistan-ban/">hadn’t addressed concerns</a> about the nature of some videos on its platform despite warnings spanning several months.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s move follows its neighboring nation, India, also banning TikTok last year. New Delhi <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">banned TikTok</a> &#8212; and eventually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/india-retains-ban-on-tiktok-uc-browser-and-57-other-chinese-apps/">200 additional apps with links to China</a> &#8212; over cybersecurity concerns. Prior to the ban, India was the biggest international market for TikTok, which had amassed over 200 million users in the world’s second largest internet market.</p>
<p>Like India, the government in Pakistan has also sought to assume more control over content on digital services operating in the country in recent years.</p>
<p>While global tech giants, most of which count India as a key overseas market, haven’t made much fuss about New Delhi’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/india-announces-sweeping-guidelines-for-social-media-on-demand-streaming-firms-and-digital-news-outlets/">new rules for social media</a>, they banded together in Pakistan late last year and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/google-facebook-and-twitter-threaten-to-leave-pakistan-over-censorship-law/">threatened to leave the country</a> over rules proposed by Islamabad.</p>
<p>Through a group called the Asia Internet Coalition (AIC), the tech firms said in November that they were “alarmed” by the scope of Pakistan’s new law targeting internet firms.” In addition to Facebook, Google and Twitter, AIC represents Apple, Amazon, LinkedIn, SAP, Expedia Group, Yahoo, Airbnb, Grab, Rakuten, Booking.com, Line and Cloudflare.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We’re just a few weeks out from the first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/early-stage-2021-part-1/?promo=lastdayebpost">TC Early Stage 2021</a> event on April 1-2. This two-day bootcamp helps early-inning founders develop core entrepreneurial skills for startup success. We’re talking essential topics led by experts in their field.</p>
<p>Case in point. Intellectual property is your bread and butter — you need to safeguard it and understand its value from a VC’s perspective. And while you’re an early-stage founder, it’s never too early to learn the ins and outs of mergers and acquisitions because you don’t ever want to get caught flatfooted — especially if your startup takes rapid flight.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, we’ve lined up a group of heavy hitters — from <a href="https://www.perkinscoie.com/">Perkins Coie</a>, <a href="https://www.meruscap.com/">Merus Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.brainbase.com/">Brainbase</a> — to share their expertise on M&amp;A and protecting IP. Don’t miss these three interactive breakout sessions with some of the best minds in the business.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><strong>Creating and Protecting IP Value in Connection with VC Financings (<a href="https://www.perkinscoie.com/">Perkins Coie</a>)</strong></p>
<p>How do venture capital investors value formal Intellectual Property (IP) rights when deciding to fund a technology or life sciences start-up? How do they conduct IP due diligence? How do investors and founders, post-funding, ensure their start-ups pursue an IP strategy that optimizes exit valuation for all? Perkins Coie partners Michael Glenn (Patent Prosecution) and Matt Oshinsky (Emerging Companies Venture Capital) join a seasoned venture capitalist to discuss these and other questions regarding safeguarding IP rights and maximizing the value of all technology development activities. Brought to you by <a href="https://www.perkinscoie.com/">Perkins Coie</a>.</p>
<p><strong>An M&amp;A Playbook for Startup Founders &#8211; Lessons from Google &amp; Microsoft (<a href="https://www.meruscap.com/">Merus Capital</a>)</strong></p>
<p>One of the most important decisions a founding team makes is when to consider selling the company to a strategic buyer. In this session, learn how to approach acquirors, avoid common pitfalls and maximize your chances for an eye-popping valuation. Hear from Sean Dempsey, founding partner of Merus Capital, who spent 10 years leading acquisitions for Google and Microsoft, and Dave Sobota, VP of Corporate Development at Instacart, and former M&amp;A leader at Google. Brought to you by <a href="https://www.meruscap.com/">Merus Capital</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Naming &amp; Protecting Your Company’s Intellectual Property (<a href="https://www.brainbase.com/">Brainbase</a>)</strong></p>
<p>You have an idea for a game-changing product or service — what do you call it? Once you’ve picked a name, how do you make sure nobody else is using it? Is the domain and Twitter handle available? Brainbase makes it easy for anyone to file a trademark without a lawyer, and instantly own your brand across all channels. In this session, company co-founder and CEO, Nate Cavanaugh explains the importance of owning your company’s trademark — both for brand protection and for fundraising due diligence. Brought to you by <a href="https://www.brainbase.com/">Brainbase</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">So, this is going to sound like a cop out (because, honestly, it kind of is), but the through line for the past week’s robotics investments is variety. That is to say that this week’s round of funding is all over the place in terms of verticals, which is probably an overall positive sign of the health of robotics investing in general. VCs seem to be pretty bullish about automation across a variety of different sectors.</p>
<p>Medical continues to be a biggie. What’s wild about surgical robots is how long they’ve actually been in practice. The earliest date back to the mid-80s, for things like orthopedic surgeries. As for more mainstream usage, Intuitive’s da Vinci has been around for more than 20 years. At last count, there were somewhere in the neighborhood of 5,000 of these devices deployed worldwide.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2122584" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2122584" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2122584" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/unnamed-23.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="631" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/unnamed-23.jpg 4341w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/unnamed-23.jpg?resize=150,92 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/unnamed-23.jpg?resize=300,185 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/unnamed-23.jpg?resize=768,473 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/unnamed-23.jpg?resize=680,419 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/unnamed-23.jpg?resize=1536,946 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/unnamed-23.jpg?resize=2048,1261 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/unnamed-23.jpg?resize=50,31 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2122584" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> ForSight Robotics</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Fittingly, Intuitive co-founder Frederic Moll is among the new advisers <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/eye-surgery-robotics-startup-forsight-raises-10m/">for ForSight Robotics</a>. The Israeli startup just raised $10 million in what it calls a “mega-seed round” for its eye surgery platform. Ophthalmological procedures, for what should be obvious reasons, have even less room for error than most surgeries.</p>
<p>The company says it can “democratize” the difficult procedure across different geographies – particularly those where access to professionals may be lacking. Per numbers from the British Journal of Ophthalmology, there are around 3.7 qualified surgeons per million citizens in developing countries. The hope is that getting machines like these in more medical facilities could help level the playing field to some degree.</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/how-rani-therapeutics-robotic-pill-could-change-subcutaneous-injection-treament/">Here’s an interesting piece on Rani Therapeutics</a>. Robotic pills are an interesting idea that has been floating around research facilities for a long time (MIT, in particular, has been pretty big on it), and it’s great to see someone take steps toward commercializing the concept. Specifically, the company’s product is designed to deliver subcutaneous injections to the small intestine.</p>
<p>Speaking of bringing concepts into practice, one of the more interesting things about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/nimble-robotics-scores-50m-for-its-fulfillment-automation-tech/">Nimble Robotics</a> is the speed with which they’ve deployed into the real world. The company is earning that name – and, apparently, that $50 million Series A raise. It’s also enlisted big names like Fei-Fei Li and Sebastian Thrun as advisors. The company builds on the deep imitation learning concept to deliver adaptable pick-and-place fulfillment robots.</p>
<p>“We’re not the first robotic pick, place-and-pack company that’s out there. We’ve grown really fast and have a lot of robots deployed in production,” the CEO told me this week. “A lot of people have show robots in the corner of a warehouse. Right now, we have heaps of robots deployed, and we’re growing really quickly. These are robots that are in production and picking tens of thousands of real orders every single day for each of our customers.”</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/11/ocean-floor-mapping-robotics-startup-bedrock-announces-an-8m-raise/">Bedrock Ocean Exploration’s $8 million raise</a> isn’t huge by comparison, but there’s plenty of growth potential here. There’s a reason, after all, that Shell ran an underwater exploration XPrize not all that long ago. Launched by Nautilus Labs cofounder Anthony DiMare, the company is deploying advanced underwater robotics to survey the ocean floor for a variety of different applications, from wind farms to laying intercontinental cables.</p>

<p>A couple of last-mile delivery robotics co’s warrant mention this week. I <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/last-mile-delivery-robotics-company-refraction-ai-raises-4-2m/">wrote about Refraction.AI</a>, which debuted on our Mobility stage a few years back. The last-mile delivery company built its robot on a bicycle frame, making an ideal form factor for cruising around in bike lines. The Ann Arbor startup just raised $4.2 million and is planning to expand to additional markets.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2121617" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2121617" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2121617" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png" alt="Safeway Tortoise" width="1024" height="653" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png 1060w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=768,490 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Safeway-Tortoise.png?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2121617" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tortoise/Albertsons</p></div></p>
<p>Bay Area startup, Tortoise, meanwhile, just got a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/albertsons-taps-tortoise-for-remote-controlled-grocery-delivery-robots/">nice viability boost from Albertsons</a>. The grocery mega-conglomerate plans to pilot the company’s robots in a couple of NorCal Safeway stores. If that goes well, the delivery carts will be arriving in even more West Coast locations.</p>
<p>On the other side of the food chain<a href="https://www.therobotreport.com/strawbot-follows-harvesters-to-improve-strawberry-picking-productivity/"> is Strawbot</a>, another in a long list of agtech robotics that has been popping up in recent years. The company says it can offer farmers a labor cost savings of up to one-third by following pickers around. It’s a different take on strawberry crops <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/02/traptic-uses-3d-vision-and-robotic-arms-to-harvest-ripe-strawberries/">that Traptic offers</a>. And while it doesn’t actually do the picking, the company certainly wins the name game.</p>

<p>One quick mention of Anki &#8212; er, Digital Dream Labs, I guess &#8212; before we go. The Pittsburgh-based edtech company bought Anki’s IP after the well-funded startup imploded. This week, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/the-owner-of-ankis-assets-plans-to-relaunch-cozmo-and-vector-this-year/">announced plans to relaunch</a> the popular Cozmo and Vector robotics toys. Per the piece:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anki invested tremendous resources into bringing them to life, including the hiring of ex-Pixar and DreamWorks staff to make the robots more lifelike. A lot of thought went into giving the robots a distinct personality, whereas, for instance, Vector’s new owners are making the robot open-source. Cozmo, meanwhile, will have programmable functionality through the company’s app.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, hello again, old friend.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coursera’s S-1 dropped last Friday, giving us a glimpse of the financial impact that COVID-19 had on a large edtech company.</p>
<p>We worked through the numbers on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/a-first-look-at-courseras-s-1-filing/">the day the filing happened</a>, but here are the core data points: Coursera’s 2020 revenue came to $293.5 million, up 59% from the year prior. During the same period, Coursera had a net loss of nearly $67 million, up 46% from the previous year’s $46.7 million net deficit.</p>
<p>The company is still unprofitable, despite the pandemic’s general lift to its business and customer base. But does it have a path to profits? Piggybacking from our <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/five-takeaways-from-coinbases-s-1/">Coinbase S-1 analysis piece</a>, let’s ask five questions concerning Coursera’s S-1 that we’ll answer as we go.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Has the company’s freemium push been worth it?</em> </strong>The freemium model is a popular strategy used by edtech companies to get a large top-of-funnel pool of free users, but the true test as a business is whether you can convert those costly unpaid users into paid customers. Coursera’s historical performance provides key insights into how much this strategy, which edtech companies heavily relied on during the pandemic, costs and creates.</li>
<li><strong><em>Will nonconsumer revenues bolster its business health? </em></strong>Consumer revenue can be notoriously volatile, so we’ll explore how Coursera’s other offerings play into its overall business, and whether there is growth potential to be found.</li>
<li><strong><em>Does its work with universities to point to future profits? </em></strong>A big question for edtech founders is whether they should try to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/16/will-edtech-empower-or-erase-the-need-for-higher-education/">empower — or erase — colleges</a>. Coursera launched a campus product during the pandemic to help colleges offer online instruction, but now we can understand if the company is too dependent on it as a revenue generator.</li>
<li><strong><em>Did the pandemic create enough momentum for online education to stay relevant? </em></strong>This is a question poised to never be fully answered, but we’ll explore how one risk factor that Coursera outlined indicates its sentiment on its market’s future, and what trust needs to be built between consumers and businesses.</li>
<li><strong><em>Will international revenue prove to be a big opportunity for Coursera? </em></strong>It’s well known that consumer edtech spending in international markets such as China and India outpaces that of the United States. We’ll see if Coursera’s business shows that, or if there are shifting tides on the willingness of people within the States to spend on education.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our work will help us grok not just Coursera’s performance, but the health of other companies in the edtech space as well. So let’s get into the numbers and work toward better comprehension of one of the most active categories in the startup world, that of turning technology to bear on the global education market.</p>
<h2>Has the company’s freemium push been worth it?</h2>
<p>Coursera has two freemium lines of business, one targeted at consumers, and the other at a portion of its enterprise business, namely “Coursera for Campus.” In the case of the latter, Coursera made parts of its enterprise offering free to use during the pandemic.</p>
<p>We had two questions: First, can we track the impact of rising freemium usage on Coursera’s growth? And can we weigh that growth against the costs of the service to compare the two? The answer to both is yes.</p>
<p>Regarding the impact of freemium on consumer usage, we can intuit from a sharply rising “registered learner” count in recent quarters that offering a free tier was useful in filling the top of Coursera’s funnel during COVID. Here’s the data: From 2018 to 2019, Coursera&#8217;s registered learner count grew from 37.3 million to 46.4 million. Then from 2019 to 2020, it shot to 76.6 million. The accelerated growth was aided by the pandemic, but made possible in part by the fact that there was no cost (no barrier to entry) to sign up for the company’s mass-market offering.</p>
<p>On the enterprise side, we can track the growth of its university-facing work somewhat easily. Enterprise revenue — which encompasses Coursera for Campus, the product that added a free tier in 2020 — has grown in recent years. From 2018 to 2019, the top line from the segment grew from $26.8 million to $48.3 million. Then from 2019 to 2020, it expanded further to $70.8 million. And from 2019 to 2020, the number of paid enterprise customers grew from 240 to 387.</p>
<p>Here, it’s harder to parse the possible impact of the freemium effort. From the numbers, you might wonder where the freemium model might have had an impact; Coursera added around $22 million in enterprise revenue during both 2019 and 2020, so can we find a bump at all?</p>
<p>It’s probably yet to come. The company notes in its S-1 filing that its “Campus Response Initiative [i.e., freemium move] enabled over 4,000 institutions globally, including approximately 10% of all degree-granting institutions, to tap into ready-made, high-quality digital curricula from leading universities with minimal upfront costs.” Coursera goes on to note that it <em>intends</em> to convert those customers as part of its growth plan.</p>
<p>Summarizing: On the consumer side, we can see rapid adoption, and on the enterprise side, we see the <em>potential</em> to accelerate future growth.</p>
<p>That set of mostly good news was not cheap; the company’s sales and marketing costs rose from 31% of revenue in 2019 to 37% in 2020. The company explained it spent $9.2 million more in 2020 than it paid in 2019 to host and support new, free users.</p>
<p>However, given that the company’s full-year revenue was more than <em>30</em> times that amount, the expense seems to fit neatly next to the company’s rapidly growing <em>consumer</em> user base that we feel was boosted by having a freemium offering; whether the enterprise side of the coin will convert is not yet clear, but having an option on future high-margin, low-churn revenues is likely attractive for Coursera and its potential investors.</p>
<p>A key question for edtech startups in the wake of the pandemic is whether a temporary increase of use will actually lead to long-term impact on adoption. Giving your platform away for free can always feel like a question mark; but in edtech, that organic, limitless consumer growth can help it land key enterprise deals eventually and a good reputation. For example, only 3% of Duolingo’s users pay, but they are worth $180 million in bookings.</p>
<p>Coursera’s general success with a freemium business model shows that top-of-funnel edtech, which is good for widespread adoption, can be a lucrative route for founders to consider.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">We know that a lot of elements go into the formation of a startup ecosystem. When your city is outside of the major coastal tech centers, it takes a deliberate effort to get such a system off the ground. For Indianapolis, Indiana, it started with the creation of ExactTarget in 2000. When that company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/04/with-exacttarget-acquisition-salesforce-com-has-spent-close-to-3-5-billion-to-get-into-the-chief-marketing-officers-suite/">was sold to Salesforce for $2.5 billion</a> in 2013, it helped bring a bushel of cash into the startup system.</p>
<p>Today, the venture capital firm that connects back to that ExactTarget acquisition, <a href="https://highalpha.com/">High Alpha Capital</a>, announced a new $110 million fund. The company concentrates on B2B SaaS startups. Kristian Andersen, partner and co-founder at High Alpha sees the fund in the context of the pandemic and the changes it has brought to how businesses are run.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are living in a [time] of almost unrivaled disruption, which has created a host of challenges for individuals, businesses, and society as a whole. In spite (or possibly because) of those challenges, we&#8217;re more confident and motivated than ever to help support the next generation of founders as they seek to transform the world through the marriage of entrepreneurship and technology,&#8221; Andersen said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Of course, cash is a key ingredient in any startup system recipe. ExactTarget&#8217;s founders were flush with it after the acquisition and Scott Dorsey, one of the firm&#8217;s founders says they wanted to build a system from the ground up that included education, a system to encourage entrepreneurship, math skills, a pool of engineering talent and of course, a venture capital firm to drive investment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think of the recipe as talent, capital, support and mentorship. So talent has to be a sharp focus, which is certainly is for us at High Alpha and across the Indianapolis market. The second piece is capital, and markets like Indy often don&#8217;t have access to capital and that&#8217;s been important that we&#8217;re raising our own funds,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He added, &#8220;Thirdly, I think it&#8217;s just support and mentorship and that&#8217;s really what High Alpha is built to do. We have 40 of us on the team with SaaS experts across design, marketing, product engineering, finance and HR &#8212;  all Centers of Excellence you need to start and scale a SaaS company,&#8221; he said.</p>

Combined with today&#8217;s announcement, the total raised across the three funds is $216 million. While the first two funds&#8217; investments were mostly in the Indy area, the plan with the newest one is to expand beyond the region with at least some of the investments.</p>
<p>The firm concentrates on enterprise B2B SaaS companies from pre-seed through Series A investments, so concentrating on early stage companies that it can help nurture and learn from their experiences building ExactTarget into a successful company.</p>
<p>Among the companies they invested in include Attentive, SalesLoft, Zylo, Terminus, The Mom Project, Lessonly, LogicGate, MetaCX and Socio.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The popularity of video and other streamed content like podcasts is continuing to grow at a breakneck speed, and today a startup called <a href="http://epidemicsound.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epidemic Sound</a>, a marketplace to source the background music for that media, is announcing a huge round of funding to scale along with it. The Stockholm-based startup has raised $450 million from Blackstone Group and EQT Growth, an equity round that values Epidemic Sound at $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Epidemic currently features some 32,000 music tracks and 60,000 sound effects, and the plan will be to continue building out the technology on its platform to provide better tools to creators for matching music to media, to expand that catalogue, to grow its customer base, and to take the service global with more localized offerings.</p>
<p>$450 million may sound like a lot of money for a company that &#8212; if you&#8217;ll excuse the pun &#8212; hasn&#8217;t made a lot of noise up to now. But the funding is underpinned with some big ambitions and significant metrics.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;It ties into the size of the vision,&#8221; co-founder and CEO Oscar Höglund said in an interview. &#8220;We are trying to soundtrack the internet. That&#8217;s what it comes down to.&#8221;</p>
<p>For an idea of how the startup is growing, when we last covered funding for Epidemic Sound<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/01/epidemic-sound-raises-20m-at-a-370m-valuation-for-its-soundtrack-music-discovery-and-licensing-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> in 2019</a> (a more modest $20 million at a $370 million valuation), it saw its tracks playing for an average of 250 million hours each month on YouTube alone.</p>
<p>Since then, that figure has grown by more than 400% and is now well over 1 billion hours each month. Höglund says that in terms of streams, YouTube videos using music from Epidemic Sound artists are played 1.5 billion times each day. And that&#8217;s before you consider the traffic for Epidemic music used across TikTok, Facebook and Instagram, Snapchat and other platforms.</p>
<p>&#8220;The macro trend is exploding,&#8221; Höglund said. Counting composers and other creators, there are over 5 million people using its platform today.</p>
<p>But considering that there are around <a href="https://www.tubics.com/blog/number-of-youtube-channels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">37 million YouTube channels</a>, and that&#8217;s not counting the many other places like Twitch, TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat and elsewhere that you might find people, there is a lot of room to grow.</p>
<p>“We look for huge open-ended markets, and [in this market] Epidemic is growing into an industry leader,” Jon Korngold, the global head of Blackstone Growth who led on its investment, said in an interview.</p>
<h2>Two-sided music marketplace</h2>
<p>Epidemic Sound, positions itself as a marketplace, where musicians can upload their recorded tracks, and those who want to use them can come with some ideas in mind of what they&#8217;d like to find &#8212; music is searchable by genre, mood, instruments, tempo, track length and popularity &#8212; and then purchase them with pricing based on where they will be used, not how often they will be heard.</p>
<p>It also offers subscriptions for unlimited use based on personal use ($15/month) or commercial use ($49/month) for unlimited access to everything, which is what the majority of people use. It&#8217;s a formula that helped the startup tip into profitability, although at the moment it&#8217;s focused more on growth and is back in red.</p>
<p>Founded back in 2009, Epidemic was started by Höglund and Jan Zachrisson to address a specific gap in the market: their aim was to make it easier, and less legally risky, to add music to digital media. It&#8217;s funny to think of it, but 11 years ago, the digital music market was still mostly about downloads, and most of them (95%) were illegal. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jan/17/music-piracy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This report from the IFPI</a> at the time didn&#8217;t even seem to mention streaming as a concept.</p>
<p>And to Epidemic&#8217;s opportunity, there were also no clear, easy to use marketplaces in existence to make music available, and to buy it under easy licensing terms.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the core, Epidemic was and is about the restriction free experience for creators,&#8221; said Victor Englesson, a partner and investment advisor at EQT Partners. &#8220;That was one of the big pain points for user-generated content, and that has been true since its inception. Epidemic Sound controls 100% of the rights in its library.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and the opportunity is less about offering easy licensing, which now seems to be table stakes, but more directly addressing a huge demand.</p>
<p>In a world where video has proven to be a hugely popular with consumers &#8212; Cisco previously <a href="https://newsroom.cisco.com/press-release-content?type=webcontent&amp;articleId=1853168" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> that video accounted for some 80% of all internet traffic in 2020, but with those numbers dating from pre-pandemic, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it was more &#8212; it has also proliferated as a medium for creators. Unsurprisingly, a lot of companies have emerged to provide tools for creators to produce and distribute their video content, and that has included providing them with music.</p>
<p>That has led to a pretty crowded market for soundtracking platforms. Others in the same area include the likes of <a href="http://artlist.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artlist</a> (which also provides a catalogue of stills and video; it also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/artlist-raises-48m-led-by-kkr-for-its-royalty-free-music-video-and-sound-effect-library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised money last year</a>), <a href="https://uppbeat.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upbeat</a>, <a href="https://www.commamusic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Comma</a> and <a href="https://www.premiumbeat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shutterstock</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Platforms themselves also provide music tools to creators, casual and otherwise, and that has extended far beyond <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/09/tiktok-brain-send-help.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>On TikTok, tracks themselves go viral and become <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2020/09/tiktok-brain-send-help.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earworms</a> overnight. And it&#8217;s interesting that Snap last year made a move that points to how it might leverage a role for itself in the music creation and dissemination marketplace. Last year, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/20/snap-acquired-voisey-an-app-to-create-music-tracks-overlaying-your-own-vocals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quietly acquired an app called Voisy</a>, which lets people overlay and edit their own tunes and vocals over a selection of beats, and then share those creations.</p>
<p>Within all that, Epidemic is more than just a simple platform for exchange, however.</p>
<p>In addition to operating its own platform, Epidemic also partners with other platforms where people are creating content, such as Adobe, Canva, Getty and Lightricks, which offer Epidemic&#8217;s music streams as part of their one-stop shops.</p>
<p>And there is also the &#8220;brain&#8221; behind what Epidemic has built. It tracks which music is used the most, and then how that music plays with audiences, it has been building a gradual picture of the music tastes of the global market &#8212; a music graph, as it were &#8212; information that it in turn uses to help sort music, match it up better with those looking for it, and to help encourage composers to create further tracks to meet demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we collect data and because music leaves a footprint, we can see when there is a huge ask for metal lullabies, for example,&#8221; said Höglund. &#8220;We can then commission more of that kind of track, and it will get picked up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The growth of Spotify, and the massive investments made by Apple, Google, Facebook and others into music streaming, tells a story of how the physical music business has declined but music listening very much has not, a trend only accentuated in the last year, where concerts were cancelled and virtual streaming took their place.</p>
<p>Epidemic is an interesting counterpoint to all of these, focusing not on deals with labels and the Billie&#8217;s and Beyonce&#8217;s of the world, but a very long tail of creators who may have no deals of the sort in their sights.</p>
<p>While companies like Spotify have turned their attention to building out brands as monetization platforms for artists, that was a part of the equation for the start for Epidemic.</p>
<p>Music creatives receive an upfront payment for each track Epidemic buys, with payment varying depending on the track. It also splits the revenue from streaming platforms where the music might later get played.</p>
<p>The company says that on average musicians can make tens of thousands of dollars year, with a select few making hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. &#8220;It&#8217;s massive distribution and reach,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>And some grow in their own right, not just as anonymous partners to video creators. Ooyy, Cospe and Loving Caliber are three that have crossed over into their own stardom, so the gap between what Epidemic Sound is doing for musicians and what a platform like, say, Spotify or YouTube might not be as wide as you might think. (That also also points to some very obvious and formidable competitors &#8212; or acquirers or partners &#8212; down the line.)</p>
<p>Combined with its size and growth, it&#8217;s this engine that has helped Epidemic Sound grow in what has become a pretty crowded market.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is, at the end of the day, a data business,&#8221; said Korngold at Blackstone Growth.</p>
<p><em>Updated user numbers and with the correct spelling of one of the musicians.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Seth Rogen and four friends-turned-co-founders have been building a weed company for close to ten years, and its products are now available in the United States. The company&#8217;s house goods will be available through its website and select dispensaries in Los Angeles will carry Houseplant&#8217;s three strains of cannabis.</p>
<p>Nearly every smoker has been there: Deep into a sesh with friends, someone has an idea of starting a weed company. It sounds great in the haze, but the idea fizzles as the high fades. That was ten years ago for co-founders Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Yeah, the same Seth and Evan who starred in and produced some of the last decade&#8217;s best comedies. Together they launched Houseplant by teamed up with friends Michael Mohr, Alex Mcatee, and James Weaver and hired Melissa Greenberg as Chief Consumer Officer and Haneen Davis as Chief Commercial Officer.</p>
<p>Called <a href="https://www.houseplant.com">Houseplant</a>, the brand started in Canada in 2019 and launching today in the United States with three weed strains and a collection of design-first house goods.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Houseplant&#8217;s CEO Michael Mohr spoke to TechCrunch ahead of Houseplant&#8217;s US launch. He explains Houseplant sees itself as able to rise above competitors because its co-founders live the life they&#8217;re trying to sell. And to this company, success is not defined by just a financial windfall.</p>
<p>Mohr explains that he&#8217;s surprised at how little attention is given to social responsibility and impact within the cannabis industry. The company set up extensive social impact programs that to address three areas: education and advocacy, community empowerment and economic opportunity, and diversity, equity, and inclusion. They are also working with organizations addressing criminal justice and drug policy reform.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Houseplant] we recognize the issues,&#8221; Mohr said, &#8220;We recognize our advantages and our privilege. And we define our success not just financially, but we also grade ourselves on the impact that we&#8217;re able to make.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mohr pushes back that Houseplant is just another celebrity branding play. He explained that Rogen and Goldberg have shown they can authentically communicate a cannabis lifestyle because that&#8217;s how they live.</p>
<p>&#8220;[Rogen and Goldberg] put more thought into the cannabis products and the surrounding lifestyle than anyone else because that&#8217;s the life they live,&#8221; Mohr said. &#8220;And it&#8217;s through that personal experience we can create a line of house goods that are immediately well received by the cannabis community and the design community.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Mohr spoke, the vision became more apparent. Houseplant sees itself as having the potential to be a top-tier cannabis brand and not a side project for some celebrities.</p>
<p>&#8220;This industry needs brands that can bring trust and awareness to the space,&#8221; Mohr said. &#8220;It&#8217;s more than using [Rogen and Goldberg&#8217;s] name. It&#8217;s using their expertise to accomplish the goal and deliver an experience to consumers across the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>These claims are easily verified. Look at Seth Rogen&#8217;s Twitter account. Over the last week, he&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/sethrogen/status/1366425890058461184">tweeted</a> several times about Houseplant&#8217;s launch, teasing products and showing off the company&#8217;s hand-selected strains. Rogen&#8217;s enthusiasm is contagious. <a href="https://twitter.com/Sethrogen/status/1368971326719860738">In one three-minute video</a>, Rogen sits behind a pottery wheel and shows off some excellent pottery skills. In another, <a href="https://twitter.com/Sethrogen/status/1369696639313616901">he dances</a> (kind of) to a track from a set of vinyl records Houseplant sells. These videos have been viewed millions of times.</p>
<p>Houseplant sees an opportunity to create a friendly cannabis brand. CEO Mohr looks to Apple for inspiration, explaining he hopes Houseplant does for cannabis what Apple did for computers and smartphones by turning an intimidating product into something everyone can use.</p>
<p>The company has three product lines, two of which are available in the States: cannabis flower and THC-infused beverages and a line of house goods. Eventually, Houseplant will release two house good products a month, which will be sold directly to consumers through its website. The beverages are only available in Canada.<br />
[gallery ids="2124178,2124171,2124170,2124176,2124173,2124180,2124181,2124183"]</p>
<p>The flower is hand-selected and includes three strains: two Sativa strains and one indica strain. All test high and come from California growers. Pink Moon is an Indica strain, crossed from Tangie and Kosher Kush, and results in a euphoric and creative high without the lively effects of a Sativa. The two Sativa strains claim to result in different effects. Diablo Wind is a cross of Jack Here and G13 Haze for a soaring, cerebral, and euphoric high. Pancake Ice is a cross of Chem Dawg, I-95, and Mandarin Cookies. Rogen tweeted twice he smokes this strain all day. The company says Pancake Ice results in a serene and pleasant body high that is not sedating.</p>
<p>The house goods portion of Houseplant has the same gas found in its weed. These products are uniquely suited for cannabis consumers yet are interesting enough for purchase by anyone. The ashtray even comes with a matching flower vase. Ashtray Set By Seth, as it&#8217;s called, retails for $85 and is inspired by Rogen&#8217;s new-found love for pottery (which he has been very vocal about on social media). The Block Lighter costs $220 and is clearly designed never to be lost like other lighters. Lastly, Houseplant sells a box set of vinyl records intended to be played with certain strains — you know, a playlist but in real life.</p>
<p>Despite the small line of products, the company seems poised to impact the growing cannabis market.</p>
<p>Houseplant is funded by two of the co-founders, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. CEO Mohr tells TechCrunch they have not taken any outside investment yet.</p>
<p>To launch Houseplant in Canada in 2019, the company partnered with cannabis giant Canopy Growth Corp. Out of this deal, the company brought to market a line of cannabis strains and THC-infused beverages. Canopy Growth is not part of the United States launch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve ever had to file a claim with your insurance company, you know that it&#8217;s not exactly fun. Often, you’re on hold indefinitely waiting to speak to a live person. And if you’ve ever had to file an auto or home insurance claim, you know that all the back and forth with your carrier and the various vendors can take up so much time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.himarley.com">Hi Marley</a> is a Boston startup that has set out to modernize communications in the insurance space by giving carriers a way to “seamlessly” communicate with their policyholders via text. The company just closed on a $25 million Series B funding round to help scale its SMS platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi Marley also includes other vendors in that communications channel, such as car repair or rental companies. The goal is to keep policyholders happier and less likely to churn to another carrier, in addition to helping carriers resolve claims faster.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the back end, Hi Marley is a platform of apps, APIs and a layer of intelligence that integrates with other core systems such as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guidewire and Duck Creek</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “to deliver critical insights” to the carriers, according to CEO and co-founder Mike Greene. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per its website, Hi Marley’s messaging solution aims to streamline communication around claims, underwriting and policyholder service interactions “while simultaneously connecting everyone who touches that insurance experience into a singular, real-time conversation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand is there, and no doubt the COVID-19 pandemic forcing more people to go digital has led to still more consumer demand for new ways to communicate. Last year, the number of carriers using Hi Marley’s platform doubled, and the company saw a 4x increase in its user base, Greene said. Currently, the startup has over 40 customers live in production — including American Family, MetLife, Auto-Owners, Erie and MAPFRE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“U</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nlike horizontal chat solutions, we are tackling the entire communication layer across the insurance enterprise for our carriers and their ecosystem partners,” Greene told TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greene is no stranger to the space, having worked in the insurance sector for years. He </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">previously co-founded and led Futurity Group, which was </span><a href="https://www.propertycasualty360.com/2010/01/18/aons-inpoint-acquires-futurity-group/?slreturn=20210211105931"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by AON, a software and services company focused on monitoring and improving performance in P&amp;C insurance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emergence Capital led the Series B round, which brings Hi Marley’s total raised since its 2017 inception to $41.7 million. Existing backers Underscore, True Ventures, Bain Capital Ventures, and Greenspring also participated in the financing, along with additional investors including Brewer Lane.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emergence Capital Founder &amp; General Partner <a href="https://www.emcap.com/people/gordon-ritter/">Gordon Ritter</a> — who took a seat on Hi Marley’s board — said his firm has been </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">focused on finding the next iconic industry cloud company within the vertical for “quite some time.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the same way Veeva [a company Ritter chaired to a successful IPO in 2013] expanded from CRM to additional software solutions that power the pharma industry, we continue to be bullish on startups building vertically-focused solutions that can power an entire industry,” Ritter said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, he added, insurance has been viewed as a necessary evil, a purchase made purely for the sake of safety and security. And in today’s environment, carriers using “old” communication strategies will likely see a negative impact on performance, Ritter believes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Most of us can likely agree that our experiences dealing with insurers during times of need have been less than ideal, if not unpleasant altogether,” said Ritter, who actually has family with roots in the insurance industry. “But Mike wants to reverse the indifference or negative reputation; he is on a mission to make insurance lovable</span><b><i>&#8230;</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A new communication fabric between carriers and their ecosystem to benefit end customers is needed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, Hi Marley plans to use its new capital to create new features, ensure the platform scales across the enterprise and (naturally) do some hiring.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">People returning from a period of incarceration face innumerable challenges, among them entering a high-tech workforce that requires a new set of skills. Jason Jones leads remote instruction at The Last Mile, a code training program for inmates; Deepti Rohatgi is head of Slack for Good, a social-good office within the company running Next Chapter, which helps place recently incarcerated find employment at tech partners; Aly Tamboura advises the new $350 million (and counting) Justice Accelerator Fund at the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative. These three, whose stories are intertwined, discussed the possibility for change and how to effect it within the context of tech and returning citizens.</p>
<hr />
<h3>On the shift in attitudes that makes it possible</h3>
<p>Not many years ago the idea of in-facility tech training and mentoring might not even have been a possibility. But the increasingly visible shortcomings and flaws of the justice system have made it clear how much such programs are needed.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Tamboura</strong>: When we think of mass incarceration, as a whole, the nation is really starting to get it, is saying this was a failed experiment, it&#8217;s not working, our communities are no safer, we have all these people in prison.</p>
<p>And a lot of Departments of Corrections across across the United States, they&#8217;re not equipped to get people ready to come home and to thrive. They really weren&#8217;t set up for that. So when you think of the role of tech in this, when you ask what has changed, a lot of Department of Corrections, have changed that mantra, a lot of Governors, to change that mantra, and projects, like The Last Mile and Next Chapter, these public-private partnerships are showing states what is possible, if we all collaborate and and put our heads together. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 5:36)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<hr />
<h3>On tailoring the lesson to the learner</h3>
<p>Teaching people serving prison terms means catering to their strengths and expectations, just like teaching any other group. In this case it also means wearing away the dehumanization and stigma that comes with spending years in a cell.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Jones</strong>: From the very first time that they come in, we really try to embed this culture, to humanize them, right? I think when it starts with the language, we don&#8217;t call none of our learners inmates convicts parolees or anything like that, because the narratives that have been attached to those to those labels have always been negative and dehumanized.</p>
<p>Then we challenge them in healthy ways and try to relate a lot of their lived experience to the coding concepts. For example, this week, I just did a lesson about scoping. And I related into like, how their cells or their living quarters is set up in &#8211; like the scope that they live in, only them or their celly have access to that, to what&#8217;s in the cell, as opposed to like the global scope where the day room or yard everyone has access to. So just finding these ways where you can relate the lived experience of the current situation, or current condition to some of these coding concepts that&#8217;s a little bit abstract and new for someone learning technology.</p>

</ul>
<hr />
<h3>On getting people close to the work</h3>
<p>Showing future coworkers and stakeholders about the real nature of the justice and incarcerative systems firsthand helps break down barriers. Silicon Valley may be famously progressive but even so people have internalized decades of misinformation about how things actually work.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Rohatgi</strong>: Most people in tech have no exposure to people who have been impacted by a criminal justice system, even though there are over 2 million people who are incarcerated. We need to first make sure the company has shifted their culture to make sure that the apprentices and future software engineers can thrive&#8230; so they don&#8217;t use terms like felon or ex-con, right? And frankly, people need to understand why this country has gotten into the place it is with our criminal justice system. So there&#8217;s a lot of education that happens within the companies.</p>
<p>For us, it&#8217;s involved taking over 200 Slack employees to San Quentin, to help shift their perceptions of what somebody who is incarcerated is capable of, explaining to them all the obstacles that you have to go through once you are released, right? Just really getting an education on this issue that nobody has, or very few people within the tech community have exposure to&#8230; Then we&#8217;ve seen massive shifts from fear to love. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 10:01)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/salesforce-buys-slack/">Salesforce buys Slack in a $27.7B megadeal</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>On getting system-impacted people a place at the table</h3>
<p>Of course it&#8217;s advised to ask people who have been in prison for their input on programs that may affect others there, but how often are such returned citizens given positions of weight at 9-figure funds? Yet as Tamboura explains it&#8217;s exactly what&#8217;s needed.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Tamboura</strong>: You know, CZI is a baby. It&#8217;s a new organization. And when our team got involved with this work, it just it took off like a rocket ship. And it&#8217;s time for it&#8217;s time for us to, like, graduate from grade school and move into college with this fund.</p>
<p>This is one of the few times in history where a fund I think it is the only time in history where a fund has been advised by someone — and I mean a fund this significant as this — advised by people who are system impacted. There&#8217;s this old mantra people that are closest to the problems are closest to solutions. And I really believe that people who have been through the system people or are system impacted, really need to not only have a seat at the table, but have a compelling voice in this work. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 13:29)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

</ul>
<hr />
<h3>On spreading the word</h3>
<p>The prison system is notoriously fractured, with regulations and opportunities varying wildly between different facilities and states. It takes research, clout, and direct work with the people in charge to move the ball — but when it hits, it can change a lot of lives. Programs like The Last Mile are just part of a broader effort.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Jones</strong>: We have a sort of like a franchise model when we go into expanding into any state. For instance, Ali with CZI, they helped with us expanding to Oklahoma, helped with the funding. It was a partnership. And when we launched, it was, at the time, the highest incarcerated state for women in the world. And I remember one of our board members, MC Hammer, talking to Governor Stitt and raising that statistic. In a matter of months, they did the biggest commutation still to this day. It was like 500 people got commuted, and a lot of our learners was part of that commutation, and got out. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 17:08)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/build-products-that-improve-the-lives-of-inmates/">Build products that improve the lives of inmates</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>On proving the impossible possible</h3>
<p>Inertia is one of the biggest obstacles to overcome in any social movement, and part of that is the assumption that if it could be done, someone would have already done it; no one has done it, so it can&#8217;t be done.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Rohatgi</strong>: One thing that&#8217;s really important is proving the model. If Slack can do it, why can&#8217;t Zoom, Square, or Dropbox? It turns out, they can. And if Zoom, Square, and Dropbox can do it, why can&#8217;t other companies, right? So the idea that it&#8217;s impossible, you can&#8217;t say that anymore. You can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s not possible to do it — you can, and for very big, not massive, but for big tech companies. So I feel like the impossibility of making the significant change and making systemic change within the tech sector seems completely doable to me. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 22:37)</strong></em></p></blockquote>

					<description><![CDATA[Valuations are up because software company growth will persist longer than most analysts and investors expected, making the present value of software companies' future cash flows larger, even if they had yet to grow into those later projections.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Some well-known VC firms have spent the last few months crunching data while working to chart, graph and map the world of venture investing. Happily for you and I, they&#8217;ve been pretty free with their time and data, helping us better understand today&#8217;s market for high-growth, software startups.</p>
<p>Last week The Exchange <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/understanding-how-investors-value-growth-in-2021/">dug into data from Battery Ventures</a>, which worked to explain some of the gains software companies have made in recent years in terms of their valuation multiples. The short gist is that multiples expansion &#8212; the repricing of software companies <em>higher</em> for each dollar of revenue they command &#8212; could be explained in part by segmenting the companies into various growth cohorts. Once accomplished, it&#8217;s easy to see that the fastest-growing software startups are enjoying the most price appreciation.</p>
<p>As one Battery investor explained, growth rates de-risk valuation multiples.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>The logic is sound enough. I can doodle on it in a future column if you&#8217;d like. But today, instead of retreading familiar ground, we&#8217;re diving into <a href="https://www.bvp.com/atlas/state-of-the-cloud-2021/?from=feature">new data from Bessemer</a>, a VC group that should be familiar to Exchange readers thanks to <a href="https://cloudindex.bvp.com/">its cloud index</a> that we refer to quite often. Regardless, Bessemer&#8217;s 2021 cloud report is out, and it assists some of the work we did with Battery&#8217;s charts.</p>
<p>What we can do with Bessemer&#8217;s dataset is extend the argument from Battery&#8217;s report: Sure, strong growth rates de-risk multiples, but what the new report indicates is that growth <em>rates</em> themselves amongst cloud companies (modern software, SaaS, call it what you will) should prove more durable than nearly anyone historically expected.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1995212 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/exchange-banner-sq-gry.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>You can quickly see the synthesis. <em>If</em> growth rates de-risk rising multiples, we can infer some logic to higher-growth companies being valued more richly than their slower-growing peers. But that doesn&#8217;t get us to understanding why multiples <em>themselves</em> might be rising, provided we wanted to find some argument for why they are <em>sane</em>. More durable growth rates, however, provide a possible answer.</p>
<p>Why? The longer a company can keep up its growth rate from year to year, the larger it will be in the future. Modern software companies do have a history of growth-rate retardation over time, but nearly never <em>negative</em> growth rates.</p>
<p>More durable growth today implies more cash generation in the future. Up go valuations, and, for the fastest-growing today, the bump in worth comes with the valuation downside protection inherent in quick growth.</p>
<p>Got all that? If not, don&#8217;t worry — I have charts. Let&#8217;s keep going.</p>
<h2>A theory for why software valuations aren&#8217;t irrational (maybe)</h2>
<p>The key reason that startup and public-company software valuations are so high is because investors are willing to pay those prices. Hungry for yield on their capital, buying growth via software has been a trade for some time. It was even accelerated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/09/what-happens-to-high-flying-startups-if-the-pandemic-trade-flips/">last summer</a> as the pandemic gripped the global economy.</p>
<p>Suddenly software was not just a possible place to bet on growth, it was also a durable place to stash cash, because without software the world would stop. And that couldn&#8217;t happen, so most folks kept paying their software bills.</p>
<p>You might think that the valuation gains companies saw as other stocks fell out of favor would fade. After all, if they got a bump and the bump faded, surely they would lose some air from their balloon. Kinda? But mostly it appears that software valuations have stayed pretty damn aloft. And this brings us to the future.</p>
<p>Check out the following chart, via the Bessemer report (and shared with permission), that I will explain immediately afterward:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bvp.com/team/mary-donofrio/">Bessemer partner Mary D&#8217;Onofrio</a>, one of the report&#8217;s lead authors and part of the growth team, told us that the x-axis is the growth rate of public software companies last year, while the y-axis is what it is managing in the current year. And that 0.8x? That&#8217;s the correlation.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Los-Angeles based startup Canoo revealed its newest — and now third — electric vehicle, a pickup truck that does away with the sharp corners and huge engine housing of both comparable EV trucks and legacy diesel pickups and is aimed at both commercial customers and weekend warrior-minded consumers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truck, which Canoo says is the most space efficient on the market, was leaked Wednesday evening in advance of an official reveal set for Thursday afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three Canoo vehicles all share a design language. But the important part, and the cornerstone of Canoo, is the foundation. Canoo uses the same platform architecture on all of its vehicles, only altering the cabins, or top hats, with each new model. Canoo’s proprietary platform is like a thin, flat skateboard that houses the critical components of the EV powertrain. The company said this type of design gives its truck a similar flatbed size as a best-selling traditional pickup.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truck will open for preorders in the second quarter of 2021, with deliveries set to begin as early as 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The truck clocks in at 184 inches in length (in comparison, Tesla’s Cybertruck is 231 inches long and the Rivian R1T is 218 inches). But where Canoo’s model stands out is in its pull-out bed extension, which stretches the truck bed from six feet to a fully enclosed eight feet, and extends the length to a more competitive 213 inches. It also boasts up to 600 horsepower and has a battery range of more than 200 miles. </span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124145" style="width: 1930px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124145" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2124145 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg" alt="Canoo-PickupTruck" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_PullOutBedExtension.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2124145" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Canoo</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Canoo&#8217;s other vehicles, the pickup has all kinds of options to change it. There are dividers for the truck bed, for instance as well as a camper shell that can turn it the vehicle into a van. There&#8217;s even a rooftop tent — at least in its photos — which suggested that Canoo is thinking about an accessories business to go along with its vehicles.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_ExteriorSnow_12.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2124148 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Canoo_PickupTruck_ExteriorSnow_12.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s also cargo storage area that has a fold down work table and additional electrical outlets, side tables that can flip down, a hidden step to the truck bed that contains even more storage, and a roof rack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our pickup truck is as strong as the toughest trucks out there and is designed to be exponentially more productive,” Canoo executive chairman Tony Aquila said in a statement. “This truck works for you. We made accessories for people who use trucks – on the job, weekends, adventure. You name it, we did it because it’s your platform and she’s bad to the bone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last December, Canoo went public through a merger agreement with special acquisition company Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp., with a market valuation of $2.4 billion. It joined a string of EV automakers and charging infrastructure companies that Fisker Inc., Nikola Corp. and Lordstown Motors in forgoing a traditional IPO on the road to a NASDAQ listing.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter Spaces, the social network&#8217;s Clubhouse rival, is working towards a public launch in April, the company announced in comments made in a public Twitter Space audio room on Wednesday. According to the Space&#8217;s host, Alex aka <a href="https://twitter.com/akkhosh">@akkhosh</a> on Twitter, the company intends to make it possible for anyone to host a Twitter Spaces room of their own sometime in April.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, very soon,&#8221; the Twitter employee noted. &#8220;That&#8217;s where we&#8217;re headed.&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch immediately reached out to Twitter to fact check his statements on Wednesday. Given that, in the context a broader conversation about a beta product <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/twitter-spaces-arrives-on-android-ahead-of-clubhouse/">that just rolled out to testers on Android a week ago</a> &#8212; and for joining Spaces only &#8212; his comments could have been interpreted to mean that Android <em>beta</em> <em>testers</em> would also gain the ability to host their own Spaces by April.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>That would still be a fairly quick pace of development for a product that only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/twitter-launches-its-voice-based-spaces-social-networking-feature-into-beta-testing/">launched into public testing</a> late last year.</p>
<p>However, a Twitter spokesperson confirmed that we can take Alex at his word.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can absolutely confirm that he meant everyone on Android and iOS, not just beta testers,&#8221; the spokesperson told TechCrunch. In other words, the company is making Twitter Spaces available to the public user base in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>The speed of development now taking place at Twitter has been notable. In just a few months, Twitter has launched its audio chat room feature to public testing and has quickly iterated on the product to tweak elements like it <a href="https://twitter.com/mayagpatterson/status/1364647741641527296">titles and descriptions</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mayagpatterson/status/1365443249389793282">scheduling options</a>, support for <a href="https://twitter.com/c_at_work/status/1365431726550343680">co-hosts and moderators</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mayagpatterson/status/1365836725751148545">guest lists</a>, and more. When forthcoming changes are announced &#8212; like Android support, co-hosts, or scheduling options, for example &#8212; they&#8217;re promised to roll out in a matter of weeks, not months.</p>
<p>A few other ideas were also discussed during yesterday&#8217;s Twitter Spaces session. The company said it&#8217;s considering support for using music in Spaces and thinking about better ways of integrating tweets.</p>
<p>For the former, the goal would be to offer Spaces&#8217; hosts some sort of welcoming music they could play for their listeners. The company has also discussed the idea of offering users the way to tweet inside the Space directly, where tweets would not be displayed on your public timeline. There are various ways this could be accomplished &#8212; for example, by offering an ephemeral, fleeting chat room inside the Space, similar to Twitter&#8217;s older live video app Periscope, or by offering a dedicated timeline just for the Space itself, which could be more complex to build.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some concerns with rushing a product like Twitter Spaces to launch. In Spaces&#8217; competitor, Clubhouse, users are still regularly reporting dealing with verbal abuse and bad actors who are looking to take advantage of the platform as a place to hustle or scam people.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s less clear to what extent Twitter Spaces has been impacted by similar issues, as its product is still non-public. But one Twitter Spaces user who joined during yesterday&#8217;s session talked about how their recent Twitter Space was hijacked by a fan group who attempted to take over the discussion. While these particular hijackers would be placated by having the ability to run their own Spaces session, it&#8217;s easy to imagine how a coordinated effort to derail a Twitter Space could still be a problem in the weeks to come.</p>
<p>Twitter, in the early days of Spaces, had spoken publicly about how <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/17/twitter-rolls-out-stories-aka-fleets-to-all-users-will-also-test-a-clubhouse-rival/">it would first ensure that</a> &#8220;women and those from marginalized backgrounds&#8221; &#8212; a group of people who &#8220;are disproportionately impacted by abuse and harm on the platform,&#8221; a product designer had said &#8212; would be the first testers of the product to ensure it&#8217;s built with safety in mind. But in the weeks that have followed, there has not been as much said about Twitter Space&#8217;s anti-abuse measures or policies, as the team&#8217;s focus has been directed more on the product itself, and its various bells and whistles.</p>
<p>Even when taking the <a href="https://investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/twitter-analyst-day/default.aspx">time to speak to analysts</a> and investors or sit down for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22319527/twitter-kayvon-beykpour-interview-consumer-product-decoder">interviews</a>, Twitter execs and product leaders have tended to gloss over <em>why</em> it keeps building new tools &#8212; like its Stories feature Fleets and now, Spaces &#8212; to encourage conversations from those who are too afraid to tweet.</p>
<p>The fact is that many are afraid because Twitter has not yet successfully made its platform a place where users aren&#8217;t trolled, abused, or attacked &#8212; for sometimes even the most benign statements or missteps.</p>
<p>One feature that could potentially help protect users by holding abusers accountable is recording Spaces.  Twitter earlier said it aims to build in a way to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321158/twitter-spaces-record-conversation-kayvon-beykpour">natively record Spaces conversations</a>. When on the record, fewer people may be willing to speak abusively, perhaps. That could encourage more thoughtful conversations but could still potentially scare other users off from trying the product.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the jury is still out on Twitter Spaces and Clubhouse&#8217;s long-term potential. There&#8217;s a question as to whether some of these platforms will see dwindling usage when the world re-opens as the pandemic ends and the conference and networking circuits heat back up. In that light, Twitter Spaces may end up having more long-term staying power as it&#8217;s connected to Twitter&#8217;s broader product and p<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/25/twitters-super-follow-creator-subscription-takes-shots-at-substack-and-patreon/">lans to make its platform a place for creators to organize</a>, and eventually monetize their fan bases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Given the deluge of climate focused companies flooding public markets, it&#8217;s getting hard to keep track of who&#8217;s doing what, where they&#8217;re traded and how they&#8217;re performing. That&#8217;s why the folks at <a href="https://www.energyimpactpartners.com/">Energy Impact Partners</a> have <a href="https://eipclimateindex.com/?page_id=6">set up an index tracking tech companies that are focused on sustainability, energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions</a>.</p>
<p>For the past few months the firm, whose investors include some of the largest energy consumers and utilities in the world, has been working on setting up the index of representative climate tech offerings that are available on public markets and discovered one thing &#8212; these companies are crushing returns compared to the overall market.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 2020, EIP Climate Index has outperformed NASDAQ by approximately 2.8 times &#8212; it&#8217;s up 127% compared to 45% for the NASDAQ. Of the companies on the list, about 20 out of the 27 companies are new offerings that have been public less than a year and have outperformed NASDAQ during that period. About16 of them are up over 100% during that time. That&#8217;s true even with the overall index down about 20 percent from its January peaks.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The index isn&#8217;t actually available for public investment, it&#8217;s an educational tool more than anything else, but it does show the breadth of companies working on climate-related solutions and reveals the overwhelming appetite of public market investors to back these companies.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There’s been a really incredibly positive run in the climate tech run in the public markets and not just from SPACs,&#8221; said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaylekann/">Shayle Kann</a>, a partner at Energy Impact Partners. &#8220;Part of our motivation for creating this climate tech index let’s see if we can put together as diverse a group of companies as possible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Included in the EIP index are companies like Beyond Meat, which is a sustainability darling, and businesses that are a bit longer in the tooth like hydrogen fuel cell companies Ballard Power and Bloom Energy. The companies run the gamut from electric storage to renewable energy production, to vehicle charging and infrastructure to alternative protein providers.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The idea was, how was the sector, if you include all this stuff, performing as a whole. We created this index and tried to be inclusive. It has been dramatically outperforming the market.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the EIP list is intended to be informative, there&#8217;s no reason someone couldn&#8217;t take this index and turn it into an exchange traded fund for the industry. Most of the ETFs that are currently on the market are focused narrowly on energy production, or infrastructure, this index is potentially the first to track the broadly diversified world of companies focused on mitigating the impacts of climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</span></p>
<p>There are even additive manufacturers in the mix like Desktop Metal, which Kann said had a huge climate component to its technology.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Additive manufacturing has a fairly strong climate case in reduced waste, reduced transportation, electrification of the manufacturing process,&#8221; Kann said. </span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s also a signal that early stage private investors can take note of too, said Kann.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It provides a broader pathway to public markets. The companies that see their share prices run up here. What it suggests for us and for everybody else in this venture capital world is the exit pathways are improved when this index does well,&#8221; he said. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As we&#8217;ve made our way through this pandemic, it has forced businesses to rethink and accelerate trends. One such trend is the movement to no-code tools to allow line-of-business users to create apps and workflows without engineering help. To help answer that demand, ServiceNow released a couple of new tools today as part of their latest release.</p>
<p>Dave Wright, the chief innovation officer at <a href="http://servicenow.com">ServiceNow</a>, says that COVID has forced more teams to work in a distributed fashion, and that has in turn has advanced the idea of putting software building into the hands of every employee.</p>
<p>&#8220;So because people haven&#8217;t had the same support networks and are distributed, you need to be able to produce software that has a consumer grade feel to it. And if you could get that in place, then you can get people to use the system. If you get people to use the system, then you start to get better employee productivity and employee engagement,&#8221; Wright explained.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This has typically revolved around the three main areas of focus on the ServiceNow platform &#8212; customer service, IT and HR &#8212; but in order to step outside those three categories, the company has decided to develop a new area called Creator Workflows, which are designed to help workers build new workflows suited to their needs.<br />
	<div class="article-block block--callout block--right" >
		<h4 class="block--callout__title">Low code/no code is hot</h4>
		
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/30/whats-ahead-for-no-code-and-low-code-startups/">What&#8217;s ahead for no code startups</a></li>
<li><a>Tracking growth of no code/low code startups</a></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/05/how-one-vc-firm-wound-up-with-no-code-startups-as-part-of-its-investing-thesis/">VC firm makes no code startups part of core investing thesis</a></li>
</ul>
	</div>
	<br />
The company has come up with a couple of new tools to help these Creators: <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/now-platform-app-engine.html">AppEngine Studio</a> and <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/products/now-platform-app-engine.html">AppEngine Templates</a>, which work together to help these folks build these no-code workflows wherever they work across an organization.</p>
<p>AppEngine studio provides the main development environment where users can drag and drop the components they need to build workflows that make sense for them. The templates take that ease of use a step further by providing a framework for some common tasks.</p>
<p>The new release also incorporates a couple of recent acquisitions: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/servicenow-acquires-loom-systems-to-expand-aiops-coverage/">Loom Systems</a> and <a href="https://blogs.servicenow.com/2019/servicenow-acquires-attivio-cognitive-search-platform.html">Attivio</a>. The company has taken the latter and repurposed it to be a platform-wide search tool called AI Search.</p>
<p>&#8220;It allows you to deliver contextualized consumer grade results. So it means that we can personalize the results that you get from a search back to you so that it&#8217;s more relevant to you and more focused on giving you that context that you really need to make sure you get actionable information,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Another company that they purchased was Loom Systems, which gave the company an AIOps component and the ability to inject that AI across the platform. Gab Menachem, who was CEO and co-founder at Loom prior to the acquisition, says the process of becoming part of ServiceNow has been smooth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vendors in this space find themselves kind of giving customers a science project. In ServiceNow the whole focus of this year has been to incorporate [Loom] into the workflow and make work flow naturally, so that employee productivity would be boosted, and the engagement will be high. And that&#8217;s what we focus on, and I think it was a really easy transition into a big company because it just made all of our customers a lot happier,&#8221; Menachem said.</p>
<p>This new tooling is available starting today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Roblox <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/10/welcome-to-bloxburg-public-investors/">went public yesterday</a> after seeing tremendous growth in 2020, which isn&#8217;t just good news for the company&#8217;s employees and investors — there are also startups like <a href="https://gamefam.com/">Gamefam</a> hoping to take advantage of the platform&#8217;s success.</p>
<p>Roblox has a whole ecosystem of millions of developers and creators building on its game platform, and some are banding together to create their own teams and studios. (We profiled several of those teams earlier this year in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/29/how-robloxs-creator-accelerator-helps-the-gaming-giant-build-new-platform-opportunities/">an article about the company&#8217;s creator accelerator</a>.) But Gamefam founder and CEO Joe Ferencz said his startup is &#8220;the first and only fully-dedicated, professional game publishing company on Roblox.&#8221;</p>
<p>Founded in 2019, Gamefan currently has 37 full-time employees and eight live games, including <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/54865335/Ultimate-Driving-Westover-Islands">Ultimate Driving</a> and <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/5652023420/NEW-MAP-Hot-Wheels-Open-World">Hot Wheels Open World</a>, and Ferencz said there are another 10 in development. Collectively, those games are seeing 48 million monthly visitors and generating six figures in monthly revenue.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Ferencz described the team as &#8220;gaming industry professionals working hand-in-hand with the top up-and-coming Roblox creators.&#8221; For example, Ultimate Driving creator TwentyTwoPilots also serves as Gamefam&#8217;s creative director.</p>
<p>Ferencz himself has worked as a manager Ubisoft and Mattel, where he led the digital side of franchises like Hot Wheels, and where he recalled seeing the emergence of free-to-play mobile gaming: &#8220;I said to myself, &#8216;The next time there’s this big platform shift, I want to be a part of this.'&#8221; The rise of Roblox and user-created games provided him with that opportunity.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2124126" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2124126" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2124126" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/media-image-3-2021-flat.jpg?w=680" alt="Joe Ferencz" width="680" height="454" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/media-image-3-2021-flat.jpg 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/media-image-3-2021-flat.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/media-image-3-2021-flat.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/media-image-3-2021-flat.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/media-image-3-2021-flat.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/media-image-3-2021-flat.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2124126" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Gamefam</p></div></p>
<p>At the same time, Ferencz said he&#8217;s excited Roblox allows creators to escape from the &#8220;orthodoxies&#8221; of free-to-play gaming, where the economics often drive game design decisions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Roblox truly is the metaverse for this younger generation,&#8221; he argued. &#8220;What they are finding here is something that transcends gaming, it&#8217;s human co-experience. What that means is that each game needs to have a very distinctive and attractive immersion to it, in a way that mobile free-to-play doesn’t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, part of Roblox&#8217;s appeal is the fact that individual creators don&#8217;t need to work with large teams or publishers, but Ferencz said, &#8220;Superstar developers and creators are thinking about bigger and bigger games, the sophistication is really evolving at a rapid pace.&#8221; That, in turn, means bigger teams, and &#8220;when you have bigger teams, you have more process, you need to know how to structure high-performing teams and drive positive teamwork between people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As the business gets bigger, you need people focused on the business opportunities, dedicated marketing functions, a dedicated live operations team,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;That’s what we offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ferencz and Gamefan&#8217;s business team have been involved in the Roblox platform for several years now, but he admitted, &#8220;Although we get it, we don&#8217;t get it exactly the way people who have been playing on it since they were 10 and developing for it since 15 get it &#8230; We respect that and lean into that.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qxwi2l4fiMw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;' sandbox='allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation'></iframe></p>
<p>So one of the key elements to the Gamefam approach, he said, is to make sure the creators are driving the game development process.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that there needs to be a visionary or a team of visionaries on each project, and that they need to decide what is right,&#8221; Ferencz said. &#8220;There will then be a team around them that is part of a consensus process, that the visionaries are responsible for bringing along for a ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>And as he thinks about Gamefam&#8217;s future, Ferencz said the company could eventually publish games on other platforms. Don&#8217;t expect it to happen anytime soon, though.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our focus is UGC gaming, and Roblox is the only place that matters in UGC gaming today,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We plan to build a huge brand and media business hand-in-hand with the Roblox platform. In the long term, if other platforms become relevant, then course we will be looking to evaluate and expand on those platforms —but the truth is, right now we couldn’t be more all about Roblox.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://huggingface.co">Hugging Face</a> has raised a $40 million Series B funding round — Addition is leading the round. The company has been building an open source library for natural language processing (NLP) technologies. You can find the <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers">Transformers</a> library on GitHub — it has 42,000 stars and 10,000 forks.</p>
<p>Existing investors Lux Capital, A.Capital and Betaworks also participated in today’s funding round. Other investors include Dev Ittycheria, Olivier Pomel, Alex Wang, Aghi Marietti, Florian Douetteau, Richard Socher, Paul St. John, Kevin Durant and Rich Kleiman.</p>
<p>With Transformers, you can leverage popular NLP models, such as BERT, GPT, XLNet, T5 or DistilBERT and use those models to manipulate text in one way or another. For instance, you can classify text, extract information, automatically answer questions, summarize text, generate text, etc.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>There are many different use cases for NLP. A popular one has been support chatbot. For instance, challenger bank <a href="https://monzo.com">Monzo</a> has been using Hugging Face behind the scenes to answer questions from its customers. Overall, around 5,000 companies are using Hugging Face in one way or another, including Microsoft with its search engine Bing.</p>
<p>When it comes to business model, the startup has recently <a href="https://huggingface.co/pricing">launched</a> a way to get prioritized support, manage private models and host the inference API for you. Clients include Bloomberg, Typeform and Grammarly.</p>
<p>With the new funding round, the company plans to triple its headcount in New York and Paris — there will be remote positions too. Interestingly, the company is also sharing some details about its bank account.</p>
<p>Hugging Face has been cash-flow positive in January and February 2021. The company raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/17/hugging-face-raises-15-million-to-build-the-definitive-natural-language-processing-library/">a $15 million round</a> a little over a year ago — 90% of the previous round is still available on the bank account. And the company’s valuation saw a fivefold increase. This shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise as you can negotiate better terms if you don&#8217;t actually need to raise.</p>
<p>And it looks like Hugging Face is on the right path as the company is hosting a vibrant community of NLP developers. You can browse <a href="https://huggingface.co/models">models</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets">datasets</a>, take advantage of them and contribute as Hugging Face is becoming the central brick of NLP enthusiasts.</p>
