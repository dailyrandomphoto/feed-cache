					<description><![CDATA[With just 22 days left until the holiday shopping season begins, we spoke to several growth marketers to find out how 2021's supply chain meltdowns are impacting their campaign planning.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Because we&#8217;re just 22 days from the official start of the holiday shopping season, we reached out to several growth marketers we&#8217;ve gotten to know through our TechCrunch Experts project to find out how this year&#8217;s supply chain issues are effecting their planned campaigns.</p>
<p>We spoke with:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliolopez87">Julio Lopez</a>, director of client strategy, retail practice lead, <a href="https://movableink.com/">Movable Ink</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christoy/">Chris Toy</a>, CEO and co-founder, <a href="https://marketerhire.com/">Marketer Hire</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristindick/">Kristin Dick</a>, head of operations and growth marketer, <a href="https://tuffgrowth.com/">Tuff</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/diptiparmar/">Dipti Parmar</a>, founder, <a href="https://diptiparmar.com/">Dipti Parmar Consulting</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The global supply chain disruptions we&#8217;ve seen so far this year will take time to repair. Even as vaccinated employees get back to work, a kaleidoscope of bottlenecks remain: truck driver shortages, congestion at shipping ports and the scarcity of empty shipping containers and the vessels that can carry them.</p>
<p>In quarterly earnings calls, &#8220;there were adjustments made to projections based on the fact that there&#8217;s no telling what challenges we might face going into Q4, as far as supply chain,&#8221; said Lopez. To maximize order flow and meet customer expectations, Dick said her company moved up its campaign start dates by 2-3 weeks and plans to lean more heavily on SMS and email campaigns than in the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I look at what&#8217;s happening with these companies from a marketing perspective it&#8217;s all good, solid fundamentals,&#8221; Toy advised. &#8220;A lot of this frankly is what you should be doing year-round.&#8221; Considering the marketing basics, and learning how to pivot at a moment&#8217;s notice, these marketers are ready for the holiday shopping season. Are you?</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s a growth marketer that you think we should know about, please fill out the survey below.</p>

<h2>Julio Lopez, director of client strategy, retail practice lead, Movable Ink</h2>
<p>Not only is the pandemic a big consideration and supply chain challenge, but we’re also faced with some natural disasters. There&#8217;s been flooding; there&#8217;s been fires. There are many things that are impacting retailers’ ability to control their supply chain. We&#8217;re hearing everything from products not being manufactured to things being stuck at ports of entry, because there isn&#8217;t enough staff, or there aren’t enough shipping containers to get things over here from China.</p>
<p>This is something that is very much top of mind for a lot of retailers and listening to some earning calls in the last quarter, there were adjustments made to projections based on the fact that there&#8217;s no telling what challenges we might face going into Q4, as far as supply chain.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s very important for retailers to be aware that their marketing plans and the SKUs or lines that they were looking to feature at a particular point in time in Q4, may or may not be available. They&#8217;re going to have to be ready to pivot their marketing calendars to account for inventory that may or may not be in stock. So that&#8217;s another place where data and the value of data become even more important.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More fuel for social audio: Berlin-based social audio startup <a href="https://beams.fm/">Beams</a>, which is building a platform for sharing and consuming short-form audio recordings &#8212; as a sort of bite-sized/deconstructed and/or collaborative podcast format which it bills as &#8220;audio-based social media&#8221; &#8212; has doubled its seed funding, adding another $3 million to close out the round at $6M.</p>
<p>&#8220;We raised $3M in late 2020. While in the testing phase, we had very high interest and attention from investors. So in early summer of this year we decided to take on two new strategic investors &#8212; The Venture City and Kal Vepuri &#8212; bringing our overall seed funding to $6M,&#8221; explain two of Beams&#8217; four co-founders (and its co-CEOs), Alan Sternberg and Robert Kilian, on why it&#8217;s taking more funding now.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/onbeams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crunchbase</a>, the 2019 founded audio startup&#8217;s earlier seed and pre-seed investors were Mangrove Capital Partners and Redalpine.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229878" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Beams counts former Soundcloud, Spotify, and N26 employees among its founding team &#8212; and its PR touts a &#8220;deep understanding of why people connect around voice&#8221;.</p>
<p>Its wider pitch is to create a platform where people can &#8220;come together and share diverse views on different trends and interests&#8221; &#8212; which is something we&#8217;ve heard from a variety of social audio startups, such as the (advice focused) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/14/anyone-is-building-a-marketplace-for-advice-one-5-minute-call-at-a-time/">Anyone</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/wisdom-is-a-social-audio-app-for-opening-access-to-mentorship/">Wisdom</a>, to name two others that also hail from Europe.</p>
<p>Users on Beams are encouraged to join interest-based groups and (asynchronously) listen or clip into topic-based threads &#8212; on, well, whatever you want to talk about, be it art or politics, fashion, food or music etc etc&#8230;</p>
<p>Topics on Beams are a real pick&#8217;n&#8217;mix &#8212; and the overall experience can feel pretty random. Like the aural equivalent of a splatter-painting.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8216;Real people, real voices&#8217; is the slogan Beams has come up with for its app-based alternative to switching on (and dialling around) talk radio. (Or, well, logging onto <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/clubhouse-language-support-android/">Clubhouse</a> &#8212; or hopping into a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/twitter-now-lets-you-tune-into-spaces-without-an-account-via-direct-links/">Twitter Space</a> to hear what some of your followers, or someone else&#8217;s, are nattering about.)</p>
<p>Finding the signal in the noice of social audio is turning out to be the real challenge.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="amcKoxcu3C"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse/">Clubhouse closes an undisclosed $4B valuation Series C round, as tech giants&#8217; clones circle</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Clubhouse closes an undisclosed $4B valuation Series C round, as tech giants&#8217; clones circle&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/clubhouse/embed/#?secret=amcKoxcu3C" data-secret="amcKoxcu3C" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Audio clips on Beam are hard-capped at 90 seconds but recordings can be shorter (although as threads build they work against that by stringing sound snippets together). So it&#8217;s using quasi-brevity as a device to try to cut through.</p>
<p>And if &lt;90s is still not short enough for your attention span a button in the app let&#8217;s you speed up playback to up to 2x so it takes even less time for your ears to consume each audio tidbit. (You can also slow playback speed to 0.75x.)</p>
<p>A quick spin around the app suggests content creators are in fairly short supply on Beam. Some of the featured threads on the home page containing just one or two responses, for example. And a few minutes of browsing also turns up the same handful of faces contributing to a variety of threads &#8212; some of whom we confirmed to be Beams staff.</p>
<p>So organic community-building looks like a work in progress.</p>
<p>Beams says its early users comprise a real &#8220;range&#8221;, from young people exchanging stories/memories around cultural themes or past events; to pro audio content creators doing 60 second interviews for sharing elsewhere; to photographers using the form to give people on their art a voice; to citizen journalists recording events on the go.</p>
<p>Many of the featured groups/topics we saw appear to be obvious seeds to try to encourage content generation (&#8216;the best advice you have ever received&#8217;; &#8216;breakfast around the world&#8217; etc); or groups labelled &#8216;Open Mic&#8217; &#8212; which nudge users to share their stories around specific themes (like women&#8217;s &#8216;Uber Stories&#8217;, or &#8216;Tinder Stories&#8217;).</p>
<p>While the group we saw that had the largest number of members (~1k) was an open pitch around podcast ideas and soliciting help for podcast projects.</p>
<p>In general, groups had far fewer members and seemed more focused/niche &#8212; say aimed at illuminating a specific local issues (&#8216;Police reform in Minneapolis explained&#8217;). Or narrating a specific perspective/experience (&#8217;20 years after 9/11&#8242;). Or trying to eke out travel/food tips (&#8216;Best Vegan Spots Las Vegas&#8217;). But quite why you&#8217;d need some of those sorts of content in an audio form vs text is one question to ponder.</p>
<p>One of the more interesting groups we encountered &#8212; &#8220;Young, Black &amp; Fly&#8221; (59 members) &#8212; describes itself as &#8220;a micro podcast about art, film &amp; music for all, through the lenses of young black creatives&#8221;, and was doing bite-sized back-and-forth interviews with creators across a variety of artistic mediums.</p>
<p>On the less interesting side there was the obligatory NFT daily news group (18 members).</p>
<p>Beams&#8217; short-form audio format lends itself to holding Q&amp;A style interviews between a group host and an invited guest. Which means the entire interview ends up deconstructed into discoverable/sharable chunks. But the downside of that is it&#8217;s less immersive than tuning into a full-fat podcast/radio show.</p>
<p>Open groups aim to recreate the Q&amp;A vibe but without active curation by asking anyone who feels like it to chip in. Which means the resulting thread can be, well, a mixed bag in terms of interest/quality from the listener&#8217;s perspective.</p>
<p>Overall, Beams feels like it&#8217;s still very much in the experimental phase.</p>
<p>Nor is it yet clear whether it&#8217;s onto something with bite-size &#8216;micropods&#8217; for the attention-strapped (post-radio) generation. Or, well, adding to the social audio noise.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Asked how many users the app has, Beams co-founders hedge their response &#8212; saying &#8220;we know of more than 40,000 unique users participating in over 5,000 groups&#8221; &#8212; so presumably it has fewer active users (and the group metric is being actively driven by Beams&#8217; own staff). </span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Although it only beta launched in May 2021 so it is still early days.</span></p>
<p>Why focus on short-form audio as a social media medium? &#8220;The short-form recorded audio space needs innovation, from both a creator and consumer point of view,&#8221; Sternberg and Kilian suggest.</p>
<p>&#8220;To create good audio content with today’s options, the bar is very high. You need hardware, you need real expertise in speaking, and it simply is not built for the mainstream. The average person has a hard time making audio content because there’s just too much friction.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it comes to consumption, that too, isn’t really easy. For instance, the only way to know if a podcast or a live audio session is going to be useful or entertaining or worth your time is to listen to it! You don’t know how it’s going to turn out, you can’t navigate your way to &#8216;the good part&#8217; and again, it’s just not a really easy thing to dive into unless you totally know and trust the person creating the content.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to build innovative solutions for this &#8212; to help people enjoy audio recordings and hearing another person’s voice in a simple way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clearly they&#8217;re not there yet on surfacing purely &#8216;worthy listens&#8217;, though.</p>
<p>Chunking up audio into 90s (meaning you inexorably have to listen to a lot of repetitive &#8216;hello/intro&#8217; spiel) and providing a button for users to crank it to 2x speed of the human voice is a far cry from only airing amazing audio.</p>
<p>Indeed, it sort of implies you think a lot of the content will be skippable. And if your tools to help listeners cut through boring bits end up creating filler audio in the process &#8212; including by soliciting audio content from anyone, voicing thoughts and making recordings of any quality &#8212; the whole approach might be, well, a bit counterproductive&#8230; (Alternatively, Beams may just not yet have found its groove; Communities do take time to nurture and grow.)</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s co-CEO also reckon that current audio platforms are lacking &#8220;intuitive ways for people to connect&#8221;, arguing: &#8220;There is no topic-related and equally interactive audio platform out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beams&#8217; focus is on building tools that &#8220;let people easily record their thoughts in different ways and share them into groups and topics&#8221;, they say, emphasizing the goal of structuring audio.</p>
<p>They also describe what they&#8217;re building as &#8220;an extended audio player for people to be a part of voice threads &#8212; similar to the music streaming services&#8221;. And say they&#8217;re planning to add audio transcriptions and enable Beams&#8217; voice recordings to be exported to other social networks for consuming there too.</p>
<p>Adding other forms of interactions around voice threads is also on their to-do list.</p>
<p>As well as focusing on building &#8220;simple and inclusive&#8221; tools for sharing and consuming audio, Sternberg and Kilian say the aim is to differentiate in a competitive space by being more open vs (more) closed competitors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;While most other audio platforms put everything solely in their apps or behind logged-in walls, we don’t like to force people into a closed ecosystem to connect with each other,&#8221; they say, adding: &#8220;We really see ourselves as more of a platform for building audio solutions, not just as a social media network, since we are also available and open on the Web, where you don’t have to be logged in or even have <span class="il">Beams</span> as an app.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;Our aim is to give people a way to collect and share voices on the street, provide journalists and media a way to easily embed and share stories, and let friends share their voices on the apps they prefer &#8212; whether that be WhatsApp, Telegram, or Signal.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">What about monetization? That&#8217;s not even a conversation for Beams&#8217; co-CEOs yet.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;We are all about building a platform, and a community around collaborative short-form audio. By looking closely at how different user groups use our product we learn and we are sure we will introduce meaningful ways for our community and us to generate revenue in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">And moderation? &#8220;Moderation will be a big challenge but recorded audio content (which is transcribed into text as well) allows us to build more products to protect our community,&#8221; they suggest.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The company offers a recurring subscription, and 50% of every dollar spent goes back to farmers.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Julia Niiro is on a mission to create a food supply chain that connects small farmers directly to consumers.</p>
<p>Niiro started <a href="https://www.localmilkrun.com/?utm_source=TechCrunch&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=Series%20A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MilkRun</a>, a subscription service delivering weekly grocery staples sourced from small, local farms, in 2018 after becoming a small farmer herself in Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p>She had purchased a meat-processing company and was working with area ranchers when she learned that 85% of farmers are over 65 years old and were being asked to increase food output as populations increase, yet only profiting 10 cents on every dollar.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229571" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>“Our model is to increase profits by helping small farmers get more of their goods purchased,” she told TechCrunch. “Like the traditional milkman model, people buy directly from the farm and have it delivered. This next wave of the food industry will be how to reduce the middle.”</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Hacking lettuce for taste and profit&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/bowery-tc1-produce/embed/#?secret=4CzQ3f14lW" data-secret="4CzQ3f14lW" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The company grew 15x in 2020, and to keep that momentum going, MilkRun raised $6 million in Series A funding. Spark Capital led the investment and was joined by existing investors Revolution’s Rise of the Rest Seed Fund, Social Impact Capital and Congruent VC. The latest infusion gives the company a total of $10 million, which includes money raised after attending Techstars and Y Combinator in 2020, Niiro said.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229770" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229770" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2229770 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Julia-Niiro-Headshot.png?w=680" alt="Julia Niiro, MikRun" width="680" height="680" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229770" class="wp-caption-text">MilkRun founder and CEO Julia Niiro</p></div></p>
<p>The new funding enables MilkRun to expand its delivery service to include Seattle and Austin — and a fourth unnamed market coming early next year — and to launch new products. The company recently unveiled a new bacon offering as part of the subscription service and is working with butchers to supply different styles and cuts. The company is also working with seafood suppliers in the Pacific Northwest and will use the funding to add seafood to its other markets.</p>
<p>MilkRun is working with over 300 small and mid-sized farms. Users go online and choose the products they want, like eggs, meat, produce and bread. The company offers a recurring subscription, with no minimum order or subscription fees, and free contactless delivery. Fifty percent of every dollar spent goes back to the farmers, Niiro said.</p>
<p>Since launching the service in 2019, one of the things she has enjoyed is learning alongside the farmers. The opportunity cost is high for farmers as they increase their buying power, so it has been “a relationship game” from the start as MilkRun works through the long list of farmers it wants to work with, getting them quickly integrated into the subscription service and building the infrastructure, she added.</p>
<p>“There has always been this tipping point and need for local food, but this chain has been broken for a long time,” Niiro said. “It is time to tip the scales back to sustainability based on small and mid-sized farmers. Commodity prices are rising to meet the level of food needs, so we are accelerating the awareness of the opportunity to really rebuild these systems and the direct world of commerce.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Niiro also said she was excited to bring on Spark Capital as the lead, referring to the venture capital firm as “a true backer of big visions and ideas.” She explained that the food industry is a massive system that is complex, and the company is a long game play as it makes inroads into the supply chain and works on its next phase of activating the full network of small farmers to be “the largest farmer’s market in the country.”</p>
<p>Kevin Thau, general partner at Spark Capital, said that mission is one of the reasons the firm invested in MilkRun. Spark is attracted to consumer plays, but Thau was initially a strong holdout on grocery ordering, even as more people ordered food online as a result of the global pandemic, he said.</p>
<p>A self-proclaimed “picky customer” when it comes to choosing his own fruits and vegetables, his negative experiences with food delivery companies led him to embrace the farmer’s market, often taking drives out to the country to get good basic food items.</p>
<p>Thau noted that a majority of people typically buy the same grocery staples each week, so rather than search through thousands of SKUs for products, MilkRun is working to be that online.</p>
<p>“MilkRun is following the trend of simplifying things so people can choose less, but the choice is highly curated,” he added. “Julia has a great story, vision and passion. She is also unique in they way she started a technology company. She is all about local farmers, and her vision for the future is one that we buy into. People crave that local business and farm stand as they get more in tune with sustainability and climate change.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[AKUA aims to replace the unsustainable part of food — factory farming — with regenerative ocean farming.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/06/17/2248614/0/en/Global-Meat-Substitute-Market-Is-Expected-to-Reach-8-82-Billion-by-2027-Says-AMR.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global meat substitute market</a> was valued at $4.51 billion two years ago and is expected to double by 2027, attracting startups, like alternative meat food tech company <a href="https://akua.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AKUA</a>, that aim to solidify a prominent place in the up-and-coming industry.</p>
<p>Former technology journalist Courtney Boyd Myers co-founded AKUA with Matthew Lebo, who was an adviser to GreenWave, a nonprofit that trains ocean farmers, five years ago after seeking out a career where she could leave a legacy and fulfill her mission of reversing climate change.</p>
<p>Growing up with a father who was a food marketer, Boyd Myers said she saw firsthand what eating a diet of fast-food can do to a person and was always looking for more healthy food options that also had a positive benefit for the planet.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229731" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2229753" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229753" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2229753" title="Rachel Ayotte" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CBM-KELP-copy.jpg?w=680" alt="Courtney Boyd Myers" width="500" height="500" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CBM-KELP-copy.jpg 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CBM-KELP-copy.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CBM-KELP-copy.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CBM-KELP-copy.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CBM-KELP-copy.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CBM-KELP-copy.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CBM-KELP-copy.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CBM-KELP-copy.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CBM-KELP-copy.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CBM-KELP-copy.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229753" class="wp-caption-text">AKUA co-founder and CEO Courtney Boyd Myers. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Rachel Ayotte</p></div></p>
<p>The co-founders initially thought of replacing the unsustainable part of food — factory farming — with regenerative ocean farming. When a friend offered the chance to look at a kelp farm, she went and liked it so much that AKUA was born.</p>
<p>Today, AKUA announced a $3.2 million seed round, led by Vibrant Ventures, to give the company $5.4 million in total fundraising to date. The total funds include backing from a Republic campaign and capital from the co-founders.</p>
<p>The round also included participation from a group that includes Pegasus Sustainable Finance, Halogen Ventures, Fifth Down Capital, Alumni Ventures Group, Karmagawa, New England Patriots coach and former linebacker Jerod Mayo, beauty founder Cristina Carlino, SmartyPants CEO Courtney Nichols Gould, Sir Kensington&#8217;s co-founder Brandon Child, Gellert Global Group president Andy Gellert, SOA&#8217;s Seabird Ventures and the Blue Angels.</p>
<p>In 2019, the company came out with its first product, Kelp Jerky, which comes in four flavors, and was a product Boyd Myers thought would be a good trial run to help people see ocean-farmed kelp in a new way.</p>
<p>“It was hit-or-miss, but is very healthy,” she added. “We went back to the drawing board during the pandemic on a new product and invented The Kelp Burger.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The burger is vegan, non-GMO, soy-free and gluten-free, created from ocean-farmed kelp, cremini mushrooms, pea protein, black beans, quinoa, crushed tomatoes and superfoods.</p>
<p>However, because they could not do the food tastings they were able to with the jerky, they decided to start a food club and sent samples of the burger in the mail. Ultimately 1,000 customers signed up, and The Kelp Burger is now the “hero product,” Boyd Myers said.</p>
<p>Meat alternatives are known to have some <a href="https://www.consumerfreedom.com/2021/07/5-chemicals-lurking-in-plant-based-meats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chemical preservatives</a> and other hard-to-pronounce ingredients in them, which can defeat the purpose of seeking out a healthier option. There are even startups looking into that, like Shiru, which recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/27/biotech-startup-shiru-sprouting-plant-based-ingredients-with-new-capital-infusion/">raised $17 million</a> to develop more healthier bonding agents for meat.</p>
<p>Boyd Myers noted those claims were inspiration for how AKUA approached developing the ingredient list for its kelp burger, which has <a href="https://akua.co/products/kelp-burger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">15 ingredients</a>, all of which are food or food-derived.</p>
<p>“The first wave of plant-based eating was the Boca Burger, beans and tofu,” she added. “The second wave is Impossible and Beyond, and the third wave is going to be the return to whole foods and clean eating. We are only as great as the giants that came before us, and if it wasn’t for them, we wouldn’t be here today doing a better plant-based burger.”</p>
<p>AKUA started selling via direct to consumers in May and currently ships to all states except Alaska and Hawaii. Boyd Myers explained that there are sales and repeat customers, but it was too early to discuss growth metrics. However, the company is dabbling in retail locations and has preorders from over 100 stores in New York, and she expects those will go out in the coming months, followed by stores in San Francisco and Los Angeles.</p>

<p>In addition to the jerky and burger, the AKUA portfolio also includes Kelp Pasta. The new funding will be used on R&amp;D for new products in the areas of alternative meat and plant-based seafood that also looks at what more can be done with kelp and other foods, like lentils.</p>
<p>AKUA soft-launched a kelp ground meat product and will have a kelp crab cake product coming out in the second quarter of 2022, Boyd Myers said. The company will also hire additional talent and ramp up its sales and marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Boyd Myers said she was excited to work with Vibrant Ventures founder Jarret Christie, to whom she was introduced by other founders. Vibrant Ventures is a new plant-based fund out of Los Angeles that launched in July.</p>
<p>As Christie got to know Boyd Myers, he saw her as a community builder who was building a movement away from factory farming, fighting climate change and helping people have access to lower-cost healthier foods.</p>
<p>“Kelp was not on anyone’s radar six months ago, but is now being considered for crop feed, packaging and crop fertilization,” he said. “She is working hand-in-hand with kelp growers; I believe this is just the beginning.”</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">The company formerly known as Facebook has been discussing the possibility of opening retail stores way before it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">rebranded</a> itself as Meta, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/technology/facebook-stores-meta-metaverse.html?referringSource=articleShare" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="18" data-v9y="1"><em>The New York Times</em></a>. Apparently, discussions about opening brick-and-mortar shops started last year, though nothing has been finalized, and the project could still end up being scrapped. If Meta does open physical outlets, however, they will reportedly be more like experience stores introducing people to devices developed by its Reality Labs division rather than outright retail shops.</p>
<p>Those devices include the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">Oculus Quest</a> (soon to be Meta Quest) virtual reality headsets and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-portal-go-review-140033819.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="20" data-v9y="1">Portal</a> gadgets, which were designed primarily for video calling. The stores could also showcase the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-smart-glasses-ar-160006477.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="21" data-v9y="1">augmented reality smart glasses</a> called Stories that Facebook developed with Ray-Ban. Based on the documents <em>The Times</em> saw, Meta&#8217;s goal is to spark &#8220;curiosity&#8221; and &#8220;closeness&#8221; with its stores, as well as provide customers with a welcoming atmosphere where they can have a &#8220;judgment free journey&#8221; while experimenting with headsets.</p>
<p>Those same documents show that Meta envisions shops with a modern, minimalist aesthetic and subtle branding placement. The company considered a lot of possible names, such as Facebook Hub, Facebook Commons, Facebook Innovations, Facebook Reality Store and From Facebook. It eventually settled on Facebook Store, but that will mostly likely change now that the company has been renamed.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229882" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>If Meta does push through with this plan, its first retail/experience store will be located in Burlingame, California, where there&#8217;s a Reality Labs office. <em>The Times </em>says the project could eventually span the world, though, with locations in various countries and regions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In the wake of a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/gm-invests-300m-in-chinas-first-self-driving-car-unicorn-momenta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$300 million investment</a> from General Motors in September, Momenta, an autonomous driving solution provider from China, announced today an additional $500 million added to its Series C round.</p>
<p>The new injection brings the total of the startup&#8217;s Series C to over $1 billion. Momenta adapts what it calls a two-legged strategy of supplying advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to auto OEMs like GM and Tier 1 suppliers like Bosch, while conducting R&amp;D on truly unmanned vehicles, that is, Level 4 driving.</p>
<p>The startup has assembled a list of heavyweight strategic investors, including China&#8217;s state-owned SAIC Motor, GM, Toyota, Mercedes Benz, and Bosch. Singapore&#8217;s sovereign fund Temasek and Jack Ma&#8217;s Yunfeng Capital are among its institutional investors.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229869" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Momenta often speaks of how its alliance with car manufacturers differentiates itself from its peers, which have chosen a more cash-intensive route of developing in-house robotaxi fleets. Instead, it counts on<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/momenta-profile/"> gleaning data from a network</a> of mass-produced vehicles powered by its solutions. Pony.ai and WeRide are among its closest rivals and have also raised a significant amount of capital.</p>
<p>In the case of the GM deal, Momenta&#8217;s solution, which uses a mix of consumer-grade millimeter-wave radars and high-definition cameras, will be used in GM&#8217;s vehicles sold in China <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/gm-invests-300m-in-chinas-first-self-driving-car-unicorn-momenta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rather than the United States</a>. The startup recently opened its first overseas office in Stuttgart to be closer to its German partners, which may imply the footprint of its technology could extend beyond its home market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tencent unveiled its progress in chips for the first time this week, which immediately gave its stock price a<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-03/tencent-unveils-first-chips-in-push-beyond-online-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> modest boost</a>. Silicon seems distant from the giant&#8217;s main arenas of video games and social networks, so observers suggest that Tencent&#8217;s move is to signal that it&#8217;s aligned with China&#8217;s long-run goals to self-develop semiconductors at a time its gaming unit is under a slate of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/11/china-roundup-tencent-takes-on-sites-trying-to-circumvent-its-age-limits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">regulatory assaults</a>. Other major tech powerhouses, from Alibaba, Baidu, to Huawei, have all answered Beijing&#8217;s silicon push with their in-house chips.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for a company with as much data to handle as Tencent, one should wonder why it didn&#8217;t get in on semiconductors earlier.</p>
<p>The three chips Tencent <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Pu1NUnCfZGdxZN2XFI4DRg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> on Wednesday are all custom built: one for AI inference, one for video transcoding, and another for network interface.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229831" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>There have been ample examples where internet behemoths start building their own specialized hardware to buttress their existing businesses. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/18/facebook-has-a-new-job-posting-calling-for-chip-designers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Back in 2018</a>, Facebook was already hiring AI chip designers, who could potentially help tackle misinformation and process its gargantuan amount of user data.</p>
<p>Tencent, with over one billion monthly users on its flagship WeChat messenger, surely has a lot of digital footprints to handle.</p>
<p>But WeChat&#8217;s steward Allen Zhang is famously reserved about exploiting personal data. Till now, WeChat&#8217;s user feed is still kept chronological with native ads that sporadically pop up.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we analyze [users’ chat history], we can bring great advertising revenue to the company. But we don’t do that, so WeChat cares a lot about user privacy,” Zhang <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/wechat-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> at WeChat&#8217;s annual conference last year. He wants WeChat to be a useful, disposable tool rather than an app that soaks up people&#8217;s time with addictive, algorithmic recommendations.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>But Zhang seems to have made concessions. WeChat now includes a short video section with the barebone functions of TikTok. Like TikTok, WeChat&#8217;s video feature infers what users like and serves up content accordingly.</p>
<p>Tencent has a slew of other business lines that could benefit from greater machine learning power and are perhaps more eager to monetize: Tencent News, its news aggregator, and Tencent Video, its Netflix equivalent. Under China&#8217;s strict censorship environment, content providers may also find themselves in need of more computing power to root out text, audio and videos that violate government rules.</p>
<p>Dowson Tong, Tencent&#8217;s senior vice president, explained that the firm&#8217;s AI inference chip will be used for image and video processing, natural language processing, search, among other scenarios. The chip for video transcoding, as the name implies, will ensure smoothness and low latency as Tencent handles its massive video workload. Lastly, the smart network interface card (SmartNIC) will be used for CPU server offloads, according to Tong.</p>
<p>Tencent won&#8217;t be working on chips alone. Tong noted in his speech that the company will create an ecosystem to maintain &#8220;deep, strategic collaborations with chip domestic and overseas chip companies.&#8221; For instance, Tencent has backed Shanghai-based Enflame, which specializes in AI training chips, in four funding rounds and is already <a href="https://www.sohu.com/a/443262059_120159035" target="_blank" rel="noopener">applying the startup&#8217;s tech to its business</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Let&#8217;s get this out of the way: The $2,199 DJI Mavic 3 is excellent and I didn&#8217;t get to try all the new features yet.</p>
<p>The Mavic 3 is DJI&#8217;s latest top-of-the-line consumer drone. It&#8217;s foldable, expensive, and packs an impressive dual-lens camera and dramatically better drone-to-controller communication. The Mavic 3 is easily DJI&#8217;s best consumer drone yet. Unfortunately, a few key features were not available on pre-launch firmware, so a full review is in the works.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new.</strong></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229041" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<ul>
<li>Dual-camera system that features a custom Hasselblad L2D-20c aerial camera. It has two lenses: a 4/3 CMOS sensor with a 24mm prime lens &amp; a 28x hybrid zoom telephoto lens.</li>
<li>First DJI drone that can transmit live 1080p/60fps video from the drone to the controller</li>
<li>Support for Apple ProRes 422 HQ and H.264/H.265 with video capabilities up to 5.1k@50fps, DCI 4k@120fps, 4k@120fps</li>
<li>Improved vision sensing system able to detect items from .5 to 200 meters thanks to new, improved sensors</li>
<li>46 minutes of flight time (5000 mAh battery)</li>
</ul>
<p>DJI sent me a Mavic 3 last week, and I&#8217;ve been flying it nonstop. However, several key features were unavailable until the drone officially launched. Before today, I was unable to test the drone&#8217;s new ActiveTrack 5.0 system and APAS 5.0 object detection &#8212; both are said to be significant upgrades over past versions. As such, I&#8217;m unable to confirm DJI&#8217;s claims, and I&#8217;m eager to try the new ActiveTrack system. Past DJI implications failed to impress.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2229067" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-3.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="384" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-3.jpg 4758w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-3.jpg?resize=150,56 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-3.jpg?resize=300,112 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-3.jpg?resize=768,288 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-3.jpg?resize=680,255 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-3.jpg?resize=1536,575 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-3.jpg?resize=2048,767 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-3.jpg?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2>Camera</h2>
<p>The DJI Mavic 3 features a new camera system that includes two lenses. The primary lens is a beast: 20 MP 4/3 CMOS sensor, 24mm prime lens, 84° field of view. The second camera features a 162mm telephoto lens with a 28x hybrid zoom affair. This system gives the Mavic 3 a fantastic prime lens and offloads the dirty work of zooming to a second camera.</p>
<p>With the new camera comes new supported video formats. The Mavic 3 supports encoding in Apple ProRes 422 HQ, DCI 4k, and 5.1k. However, the Apple ProRess 422 HQ encoding is only available on the more expensive Mavic 3, the $4,999 Mavic 3 Cine edition (it also includes a 1TB SSD).</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The images straight off the camera are stunning. I compared the images to those captured using the DJI Air 2S, and the differences are noticeable with deeper tones and more nuance in shadows. Details are crisp and sharp.</p>
<p>Look for a full report in the coming days. Several key video features were locked until DJI officially announced the Mavic 3. I need to test the drone using the latest firmware.</p>
<h2>Object Detention</h2>
<p>I crash a lot of drones, and it&#8217;s not for lack of caring. I push them farther (and closer) than they should go. And props are cheap, too. But I haven&#8217;t crashed the Mavic 3 yet despite my best attempts. The drone sees everything.</p>
<p>Features like object detection and crash mitigation have been standard features on drones for several generations. Still, this latest version features upgraded capabilities, including detecting objects at a greater distance and a closer range.</p>
<p>As of writing, DJI had yet to update the drone to the latest firmware that included significant updates to the Mavic 3&#8217;s capabilities. However, even using pre-release software, the Mavic 3 is impressive.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Fall in Michigan, and most of the leaves are off the trees. The Mavic 3 doesn&#8217;t care. I found it&#8217;s easily able to detect even the smallest branch. The drone can either stop or attempt to bypass the object.</p>
<p>I took the drone for a walk through the woods. For the most part, it managed to walk itself, sliding side to side to avoid obstacles. I just had to direct the drone forward, and it found its own path. This was capable with past DJI drones, but it was not nearly this smooth. I never trusted the older crash mitigation systems. This one feels much improved.</p>
<p>Like the Mavic Pro 2, the Mavic 3 has sensors watching every corner of the drone. In addition, there are six fish-eye vision sensors and two wide-angle sensors. DJI calls this omnidirectional obstacle sensing, and its capabilities are a step above that found on the Air 2S, which only watches in four directions.</p>
<h2>Range</h2>
<p>Owners are going to notice two things about the Mavic 3 over past models. One, this drone has a much more robust communication connection. I didn&#8217;t lose contact with the drone flying in spots past drones would cut out. The Mavic 3 streams live video to the controller at 1080p/60 &#8212; that&#8217;s twice the frame rates as past models and it&#8217;s very noticeable.</p>
<p>DJI claims that the maximum transmission range is 15km. That&#8217;s over 9 miles, and due to FAA regulations, I&#8217;m unable to test that range. However, this drone has a serious range.</p>
<p>I took the Mavic 3 around to several familiar spots during my short time with the drone, including an abandoned urban area with low bridges over a river. I like to fly drones in this area. Past drones (DJI Air 2S and Mavic Pro 2) struggle to maintain connection when passing under the bridges. The Mavic 3 held its connection the whole time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I noticed the increase in transmission power when flying the drone in the cornfields behind my house. Often, other drones were able to skim the top of the field, but the range was dramatically cut when the drone was a few feet off the ground instead of hundreds of feet in the air. The Mavic 3 didn&#8217;t have that issue and managed to stream the live video to the controller at 1080p/60.</p>
<p>The live video preview is lovely. The drone now transmits in full 1080p HD at 60 fps when close enough. The increase in frame rates is delightful. In addition, the smoother video preview makes flying the drone more enjoyable.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="breakout aligncenter size-full wp-image-2229064" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-1.jpg 4384w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-1.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dji-mavic-3-1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<h2>Build quality</h2>
<ul>
<li>The construction and build quality is better than that found on the DJI Air 2. It feels solid and doesn&#8217;t look like a toy.</li>
<li>The Mavic 3&#8217;s prop arms are significantly thinner than those found on the smaller Air 2S.</li>
<li>The props are 4.5 inches. The props on the Air 2S are 3.5 inches.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Battery</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Mavic 3 uses a new battery design from previous models. It&#8217;s a four cell unit that weighs 335.5g. It slides into the drone&#8217;s body.</li>
<li>Charges over DJI&#8217;s preparatory connector. The charging dock uses USB-C.</li>
<li>Claimed battery life is 46 minutes. I saw, on average, around 30 minutes in windy conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Unavailable for testing at time of publication</h2>
<ul>
<li>120 fps video modes.</li>
<li>APAS 5.0 &#8212; The pre-launch firmware did not have the latest object detection and crash mitigation features. As such, the drone still featured past versions of this ability and was able to identify and avoid objects as small as a tiny tree branch.</li>
<li>ActiveTrack 5.0 &#8212; This feature will be available at a later, unannounced time. Supposedly, this system allows the Mavic 3 to track and follow an object no matter its direction of travel. Past versions of this feature were disappointing and limited mainly to tracking objects moving towards or away from the drone &#8212; not side to side or diagonally. I&#8217;m eager to try this new feature.</li>
<li>4G Network-Powered Transmission &#8212; This attachment will supposedly improve the video transmission by utilizing 4G network communication. This will be released at a later time and unavailable for testing at the time of writing.</li>
</ul>
<p>A full review is coming. Look for it next week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://scifounders.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciFounders</a>, an accelerator program and fund launched back in January with $6 million in backing, has a new proposition for the scientist founders who it looks to help run their own companies. It plans to give some of the teams it funds the voting rights that would normally come with its investment.</p>
<p>Why does it matter? Well, it&#8217;s a sign of the times in many ways. While venture capitalists have long been known for the many <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/12/7/11621208/four-ridiculous-demands-that-venture-capital-investors-make" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demands</a> they make on founders, entrepreneurs have been sitting comfortably in the driver&#8217;s seat in recent years, with VCs doing whatever they can to stay top of mind, from opening new offices and creating their own editorial arms, to offering term sheets in record time and waiving fresh checks at founders almost immediately after they close a funding round.</p>
<p>But SciFounders co-founder Matt Krisiloff argues that there&#8217;s much more to the thinking of SciFounders, which sprang up this year to cater to the growing number of PhDs for whom there are not enough spots in academia.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229667" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Krisiloff, who is himself a founder &#8212; he also runs a biotech company called Conception that&#8217;s trying to turn stem cells into human eggs &#8212; says he&#8217;s tired of watching biotech founders in particular lose control of their companies.</p>
<p>It happens &#8220;a lot of the time just because these startups are far more capital intensive,&#8221; Krisiloff notes. &#8220;You can start a software company with a couple thousand dollars in pre-seed funding, but a life science company probably needs a couple million dollars [to get started], so things can flip pretty quickly&#8221; against founders who can see their ownership and power diluted quickly.</p>
<p>What his outfit wants is to provide those scientists with more leverage, and if it has to come from SciFounders, that&#8217;s apparently fine. Says Krisiloff, &#8220;We think it would be great longer term for scientists to say, &#8216;We&#8217;re first-class citizens in charge of everything,&#8217; as is often the case in the software world, where you have the Collison brothers in charge of Stripe, or the Airbnb founders in charge of their company. We want to make sure that happens more widely for scientist founders, as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>SciFounders &#8212; which has so far provided $400,000 and mentorship to seven companies in exchange for a 10% stake &#8212; knows there is only so much impact that an outfit of its size can make.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Krisiloff also sounds unsurprised when we push back on the idea that limited partners will broadly go along with VCs who give away one of the few tools left at their disposal right now: their voting rights, which give them at least some say over corporate matters.</p>
<p>But he suggests that movements have to start somewhere. Besides, SciFounders thinks it has already hit a nerve, simply by providing more guidance to academics than they&#8217;ve historically received. Krisiloff says while SciFounders is working with just seven teams right now &#8212; outfits that it expects to actively help for up to a year because their &#8220;iteration cycles can take a super long time&#8221; &#8212; it has meanwhile received more than 1,000 other applicants, many of whom reached out to the team after a simple Twitter announcement about the outfit&#8217;s launch.</p>
<p>In addition to Krisiloff, who earlier ran a portfolio of research projects affiliated with Y Combinator, SciFounders was co-founded by Alexander Schubert, a molecular biologist who was most recently a postdoctoral research fellow with Genentech, and Lucas Harrington, a co-founder and the chief scientific officer of Mammoth Biosciences.</p>
<p>Among Harrington&#8217;s three other co-founders, of course, <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">is the CRISPR-Cas genome editing co-inventor Jennifer Doudna, who last year jointly won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with longtime collaborator Emmanuelle Charpentier.</span></p>

<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/google-play-to-support-alternative-billing-systems-in-south-korea-following-new-law/">Google launches third-party payment support in South Korea:</a> </strong>Developers with apps in the South Korean Google Play marketplace will have the ability to “offer alternative payment systems alongside Google’s own,” after a law passed in the country changed the rules. If that sounds like a small win, you haven’t been paying attention. Alphabet and Apple are hell-bent on keeping as much income from their app stores as possible, regardless of whether such actions are developer- or consumer-friendly.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/why-latams-fintech-boom-is-more-than-hype-and-superlative-venture-investment/">Latin American fintech startups are living up to their hype:</a></strong> If you are building a financial services company, Latin America is just about the hottest market for your wares. In the wake of record fundraising numbers, TechCrunch did a little digging into the space, learning what is driving the startup cohort forward. And, yes, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/nubanks-ipo-filing-gives-us-a-peek-into-neobank-economics/">Nubank’s IPO came into it</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/cruise-launches-driverless-robotaxi-service-for-employees-in-san-francisco/"><strong>Driverless taxis come to San Francisco:</strong></a><strong> </strong>You might have expected self-driving car services to <em>start </em>their lives in the City by the Bay. After all, per capita it is simply <em>lousy</em> with tech folks. But, given the city’s complex and hilly layout, it wasn’t. But now Cruise, Alphabet’s self-driving subsidiary, is running taxis there. And if they can do so in San Francisco, perhaps they will soon make it to our own cities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Before we dive into startup news, our own <a href="https://twitter.com/abracarioca">Anna Heim</a> has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/more-saas-companies-are-shifting-to-usage-based-pricing/">great dive into the current SaaS versus on-demand pricing debate</a> that I wholeheartedly recommend.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/gwoop-raises-1-8m-for-its-esports-training-platform-as-it-starts-working-with-high-school-gaming-leagues/"><strong>No, Gwoop is not Whoop for Goop:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Instead, Gwoop is an esports training platform that is linking up with high school gaming leagues. This is awesome, and is more evidence that I was born several decades too early. Esports in schools? We did <em>not</em> that, unless you counted competitive snake-playing on our Nokia bricks. Regardless, the esports training market is doing well it appears, given that related <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/metafy-adds-5-5m-to-its-seed-round-as-the-market-for-games-coaching-grows/">startup Metafy also raised this year</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/federal-judge-quashes-bezos-lawsuit-against-nasa-over-spacex-contract/"><strong>Judge grounds Blue Origin spacesuit over moon mission:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Here’s something new for the newly self-employed Bezos to moon over, literally. His space company’s efforts to wedge into the NASA moon-mission budget just got dismissed. So much for that pie-in-the-sky attempt.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/upwest-raises-70-million-for-fund-iv-investing-in-israeli-founders-looking-to-tackle-u-s-market/"><strong>UpWest raises $70M fund to bring Israeli startups to the U.S. market:</strong></a><strong> </strong>If you are a startup that is doing well in one market, you will look for another. It’s like the opening of &#8220;Pride and Prejudice,&#8221; but instead of a “single man” put in <em>startup</em>, plug-in <em>well funded</em> for “good fortune” and <em>desire another geography to sell into</em> in for “be in want of a wife.” That, basically, is UpWest’s value prop. It wants to help Israeli companies take on a much bigger market.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/whylabs-raises-10m-series-a-for-its-ai-observability-platform/"><strong>WhyLabs raises $10M for AIobs:</strong></a><strong> </strong>AI models are not alive, per se, but WhyLabs wants to help companies keep tabs on their ML setup in case it loses health. The company’s new round comes after it raised $4 million in a seed round last year.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/pubnub-raises-65m-to-build-and-run-data-streams-for-messaging-presence-and-other-real-time-aspects-of-virtual-spaces/"><strong>PubNub shows that data streaming is big business:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Now flush with $65 million in new capital, PubNub’s bet on data streams appears to be paying off. And the company is flush with a Series E to help build out its APIs that help “power messaging and data updates for apps and other digital businesses” in new geographies.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why more SaaS companies are shifting to usage-based pricing</h2>
<p>Boston-based VC firm OpenView interviewed nearly 600 SaaS companies for its annual pricing survey and the results are in: Usage-based pricing has gone mainstream.</p>
<p>Last year, 34% of survey respondents said they were using a flexible pricing model. This year, that figure rose to 45%.</p>
<p>&#8220;When AI can automate tasks, the more successful the solution is, the fewer people need to be logging in,&#8221; said OpenView operating partner Kyle Poyar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seats are just an outdated way of charging and don’t allow a company to communicate value or invest in features that would add more value.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Big Tech Inc.</h2>
<p>To kick off our Big Tech conversation today, our own Ryan Lawler covered <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/blend-fintech-market/">Blend’s expansion from the mortgage market into a broader fintech suite</a>. Take a peek.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/uk-warns-facebook-over-safety-criminal-liability-legislation/"><strong>The U.K. rattles its scepter at social media companies that earn its ire:</strong></a><strong> </strong>A few things. First, the U.K. has a “recently appointed secretary of state for digital” named Nadine Dorries, it turns out. And second, it appears that she is not messing around. TechCrunch reports that she “wants to take a tougher line on social media platforms than her predecessor,” which could include “criminal sanctions for breaches of incoming [domestic] online safety legislation.”</li>
<li><strong>And in other Facebook news, </strong>the Meta company is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/facebook-groups-to-gain-personalization-features-subgroups-chat-and-tools-for-making-money/">working on personalization features for its Groups product</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/nikola-sets-aside-125-million-to-settle-with-sec/"><strong>Nikola sets aside war chest for future settlements:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Embattled EV company Nikola is expecting bad news, it appears, setting aside an eighth of a billion dollars for settling with the American Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That’s a lot of coin for a company that needs lots of change to get its trucks rolling.</li>
<li>And to close us out, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/04/kyndryl-officially-launches-as-ibm-spins-out-infrastructure-services-biz-as-separate-company/"><strong>IBM’s infrastructure services work has spun out into a separate company called Kyndryl</strong></a> — which I presume is the name of <a href="https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/beedrill">Beedrill’s</a> lost forefather — which is doing huge revenues per our own Ron Miller. Per our reporting, Kyndryl “sees itself as a consulting arm for legacy companies to help them make the transition to more modern ways of doing business,” which seems fair enough.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Velodyne Lidar is welcoming a new CEO. The sensor company said that Theodore Tewksbury would take over the role starting November 10, the most recent in a string of changes to Velodyne’s C-suite since the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>“I was attracted to Velodyne for a very simple reason which is, as you all know, the company is the undisputed lidar technology pioneer and market leader,” Tewksbury said during the company’s third-quarter earnings call. “I have a proven track record of building and scaling innovative technology businesses, and driving revenue growth, profitability and shareholder value, which in my view is exactly what Velodyne needs today.”</p>
<p>Most recently, Tewksbury was the CEO of Eta Compute, a company that develops edge vision sensors. He’s also served on the board of Jariet Technologies and MaxLinear, in addition to acting as chief executive at Energy Focus, Entropic Communications and IDT.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229714" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company has been without a CEO for several months, after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/velodyne-lidar-ceo-resigns-in-latest-internal-drama/">Velodyne announced the departure of Anand Gopalan in July</a>, after around a year and a half on the job. Instead of immediately finding a replacement or appointing an interim CEO, Velodyne set up an “Office of the Chief Executive,” which consisted of a handful of C-suite executives, alongside an executive search committee.</p>
<p>Prior to Gopalan’s tenure, Velodyne had been caught in the throes of internal chaos, with the company’s founder, David Hall, pitted against the company’s board of directors. Things took a turn for the worse around the time that Velodyne completed its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/velodyne-becomes-latest-tech-company-to-go-public-using-a-spac-eschewing-the-traditional-ipo-path/">$1.8 billion SPAC merger</a> with Graf Industrial Corp. last summer. Hall stepped down and his wife, Marta Thoma Hall, who was acting as chief marketing officer, was removed after <a href="https://velodynelidar.com/press-release/velodyne-lidar-announces-changes-to-board-of-directors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an internal investigation concluded</a> that they “each behaved inappropriately with regard to Board and Company processes, and failed to operate with respect, honesty, integrity, and candor in their dealings with Company officers and directors.”</p>
<p>Since that time, Hall has not gone quietly: he <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211021005686/en/David-Hall-Founder-of-Velodyne-Lidar-Announces-Intent-to-Nominate-Highly-Qualified-Director-Candidates-for-Election-at-the-Company%E2%80%99s-2022-Annual-Meeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued a letter to shareholders last month</a> outlining problems with the company and stating his intent to nominate two new board members.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not allow Velodyne Lidar to continue to stagnate under current leadership,&#8221; Hall wrote, adding &#8220;I intend to nominate two highly-qualified director candidates.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Turning to the company’s financial results, Velodyne altered its full-year revenue guidance to between $60 million and $63 million, down from between $77 million and $94 million at the end of the previous quarter this year. The decrease is due to moving into mass commercialization, and customers expecting “consistency of performance,” CFO Drew Hamer said on an investor call Thursday. “This is a natural evolution from the R&amp;D purchases our customers had done with us historically, where test samples were acceptable.”</p>
<p>He added that the company is finding nonrecurring engineering fees difficult to forecast, so these potential contracts were subtracted from the guidance “unless we have a signed agreement in hand.”</p>
<p>The company’s operating expenses are also significantly down compared to the previous quarter, mostly due to marketing and sales expenses shrunk down to $6.5 million, compared to a whopping $47 million in the second quarter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As Facebook and Apple charge headlong into a more 3D future for the consumer web with big plans for mixed reality headsets, most web content out there is still firmly 2D. And while some are pushing for a completely separate &#8220;metaverse&#8221; where 3D content lives, that&#8217;s likely going to be a hard sell for existing web platforms that want to invest resources where the users are today.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vntana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VNTANA</a> builds a content management system which helps e-commerce retailers show off products on their sites in glorious 3D, while also allowing users to view objects in augmented reality and try on items virtually. The startup, founded back in 2012, has had a central focus on 3D content for years but has shifted its attention from bringing holograms to live events pre-pandemic to bringing 3D content to storefronts across the web.</p>
<p class="p1">&#8220;It was always about creating this interactive way for consumers to engage with their products in meaningful ways,&#8221; CEO Ashley Crowder says.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229696" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The startup tells TechCrunch it has raised $12.5 million in Series A funding across multiple raises. Backers of the startup&#8217;s latest fundings include Mark Cuban, former Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe, Flexport and Anorak Ventures, among others. The company announced a $6 million seed round back in 2019.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s software suite includes products which optimize large 3D files for quicker loading times so consumers can view every angle of a new product while also allowing e-commerce platforms to leverage the 3D files they already own to craft 2D digitally rendered showroom images and videos, saving time and money on marketing. The company has recently partnered with wholesale management platform Joor and software maker PTC to build out its reach.</p>
<p>Consumers can leverage the startup&#8217;s software to get a sense of an object&#8217;s size and real-world appearance in their physical space with augmented reality before making a purchase, something that can lead to fewer returned items, Crowder says.</p>
<p>Despite some major announcements from Apple, Google and Facebook, the developer opportunity for augmented reality has been more limited than many investors in the space expected when the wave of interest first kicked off several years ago. Websites have been slow to embrace 3D content for its own sake, but players like VNTANA have found opportunities to ship experiences that use 3D content to solve known issues for e-commerce retailers while setting them up to be ready for an AR/VR future.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1456348507548405762?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rolling out</a> the ability for users to share direct links to their Spaces to let others tune into a live audio session via the web without being logged into the platform. The social media giant says the new functionality is aimed at Spaces users who have friends that aren’t on Twitter but would still want to listen in on a Space.</p>
<p>The expansion opens up Twitter Spaces to even more people and gives the social media giant a better chance of reaching new users outside of its platform. The new functionality also gives Twitter Spaces an edge over rivals like Clubhouse and Facebook’s Live Audio Rooms.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>Twitter has been introducing several features over the past few months to streamline Spaces and garner more users. Last week, the company launched a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/28/twitter-launches-spaces-recording-feature-to-testers-on-ios-global-launch-to-follow/">Spaces Recording</a> feature to testers on iOS, with a global launch to follow. The feature gives hosts the ability to select a new &#8220;Record Space&#8221; setting before starting a live audio session. Once the session concludes, the recorded Space can be shared across Twitter, allowing listeners to play it back at any time or re-share it themselves.</p>
<p>Twitter also recently launched a <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1453449025877942288" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spaces test</a> that brings the dedicated Spaces Tab to Android users along with an update that brings easier DM invites. Twitter will also now<a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1453446589817704451" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> feature popular Spaces</a> in the Explore tab on iOS to increase their visibility.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Clubhouse also recently updated its platform to better compete with its rivals. Clubhouse <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/30/clubhouse-adds-clips-replays-for-asynchronous-listening-better-search-and-spatial-audio-for-android/">expanded</a> its offerings to allow for asynchronous listening, including support for clips, replays and audio exports. The company has also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/clubhouse-language-support-android/">added support</a> for 13 new languages, including French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Malayalam, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Tamil and Telugu.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Live audio grew in popularity amid the pandemic as people around the world were confined to their homes. However, as restrictions have lifted in many countries and in-person events have returned, companies that offer live audio rooms are looking to retain users by launching new features and making conversations more accessible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A new app called <a href="https://www.okpushit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Push it</a> is sitting at the top of the App Store promising little more than the ability to send &#8220;push notifications to your friends.&#8221; The app features only two screenshots &#8212; one of a big red button and another basic, black-and-red screen with text that says &#8220;sending.&#8221; So what is going on here? And how is this app No. 1 in five countries when many people who install it can&#8217;t even use it yet?</p>
<p>As it turns out, Push it is the latest creation from the makers of the Snapchat platform app, <a href="https://www.getsendit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sendit</a>, which features AR games and anonymous Q&amp;As.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229726" style="width: 604px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229726" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2229726" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-5.18.21-PM.jpg?w=594" alt="" width="594" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-5.18.21-PM.jpg 1010w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-5.18.21-PM.jpg?resize=131,150 131w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-5.18.21-PM.jpg?resize=262,300 262w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-5.18.21-PM.jpg?resize=768,879 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-5.18.21-PM.jpg?resize=594,680 594w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-5.18.21-PM.jpg?resize=44,50 44w" sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229726" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> fullsenders</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229611" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>To understand what <a href="https://apps.apple.com/US/app/id1588144619?l=en#?platform=iphone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Push it</a> is all about, you have to first understand the company&#8217;s original app, <a href="https://www.getsendit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sendit</a>.</p>
<p>Popular with a younger demographic, Sendit has been steadily gaining traction with Snapchat users who use the app to play games and have conversations with their Snapchat friends. To date, Sendit has been downloaded nearly 9 million times worldwide and has generated nearly $3 million in consumer spending, according to Sensor Tower data.</p>
<p>The app <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">recently </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/03/anonymous-snapchat-app-sendit-surges-with-3-5m-installs-after-snap-bans-yolo-and-lmk/">gained millions of new installs</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> following Snap&#8217;s suspensions of Sendit&#8217;s top rivals, YOLO and LMK, which were the focus of a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/05/snap-cuts-off-yolo-lmk-anonymous-messaging-apps-after-lawsuit-over-teens-death/">lawsuit</a> from a mother whose son died by suicide after being anonymously bullied by users of those apps. Sendit has, so far, escaped a similar fate <a href="https://protectyoungeyes.com/apps/sendit-app-review-dangerous/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">despite offering</a> anonymous features of its own &#8212; like its &#8220;ask me anything&#8221; game, which prompts a Snapchat user&#8217;s friends to ask questions without revealing who they are. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Some of Sendit&#8217;s negative reviews also make mention of bullying, but Snap has yet to take action. When we asked Snap to detail its policy around anonymous apps aimed at minors, we were told the company is in the process of reviewing its app ecosystem and policies, following the hire of its </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.axios.com/snap-hire-beauchere-global-platform-safety-14d8b989-6480-440a-8207-0dfd2edc7ac4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first global head of platform safety</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In addition, some of Sendit&#8217;s users believe the app is using bots to post questions that their friends would have never asked.</p>
<p>Writes one user in an App Store review: <em>&#8220;This app randomly sends you fake/automated questions. For example, me and all of my friends are mid-20s and older and we’ve all gotten the same question about &#8216;do u have trust issues,&#8217; &#8216;who’s the best person to copy homework from?&#8217; </em></p>
<p>Another reviewer complains: <em>&#8220;Ok so I can tell that the questions are 100% not from anyone I know, in fact I’m pretty sure this is fake. I’m convinced that the questions are from AI. They are just random cheap questions that nobody would ask like “who would you choose to be on your team in a zombie apocalypse?” Like that’s stupid. Nobody just asks that. Make a real app.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>Sendit&#8217;s founder Hunter Rice denies that bots are involved. He also pushed back at the idea that Sendit&#8217;s adoption by teenagers is being driven by anonymity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our users gravitate towards Sendit because of its awesome AR experiences,&#8221; Rice explains. &#8220;Our mission, and what we&#8217;re looking to do, is to find new ways to reduce the friction of sparking conversations with friends. We discovered this really engaging format through these AR games. That&#8217;s really the magic behind Sendit and why it&#8217;s been so successful,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Today, Sendit offers games like &#8220;Never Have I Ever,&#8221; &#8220;Truth or Dare&#8221; and others that appeal to a young crowd. It also lets users ask questions like &#8220;Who do you ship me with?&#8221; or &#8220;Confessions &#8212; say who you have a crush on,&#8221; and &#8220;Compatibility test,&#8221; which reflect the kinds of things that a teenager would want to chat about among friends.</p>
<p>Similarly, Rice says his team&#8217;s new app Push it is also about coming up with new ways to encourage conversations.</p>
<p>Except, in this case, it&#8217;s not promising AR Lens games and Q&amp;As for Snapchat, but a basic tool for pushing notifications directly to friends&#8217; iPhones.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229727" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229727" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2229727" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-6.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-6.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-6.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229727" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> fullsenders</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;With Sendit, we found this great format within these AR interactions and that&#8217;s been going great. So, we wanted to replicate that same mechanic using a different format,&#8221; Rice says.</p>
<p>In case it&#8217;s not clear by its minimalist App Store listing, the new app offers a basic follower/following model and lets users send out a push notification to everyone who subscribes to you on the app. Those followers can then respond to that notification to spark a one-on-one conversation, similar to Sendit.</p>
<p>This could be something adopted by a group of friends or even used by creators or brands, the company believes.</p>
<p>To work, Push it requires full access to your Contacts database on your iPhone. It also offers tools to invite friends via text messages. It puts an &#8220;OK&#8221; button next to a friend&#8217;s name who&#8217;s supposedly in need of an invite which, when pushed, will create a text you can send them to join. (It&#8217;s not clear that the app&#8217;s not just randomly selecting names of people from your address book to text, however.)</p>
<p>Amid today&#8217;s push for increased privacy, SMS-based growth mechanics are generally looked down upon after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/20/dont-get-played-by-this-spammy-app-like-i-did/">years</a> of over-zealous app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2008/01/14/hey-chacha-i-dont-like-sms-spam/">invite</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/21/everalbum-is-proof-that-sms-spam-still-works/">spamming</a> became the norm. Fortunately, however, Push it doesn&#8217;t auto-text your friends, it just pushes you to. (However, the app&#8217;s <a href="https://getsendit.com/privacy-policy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy policy</a> doesn&#8217;t do much to assuage fears about what it&#8217;s doing with your personal data. It&#8217;s clear that data will be used for marketing purposes and shared with Push it&#8217;s vendors and business partners, the policy says.)</p>
<p>The app also brazenly solicits 5-star reviews. When you tap the star icon, a pop-up window appears that promises you a &#8220;special message&#8221; if you rate the app 5 stars on the App Store.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229720" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229720" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2229720" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229720" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> fullsenders</p></div></p>
<p>The Push it iOS app was published to the App Store in late October, previously under the name &#8220;Project Red,&#8221; according to Sensor Tower data. It <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">only become available to select markets as of last night, including Australia and California. To see it already at No. 1 makes for a suspicious launch &#8212; one that typically indicates having relied heavily on pre-launch marketing or growth hacks, as is now common. (See also: </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/26/poparazzi-hypes-itself-to-the-top-of-the-app-store/">springtime chart-topper Poparrazzi</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">, which growth hacked its way to No. 1). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">But Rice claims that&#8217;s not the case. </span></p>
<p>&#8220;All the excitement around Push it has been entirely organic,&#8221; he claims, though admitting the company used social media to hype the app&#8217;s launch. Currently, the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pushitappp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Push it Instagram</a> account has roughly 32,000 followers, for example.</p>
<p>But Sensor Tower data indicates the app has already gone viral in five countries as of today. It&#8217;s No. 1 in the U.S., Canada, Bermuda, Ireland and Norway, the firm says. It&#8217;s also in the top 10 in Great Britain, the Netherlands, Australia, Finland and New Zealand. (Many of these countries aren&#8217;t listed as launch markets per Push it&#8217;s Instagram, we should note).</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229722" style="width: 324px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229722" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2229722" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-5.png?w=314" alt="" width="314" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-5.png 1284w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=69,150 69w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=139,300 139w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=768,1662 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=314,680 314w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=710,1536 710w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=947,2048 947w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Image-from-iOS-5.png?resize=23,50 23w" sizes="(max-width: 314px) 100vw, 314px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229722" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> fullsenders</p></div></p>
<p>What&#8217;s odd about the app&#8217;s No. 1 status is that the app is basically non-functional in the markets where it&#8217;s not yet live, which today includes most U.S. states. You can use the app to claim your username and&#8230;well, that&#8217;s about it. Then you have to wait for your market to be flipped on.</p>
<p>Rice says the staggered rollout strategy was meant to ensure Push it could handle the traffic, but it seems to have confused a number of users, who are commenting things on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pushitappp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a> like <em>&#8220;Bruh when is it gonna work&#8221;</em> or <em>&#8220;what&#8217;s the point of this&#8221;</em> or <em>&#8220;I&#8217;m so confused lmao.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just making sure that we can roll it out in a smooth way where our users can get the best experience possible. We want to make sure that everyone has access to it, and that&#8217;s coming very soon. But yeah, we also want to make sure that our servers stay alive,&#8221; Rice says.</p>
<p>Push it and Sendit are built by a small team of 10 at fullsenders, based mostly in Santa Monica. The company has an undisclosed amount of funding. But we guessed at least one of its angels correctly:</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The test for Push it now is whether or not it can sustain such a high ranking in the App Store &#8212; organic or otherwise &#8212; something that&#8217;s proven difficult for other newcomer social apps. It may also have to contend with the coming regulatory crackdown on social experiences designed for minors and younger teens. If Push it gains traction, it may have to rethink its privacy policy and forthcoming revenue models.</p>
<p>For the time being, however, Push it is not making money.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now, we&#8217;re really just focused on building an amazing community and creating great features that users want to engage with,&#8221; Rice says. &#8220;And if we can provide value in the product itself, we&#8217;ll be able to come up with a business model that works best for the company.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Selling an asset at a loss is a bad idea in most areas of business, but it is a particularly bad idea in a market where sales cycles are slow, unpredictable and largely out of your control.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">After 3.5 years, Zillow announced this week that it is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/02/business/zillow-q3-earnings-home-flipping-ibuying.html">shutting down Zillow Offers</a> and exiting the iBuying business. The news was not entirely unexpected, as the company had previously admitted to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/zillow-says-it-cant-buy-any-more-homes-this-year-11634574144?mod=article_inline">pausing home buying</a> through the end of the year and was reportedly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-01/zillow-selling-7-000-homes-for-2-8-billion-after-flipping-halt">seeking investors to purchase 7,000 homes</a> it had in its inventory.</p>
<p>Still, the retreat shocked the market: Zillow’s stock fell more than 20% on the news and fears around the iBuying market drove shares of competitors Opendoor down by about 15% and Offerpad about 6%. Those stocks have recovered a bit since, but there still seems to be some trepidation around iBuying as a business model.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Zillow basically confessed that its pricing model is at best a lagging indicator and really no good in a market that isn’t aggressively moving up and to the right.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We’ll know more about the impact of slowing housing sales and price appreciation on the broader market when <a href="https://investor.opendoor.com/news-releases/news-release-details/opendoor-report-third-quarter-2021-financial-results-november-10">Opendoor</a> and <a href="https://investor.offerpad.com/news-releases/news-details/2021/Offerpad-to-Report-Third-Quarter-2021-Results-on-November-10th/default.aspx">Offerpad</a> announce their third-quarter earnings next week. In the meantime, there’s plenty of anecdotal evidence to suggest that Zillow’s big loss wasn’t necessarily a business model problem with iBuying as a whole as much as it was a problem with Zillow’s algorithm.</p>
<p>At their most basic level, iBuyers seek to purchase homes at a slight discount to their market value, offering the convenience of a cash offer to sellers in exchange. They then make any necessary repairs or renovations necessary, list the property and attempt to sell it for more than their initial purchase price, making money on the spread.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem Zillow ran into, and the reason it decided to exit the business, was that in the third quarter the company was <a href="https://www.housingwire.com/articles/inside-zillows-misadventures-in-ibuying/">paying above market value</a> for homes and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/zillow-offers-pause-ibuyers-homes-atlanta-phoenix-dallas-houston-minneapolis-2021-10">selling them for less</a> than their initial market price.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://cloud.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Cloud</a> announced a major deal today with <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The CME Group</a> to move CME&#8217;s futures and options markets to the cloud over a 10-year period. The deal has several components, including a $1 billion investment from Google into CME. Google would not say how much the total deal is worth, however.</p>
<p>Philip Moyer, VP of strategic industries at Google Cloud, says this isn&#8217;t your standard deal where Google simply helps the customer move workloads to the cloud. &#8220;Instead, this is really a demonstration by Google and CME, that we&#8217;re really committed to the long-term journey necessary to take the hardest elements of the financial services industry to the cloud,&#8221; Moyer told me.</p>
<p>He says that what makes the deal so complex is that a company like CME has among the most demanding security, latency and redundancy and recovery requirements. The companies are not saying how the deal is structured in terms of costs, but the plan is to implement it across several phases, starting with the easiest workloads with the lowest latency requirements, followed by data analysis tooling.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229656" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;In the second phase we&#8217;re really focused on trying to innovate by doing more real-time data and analytics, and creating new products and making the markets more efficient,&#8221; he said. And finally, in the last phase, the companies plan to move the most latency-sensitive parts of the workloads to the cloud.</p>
<p>As Moyer sees it, this is a huge deal and if it goes all the way through over a decade, it could transform how financial services companies like CME function. &#8220;So it&#8217;s really a phased approach, taking one of the largest and most diverse exchanges in the world up into the cloud. And along the way, Google intends to use its global network, its resiliency, its AI/ML, its data technologies, its global accessibility to enhance CMEs resiliency and accessibility on a worldwide basis,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The big question aside from the overall scope of the deal is where the $1 billion investment fits in, and Moyer says it&#8217;s about showing CME that it too has skin in the game. The investment involves non-voting stock. There is no board seat and CME&#8217;s board is free to spend the money as it wishes. But Moyer says that the investment is about showing that Google is invested in the long-term success of the relationship.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think one of the things that I would tell you that&#8217;s different about this relationship than maybe other kinds of traditional vendor relationships, where you just kind of get awarded an RFP or RFI, is that we&#8217;re committing to the engineering necessary to get to the finish line. And we&#8217;re not potentially starting years from now. We&#8217;re starting day one, on the journey together across all three phases,&#8221; he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>While there are a lot of unknowns here, this is potentially a huge deal, which if successful, could open the wider financial services market to Google Cloud. Google has always had the advantage of running large cloud services at scale as part of its business. If it can start to capture other large-scale cloud businesses that can take advantage of that expertise, perhaps it can begin to move the market share needle in a more significant way.</p>
<p>Google was in third place in Q3 in the cloud infrastructure market with $4.5 billion in revenue, good for 10% market share. For some perspective, market leader AWS had more than $16 billion in revenue, good for 33% market share, according to numbers by <a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/amazon-microsoft-google-grab-the-big-numbers-but-rest-of-cloud-market-still-grows-by-27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Synergy Research</a>. The overall market <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/cloud-infrastructure-market-hits-180b-run-rate-in-q3-as-even-chip-shortages-cant-slow-it-down/">reached $45 billion in Q3</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian, the electric automaker that recently <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/01/rivians-ipo-filing-is-now-public/">filed for an IPO</a>, has been sued by a former sales and marketing vice president for alleged gender discrimination.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that Laura Schwab, a former sales and marketing executive who had a long employment history with Jaguar Land Rover and Aston Martin before joining Rivian in November 2020, was fired after reporting gender discrimination to the company&#8217;s human resources department. The lawsuit was filed Thursday in California Superior Court in Orange County.</p>
<p>A Rivian spokeswoman told TechCrunch that due to a quiet period ahead of its public offering, the company can&#8217;t offer comment.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229643" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Schwab also filed a statement of claim with the American Arbitration Association and laid out her allegations in a <a href="https://medium.com/@lauraschwab1/life-outside-the-boys-club-why-i-spoke-up-about-rivians-toxic-bro-culture-and-got-fired-15600b999ae7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post published on Medium</a>. The AAA statement, viewed by TechCrunch, describes a &#8220;toxic bro culture&#8221; at the company&#8217;s highest levels. The lawsuit alleges that Schwab was regularly ignored by her superior when trying to point out problems. She was regularly excluded from meetings attended by her male peers and decisions regarding her team were made without her input, the statement says. The AAA statement also says<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> that her concerns regarding &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Rivian&#8217;s misleading public statements and flawed business practices,&#8221; were dismissed. </span></p>
<p>When she spoke up to human resources about &#8220;the boys&#8217; club culture and gender discrimination she was experiencing from a C-level executive, Rivian abruptly fired her,&#8221; the statement reads.</p>
<p>In one excerpt on the blog, Schwab wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rivian publicly boasts about its culture, so it was a crushing blow when I joined the company and almost immediately experienced a toxic bro culture that marginalizes women and contributes to the company making mistakes. I raised concerns to HR about the gender discrimination from my manager, the &#8220;boys club&#8221; culture, and the impact it was having on me, my team, and the company. Two days later, my boss fired me.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The complaint comes as Amazon-backed Rivian prepares to become a publicly traded company in one of the most anticipated debuts of the year. A recent regulatory filing showed Rivian hoped to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/electric-vehicle-maker-rivian-seeks-to-raise-8-4-billion-in-ipo/">raise up $8.4 billion</a> in its initial public offering. The company plans to offer 135 million shares at a price between $57 and $62. Underwriters also have an option to buy up to 20.25 million additional shares. If underwriters exercise that option, Rivian would raise as much as $9.6 billion.</p>
<p>Based on the number of outstanding shares, that would put its market valuation at about $53 billion. If employee stock options and other restricted shares are considered, Rivian&#8217;s valuation could be as high as $60 billion. Rivian filed October 1 to become a publicly traded company in the United States.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today after the bell American ride-hailing giant Uber <a href="https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2021/Uber-Announces-Results-for-Third-Quarter-2021/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> its third-quarter financial results. Critically, the long-unprofitable company managed to squeak $8 million worth of adjusted EBITDA &#8212; a very modified profit metric &#8212; while still posting net losses of more than $2 billion.</p>
<p>The adjusted-profit result comes days after Lyft, Uber&#8217;s domestic rival, also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/lyft-reports-adjusted-profitability-as-revenue-per-rider-rises/">recently managed the financial feat</a>.</p>
<p>In the third quarter, Uber&#8217;s gross bookings (or the value of all goods and services that flowed through its platform) totaled $23.1 billion, up 57% on a year-over-year basis. That figure translated to revenues of $4.8 billion, up 72% compared to the year-ago quarter. From that revenue figure Uber turned in a net loss of $2.4 billion, a figure inclusive of &#8220;a $2.0 billion net headwind&#8221; from the company revaluing its equity holdings in other companies.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229644" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s unadjusted per-share net losses came to $1.28, or a bit more than double the $0.62 it lost on a per-share basis in the year-ago third-quarter.</p>
<p>Analysts had expected the ride-hailing company to report a $0.33 per-share loss against revenues of $4.42 billion. Shares of the company are off around 5% in after-hours trading.</p>
<p>Before we get into segment performance, Uber indicated that it expects gross bookings of between $25 billion and $26 billion in the fourth quarter, leading to adjusted EBITDA of $25 to $75 million. Normally we&#8217;d mock a company of Uber&#8217;s scale and age for still forecasting with kids-table metrics like adjusted EBITDA instead of grown-up stats like GAAP net income. But as Uber has long promised investors that it would claw its way to the modified profit threshold this year, the guidance is worth noting.</p>
<h2>Segment performance</h2>
<p>Thinking broadly, Uber&#8217;s food delivery business drives far more of its total gross bookings than its ride-hailing business these days. In fact, it may be time to consider Uber more a food-delivery company than a taxi app.</p>
<p>Regardless, here&#8217;s the company&#8217;s segment breakdown in terms of gross spend:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229649" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229649" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2229649 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.14.56-PM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="228" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.14.56-PM.png 701w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.14.56-PM.png?resize=150,50 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.14.56-PM.png?resize=300,101 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.14.56-PM.png?resize=680,228 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.14.56-PM.png?resize=50,17 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229649" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Uber</p></div></p>
<p>It is notable that ride-hailing is growing more quickly lately than food delivery at the company, but the swap makes some sense. Uber Eats grew like a weed during the pandemic, while moving people about lost its luster while folks stayed home. Now, with COVID abating in some markets, things are flipping back around.</p>
<p>Recall that Uber generates more revenue from rides than food, leading to the following top-line results from the above gross bookings:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229651" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229651" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2229651 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.16.38-PM.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="255" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.16.38-PM.png 712w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.16.38-PM.png?resize=150,56 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.16.38-PM.png?resize=300,113 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.16.38-PM.png?resize=680,255 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.16.38-PM.png?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229651" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Uber</p></div></p>
<p>Near revenue-parity from taxi service and on-demand noshing feels notable, as does Uber&#8217;s Freight business generating enough top line for us to begin considering it a material piece of the company&#8217;s larger operational outcomes.</p>
<p>Now, to profitability, or, really, <em>adjusted EBITDA</em> results for each group:</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2229655" style="width: 682px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2229655" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2229655 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.18.11-PM.png?w=672" alt="" width="672" height="261" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.18.11-PM.png 672w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.18.11-PM.png?resize=150,58 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.18.11-PM.png?resize=300,117 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-04-at-4.18.11-PM.png?resize=50,19 50w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2229655" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Uber</p></div></p>
<p>As you can see, Uber has managed to drive its food business to nigh-adjusted breakeven status. That&#8217;s material progress compared to where the product was last year. And Uber&#8217;s ride business mostly canceled out its adjusted corporate losses. In sum, the company stuck a toe into adjusted-profitability land, posting $8 million worth of adjusted EBITDA, as we noted up top.</p>
<p>What <em>is</em> impressive, frankly, is how far Uber managed to improve its adjusted EBITDA metric in just one year.</p>
<p>Taking into account all costs and expenses, Uber&#8217;s GAAP operating profit, however, came to -$572 million. And once interest costs and other expenses were taken into account, the former startup lost $2.44 billion in the period, or around $800 million per month. What drove the massive gap at Uber between its operating losses and its GAAP losses? Falling value of its investments. Per the company:</p>
<blockquote><p>During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, unrealized loss on debt and equity securities, net, primarily represents a $3.2 billion and $1.7 billion net unrealized loss, respectively on our Didi investment, partially offset by a $994 million unrealized gain on our Zomato investment recognized during the third quarter of 2021, a $102 million and $573 million unrealized gain, respectively on our Aurora Investments, as well as a $73 million and $56 million net unrealized gain, respectively on our other investments in securities accounted for under the fair value option.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or more simply, the Chinese government&#8217;s annoyance with Didi led to Uber&#8217;s net income winding up in the shitter.</p>
<p>Summing, Uber remains unprofitable, but it is recovering from the pandemic and has managed, at last, to post adjusted incomes. Now let&#8217;s see it get to real breakeven.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A16z Crypto has been minting plenty of NFT unicorns this year. In July, they backed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/nft-market-opensea-hits-1-5-billion-valuation/">NFT marketplace OpenSea</a> at a $1.5 billion valuation. They participated in a September raise for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/22/nba-top-shot-creator-dapper-labs-raises-another-250-million/">NBA Top Shot-maker Dapper Labs</a>, which valued the company at a whopping $7.6 billion. Just last month, they backed the team behind play-to-earn crypto game Axie Infinity with a $3 billion valuation.</p>
<p>While the NFT space in general is quite young, a16z&#8217;s latest unicorn NFT bet is a bit earlier than usual. <a href="https://mythicalgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mythical Games</a> is raising a $150 million Series C from the firm at a $1.25 billion valuation just a few months after it closed a whopping $75 million Series B. Mythical Games&#8217; sole title Blankos Block Party is an NFT-based game that&#8217;s only been in &#8220;early access&#8221; for a few months and has a player base of monthly active users just in the &#8220;high tens of thousands,&#8221; according to the company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We weren&#8217;t planning on raising for quite a few more months,&#8221; CEO John Linden tells TechCrunch. &#8220;And [a16z crypto] came to us early and they kind of preempted everybody else. They knew we weren&#8217;t raising but they said, &#8216;Hey, let&#8217;s do this now&#8230;&#8217; And we&#8217;re sitting in such a great position now where we have many years of capital at this point.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2228855" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

<p>There actually aren&#8217;t too many crypto gaming startups out there, but a good chunk of them are built by crypto founders with crypto economics at the center of every part of the titles. As a result, most blockchain games have pretty advanced economies and pretty rudimentary gameplay.</p>
<p>One of the reasons Mythical Games has struck a nerve with investors is that they&#8217;re a team of gaming industry veterans who are building a platform that is gameplay first, blockchain-based investment-platform second. The studio&#8217;s main title Blankos Block Party feels much less crypto-centric than other NFT titles. It&#8217;s a polished game that looks pretty similar to the title Fall Guys, but boasts a revenue model that combines a BattlePass-style subscription with a non-crypto in-game currency that users can buy NFTs with and then sell for real cash on a secondary marketplace.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of NFTs of user avatars or accessories have already been minted on the platform, where users can also sell the goods they&#8217;ve purchased with in-game currency for actual cash, part of a broader &#8220;play-to-earn&#8221; mechanic which rewards users for investing time in the platform. Users can choose to navigate all of this without ever touching cryptocurrencies. Linden says that Mythical Games will continue to get &#8220;deeper and deeper&#8221; into crypto mechanics, but notes that they&#8217;re looking to tread carefully as they gauge where to stick to conventions and where to push the limits.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p>Mythical Games&#8217; unicorn status is a bet from a16z Crypto that game developers are potentially going to be interested in as a more subtle embrace of blockchain-based in-game economies. The studio has been <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/11/02/mythical-games-announces-partners-for-blockchain-game-economy-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working with a handful of smaller studios</a> to integrate some of their infrastructure, including marketplace services, compliance tech, token management and access to their custom blockchain. They&#8217;re generally looking to build a path forward for the gaming industry adopting more complex in-game economies based around NFTs while also ensuring users aren&#8217;t left navigating a web of crypto confusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;To us, this is the future of gaming,&#8221; a16z Crypto general partner Arianna Simpson tells TechCrunch. &#8220;This is the future of how people will expect to play games and participate and be rewarded for the time and the investments that they make on these platforms. And this is a multitrillion-dollar market, without question.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blockchain-based mechanics can be a tough sell for game studios today largely because it&#8217;s still a pretty hostile platform environment for NFT-based titles at the moment. Apple and Google haven&#8217;t showcased much of an interest in building a path for crypto payments or NFT sales inside their mobile app stores while Steam has outright banned NFT titles from their PC game store, a move which directly impacted Blankos. Part of this has undoubtedly been the desire of platforms not to upend the in-game payment systems that have made them rich, but there are also legal uncertainties around how deeply some titles are wading into securities territory.</p>
<p>For now, Blankos is only available as a desktop PC client directly downloadable from their own website. They don&#8217;t have mobile apps and they aren&#8217;t available on any PC game stores. Even without accessibility on mobile today, a16z Crypto sees a big opportunity for Blankos and crypto gaming in general. &#8220;I think mobile is definitely going to be an important part of the story going forward. There&#8217;s no doubt about that, but desktop is still huge,&#8221; Simpson says. &#8220;If you look at it even today, the majority of the highest value transactions are happening on desktop.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.goodlyapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goodly</a>, a three-year-old, San Francisco-based startup, has been steadily building its business with a five-person team and not much funding &#8212; $1.5 million secured in 2019 and, more recently, an undisclosed amount of funding from Beth Axelrod, a longtime HR exec and the global head of employee experience at Airbnb.</p>
<p>The startup, which aims to make it dead simple for companies to offer tax-free student loan repayment as an employee benefit, is profitable. It has exclusive relationships with numerous brokers, including insurer NFP and the much larger Willis Towers Watson. Still, its product wasn&#8217;t exactly top of mind during the pandemic, when enterprises became consumed with remote work and trying to ensure their employees&#8217; mental well-being.</p>
<p>Sailing into 2022, that could be changing for two reasons. One ties to a provision within the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 that allows employers to contribute up to an annual maximum of $5,250 per employee to repay student debt. Those contributions from the company are tax deductible for employers but also are excluded from taxable income for employees, which will seemingly give companies a much larger financial incentive to provide them.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2229174" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Second, after more than 20 months of temporary student loan forbearance for millions of student loan borrowers, student loan relief is ending on January 31, which means that beginning in February, federal loan payments will resume with their normal (and normally onerous) interest rates. That means an issue that has been shelved for some time will suddenly jump to the forefront, and in a competitive job market, companies would probably be wise to take note.</p>
<p>Certainly, Goodly CEO Gregory Poulin &#8212; who was among the earliest employees at Parker Conrad&#8217;s Rippling, along with co-founder and CTO Hemant Verma &#8212; has a compelling pitch should they decide to investigate further. As Poulin told us earlier this week, while $5,250 may not seem like much, it can add up in surprising ways over time.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the average company that we work with, we usually see around $100 per participant per month being the most common contribution,&#8221; he says, comparing the cost to a cup of coffee per day. But taking that employer contribution and applying it as a payment directly to the principal of student loan also helps address the issue of compounding interest over the lifetime of the loan, which is where people really get into trouble.</p>
<p>Poulin says the typical repayment period is about 10 years and that Goodly can reduce that repayment period by three to four years depending on the outstanding balance of an employee&#8217;s loan. That doesn&#8217;t square exactly with the data that we&#8217;re seeing and which shows that repayment periods actually average closer to 20 years, but obviously if Goodly can help someone save even a year of loan payments, that&#8217;s something employers can use as a sweetener.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, the startup&#8217;s tech is fairly straightforward. Each user of Goodly is given their own account, where they can manage and track their student loans from its dashboard. From there, employees can also access content like financial wellness counseling, or the best strategies for optimizing repayments.</p>
<p>Poulin adds that one especially popular feature is the ability for employees to invite their friends or family to make a contribution toward their student loans that functions in a similar way to crowdfunding, wherein a parent or grandparent can make a one-time or a recurring contribution. &#8220;And of course, that contributor has peace of mind in knowing that payment is being directed to that student loan and not spent on anything else,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Goodly passed through Y Combinator shortly after its launch in 2018. Poulin says he was inspired to launch the business after the sudden death of his own father while he was a student at Dartmouth, after which he found himself having to borrow $80,000 in student loans.</p>
<p>Years later, he says his payment is still more than $900 a month.</p>
<p>He has a lot of company, unfortunately. As of last year, there were 45 million borrowers who collectively owed nearly $1.6 trillion in student loan debt in the U.S., and for too many of them, it can become crushing. &#8220;It really creates a two-tiered workplace where those with student loans are in a lot of ways, second-class citizens,&#8221; says Poulin, &#8220;because by the age of 30, people with student debt hold about half the retirement savings of their peers without student loans,&#8221; causing them to delay homeownership, getting married and having children.</p>
<p>If Goodly has its way, when student debt regains mindshare in 2022, more employers will begin to recognize the issue &#8212; and do more to help their employees mitigate the cycle.</p>
