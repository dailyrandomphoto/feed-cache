										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/dell" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="dell">Dell&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> latest monitors reflect the growing need for simple, solid solutions to video conferencing needs, with a clever pop-up camera and a perhaps too clever by half Teams integration. The new displays integrate a number of advanced features — but they&#8217;re still made strictly with offices in mind.</p>
<p>The new Dell 24, 27 and 34 Video Conferencing Monitors are clearly meant to be a turnkey solution to the need at many companies for video-capable setups that don&#8217;t cost a fortune.</p>
<p>The most interesting feature is a pop-up camera at the top; this isn&#8217;t the first one of these by far (we&#8217;ve seen them going back a few years) or even the first by Dell, but it is the first of theirs in a monitor as opposed to an all-in-one system, and it is probably the best one yet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2092432" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/dell-popup.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2092432" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2092432" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/dell-popup.gif" alt="Dell's monitor has a pop-up camera." width="800" height="434" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2092432" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dell</p></div></p>
<p>The five-megapixel camera (which translates to somewhat more than 1080p, likely around 3K) won&#8217;t blow any minds, so if you want things like optical background blur and improved lighting, you&#8217;ll have to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/how-to-get-your-nice-camera-set-up-as-a-high-quality-webcam/">build your own setup</a>. But it should be perfectly fine for work calls and having it slip away when not in use is reassuring to the privacy-conscious.</p>
<p>An additional, nonobvious reason to like this setup is it means the camera isn&#8217;t confined to the bezel of the monitor itself, possibly allowing for a better lens and bigger sensor. I&#8217;ve asked Dell for the detailed specs and I don&#8217;t expect anything extraordinary, but it&#8217;s always better to have space than to pack the camera module into the margins.</p>

<p>At the bottom of these new screens is a pleasantly felted speaker bar, with just enough wattage for calls to sound fine — it won&#8217;t work for bangers, though.</p>
<p>But on the left side of that speaker are some interesting, if not entirely practical, new buttons. Most prominent is a dedicated <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="microsoft">Microsoft <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Teams button, along with call, volume and mute buttons.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2092441" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/teams-button.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2092441" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2092441" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/teams-button.jpg" alt="Close up of Teams button on Dell monitor." width="1024" height="589" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/teams-button.jpg 1457w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/teams-button.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/teams-button.jpg?resize=300,173 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/teams-button.jpg?resize=768,442 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/teams-button.jpg?resize=680,391 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/teams-button.jpg?resize=50,29 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2092441" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Dell</p></div></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I wouldn&#8217;t want one of those. And not just because we don&#8217;t use Teams.</p>
<p>Maybe this is just me, but I don&#8217;t like the idea of reaching forward and whacking my monitor, which I&#8217;ve carefully positioned, every time I want to adjust the volume or answer a call, or mute myself — good luck doing it subtly when the whole view shakes every time. Even if I did, I wouldn&#8217;t want a button dedicated specifically to a single brand of video conferencing. Seems limiting when so many video platforms are in play.</p>
<p>I would be far more likely to pay for a puck with those controls on it as well as a mono speaker for voices and mic that&#8217;s closer to me. And by the way, it might be better to leave noise cancellation to the software side of things — calling apps often integrate their own, and who knows how built-in noise blocking interacts with those.</p>
<p>No doubt this is a simpler product solution, of course, and also presumably one that Microsoft and Dell worked together on. The pop-up webcam also has an IR camera that works with Windows Hello, the face-recognition login method I didn&#8217;t realize existed until very recently.</p>
<p>Obviously this is Dell and Microsoft going after enterprise customers who are already in their ecosystem. But as a Dell monitor lover myself, I wouldn&#8217;t mind having a pop-up camera — minus the unnecessary sound bar and Teams button. Where&#8217;s the love, Dell?</p>
<p>The new video conferencing monitors will be available next month, starting at $520 for a 24-inch, then going up to $720 for the 27-inch and $1,150 for the (curved) 34-inch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The U.S. government says hackers &#8220;likely Russian in origin&#8221; are responsible for breaching the networks of at least 10 U.S. federal agencies and several major tech companies, including <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/fireeye" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="fireeye">FireEye <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and Microsoft.</p>
<p>In a joint statement published Tuesday, the FBI, the NSA and Homeland Security&#8217;s cybersecurity advisory unit, CISA, said that the government was &#8220;still working to understand the scope&#8221; of the breach, but that the breaches are likely an &#8220;intelligence gathering effort.&#8221;</p>
<p>The compromises are &#8220;ongoing,&#8221; the statement said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The statement didn&#8217;t name the breached agencies, but the Treasury, State and the Department of Energy are among those <a href="https://www.fedscoop.com/solarwinds-recap-federal-agencies-caught-orion-breach/">reported to be affected</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a serious compromise that will require a sustained and dedicated effort to remediate,&#8221; the statement said. &#8220;The [joint agency effort] will continue taking every necessary action to investigate, remediate, and share information with our partners and the American people,&#8221;</p>
<p>News of the widespread espionage campaign emerged in early December after cybersecurity giant FireEye, normally the first company that cyberattack victims call, discovered its own network <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/cybersecurity-firm-fireeye-says-it-was-hacked-by-a-nation-state/">had been breached</a>. Soon after, it was reported that several government agencies had also been infiltrated.</p>
<p>All of the victims are customers of U.S. software firm <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/solarwinds" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="solarwinds">SolarWinds, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> whose Orion network management tools are used across the U.S. government and Fortune 500 companies. FireEye <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/evasive-attacker-leverages-solarwinds-supply-chain-compromises-with-sunburst-backdoor.html">said that hackers</a> broke into SolarWinds&#8217; network and pushed a tainted software update to its customers, allowing the hackers to easily break into any one of thousands of companies and agencies that installed the backdoored update.</p>
<p>Some 18,000 customers downloaded the backdoored software update, but the government&#8217;s joint statement said that it believes only a &#8220;much smaller number have been compromised by follow-on activity on their systems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several news outlets have previously reported that the hacks were carried out by a Russian intelligence group known as APT 29, or Cozy Bear, which has been linked to several espionage-driven attacks, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/17/russian-cyberops-are-targeting-covid-19-vaccine-rd-intelligence-agencies-warn/">attempting to steal coronavirus vaccine research</a>.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s joint statement would be the first time the government acknowledged the likely culprit behind the campaign.</p>
<p>Russia had previously denied involvement with the hacks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Procter &amp; Gamble will not acquire women&#8217;s beauty products startup Billie,<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200108005827/en/PG-Announces-Plans-to-Acquire-Billie-Inc."> as previously planned</a>, following action taken by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to stop the deal from proceeding. In December, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/ftc-sues-to-block-pgs-acquisition-of-billie-a-razor-startup-for-women/">the FTC sued to block P&amp;G&#8217;s acquisition</a> of the New York-based startup Billie, a maker of women&#8217;s razors and other beauty products, on the grounds that the merger would eliminate competition in the wet shave razor market.</p>
<p>Today, P&amp;G and Billie issued a joint statement, expressing their regret over the FTC&#8217;s decision to attempt to block their merger, which led to the deal&#8217;s termination:</p>
<blockquote><p>We were disappointed by the FTC’s decision and maintain there was exciting potential in combining Billie with P&amp;G to better serve more consumers around the world. However, after due consideration, we have mutually agreed that it is in both companies’ best interests not to engage in a prolonged legal challenge, but instead to terminate our agreement and refocus our resources on other business priorities.</p></blockquote><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Billie had made a name for itself in the women&#8217;s razor market by offering to eliminate the so-called &#8220;pink tax,&#8221; which refers to how women&#8217;s products are often marked up at higher price points compared with similar products aimed at men. It later expanded into the broader beauty market with a focus on more natural products that are free of additives and chemicals, including sulfates, parabens, formaldehydes, GMOs, drying alcohols, synthetic dyes, fragrances, cheap foaming agents, unstable silicones and BHT.</p>
<p>The startup was also particularly successful in capturing the interest of a younger, Gen Z to millennial-aged consumer, who responded to its mission as well as its modern, and often even progressive, marketing across social media and the web. In its advertisements, Billie would <a href="https://mybillie.com/pages/projectbodyhair">show women with body hair</a> &#8212; a message that went against the grain of traditional societal expectations, where women are often shown in marketing messages &#8212; including razor ads &#8212; as already hairless and smooth.</p>
<p>Billie&#8217;s message was that women should feel free to do what they want about their body hair &#8212; but for those who prefer to shave, it would be happy to sell them an affordably priced razor.</p>
<p>What also made Billie interesting was its business model. The company offers to ship replacement blades on a subscription basis to its customers, which helped it grow revenues and customer loyalty.</p>
<p>Ahead of the P&amp;G acquisition, Billie was planning to expand into physical retail stores, which would have made the brand a more direct competitor to P&amp;G products, the FTC had said.</p>
<p>&#8220;As its sales grew, Billie was likely to expand into brick-and-mortar stores, posing a serious threat to P&amp;G,&#8221; noted Ian Conner, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, in a statement issued last month. &#8220;If P&amp;G can snuff out Billie’s rapid competitive growth, consumers will likely face higher prices,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>As a result of the FTC&#8217;s actions, the companies chose to put an end to their plans to merge as opposed to pursuing further legal action.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/01/statement-ian-conner-director-ftcs-bureau-competition-regarding">FTC praised this decision in a release issued today</a>. Reuters also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-billie-m-a-p-g-idUSKBN29A1RA">reported</a> on the companies&#8217; decision to terminate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Procter &amp; Gamble’s abandonment of the acquisition of Billie is good news for consumers who value low prices, quality, and innovation,&#8221; the FTC statement reads. &#8220;Billie is a direct-to-consumer company whose advertising targets customers who are tired of paying more for comparable razors. The FTC voted to challenge this merger because it would have eliminated dynamic competition from Billie.&#8221;</p>
<p>The FTC lawsuit was the second antitrust suit the agency filed in 2020 after it previously sued to block Edgewell Personal Care&#8217;s (maker of Schick razors) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/09/edgewell-acquires-harrys/">$1.37 billion deal to acquire the razor startup Harry&#8217;s, Inc</a>., another direct-to-consumer brand. As a result, that deal fell through, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Coral reefs all over the world are struggling to survive, with millions of people and billions of dollars in business that rely on them at risk — on top of the fundamental tragedy of losing such a crucial ecosystem. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/coral-vita" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="coral-vita">Coral Vita <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> aims to modernize both coral restoration techniques and the economy surrounding them, and has raised a $2 million seed round to kick things off in earnest.</p>
<p>I wrote about Coral Vita late in 2019 when I encountered co-founder Gator Halpern on the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/16/in-the-accelerator-over-the-sea/">Sustainable Ocean Alliance&#8217;s Accelerator at Sea</a>. At the time, the operation was both smaller and under siege by Hurricane Dorian, which wiped out the team&#8217;s coral farm in the Bahamas — and then, of course, the pandemic arrived just in time to spoil the team&#8217;s 2020 plans along with everyone else&#8217;s.</p>

<p>But despite the general chaos of the last year, Coral Vita managed to start and at last close a $2 million round, with the intention to come back bigger and better and demonstrate a new global model for the field.</p>
<p>&#8220;We decided rather than just rebuilding our pilot farm to that pilot level, we&#8217;d just take the next step forward in our journey. We really believe this is an opportunity to jump start a restoration economy,&#8221; said Sam Teicher, co-founder and chief reef officer.</p>
<p>To picture how reef restoration looks today, imagine (as Teicher invited me to) an underwater garden near the shore, with floating ropes and structures on which grow coral fragments that are occasionally harvested and transported to the area in need of young, healthy corals.</p>

<p>&#8220;But when you think about the scale of the problem — half the world&#8217;s reef are dead and the other half are predicted to die in the next 30 years — relying on underwater facilities isn&#8217;t possible,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The plan Coral Vita has is to transition away from ocean-based farms to land facilities that allow for much improved yield and survivability, and employ advanced techniques to speed up coral&#8217;s growth and increase its survival rate. One such technique is coral fragmenting, developed by the restoration community at large, in which corals are broken up into tiny pieces, which can grow as much as 50 times faster in aggregate. And by doing so on land they can exert much more control over the coral&#8217;s attributes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got tanks on land with clean sea water pumping through and the ability, among other things, to control conditions,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;So if you think of what it&#8217;ll be like off the coast of Grand Bahama in 40-50 years, we can essentially simulate that to harden the corals against those conditions. Up front, an ocean-based nursery is much cheaper, but when you start thinking about the need to grow millions or billions of corals around the world, land-based facilities start to look a lot more realistic. The cost goes down with scale, too — ocean-based nurseries go to about $30-$40 per coral; we can get it down to $10 as we get up to a hundred or a thousand tanks.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2092393" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coral-vita-imgs-1.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2092393" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2092393 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coral-vita-imgs-1.jpeg" alt="Onlookers view the coral growing tanks at Coral Vita" width="1024" height="511" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coral-vita-imgs-1.jpeg 1928w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coral-vita-imgs-1.jpeg?resize=150,75 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coral-vita-imgs-1.jpeg?resize=300,150 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coral-vita-imgs-1.jpeg?resize=768,383 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coral-vita-imgs-1.jpeg?resize=680,339 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coral-vita-imgs-1.jpeg?resize=1536,766 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coral-vita-imgs-1.jpeg?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2092393" class="wp-caption-text">On the left, a Bahamanian tourism official (far left) listens to Sam Teicher. On the right, Gator Halpern (center) talks with others before the pandemic. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Coral Vita</p></div></p>
<p>Not only is the physical scale limited at present, but the income sources are as well: Often it&#8217;s government money instead of the inexhaustible well of private cash. Coral Vita hopes to be able to change that by increasing and diversifying supply and going directly to those affected.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to transform the space away from grants and aid — we&#8217;re selling to customers that depend on the ecosystems of reefs,&#8221; Teicher said. &#8220;If you&#8217;re a hotel that relies on scuba or snorkel tourists, if you&#8217;re a coastal property owner or insurer, a government, a development bank, a cruise line, you can hire Coral Vita to restore the reefs that you work on.&#8221;</p>
<p>This superficially mercenary business model where commercially important reefs get priority wouldn&#8217;t be necessary, of course, if governments and industry hadn&#8217;t systematically neglected these reefs to begin with. Not that privately funded projects are somehow fundamentally tainted, but this type of restoration work tends to be seen as the milieu of nonprofits and government agencies. One might consider this approach a direct, if late, tax that cuts out the government middle man.</p>
<p>The fact is this is globally crucial work that needs to start <em>now</em>, not in five or 10 years when the correct conservation funds are organized by concerned parties. Every month counts when reefs are actively deteriorating, and private money is the only realistic option to scale up fast and do what needs to be done. Plus, as the process becomes cheaper, it becomes easier to fund projects without commercial backing.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2092392" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coral-vita-imgs-4.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2092392" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2092392" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coral-vita-imgs-4.jpg" alt="Corals grow in a tank at Coral Vita in the Bahamas." width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coral-vita-imgs-4.jpg 6321w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coral-vita-imgs-4.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coral-vita-imgs-4.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coral-vita-imgs-4.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coral-vita-imgs-4.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coral-vita-imgs-4.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coral-vita-imgs-4.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/coral-vita-imgs-4.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2092392" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Coral Vita</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;On top of that is the ability to innovate,&#8221; added Teicher. &#8220;What we&#8217;re trying to do with this round is to make advances to the science and engineering, including 3D printing and robotics in the process. We&#8217;re launching R&amp;D projects not just for restoration but protection.&#8221;</p>
<p>He cited Tom Chi, co-founder of Google X and an early advisor and investor, as someone who has pushed on the automation side, comparing the industry to agriculture, where robotics is currently having a transformative effect.</p>
<p>Proving out the scalable land-based farms opens up the possibility of a global presence, as well — lowering costs and lead times for corals to be brought to where they&#8217;re needed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re at a point where we need to rethink adaptation and how to fund it,&#8221; said Teicher. &#8220;The two-year plan is to launch more farms in other countries — ultimately we want this to be the biggest coral farm that ever existed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leading the $2 million round was the environment-focused Builders Collective, with participation from Apollo Projects&#8217; Max Altman and baseball&#8217;s Max and Erica Scherzer. Earlier investors (in a pre-seed or &#8220;seed one&#8221; round) include the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/sustainable-ocean-alliance" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="sustainable-ocean-alliance">Sustainable Ocean Alliance, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Tom Chi as mentioned, Adam Draper, Yale University, and Sven and Kristin Lindblad.</p>

Today, the company announced that it will be acquiring the developer behind Luigi&#8217;s Mansion 3, Canada-based Next Level Games.</p>
<p>Nintendo&#8217;s announcement is the first studio acquisition for the company since their 2007 purchase of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em> developer Monolith Soft.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/next-level-games" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="next-level-games">Next Level Games <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> has been working on Nintendo-licensed IP exclusively for the better part of the last decade, crafting a number of titles across some of the company&#8217;s second tier of intellectual property including the Super Mario Strikers series as well as mobile iterations of Metroid Prime and Luigi&#8217;s Mansion.</p>
<p>The Vancouver-based studio&#8217;s recent Luigi&#8217;s Mansion 3 title for the Nintendo Switch has been a pretty huge success for the company which has had pretty light offerings of first-party IP since the system&#8217;s launch. In a recent earnings report, Nintendo shared that Luigi&#8217;s Mansion 3 had sold nearly 8 million copies, earning it a spot as one of the system&#8217;s top-selling titles.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today <a href="https://www.affirm.com/">Affirm</a>, a fintech startup that offers payment options to e-commerce customers, released a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465921000697/tm2026663-15_s1a.htm">new S-1/A filing</a>. The new document follows a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1820953/000110465920138534/tm2026663-13_s1a.htm">late-December filing</a> of a similar nature, though that update focused on <a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1341750729774682120">changing the language of Affirm&#8217;s reported results</a>, tweaking its language to remove some adjusted metrics and hewing closer to generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s more recent filing details what could be its first IPO price interval, indicating that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/affirm" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="affirm">Affirm <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> may price its shares between $33 and $38 per share in its IPO. If Affirm raises its estimates, expect that price range to tighten.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s calculate Affirm&#8217;s valuation marks at its new price range before digging into what we think of the company&#8217;s estimated worth against its most recent performance.</p>
<h2>Valuation</h2>
<p>There are two ways to calculate a company&#8217;s IPO valuation. The first takes into account only shares that will exist after the offering. The second, the so-called diluted valuation, takes into account shares that are available for exercise or conversion, but have yet to be. To avoid choosing sides today, we&#8217;ll calculate both.</p>
<p>The first, simple valuation is a doddle to tally:</p>
<ul>
<li>Affirm shares outstanding post-IPO, <em>including</em> its underwriters&#8217; option: 246,436,771.</li>
<li>Affirm IPO price interval: $33 to $38 per share.</li>
<li>Affirm simple IPO valuation range: $8.1 billion to $9.4 billion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Affirm&#8217;s fully diluted valuation involves a larger share count, so it generates larger results. Doing our own math, here&#8217;s how it shakes out (Bloomberg came up with slightly different numbers):</p>
<ul>
<li>Affirm fully diluted shares outstanding post-IPO, <em>including</em> its underwriters&#8217; option: 318,865,246<sup>1</sup>.</li>
<li>Affirm IPO price interval: $33 to $38 per share.</li>
<li>Affirm fully diluted IPO valuation range: $10.5 billion to $12.1 billion.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time of its April, 2019 Series F, Affirm was worth $2.9 billion after the capital was raised, according <a href="https://pitchbook.com/">to PitchBook</a>. The company also raised a $500 million Series G in September of 2020. That final round sold shares at $19.93 apiece, along with some convertible notes, per today&#8217;s filing; investors in that transaction are set to do very well in under a year.</p>
<p>Those who put money in even earlier will do even better.</p>
<h2>Do those numbers make sense?</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Boat, an electronics and lifestyle startup in India, has raised $100 million in a new financing round that many independent investors termed as the most successful hardware startup story to date in the world’s second-largest internet market.</p>
<p>An affiliate of <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/warburg-pincus" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="warburg-pincus">Warburg Pincus, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a New York-headquartered private equity firm, financed the entire Series B round for the four-year-old Indian startup, which sells low-cost, durable headphones, earphones and other mobile accessories.</p>
<p>The round gives <a href="https://www.boat-lifestyle.com/">Boat</a>, which had raised about $3 million in equity and debt financing prior to the new round, a post-money valuation of about $300 million, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Executives of Boat declined to comment on the valuation, other than saying that Warburg Pincus had bought a &#8220;significant minority stake&#8221; in the startup.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>An investor who did not want to be named said Boat has grown to be an anomaly case among hardware startups in India. There aren&#8217;t many hardware startups in India in the first place. Among those that do exist, very few have been able to raise much money. (Technically, I suppose you could squint your eyes hard enough to see smartphone vendors Micromax and Lava International as hardware startups, but neither of them have raised $100 million.) <span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Boat has made things even more interesting by achieving an additional rare milestone: profitability, said Sameer Mehta, co-founder of the startup, in an interview with TechCrunch.</span></p>
<p>The secret sauce of Boat, at least in part, is that it has managed to keep the price points of its accessories low while also making them aesthetically appealing. The startup counts the young generation as its target audience who want good-looking accessories at low prices but also tend to upgrade every few months.</p>
<p>Another possible reason why things worked out for Boat, which had only one institutional investor prior to the new round (Fireside Ventures), is that it showed up at the right time. The startup began its journey with selling charging cables and power adapters. Its beginning coincided with Indian smartphone market hitting a tipping point, where millions of people had started to buy a handset each month.</p>
<p>A few months into its journey, India&#8217;s richest man (Mukesh Ambani) further accelerated the smartphone market with the launch of telecom network Reliance Jio, which offered 4G data at no price for several months, suddenly giving tens of millions of people in the country yet another reason to upgrade to a smartphone.</p>

(Boat Lifestyle)</p></div></p>
<p>Boat has expanded into several categories in recent years, and followed the same strategy that made it stand out in the first place. Its fitness wearable starts at Indian rupees 1,799 ($24.50), smartwatches at $34, charging cables at $3.40, home theatre soundbars at $54, wireless speakers at $13.50, headphones at $5.50 and AirPod-like earbuds at $27.</p>
<p>According to marketing research firm IDC, Boat commands over 30% of the wearable market in India and is the fifth-largest brand globally in the category.</p>
<p>The startup &#8212; which clocked revenue of more than $65 million in the financial year that ended in March last year and expects to double this by the next financial year &#8212; sells its products through both online and offline retail channels. Its devices are available through Flipkart, Amazon India and Reliance Retail, as well as Tata Cliq, Croma and Vijay Sales. Analysts at HDFC bank estimated in a note last month that Boat Lifestyle&#8217;s products are available through over 5,000 retail stores across India, and it plans to enter global markets &#8212; something it would have done much sooner if the pandemic hadn&#8217;t come in the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;We see a compelling growth story in <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/boat" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="boat">boAt <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> and believe the company is well-poised to build upon the strong leadership position it has carved out within the industry and stands to benefit from the secular tailwinds of e-commerce growth in India. Warburg Pincus is excited to partner with the management team of boAt led by Aman &amp; Sameer in this journey and we look forward to supporting them through the next phase of the company’s growth,&#8221; said Vishal Mahadevia, managing director and head of Warburg Pincus India, in a statement.</p>
<p>Mehta said Boat has also been lucky with the way it marketed its products. Instead of following the traditional way of advertising, the startup signed up a handful of top young celebrities and cricketers who promoted Boat products. It helped that some of the people it counted on very early on &#8212; such as the cricketer Hardik Pandya (pictured in the lead image) &#8212; have also grown to be more successful in recent years.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear who Boat&#8217;s rivals are today. Certainly smartphone vendors such as Xiaomi and Realme that have expanded their accessories businesses pose a threat. Retailers like Croma, Flipkart, and Amazon have also expanded their in-house private labels to launch earphones and other mobile accessories in recent years. Mehta suggested that the market in which Boat operates is not a zero-sum game yet. &#8220;Everyone is growing at the same time,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>An investor who has backed several D2C brands, but not Boat, in India said that it&#8217;s true that many customers of Boat might consider buying AmazonBasics products, but he cautioned that AmazonBasics products are not necessarily the most aspirational items. &#8220;People are buying Boat because their products carry a premium feeling,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Another investor added that AmazonBasics items are also not as aggressively priced in India, as unlike other markets, Amazon is yet to scale its AmazonBasics catalog in the country.</p>
<p>Boat will deploy the fresh capital to shift more of its manufacturing from China to India, and expand to more categories including gaming keyboards and mice, Mehta said.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The systemic issues became apparent the way they often do -- when customers began complaining.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://segment.com">Segment</a>, the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/11/twilio-is-buying-customer-data-startup-segment-for-between-3b-and-4b/">Twilio bought last fall for $3.2 billion</a>, was just beginning to take off in 2015 when it ran into a scaling problem: It was growing so quickly, the tools it had built to process marketing data on its platform were starting to outgrow the original system design.</p>
<p>Inaction would cause the company to hit a technology wall, managers feared. Every early-stage startup craves growth and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/segment-io" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="segment-io">Segment <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> was no exception, but it also needed to begin thinking about how to make its data platform more resilient or reach a point where it could no longer handle the data it was moving through the system. It was &#8212; in a real sense &#8212; an existential crisis for the young business.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			The project that came out of their efforts was called Centrifuge, and its purpose was to move data through Segment&#8217;s data pipes to wherever customers needed it quickly and efficiently at the lowest operating cost.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>Segment&#8217;s engineering team began thinking hard about what a more robust and scalable system would look like. As it turned out, their vision would evolve in a number of ways between the end of 2015 and today, and with each iteration, they would take a leap in terms of how efficiently they allocated resources and processed data moving through its systems.</p>
<p>The project that came out of their efforts was called Centrifuge, and its purpose was to move data through Segment&#8217;s data pipes to wherever customers needed it quickly and efficiently at the lowest operating cost. This is the story of how that system came together.</p>
<h2>Growing pains</h2>
<p>The systemic issues became apparent the way they often do &#8212; when customers began complaining. When Tido Carriero, Segment&#8217;s chief product development officer, came on board at the end of 2015, he was charged with finding a solution. The issue involved the original system design, which like many early iterations from startups was designed to get the product to market with little thought given to future growth and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/23/when-choosing-a-tech-stack-look-before-you-leap/">the technical debt payment</a> was coming due.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">&#8220;We had [designed] our initial integrations architecture in a way that just wasn&#8217;t scalable in a number of different ways. We had been experiencing massive growth, and our CEO [Peter Reinhardt] came to me maybe three times within a month and reported various scaling challenges that either customers or partners of ours had alerted him to,&#8221; said Carriero.</span></p>
<p>The good news was that it was attracting customers and partners to the platform at a rapid clip, but it could all have come crashing down if the company didn&#8217;t improve the underlying system architecture to support the robust growth. As Carriero reports, that made it a stressful time, but having <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/15/why-dropbox-decided-to-drop-aws-and-build-its-own-infrastructure-and-network/">come from Dropbox</a>, he was actually in a position to understand that it&#8217;s possible to completely rearchitect the business&#8217;s technology platform and live to tell about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the things I learned from my past life [at Dropbox] is when you have a problem that&#8217;s just so core to your business, at a certain point you start to realize that you are the only company in the world kind of experiencing this problem at this kind of scale,&#8221; he said. For Dropbox that was related to storage, and for Segment it was processing large amounts of data concurrently.</p>
<p>In the build-versus-buy equation, Carriero knew that he had to build his way out of the problem. There was nothing out there that could solve Segment&#8217;s unique scaling issues. &#8220;Obviously that led us to believe that we really need to think about this a little bit differently, and that was when our Centrifuge V2 architecture was born,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>Building the imperfect beast</h2>
<p>The company began measuring system performance, at the time processing 8,442 events per second. When it began building V2 of its architecture, that number had grown to an average of 18,907 events per second.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The rise of distributed teams in response to the coronavirus has led to more video-conferencing meetings for all of us. As offices remain closed, distributed work is forcing companies to figure out a better way than Zoom or Google Hangouts to meet with employees across time zones and teams.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><a href="https://rewatch.tv/">Rewatch</a> wants to make meetings more efficient, and maybe even shorter. Co-founded by<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/connors"> Connor Sears</a> and<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottjg/"> Scott Goldman</a>, Rewatch creates and organizes private video channels for companies to store meetings so employees can sift through them on their own time.</p>
<p>And at its core, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/rewatch" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="rewatch">Rewatch <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is a counterintuitive play: The startup thinks it can combat &#8220;Zoom fatigue&#8221; by giving employees more ways to watch video-conferencing calls.</p>
<p>The product works like this: Companies can record their meetings, over Google Hangouts or Zoom, and then Rewatch archives the meetings into a database. Using tags and notes, the videos become more searchable and easier to find. For example, you can tag a co-worker in a meeting in which they got an unexpected shout-out. Or you can search for the last time a manager brought up the project you’re working on.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2090486 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Home.png" alt="" width="879" height="753" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Home.png 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Home.png?resize=150,128 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Home.png?resize=300,257 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Home.png?resize=768,657 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Home.png?resize=680,582 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Home.png?resize=1536,1315 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Home.png?resize=50,43 50w" sizes="(max-width: 879px) 100vw, 879px" /></p>
<p>The video libraries, which the company describes as “mini-YouTube channels,” also include transcriptions of all meetings. Rewatch is turning synchronous meetings into asynchronous bulletins and documents.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2090487 aligncenter" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Collaboration.png" alt="" width="676" height="559" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Collaboration.png 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Collaboration.png?resize=150,124 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Collaboration.png?resize=300,248 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Collaboration.png?resize=768,635 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Collaboration.png?resize=680,562 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Collaboration.png?resize=1536,1270 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Collaboration.png?resize=50,41 50w" sizes="(max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px" /></p>
<p>“In the past, the only way to scale a meeting was just to have a longer meeting, or more meetings,” Sears said.</p>
<p>If Rewatch works, the founders hope to see meetings shift from squares of muted floating heads to interactive across various teams and time zones with text and annotations.</p>
<p>Sears first had the idea for Rewatch when he was an employee at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/github" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="github">GitHub, <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> a space for developers. GitHub, which is fully distributed, created an internal YouTube channel to enable employees across time zones to work with one another. Now, the two co-founders are trying to take one of GitHub’s internally loved features and bring it, and more, to the mainstream.</p>
<p>So far, the startup has been able to land a number of customers, including GitHub, although it wouldn’t disclose total numbers. When it launches, the company will charge a subscription fee, but Sears and Goldman have not disclosed the pricing yet.</p>
<p>One of Rewatch’s competitors is Google Drive, which has lagged in creativity around storing and structuring video content. The startup competes with the tool by adding more search-friendly features for video like live transcriptions. Other competitors include Berlin-based <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/21/acapela/">Acapela</a>, which is working on asynchronous meetings, and Storyboard, a podcast company that helps directors publish <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201216005187/en/Storyboard-Raises-4.5-Million-Round-Led-by-CRV-to-Bring-the-Consumer-Podcast-Boom-to-the-Enterprise">on-demand audio content to their stakeholders</a>. Both companies have recently raised millions of dollars.</p>
<p>While innovation around how meetings are held certainly feels important, Rewatch and others are betting that employees will turn to these content repositories on a semi-often basis and engage with them in a meaningful way. But how many of us watch the standup we missed while on vacation? The business is contingent on that singular consumer habit.</p>
<p>This reality doesn&#8217;t mean innovation isn’t welcome. It just means that a huge shift in consumer habits needs to change in order for this startup, and many others, to be successful. And that too-early-to-know reality makes the fact that investors have put millions into the startup<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/29/startup-cynicism/"> even more compelling</a>.</p>
<p>Rewatch has convinced a number investors on its vision. The startup tells TechCrunch that it has raised a $2 million pre-seed round led by Semil Shah at <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/haystack-5" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="haystack-5">Haystack <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with participation from Kent Goldman at Upside Partnership. Other investors include Gumroad CEO Sahil Lavingia, GitHub CTO Jason Warner and SVP of Zendesk Jason Smeale.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">More than two years ago, Ludwig Schoenack, Nikolaus Volk and Francesco Wiedemann looked at the bevy of scooter services, ride-hailing apps, public transit and car-sharing options available in most urban centers in the United States and saw a gap in the mobility market.</p>
<p>Consumers who didn&#8217;t want to own a car, but needed one for a few days or weeks had two options: head to a car rental center, likely located at an airport or outside the city center, or turn to a car-sharing platform. The three friends — all German immigrants whose paths had crossed in San Francisco — decided to pool their collective expertise from BMW, McKinsey and Uber and launch Kyte to create a new kind of car rental experience without taking on the costly business of owning and maintaining large fleets.</p>
<p><a href="https://drivekyte.com/">Kyte</a> built a fleet-logistics platform that lets consumers rent vehicles through their app or website. The vehicles, which are located in hubs throughout a city center, are delivered by gig economy workers right to the renters&#8217; home. Kyte also handles the pickup and refuels the vehicle for no extra charge.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;We still believe people own cars because they want it outside their door, so we thought why don&#8217;t we put it right there,&#8221; Schoenack said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Kyte partners with car rental firms and other companies that manage fleets, allowing the startup to focus on consumers and the tech.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">The startup, which launched in late 2018 and operates in Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco, has caught the attention of capital of investors. The startup said Tuesday it has raised $9 million in funding from </span>DN Capital and Amplo VC. Numerous individual investors from the mobility industry also participated, including former Uber executives Ed Baker, Jörg Heilig, Josh Mohrer and William Barnes, as well as Lime co-founder Toby Sun and Kayak and Travelocity co-founder Terry Jones.</p>
<p>The funds are already being put to work to help drive Kyte&#8217;s expansion into markets, starting with Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Kyte&#8217;s founders wouldn&#8217;t disclose their revenue, except to say it&#8217;s generating a &#8220;solid six-figure&#8221; amount of revenue monthly. Schoenack added that Kyte&#8217;s monthly revenue has grown 400% since March as more consumers have turned to cars during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even before COVID was on the horizon, it was clear that we needed to change the way we interact with cars,&#8221; Schoenack said. Consumers have been more willing to try alternatives like Kyte to travel as COVID-19 has turned many off from air travel.</p>
<p>Despite this fast growth, Schoenack said more than half of Kyte&#8217;s bookings come from recurring users.</p>
<p>Kyte has also found its clients — which Schoenack would only describe as the biggest rental car companies in the country — are willing and enthusiastic participants since it helps get vehicles in the hands of customers. Rental car companies were hit hard by COVID-19 since the bulk of operations are at airports. These companies were left with millions of dollars of depreciating assets that weren&#8217;t generating any revenue.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pandemic has accelerated the transformation of cities and consumer behavior with respect to transportation,&#8221; Schlenker said. &#8220;Kyte&#8217;s unique operations layer facilitates this transformation while providing a level of service and convenience that other solutions fail to meet.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Today <a href="https://getdivvy.com/">Divvy</a>, a Utah-based startup that focuses on corporate spend management, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/divvy-raises-165-million-at-a-1-6-billion-valuation-301200377.html">announced</a> that it has closed a $165 million round at a $1.6 billion valuation. The company said that the new capital was raised from Hanaco, Schonfeld, PayPal Ventures and Whale Rock, along with a cadre of prior investors.</p>
<p>The new investment is not <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/divvy-7ad9" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="divvy-7ad9">Divvy&#8217;s <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> first megaround of private capital. The well-known startup raised $200 million in April of 2019. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/30/utahs-divvy-raises-200m-to-eliminate-expense-reports/">reported at the time</a> that that round valued Divvy at around $700 million, making today&#8217;s deal a more than 2x increase in valuation for the company.</p>
<p>Divvy exists amongst the current generation of Utah-based tech upstarts that are keeping the state&#8217;s tech scene in the broader startup conversation. Podium <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/utahs-podium-raises-125m-series-c-led-by-yc-after-reaching-100m-arr/">fits in the same cohort</a>, for example, while <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/qualtrics/">Qualtrics</a> feels like it&#8217;s from the preceding peer group.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="AUwwU3RAvg"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/30/utahs-divvy-raises-200m-to-eliminate-expense-reports/">Utah&#8217;s Divvy raises $200M to eliminate expense reports</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Utah&#8217;s Divvy raises $200M to eliminate expense reports&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/30/utahs-divvy-raises-200m-to-eliminate-expense-reports/embed/#?secret=AUwwU3RAvg" data-secret="AUwwU3RAvg" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Divvy&#8217;s market, the corporate spend management space &#8212; broadly, corporate cards and software that helps firms manage and limit expenses &#8212; is incredibly active today as businesses look to modernize their financial infrastructure. The new capital for Divvy comes after multiple other <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/spendesk-raises-another-18-million-for-its-corporate-card-and-expense-service/">competitors recently announced fresh funds itself</a>, for example. Let&#8217;s take a look at who Divvy is taking on with its new round.</p>
<h2>Competition</h2>
<p>A few weeks back <a href="https://t.co/robCWKydUu?amp=1">Ramp</a>, another corporate-cards-and-software startup, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/ramp-raises-30m-as-the-battle-to-own-corporate-spend-heats-up/">announced a $30 million raise</a> and that it had reached $100 million in spend through its service in its first 18 months of business. At the same time Divvy shared with TechCrunch that it had seen 120% customer growth and over 100% growth in platform spend in 2020, compared to 2019. At the time, Brex, which also competes in the corporate spend space, declined to share metrics.</p>
<p>That Divvy was able to raise so much capital given its recent growth rates is not surprising. But that so many companies in its sector are managing similarly strong-to-line expansion stands out. After covering the <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ramp-3" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ramp-3">Ramp <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> round in December and noting Divvy&#8217;s metrics at the same time, both <a href="https://www.airbase.com/">Airbase</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/spend-control-focused-airbase-adds-23-5m-to-its-series-a-as-it-posts-quick-growth/">more here</a>) and <a href="https://www.teampay.co/">Teampay</a> (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teampay-adds-5m-to-its-series-a-at-higher-valuation-after-growing-arr-320-growth-since-the-round/">more here</a>) reached out with numbers of their own.</p>
<p><a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/team-labs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="team-labs">Teampay <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> reiterated <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teampay-adds-5m-to-its-series-a-at-higher-valuation-after-growing-arr-320-growth-since-the-round/">its October-era metrics:</a> that it has seen its annual recurring revenue (ARR) grow by 320% and its total spend grow by 800% since its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/26/tribe-leads-12m-series-a-into-teampay-to-make-managing-employee-expenses-painless/">then year-ago Series A</a>. Airbase noted what it described as 250% growth in ARR &#8212; up by 2.5x, in other words &#8212; and 700% growth in payment volume (annualized).</p>
<p>Divvy, Teampay and <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/airbase" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="airbase">Airbase <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> are therefore growing like all heck, though in slightly different fashions. Divvy and Ramp offer their corporate spend products and software for free, taking a slice of payment volume through interchange revenues. Teampay and Airbase generate incomes from interchange as well, but also charge for their software. This gives them both spend<em> and</em> software revenues.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="NK1Wdkl1gB"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teampay-adds-5m-to-its-series-a-at-higher-valuation-after-growing-arr-320-growth-since-the-round/">Teampay adds $5M to its Series A at higher valuation after growing ARR 320% growth since the round</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Teampay adds $5M to its Series A at higher valuation after growing ARR 320% growth since the round&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/teampay-adds-5m-to-its-series-a-at-higher-valuation-after-growing-arr-320-growth-since-the-round/embed/#?secret=NK1Wdkl1gB" data-secret="NK1Wdkl1gB" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Which brings us back to Divvy&#8217;s news from today. I normally avoid quoting from releases, but in today&#8217;s case a paragraph is worth sharing:</p>
<blockquote><p>The valuation of <span class="xn-money">$1.6 billion</span> and the addition of key investors validates Divvy&#8217;s ambition to modernize financial processes by combining credit, vendor, and spend management into a single platform. With this round of funding, Divvy plans to invest heavily in product development and engineering in order to accelerate their future roadmap.</p></blockquote>
<p>Divvy is going to invest heavily in product? That makes sense. But to give away its software forever just seems odd. Some of its competitors are charging for theirs! Why not Divvy as well?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see, but what is clear today is that the capital that has gone into startups in Divvy&#8217;s cohort was put into a niche that has shown huge demand. So, expect to hear more from this product area in 2021.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.chronosphere.io/">Chronosphere</a>, the scalable cloud native monitoring tool launched in 2019 by two former Uber engineers, announced a $43.4 million Series B today. The company also announced that their service was generally available starting today.</p>
<p>Greylock, Lux Capital and venture capitalist Lee Fixel, all of whom participated in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/05/chronosphere-launches-with-11m-series-a-to-build-scalable-cloud-native-monitoring-tool/">the startup&#8217;s $11 million Series A</a> in 2019, led the round with participation from new investor General Atlantic. The company has raised $54.4 million.</p>
<p>The two founders, CEO Martin Mao and CTO Rob Skillington, created the open-source <a href="https://eng.uber.com/m3/">M3 monitoring project</a> while they were working at Uber, and left in 2019 to launch Chronosphere, a startup based on that project. As Mao told me <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/05/chronosphere-launches-with-11m-series-a-to-build-scalable-cloud-native-monitoring-tool/">at the time of the A round</a>, the company wanted to simplify the management of running the open source project:</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<blockquote><p>M3 itself is a fairly complex piece of technology to run. It is solving a fairly complex problem at large scale, and running it actually requires a decent amount of investment to run at large scale, so the first thing we’re doing is taking care of that management,</p></blockquote>
<p>He said that the company spent most of last year iterating the product and working with beta customers, adding that they certainly benefited from building the commercial service on top of the open-source project.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;re lucky that we have the foundation already from the open-source project, but we really wanted to focus a lot on building a product on top of that technology and really have this product be differentiated, so that was most of the focus of 2020 for us,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="gucbqL0DFf"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/ibm-is-acquiring-apm-startup-instana-as-it-continues-to-expand-hybrid-cloud-vision/">IBM is acquiring APM startup Instana as it continues to expand hybrid cloud vision</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;IBM is acquiring APM startup Instana as it continues to expand hybrid cloud vision&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/18/ibm-is-acquiring-apm-startup-instana-as-it-continues-to-expand-hybrid-cloud-vision/embed/#?secret=gucbqL0DFf" data-secret="gucbqL0DFf" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Mao points out that he and Skillington weren&#8217;t looking for this new round of funding as they still had money left from the A round, but the company&#8217;s previous investors approached them and they decided to strike to add additional money to the balance sheet, which would help grow the company, attract employees and help reassure customers they had plenty of capital to continue building the product and the company.</p>
<p>As the company has developed over the last year, it has been adding employees at a rapid clip, growing from 13 at the time of the A round in 2019 to 50 today with plans to double that by the end of next year. Mao says the founders have been thinking about how to build a diverse company from its early days.</p>
<p>&#8220;So [ … ] beginning last year we were making sure we were hiring the right leaders, and the right recruiting team who also care about diversity, then following that we made company-wide goals and targets for both gender and ethnic diversity, and then [we have been] holding ourselves accountable on these particular goals and tracking against them,&#8221; Mao said.</p>
<p>The company has been spread out from the beginning, even before COVID, with offices in Seattle, New York and Lithuania, and that has helped in terms of having a broader base to recruit from. Mao wants to remain mostly remote whenever it&#8217;s possible to return to the office, but maintain hubs on each coast where employees can meet and see each other in person.</p>
<p>With the product generally available today, the company will look to expand its customer base, and with the open-source project to drive interest, they have a proven way to attract new customers to the commercial product.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tile is preparing to introduce a new product this year that will serve as a rival to Apple&#8217;s long-awaited AirTags and other lost-item trackers coming to the market, including those from Samsung, TechCrunch has learned. While previous Tile trackers have leveraged Bluetooth to help users locate lost items &#8212; like a misplaced set of keys, for example &#8212; Tile&#8217;s new product will take advantage of UWB (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-wideband">ultra-wideband</a>) technology to find the missing items. It will also use augmented reality to help guide users to the lost item&#8217;s location via the Tile mobile app.</p>
<p>Ultra-wideband technology is <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/ultra-wideband-information-iph771fd0aad/ios">available</a> on newer iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 models and <a href="https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/27710/20201014/led-samsung-apple-uwb-next-big-smartphone-tech.htm">select Android-powered devices</a>, including more recent devices <a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/10/12/samsung-uwb-tech-xiaomi-smart-home-demo/">from Samsung</a>.</p>
<p>Like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, UWB is a short-range, wireless communication protocol, but one that operates at very high frequencies. It can be used to capture spatial and directional data, which is where it comes in handy to lost-item finders, like Tile&#8217;s trackers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Apple last year <a href="https://www.imore.com/ios-14-developers-can-now-take-advantage-u1-chip-thanks-new-nearby-interaction-framework">began to give third-party developers access</a> to its U1 chip, which uses UWB technology to make the iPhone spatially aware, via its &#8220;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/nearbyinteraction">NearbyInteraction</a>&#8221; framework. Some Android devices also ship with the technology. It&#8217;s unclear to what extent Tile is using the new frameworks with its forthcoming product, and the company is likely under NDA with regard to its work with Apple specifically, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/24/apple-find-my-competition/">per earlier reports</a>.</p>
<p>Based on Tile&#8217;s internal concept art for the device (shown below), Tile&#8217;s UWB model will look similar to its other small trackers, like the Tile Mate and Tile Pro. It will also have a square shape, center button and flat back to support being mounted using an adhesive. And like other Tile dongles, it can be attached to a keychain.</p>

<p>Typically, Tile dongles would be attached to things like keys, remote controls, handbags, duffels, luggage or other small carry items, or stuck to larger devices like personal electronics or bikes. However, lost items could only be located by way of Bluetooth, when nearby, or via Tile&#8217;s &#8220;community find&#8221; network when farther away. The latter leveraged the Tile app installed on its users&#8217; phones to help locate any Tile tracker set to a lost mode, then ping the item&#8217;s owner when the item was found. This has allowed Tile users in the past to locate lost items like those left on an airplane by mistake, for example.</p>
<p>The new Tile tracker, on the other hand, will use UWB to make the finding process easier than before.</p>
<p>Because UWB offers spatial awareness capabilities, it will be able to locate missing items inside or outside, even when you can&#8217;t hear the tracker&#8217;s ring. This could help when the missing item is buried under something &#8212; like a sofa cushion &#8212; or inside something like a dresser drawer, for example. It can also help to find items more easily in a larger space, like a house with multiple floors.</p>
<p>The Tile app, meanwhile, will allow users to launch to an AR-enabled camera view that will help to guide them to the item&#8217;s location using overlays, like directional arrows and an AR view of the item&#8217;s location.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2092113" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2092113" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2092113 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.02.00-PM.jpg?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="367" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.02.00-PM.jpg 1814w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.02.00-PM.jpg?resize=150,81 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.02.00-PM.jpg?resize=300,162 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.02.00-PM.jpg?resize=768,414 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.02.00-PM.jpg?resize=680,367 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.02.00-PM.jpg?resize=1536,828 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-04-at-3.02.00-PM.jpg?resize=50,27 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2092113" class="wp-caption-text">Tile internal concept art. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Tile</p></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Per sources familiar with Tile&#8217;s plans, we understand Tile expects to release the new tracker later this year with support for both iOS and Android devices. Pricing is unknown. Tile will still sell its popular Bluetooth-enabled devices, of course, as a good portion of the market does not yet own a UWB-enabled smartphone at this time &#8212; the technology is only found in newer devices.</p>
<p>Though Tile has historically led the market in comparison with other third-party lost-item trackers, the company is due to face increased competition in 2021 as new trackers arrive from top smartphone brands, like Samsung and Apple.</p>
<p>At the <a href="https://insights.samsung.com/2020/08/05/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-virtual-event-watch-the-livestream-here-2/">2020 Samsung Galaxy Unpacked virtual event</a>, Samsung discussed its plans to integrate UWB into a new SmartThings Find application. This week, its <a href="https://gizmodo.com/latest-samsung-leak-shows-off-tile-like-bluetooth-track-1845977459">upcoming Samsung Galaxy SmartTag tracker was spotted</a> in images provided to the certification authority NCC. The device very much looks like a Tile tracker, with its square-ish shape and keychain hole, for instance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, according to a new research note from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/04/kuo-airtags-ar-device-2021/?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">Apple will reveal its own Tile competitor, AirTags</a> this year. Apple has already all but confirmed AirTag&#8217;s existence, as it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/02/apple-accidentally-confirms-the-existence-of-an-unreleased-product-airtags/">even accidentally published references</a> to its lost-item tracker in an official support video at one point. <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/04/leaker-shares-final-apple-airtags-design-in-leaked-pairing-animation-video">Leaked images of the AirTags</a> also began to circulate this week, adding fuel to these reports of a &#8220;soon-ish&#8221; AirTags launch.</p>
<p>A UWB-powered tracker could help allow Tile to maintain its position in the market. Tile, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/lost-item-finder-tile-expands-partnership-with-comcast-as-apples-competitor-looms/">as of last year</a>, had sold 26 million Tile devices, and was locating around six million items per day across 195 countries. Tile&#8217;s website now <a href="https://www.thetileapp.com/en-us/about-tile">says</a> its devices reach over 230 countries and territories. With this scale, Tile today leads the market. But Apple&#8217;s AirTags could have a first-party advantage with deep integrations into its &#8220;Find My&#8221; app  &#8212; a concern that was <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/01/17/tile-apple-antitrust-opening-statement/">brought up by Tile in last year&#8217;s antitrust hearings</a> in reference to how Apple wields its platform and market power to overrun competitive businesses.</p>
<p>Tile is not speaking publicly about its plans for a UWB device at this time.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we can’t comment on our product roadmap, we&#8217;re constantly looking to improve our customer experience and solve the pain point of finding lost items,&#8221; a spokesperson for Tile told TechCrunch.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The aggregate fintech venture dataset shows an active sector with global demand from investors, but demand is not even.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Over the next few weeks, the venture capital industry will compile and release data concerning its Q4 2020 performance, capping a year that saw the world of private capital <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/30/the-second-wave-of-unicorn-layoffs-is-brutal/">freeze</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/second-quarter-vc-investing-totals-appear-lackluster/">thaw</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/19/late-stage-deals-made-q3-2020-a-standout-vc-quarter-for-us-based-startups/">burn</a>.</p>
<p>But we can get a peek at a critical part of the VC universe early, thanks to a preview of global <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/aax-b20d" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="aax-b20d">fintech <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> investment results <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/fintech-trends-q4-2020/">from CB Insights</a>. The dataset deals with worldwide investments into fintech companies from the start of October through December 12.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on Extra Crunch</a>, or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Given that the last two weeks of the year are not famous for productivity, the dataset we have should prove representative for this critical slice of the venture capital market. (For our look at the third-quarter fintech VC market, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/13/fintech-vc-keeps-getting-later-larger-and-more-expensive/">head here</a>.)</p>
<p>To be honest, I didn&#8217;t plan on writing up this data when I first dug into it; I was prepping for later releases, hoping to ground myself ahead of the full numbers. However, the collected results aligned with several themes that cropped up during 2020, making it a representative capstone of sorts concerning the year&#8217;s venture capital market. So it was too interesting to not unpack.</p>
<p>What happened to fintech venture capital investment in Q4 and 2020? Some startup stages and regions did well, but amidst the good news, one of the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/24/us-seed-stage-investing-flourished-during-pandemic/">hotter domestic segments of startup land</a> is not set to have a good global year. Let&#8217;s get into the numbers.</p>
<p>A final warning: Although these results are missing a few weeks&#8217; worth of inputs, we believe these numbers will prove more than directionally accurate when all results are tallied and released by the various organs of venture data tracking.</p>
<h2>North America and Europe shine, Asia falls</h2>
<p>Using numbers that include projections for the rest of 2020, it&#8217;s clear that the fintech venture capital world is not equally distributed. If you are reading this in the United States, for example, or the U.K., you might be surprised to learn that <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/cb-insights" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="cb-insights">CB Insights <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> expects global fintech venture capital deal and dollar volume to fall in 2020. Surely not, with all the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/23/how-robinhood-and-chime-raised-2b-in-the-last-year/">neobank and trading-platform deals we saw</a>?</p>
<p>Yes, actually, because while fintech investment has risen in dollar terms in both North America and Europe, huge declines in Asia have overshadowed results in the other two regions. Here&#8217;s the clip of the preview chart:</p>

					<description><![CDATA["The next social network needs to be a place to hang also when you don’t come for a game session."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The gaming industry has had plenty of watershed moments in 2020 as consumer entertainment habits have shifted in response to the pandemic. One trend has been the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/top-gaming-investors-share-how-the-pandemic-is-reshaping-mmos-and-social-games/">crystallization of MMOs as social entertainment hubs</a> that serve more needs for users than ever before.</p>
<p>Following my survey of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/20/7-investors-discuss-augmented-reality-and-vr-startup-opportunities-in-2020/">gaming-focused investors on trends in the AR/VR world</a> several months ago, I pinged a handful of investors to tap their thoughts on the shifting trends and opportunities in social gaming.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hope Cochran, <a href="https://www.madrona.com/team-profiles/hope-cochran/">Madrona Venture Group</a></li>
<li>Daniel Li, <a href="https://www.madrona.com/team-profiles/daniel-li/">Madrona Venture Group</a></li>
<li>Niko Bonatsos, <a href="https://www.generalcatalyst.com/team/niko-bonatsos/">General Catalyst</a></li>
<li>Ethan Kurzweil, <a href="https://www.bvp.com/team/ethan-kurzweil">Bessemer Venture Partners</a></li>
<li>Sakib Dadi, <a href="https://www.bvp.com/team/sakib-dadi">Bessemer Venture Partners</a></li>
<li>Jacob Mullins, <a href="https://shastaventures.com/team/jacob-mullins/">Shasta Ventures</a></li>
<li>Alice Lloyd George, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alice-lloyd-george-b6686124/">Rogue</a></li>
<li>Gigi Levy-Weiss, <a href="https://www.nfx.com/team/gigi-levy-weiss/">NFX</a></li>
</ul>
<p>One thing that most investors expressed excitement around was the widening entertainment ambitions of social platforms, as concerts and movie screenings find homes on gaming platforms like Fortnite.</p>
<p>While evolving free-to-play mechanics continue to elevate the experience of single-player titles into something more living and breathing, platforms like Roblox have found areas for growth that seem more unique, developing into destinations for users to communicate and share.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s where culture is created,&#8221; Madrona&#8217;s Daniel Li told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Not all of the respondents shared the belief that a gaming platform like Fortnite would grow to become the next Facebook. General Catalyst&#8217;s Niko Bonatsos pointed to adjacent platforms like Discord or Twitch as the constants that would remain as consumers cycled through different platform ecosystems. Other pointed to the the still-disjointed experience switching between mobile and desktop experiences as a yet-to-be-solved stumbling block.</p>
<p>Building the metaverse and building a popular casual mobile game are two different things. Most investors I talked with emphasized how much the pace of scaling has accelerated across categories though with breakout hits rising faster than ever while disasters seem to grow evident just as quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that you look at Among Us, and Cyberpunk on the other side, anything can happen much faster and more extreme than it used to be just because of distribution,&#8221; Rogue VC&#8217;s Alice Lloyd George told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Read below for the full answers; some responses have been edited for length and clarity.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Hope Cochran and Daniel Li, Madrona Venture Group</h2>
<p><b>The idea that the next big social network will be an MMO seems to be a trendy take in the VC world, what are the roadblocks to this actually happening?</b></p>
<p><strong>Daniel Li:</strong> Hope and I were trading some notes and part of our thesis is that gaming is the future of social and for Gen Z, gaming is replacing not just old games, but it&#8217;s replacing TV and Netflix. So instead of going to watch music videos on YouTube, you&#8217;re going to a concert in Roblox and that&#8217;s a social experience with your friend … instead of going to the mall, now you&#8217;re in Roblox. It&#8217;s where kids are hanging out and it&#8217;s where culture is created.</p>
<p><strong>Hope Cochran:</strong> And in COVID, it&#8217;s the only place where they can hang out and I think the gaming industry has done a really fabulous job creating another social engagement that we need right now. I don&#8217;t want to focus too much on kids, but parents are becoming more accepting of their kids in the games because there is this social engagement and, for instance, I can see that my child is upstairs connecting with his four best friends. They log in together and they play. They normally might be out on a soccer field but they can&#8217;t right now so I think parents are becoming a little more comfortable saying, &#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s playing with his friends.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Gaming has seemingly become a more “mainstream” area for investment, as someone who has been in the space a bit, what&#8217;s different about investing in the gaming sector?</b></p>
<p><strong>HC:</strong> It&#8217;s very hard to find that balance between creative or understanding what might become a hit and a real business mind. So my experience has been that when you look into a gaming company as an investor, it&#8217;s actually more driven by math, stats and analytics, and then you have a core team who has the creative juices, so I try to look for that kind of dynamic.</p>
<p>So, who is developing what the users will love and who is analyzing it and how are they responding to what the users are loving. I do think there&#8217;s a point where a team develops a game and it&#8217;s mostly a creative process but then you have to kind of toggle to the analytics. It&#8217;s where the mathematicians meet the magicians and there needs to be a combination of that within every game.</p>
<p><b>What’s different about how popular games and MMOs are scaling these days? Have you seen any interesting growth hacks or strategies that seem promising?</b></p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> I think there are more and more of these cultural memes that just seem to come out of nowhere, like Among Us kind of just sat there for two years and streamers started picking it up and now it&#8217;s super popular. I&#8217;d say for nearly all of those, they&#8217;re going to be a social category of games, you don&#8217;t see a game like Cyberpunk come out of nowhere without any marketing dollars behind it.</p>
<p>So I do think one of those new channels is getting influencers to talk about your games, and typically I think for those it&#8217;s not actually the big influencers picking it up, it&#8217;s a whole bunch of small influencers all starting to play a game and have it start to build up steam that way. It&#8217;s more likely the Call of Duty&#8217;s that can hire the big streamers and pay them millions of bucks to play a new game, but I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a new to go-to-market for smaller studios around that.</p>
<p><b>How can MMOs, which feel like fundamentally active experiences, provide a better passive experience for users that may be more interested in the community than playing a first-person shooter or battle royale? How do games become more approachable to a wider audience?</b></p>
<p><strong>DL:</strong> A lot of people are saying these single-player games aren&#8217;t really fun games anymore, they&#8217;re just like cinematic experiences. Like playing Cyberpunk for 60 hours versus binge-watching three TV series, it&#8217;s definitely a different experience. The thing that&#8217;s actually more interesting here is the virtual events that are happening inside these games. Thinking about what the next Twitch looks like, it&#8217;s probably some kind of experience where you&#8217;re inside the game doing something more passive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;">Pokémon GO creator Niantic has acquired a small SF gaming startup building a league and tournament organization platform to help gamers create their own communities around popular titles.</span><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><a href="https://mayhem.gg/">Mayhem</a> was in Y Combinator&#8217;s winter 2018 batch and went on to raise $5.7 million in funding, according to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mayhem-gg/company_financials">Crunchbase</a>. Other backers include Accel, which led the startup’s Series A in 2018, Afore Capital and NextGen Venture Partners.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s focus has shifted quite a bit since its initial YC debut, when it announced a service called Visor that would analyze video of esports gameplay and coach users on how they could improve their performance. The company has seemed to shift its focus wholly to community tools to help gamers find matches and organize tournaments for games like Overwatch on its platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Terms of the acquisition weren’t disclosed by <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nianticlabs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nianticlabs">Niantic <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>The “majority” of Mayhem’s team will be joining <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/nianticlabs" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="nianticlabs">Niantic <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> with the startup’s CEO Ivan Zhou landing in the company’s Social Platform Product team while the rest of the team joins Platform Engineering.</p>
<p>In a statement, Niantic asserts that the acquisition “reinforces our commitment to real-world social as the centerpiece of our mission.”</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/29/the-niantic-ec-1/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ec-1-niantic-read-more.jpg?w=300" alt="Read a deep dive of Niantic on Extra Crunch" width="300" height="160" /></a></p>
<p>Most of Niantic’s acquisitions of late have focused on augmented reality backend technologies, so it’s interesting to see them buying tech that focuses on community organization.</p>
<p>Pokémon GO continues to be Niantic’s cash cow, though the company hasn’t seen the same levels of viral success with subsequent releases where organic growth hasn’t been quite as easy to come by. Buying a startup building community tools suggests the company is ready to bring in some outside tech to push their own efforts forward as they strive to create a broader platform for their AR ambitions and more standalone hits of their own.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">There’s a decent chance you missed the news back in May &#8212; there was, after all, a lot going on at the time. General Electric sold off its more than 100-year-old <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ge-power-ag" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ge-power-ag">GE <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> Lighting division to smart home company Savant. Today, the division’s new owner is announcing a key rebranding effort, six months after the initial deal.</p>
<p>Clearly there’s still value in the GE name, even divorced of its original parent company. In its new home, the C by GE line is getting a rebrand, however. Seems totally reasonable &#8212; C by GE was never the most straightforward name. Going forward, the line will be rebranded as “Cync” &#8212; which, if not better is, at the very least different.</p>
<p>Along with the change in ownership, the name connotes a broadening of scope &#8212; that much was probably an inevitability under Savant. <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://crunchbase.com/organization/ge-lighting" target="_blank" data-type="organization" data-entity="ge-lighting">GE Lighting <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> is becoming a larger smart-home brand in its new home. CES, which kicks off next week, will find the company introducing a new thermostat and a range of outdoor products, including a new smart plug. The brand will also introduce a connected camera and fan speed switch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The new products will test the value of the GE Lighting brand name, both outside of General Electric and beyond just lighting. The smart-home category is already a crowded one (and has been for years), and Savant’s going up against offerings from big names like Amazon’s Ring.</p>
<p>The new Cync app will arrive in March, bringing with it “a more user-friendly and customizable experience that enhances comfort, control and confidence,” according to Savant. More news next week at CES.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In an unexpected turn, the New York Stock Exchange <a href="https://ir.theice.com/press/news-details/2021/NYSE-Updates-Guidance-on-Delisting-Determination-for-Securities-of-Three-Issuers-in-Relation-to-Executive-Order-13959--/default.aspx">said</a> Monday that it no longer intends to delist China&#8217;s three major telecoms operators, a decision that was originally announced on December 31.</p>
<p>The initial action targeted China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom as part of the Trump administration&#8217;s move to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-securities-investments-finance-communist-chinese-military-companies/">bar investment in companies</a> deemed to supply and support China’s military, intelligence and security services.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/ofac/downloads/ccmc/ns-ccmc_list.pdf">current blacklist</a> names 35 companies, including the parent organizations of the three listed telecoms firms as well as Huawei and China&#8217;s major chipmaker SMIC.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The reversal was made &#8220;in light of further consultation with relevant regulatory authorities,&#8221; said the exchange. The companies will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE while the exchange continues to evaluate how the executive order applies to them and their listing status, according to the announcement.</p>
<p>The delisting of the three telecom giants, which have been trading on NYSE for about two decades, was seen by some experts as merely symbolic. The trading volumes of these firms in New York are only a small percentage of their total tradable shares, thus the impact of the potential delisting &#8220;would be rather limited on the companies’ growth and general market performance,&#8221; <a href="http://www.csrc.gov.cn/pub/csrc_en/newsfacts/release/202101/t20210103_390001.html">said</a> the China Securities Regulatory Commission in a statement issued on Sunday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The recent move by some political forces in the U.S. to continuously and groundlessly suppress foreign companies listed on the U.S. markets, even at the cost of undermining its own position in the global capital markets, has demonstrated that U.S. rules and institutions can become arbitrary, reckless and unpredictable,&#8221; the Chinese exchange authority said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope that the U.S. side could show respect for the market and reverence for the rule of law, do more things that can benefit the order of global financial markets, the legitimate rights of investors, and the stability and development of the global economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>In recent times, a number of Chinese companies trading in the U.S. have opted for secondary listings in Hong Kong. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/27/alibaba-second-listing-hong-kong/">Alibaba</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-jd-com-listing-idUKKBN23I05W">JD.com</a> and NetEase have debuted in Hong Kong and more tech companies are reportedly weighing their homecoming. Chinese tech bosses are wary of the U.S. government&#8217;s potential clampdown, but they also hope to replicate Alibaba&#8217;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/27/alibaba-second-listing-hong-kong/">success in Hong Kong</a> and see funding opportunities in China&#8217;s new<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/13/china-new-tech-board/"> Nasdaq-style board</a>, which was introduced in 2019 in part to lure its tech darlings home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Using Xiami was once synonymous with having good music taste in China. The music app, which debuted around 2008 and was <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/rumor-alibaba-acquires-social-music-site-xiami">acquired by Alibaba in 2013</a>, is discontinuing its streaming service today, Xiami said in a <a href="https://h5.xiami.com/app/xiami-frontend/xm-announcement/index/index.html">notice</a> to users.</p>
<p>Xiami, which means &#8220;small shrimp&#8221; in Chinese, was once known for its smart discovery, elegant design, social features and support for indie musicians, which helped attract a loyal following among China&#8217;s artsy, hipster types. The beginning of its decline coincided with the battle for music rights in China. A digital music behemoth was formed in 2016 when <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tencent-to-buy-majority-stake-in-china-music-corp-creating-streaming-giant-1468470851">Tencent bought a majority stake in China Music Group</a>, which brought to Tencent a reservoir of exclusive music deals. By 2017, Tencent&#8217;s music apps <a href="https://radiichina.com/how-tencents-empire-is-making-music-pay/">controlled as much as 75%</a> of China&#8217;s music streaming market.</p>
<p>Xiami, on the other hand, lost large quantities of music rights and, consequently, users, who converted to more resource-rich platforms, albeit grudgingly.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Alibaba did have a shot at online music. In 2015, the e-commerce giant <a href="https://www.alizila.com/alibaba-names-renowned-musician-gao-xiaosong-run-music-unit-2/">appointed</a> two renowned industry veterans &#8212; a songwriter and a music company executive &#8212; to steer its newly minted music group. Neither was necessarily seen as having the experience for running an internet music business. Instead of growing Xiami, they poured resources into a platform called Alibaba Planet to build artist-fan relationships. The idea didn&#8217;t take off.</p>
<p>In the meantime, newcomers like NetEase Music are holding out in their battle against Tencent&#8217;s music empire, of which dominance has endured to this day.</p>
<p>While users will lose access to the app and all their data, Xiami is not totally dead. Its copyrights-focused segment Yin Luo (音螺 or Conch Music) will continue to operate, according to the notice. But the dream of Xiami&#8217;s utopian founders, &#8220;earn music &amp; money&#8221; (hence the app&#8217;s original name &#8220;EMUMO&#8221;), a vision they laid out inside a café on a snowy day in Hangzhou, is surely gone.</p>
