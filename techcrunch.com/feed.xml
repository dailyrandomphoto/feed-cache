										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The European Parliament has voted to back a total ban on biometric mass surveillance.</p>
<p>AI-powered remote surveillance technologies such as facial recognition have huge implications for fundamental rights and freedoms like privacy but are already creeping into use in public in Europe.</p>
<p class="ep-wysiwig_paragraph">To respect &#8220;privacy and human dignity&#8221;, MEPs said that EU lawmakers should pass a permanent ban on the automated recognition of individuals in public spaces, saying citizens should only be monitored when suspected of a crime.</p>
<p class="ep-wysiwig_paragraph">The parliament has also called for a ban on the use of private facial recognition databases &#8212; such as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/clearview-ai-ruled-illegal-by-canadian-privacy-authorities/">controversial AI system created by US startup Clearview</a> (also already in use by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/swedens-data-watchdog-slaps-police-for-unlawful-use-of-clearview-ai/">some police forces in Europe</a>) &#8212; and said predictive policing based on behavioural data should also be outlawed.</p>
<p class="ep-wysiwig_paragraph">MEPs also want to ban social scoring systems which seek to rate the trustworthiness of citizens based on their behaviour or personality.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/">April</a>, the EU&#8217;s executive presented draft legislation for regulating high risk uses of artificial intelligence technology &#8212; which included a ban on social scoring and prohibition in principal on the use of remote biometric surveillance in public.</p>
<p>However civil society, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/21/ban-biometric-surveillance-in-public-to-safeguard-rights-urge-eu-bodies/">European Data Protection Board and European Data Protection Supervisor</a> and a number of<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/meps-call-for-european-ai-rules-to-ban-biometric-surveillance-in-public/">¬†MEPs quickly warned</a> that the Commission&#8217;s proposal did not go far enough.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The parliament as a whole has now made it clear it also wants stronger safeguards for fundamental rights.</p>

<p>In a resolution adopted last night &#8212; with the parliament voting 377:248 in favor of the LIBE committee&#8217;s <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-9-2021-0232_EN.pdf">report on Artificial Intelligence in criminal law</a> &#8212; parliamentarians sent a strong signal over what they will accept in the upcoming negotiations between EU institutions that will nail down the details of the Artificial Intelligence Act.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>The relevant paragraph on remote biometric surveillance calls on the Commission to:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;implement, through legislative and non-legislative means, and if necessary through infringement proceedings, a ban on any processing of biometric data, including facial images, for law enforcement purposes that leads to mass surveillance in publicly accessible spaces; calls further on the Commission to stop funding biometric research or deployment or programmes that are likely to result in indiscriminate mass surveillance in public spaces</p></blockquote>
<p>The resolution also takes aim at algorithmic bias, calling for human supervision and strong legal powers to prevent discrimination by AI &#8212; especially in a law enforcement and the border-crossing context.</p>
<p>Human operators must always make the final decisions, MEPs agreed, saying that subjects monitored by AI-powered systems must have access to remedy.</p>
<p>To ensure fundamental rights are upheld when using AI-based identification systems &#8212; which MEPs noted have been shown to misidentify minority ethnic groups, LGBTI people, seniors and women at higher rates &#8212; algorithms should be transparent, traceable and sufficiently documented, they also said.</p>
<p>They also called for public authorities to use open-source software in order to be more transparent, wherever possible.</p>
<p>MEPs also targeted a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/05/orwellian-ai-lie-detector-project-challenged-in-eu-court/">controversial EU-funded research project</a> &#8212; to create a &#8216;smart&#8217; lie-detector based on analyzing facial expressions &#8212; saying the iBorderCtrl project should be discontinued.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, rapporteur <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/197844/PETAR_VITANOV/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Petar Vitanov</a>¬†(S&amp;D, BG) said: ‚ÄúFundamental rights are unconditional. For the first time ever, we are calling for a moratorium on the deployment of facial recognition systems for law enforcement purposes, as the technology has proven to be ineffective and often leads to discriminatory results. We are clearly opposed to predictive policing based on the use of AI as well as any processing of biometric data that leads to mass surveillance. This is a huge win for all European citizens.‚Äù</p>
<p>The Commission has been contacted for comment on the vote.</p>
<p>The parliament&#8217;s resolution also calls for a ban on AI assisting judicial decisions &#8212; another highly controversial area where automation is already been applied, with the risk of automation cementing and scaling systemic biases in criminal justice systems.</p>
<p>Global human rights charity, <a href="https://www.fairtrials.org">Fair Trials</a>, welcomed the vote &#8212; calling it a &#8220;landmark result for fundamental rights and non-discrimination in the technological age&#8221;.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Favo enables under-employed entrepreneurs to create new income streams through steady sales commissions from their own local grocery network.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Favo, a Brazilian social commerce platform, closed on $26.5 million in Series A funding to continue developing its app that takes grocery orders through local social networks.</p>
<p>Tiger Global Management led the round, with existing investors GFC, Elevar Equity, Kevin Efrusy, David Velez, FJ Labs and H2O participating. The latest round gives the company about $37 million in total funding since the company was started in 2019 by Alejandro Ponce and Marina Proen√ßa.</p>
<p>Families in Brazil spend, on average, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1114851/spending-food-brazil/">$118 a month on food</a>. According to IBGE data, they <a href="https://agenciadenoticias.ibge.gov.br/en/agencia-press-room/2185-news-agency/releases-en/25609-pof-2017-2018-households-with-up-to-r-1-9-k-allocate-61-2-of-their-expenses-to-food-housing">spend up to 22% of their budget on groceries</a>. Favo enables under-employed entrepreneurs to create new income streams through steady sales commissions from their own local network. People order groceries through the Favo app, and the logistics system fills the order and arranges delivery, in bulk, to the entrepreneur the next day. The entrepreneur completes the last-mile delivery.</p>
<p>Ponce was previously the founder of another company, but felt he was not fulfilling his purpose. He was introduced to ‚Äúikigai,‚Äù the Japanese concept for finding your purpose, which he explained says to do what you love and what keeps you going. When he learned about social commerce from a friend, he traveled to China in 2019 to see it firsthand.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI came back and knew that this is what I wanted to build,‚Äù Ponce said.</p>
<p>He met Proen√ßa, who has a marketing and user experience background. They bonded over their humble beginnings and set out to build a company for families just like theirs that would bring e-commerce to all consumers across Latin America, not just for the wealthy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are creating a new class of entrepreneurs,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWe empower unemployed people, mainly moms, with technology and logistics to become owners and generate extra income for households. This could be one of the largest e-commerce platforms in LatAm because we are democratizing it.‚Äù</p>
<p>By having entrepreneurs be the contacts for the shoppers, Proen√ßa said Favo is removing the lack of trust for buying groceries online, which included the fear of not receiving their goods because they didn‚Äôt have a human to talk to.</p>
<p>It also doesn‚Äôt cost entrepreneurs any money to work with Favo.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>‚ÄúMany direct sales organizations force people to buy things, but in our case, they don‚Äôt have to do anything,‚Äù Ponce said. ‚ÄúLatin America is 20 years behind the United States, and in most cases, we are the first-time introduction a client has to e-commerce in their lives.‚Äù</p>
<p>Favo launched in Peru in 2020 and then Brazil. The co-founders plan to focus the new funding on logistics and fulfillment operations, as well as expansion in Brazil and into Mexico. Ponce expects to be in 20 cities in the following months.</p>
<p>The company is working with 160,000 buyers and seeing revenue increase 30% month over month. Buyers can choose from over 3,000 products that are delivered to them within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ponce said Favo partnered with this round of investors because they are known for helping with expansion. He added that Tiger Global has already helped put the company on the right path.</p>
<p>&#8220;Favo&#8217;s innovative social commerce business model and rapidly growing logistics platform are transformative developments for the purchase and distribution of goods in Latin America,‚Äù said Griffin Schroeder, partner at Tiger Global Management, in a written statement. ‚ÄúWe are excited to support Favo&#8217;s mission to democratize e-commerce and to partner with Alejandro and Marina as they quickly expand across new markets.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google plans to invest up to $50 million in African early and growth-stage startups, ramping up efforts to support more businesses on the continent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google made known its plans today in a virtual event where CEO Sundar Pichai announced the tech giant&#8217;s intentions to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/06/google-confirms-1b-investment-into-africa-including-subsea-cable-for-faster-internet/">commit $1 billion over the next five years</a> in tech-led initiatives in Africa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These initiatives range from improved connectivity via Google&#8217;s subsea cable Equiano to investments in small businesses and startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Up until now, Google has fulfilled its obligations in the latter through its Google for Startups Accelerator Africa program and the recently launched Black Founders Fund.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The accelerator program has supported more than 80 startups in four years providing equity-free resources. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other hand</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the Black Founders Fund, a $5 million fund, gives dilutive cash awards to black-led startups in the U.S. and Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, 50 startups have </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been selected</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, each receiving $100,000 in equity-free capital along with credits from Google Cloud, Google.org ads grants, and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> support.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213261" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213261" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2213261" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/D53E291C-8FF2-4B82-ACAC-07B55633EF10.jpeg?w=680" alt="Google" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/D53E291C-8FF2-4B82-ACAC-07B55633EF10.jpeg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/D53E291C-8FF2-4B82-ACAC-07B55633EF10.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/D53E291C-8FF2-4B82-ACAC-07B55633EF10.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/D53E291C-8FF2-4B82-ACAC-07B55633EF10.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/D53E291C-8FF2-4B82-ACAC-07B55633EF10.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/D53E291C-8FF2-4B82-ACAC-07B55633EF10.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2213261" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong></p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike both initiatives, the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">newly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced $50 million fund will see Google take equity in high-growth startups around Africa in exchange for varying check sizes.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of countries and sectors, Nithin Gajria, the managing director of Sub-Saharan Africa, Google, said the Africa Investment Fund doesn&#8217;t have any preference yet</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He adds that the fund might work in a similar fashion as the Google for Startups Accelerator program. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although Africa has a Big Four (Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and Egypt) in terms of startup and venture capital activity on the continent, the accelerator has made sure to accept applications from startups in less-funded and overlooked regions into the program.¬†</span></p>
<p>These countries include Algeria, Botswana, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Ghana, Morocco, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Tunisia, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For startups who get investments from the Africa Investment fund, Google says they will have access to its employees, network, and technologies.</span></p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">Amazon has <a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.co.uk/shopping-and-entertainment/amazon-4-star-opens-in-the-uk-marking-its-first-international-expansion" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="14" data-v9y="1">opened</a> a 4-star store in Bluewater, a mall located just southeast of central London. And it&#8217;s not just the first 4-star store outside the US, it&#8217;s also the company&#8217;s first shop in the UK that sells non-food and non-perishable items. Similar to Amazon&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-26-amazon-4-star.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="15" data-v9y="1">4-star stores in New York</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-01-amazon-4-star-store-colorado.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="16" data-v9y="1">other parts</a> of the US, the shop in Bluewater will sell products rated 4 stars and above, are top sellers or are trending on the e-commerce giant&#8217;s UK website.</p>
<p>Since the shop can&#8217;t carry all the highly rated products Amazon sells online, the selection in-store will be curated, though they will include goods across top categories like consumer electronics, toys, games, books, kitchen and home. It will sell products from small businesses across the UK, as well as the company&#8217;s own devices, including Kindle e-Readers, Fire tablets and Echo speakers.</p>
<p>The shop will have sections that correspond to specific sections of the website, as well, such as Most Wished For, which will feature products from Wish Lists. &#8220;Trending in Bluewater&#8221; will showcase items local customers have been buying, while &#8220;Most Gifted&#8221; will feature the top items ordered as gifts. Amazon says it will switch out products regularly based on customer feedback and to keep up with the latest trends.</p>
<p>Products in the store will be marked with digital tags containing the item&#8217;s price, average star rating and the number of customer reviews. In addition, customers don&#8217;t have to be Prime members to be able to shop there. That said, the store won&#8217;t feature Amazon&#8217;s Just Walk Out technology like the company&#8217;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-go-store-uk-084721065.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="17" data-v9y="1">Fresh grocery store</a> in London. Just Walk Out allows shoppers to grab what they need from the shelves and, well, walk out without having to pay at a manned or a self-checkout counter. They can make their purchase from Amazon&#8217;s UK website, however, and simply pick up their order from the store the next day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber is piloting new app features aimed at making air travel more hassle-free, including the ability to reserve rides from airports, gain access to enhanced curbside pickup, request a ride once you land and order food in advance from airport restaurants for pickup.</p>
<p>Uber Reserve at Airports will allow users at 20 major airports across the country ‚Äì including LaGuardia, JFK, Miami International, Dallas Fort Worth and Ronald Reagan International ‚Äì to book a ride up to 30 days in advance. The new feature, which includes complimentary wait time of up to one hour, is connected to airport departure and arrival KPIs so it can track flights and automatically adjust reservations if a flight is delayed or early. Uber has also upped its machine learning technology to allow for a feature that helps match riders waiting at airport curbsides with drivers more quickly.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213166" style="width: 413px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213166" loading="lazy" class="vertical wp-image-2213166 size-large" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Features.png?w=403" alt="Uber Reserve at Airports feature" width="403" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Features.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Features.png?resize=89,150 89w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Features.png?resize=178,300 178w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Features.png?resize=768,1296 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Features.png?resize=403,680 403w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Features.png?resize=910,1536 910w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Features.png?resize=1214,2048 1214w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Features.png?resize=30,50 30w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2213166" class="wp-caption-text">Uber Reserve at Airports feature</p></div></p>
<p>While it&#8217;s not exactly news that a car service is going to start accepting airport reservations, this move demonstrates how Uber is using its brand recognition to pivot away from on-demand and towards more traditional black car services. The announcement comes at a time when Uber is working to increase revenues after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/05/how-uber-plans-to-rebound-from-massive-q2-losses-stemming-from-driver-incentives/">massive losses last quarter</a>.<a href="https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput"> With air travel beginning to climb back up to 2019 levels</a>, the company has a chance to offer a more luxury, bespoke (and expensive) service to riders.</p>
<p>Airport trips are a good target for revenue growth because they&#8217;re typically longer and have higher fares, according to Uber. The company says just over the last week of September, it&#8217;s seen a 15% increase in airport trips, so the new reserve function will potentially give drivers the option of earning more money, the ability to plan their day in advance and more control knowing where a pickup starts.</p>
<p>As part of the new feature rollout, Uber is also offering a &#8216;Ready When You Are&#8217; service that falls somewhere in between on-demand ride-hailing and booking in advance, without an increase in fare. Customers can request a ride once they land with options to be picked up in 20 minutes, 10 minutes or as soon as possible. This feature is being piloted at six airports in the U.S. and Canada, but Uber says to expect a larger rollout through the start of next year.</p>
<p>Uber has had to work very closely with airports to make these app features work, says Sundeep Jain, Uber&#8217;s chief product officer.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>&#8220;Different airports and cities have different regulations and laws that we have to keep in mind,&#8221; Jain told TechCrunch. &#8220;The complexity amplifies when you get to international airports. Also the pickup zones, the walking distance between where passengers arrive and where ground transportation is available varies and the way the signage works for airports is different, so working with airports is always a challenge, but an opportunity as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, Uber is also tapping into humanity&#8217;s collective fear of being in crowds for too long with its Mobile Ordering for Pickup feature, which allows customers can skip the line by using Uber Eats for pick-up while at the airport to order from select Starbucks, Burger King, Chili&#8217;s, Wolfgang Puck and Eddie George&#8217;s Grill 27. This feature is currently piloting at Toronto Pearson Airport, and will continue to roll out to US airports in the coming months, says the company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Databricks today announced that it has acquired German startup 8080 Labs, the company behind <a href="https://bamboolib.8080labs.com/">bamboolib</a>, a popular GUI for the Python-based <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> data analysis and manipulation tool. Bamboolib allows data scientists to quickly and easily explore their data and transform it without having to write any code. 8080 Labs offered both a free community edition of bamboolib as well as a paid pro edition with additional enterprise capabilities. Databricks plans to integrate these UI-driven features into its Lakehouse Platform and to expand its own low-code/no-code capabilities.</p>
<p>This marks Databricks&#8217; first acquisition since it closed its $1.6 billion <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/databricks-raises-1-6b-at-38b-valuation-as-it-blasts-past-600m-arr/">Series H funding round in August</a>. At the time, Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi told us that he wanted to raise this round to be able to go up against its well-capitalized competitors in this space. As is so often the case with fast-growing companies in a competitive space, that often means making acquisitions to buy both the engineering talent and software capabilities to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Together with last year‚Äôs acquisition of <a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2020/06/24/welcoming-redash-to-databricks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://databricks.com/blog/2020/06/24/welcoming-redash-to-databricks.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1633544358353000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHh7LrhPEqYZCuHwJpgU8u0kTufiw">Redash</a>, we are broadening the focus of our user base to a wider audience that prefers low-code/no-code solutions. Bringing simple capabilities to <span class="il">Databricks</span> is a critical step in empowering more people within an organization to easily analyze and explore large sets of <span class="il">data</span>, regardless of expertise,&#8221; Ghodsi noted in today&#8217;s announcement.</p>
<p>For Databricks, this acquisition also marks a renewed emphasis on bringing its platform to citizen data scientists who may not have the expertise to use its tools otherwise. &#8220;As <span class="il">data</span> and AI become a strategic priority for businesses of every size, it&#8217;s critical that everyone within an organization is empowered to ask questions and take action based on <span class="il">data,&#8221; the company notes in today&#8217;s announcement. Combined with its automated machine learning tools, Databricks argues, its service will now allow a wider range of users to extract value from their data &#8212; and also make life easier for professional developers who can build their data transformations with its UI tools and then export the Python code once they need to build a more custom implementation.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We founded 8080 Labs to bring simplicity to complex <span class="il">data</span> tasks and make the power of <span class="il">data</span> science and machine learning accessible to <span class="il">data</span> teams of any skill set,&#8221; said Tobias Krabel, co-founder of 8080 Labs. &#8220;With open-source roots and an incredible vision to reshape the <span class="il">data</span> landscape with the lakehouse category, we see endless opportunities with <span class="il">Databricks</span> and could not be more excited to join the team on this journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two companies did not disclose the details of the acquisition, and 8080 Labs didn&#8217;t raise any outside funding prior to this sale.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The developing world represents the best chance of growth for large internet companies, and today one of the very biggest set out its strategy for how it plans to tackle that.</p>
<p>Google said that it would be investing $1 billion to support ‚Äúdigital transformation‚Äù across Africa. This will include landing a subsea cable into the continent to enable faster internet speeds, low-interest loans for small businesses, equity investments into African startups, skills training and more.</p>
<p>The plans were unveiled today at an <a href="https://adsonair.withgoogle.com/events/google4africa">event</a> led by Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai &#8212; putting the most senior executive at the company at the top of the event being a mark of the priority that the company is placing on the bet it‚Äôs making here.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve made huge strides together over the past decade &#8212; but there‚Äôs more work to do to make the internet accessible, affordable and useful for every African. Today I‚Äôm excited to reaffirm our commitment to the continent through an investment of $1 billion over five years to support Africa‚Äôs digital transformation, to cover a range of initiatives from improved connectivity to investment in startups,‚Äù said Pichai.</p>
<p>Google said it will inject the investment in projects to be implemented in countries across the continent including Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda and Ghana.</p>
<p>The subsea cable will cut across South Africa, Namibia, Nigeria and St Helena, connecting Africa and Europe. It will provide approximately 20 times more network capacity than the last cable built to serve Africa, managing director for Google in Africa, Nitin Gajria said.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis will lead to a 21 percent reduction in internet prices and increase internet speed in Nigeria and almost triple in South Africa,‚Äù said Gajria.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It is projected to create about 1.7 million jobs in Nigeria and South Africa by 2025 as the digital economy grows.</p>
<p>Google also announced the launch of the Africa Investment Fund, where it will invest $50 million in start-ups across the continent providing them ‚Äúwith access to Google‚Äôs employees, network, and technologies to help them build meaningful products for their communities.‚Äù</p>
<p>The company said it will additionally disburse $10 million in low-interest loans to small businesses in Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and South Africa, to alleviate hardships brought about by the Covid pandemic. This will be done in partnership with Kiva, a San-Francisco based non-profit lending organization. It pledged $40 million to non-profits improving lives in Africa.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am so inspired by the innovative African tech startup scene. In the last year we have seen more investment rounds into tech startups than ever before. I am of the firm belief that no one is better placed to solve Africa‚Äôs biggest problems than Africa‚Äôs young developers and startup founders. We look forward to deepening our partnership with, and support for, Africa&#8217;s innovators and entrepreneurs,‚Äù said Gajria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mauritius and U.K.-based investment company <a href="https://www.juven.africa/">Juven</a> went live today with plans to fund growth-stage technology and consumer companies in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one-year-old firm is looking to invest large checks in companies &#8220;that have proven business models, strong revenue traction and large addressable markets,&#8221; it said in a statement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juven is one of the few investment firms targeting growth deals on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/05/tlcom-capital-closes-71m-africa-fund-with-plans-to-back-12-startups/">TLcom</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/13/novastar-ventures-becomes-200m-african-vc-fund-after-108m-raise/">Novastar</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/31/partech-is-doubling-the-size-of-its-african-venture-fund-to-143-million/">Partech Africa</a>, that have written significant checks in tech companies in recent years</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But unlike the others, Juven is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">not a venture capital fund; the evergreen investment company is a spinoff from Goldman Sachs&#8217; Africa principal team responsible for making several high-growth investments in the tech scene since 2014.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juven founder Jules Frebault led the Africa team, the Special Situations Group. He joined Goldman Sachs in 2010 and grew out the department&#8217;s strategy from a London office to back companies that could make good returns on the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The team first made some investments across private equity and credit; the most notable bets were in telecom-led businesses and towers like the IHS Towers</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Down the line, Goldman Sachs dipped its hand into growth-stage investing in tech companies, backing Africa&#8217;s first unicorn Jumia, Zipline, and Eat&#8217;N&#8217;Go. It also led investments in Unicaf&#8217;s Series B round, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/26/south-african-fintech-startup-jumo-raises-second-50m-vc-round/">Jumo&#8217;s second Series B</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/14/nigerian-logistics-startup-kobo360-raises-30m-backed-by-goldman-sachs/">Kobo360&#8217;s Series A</a>, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/28/kenyas-twiga-foods-eyes-west-africa-after-30m-raise-led-by-goldman/">Twiga Foods&#8217; Series B round</a>.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frebault tells TechCrunch that the Juven team spun out off Goldman Sachs to &#8220;go after the growth-stage opportunity in Africa with a dedicated structure, capital, resources and mandate</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldman Sachs transferred its growth portfolio &#8212; Unicaf, Jumo, Kobo360, Twiga, and Eat&#8217;N&#8217;Go &#8212; to Juven. Some former Goldman Sachs employees also left with Frebault to build out Juven&#8217;s operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The firm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is structured</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to have a holding company and a balance sheet that holds its assets and cash. This way, when an investment </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is monetized</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the capital comes back and Juven redeploys it. Such methods allow for making </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> investments without raising multiple funds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s actually akin to a corporate </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in terms of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how it&#8217;s structured,&#8221; Frebault said. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the capital that we deploy either comes from our balance sheet or we take on follow-on investments from our shareholders.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221;¬†</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In that light, Juven has re-invested in four companies in its current portfolio this year. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it plans to add more investments before the next year runs out, Frebault says the firm might not make more than three investments per year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average ticket size will range from $10 million to $30 million, then $50 million or more in follow-on checks. The founder says that for tech companies, which is one of Juven&#8217;s primary targets, it targets Series B and later-stage growth rounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Juven makes only a handful of investments per year, the firm will provide </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">additional</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> benefits around financial, legal, operational and strategic support</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have to be flexible and start at $10 million because it can be the right size for Series B rounds on the continent,&#8221; Frebault said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t take a venture capital approach, and we don&#8217;t invest in many companies. We take concentrated positions and then continue investing in these companies over time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Juven&#8217;s focus is on entrepreneurs trying to leverage tech to solve problems around access for the masses, the company said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frebault adds that Juven may also consider non-tech companies that can</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> solve such problems</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the firm says it can invest in almost anything, businesses solving problems around food, education, healthcare, financial services, commerce and logistics will most likely get a nod before others</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We can invest in everything but we&#8217;re staying away from is extractive industries,&#8221; the founder said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s the same situation with countries as the investment firm¬†</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has a preference for businesses expanding </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">regionally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in large consumer economies like Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, South Africa, Ghana and the Ivory Coast</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the team that led Goldman Sachs&#8217; investments in Africa is now at Juven, Frebault says the 152-year-old investment giant&#8217;s Asset Management division still has a global mandate that includes Africa, albeit</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> focusing on a larger scale and institutional activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goldman Sachs declined to comment on Frebault&#8217;s move, Juven&#8217;s activity, its own broader objectives or plans for the region in the future.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://wayve.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wayve</a>, a U.K.-based self-driving startup that is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/03/wayve-claims-world-first-in-driving-a-car-autonomously-with-only-its-ai-and-a-satnav/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notable</a> for its use of deep learning and cameras rather than more-costly Lidar and other sensors to guide vehicles, is gearing up for its next stage of development with a strategic backer in its pocket. Today <a href="https://ocado.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ocado</a> &#8212; the online grocer that also powers online grocery systems for other retailers like Kroger in the U.S. &#8212; announced that it is investing ¬£10 million ($13.6 million at today&#8217;s rates) in the startup.</p>
<p>The deal will give Ocado early access to London-based Wayve&#8217;s technology, which will be used in a trial in which Wayve&#8217;s hardware and software will be fitted on to Ocado vans and trialled for a year in real-world scenarios involving traffic congestion, making awkward turns on small residential streets, and navigating complicated, non-grid street layouts.</p>
<p>Longer term, Ocado wants to use the technology across its wider global footprint: the U.K. company licenses its grocery picking, inventory, and logistics technology, which it calls the Ocado Smart Platform (OSP) to other retailers around the world.</p>
<p>The deal is a two-way street in terms of data: Wayve will also be retrofitting Ocado vehicles with its computers and cameras to gather more data about delivery driving in general: the company&#8217;s big claim is that it doesn&#8217;t rely on costly Lidar and other sensors to operate, and that this also means that it can be used in unfamiliar environments, but it still needs lots of training data for its machine learning to operate that system.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOcado Group has been driving innovation in global grocery logistics for decades. Their cutting-edge approach to grocery operations and international reach aligns strongly with Wayve‚Äôs culture and global ambitions,&#8221; said Alex Kendall, CEO of Wayve, in a statement. &#8220;I am incredibly excited to collaborate with Ocado Group and learn from their vast expertise. Globally, there is huge momentum to transform mobility in grocery operations right now. We are focused on delivering an autonomous last mile solution to support the needs of grocery retailers everywhere. Through this partnership with Ocado Group we aim to unlock autonomous delivery faster in more places worldwide.‚Äù</p>
<p>The deal is non-exclusive on both sides.</p>
<p>On Wayve&#8217;s side, it is also<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> working with at least one other big retailer in the U.K. &#8212; just last month, Asda (the UK superstore that used to be owned by Walmart but is no longer) </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/technology-and-supply-chain/asda-to-trial-driverless-delivery-vans-in-london/659999.article" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kicked off a trial with the company</a><span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">. Records at </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;" href="https://www.companysearchesmadesimple.com/company/uk/13536254/ocado-ventures-wayve-limited/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Companies House</a> show that<span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;"> Wayve has been working with Ocado for some months before now, so it seems like there was a small scramble between the two supermarket rivals to get the news out of their engagements.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Wayve has other strategic investors in the company: Virgin &#8212; the conglomerate that has stakes in a variety of businesses &#8212; in March announced an <a href="https://www.virgin.com/branson-family/richard-branson-blog/supporting-wayve-to-make-self-driving-cars-a-day-to-day-reality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investment of an undisclosed amount</a> in the startup. In total Wayve has disclosed more than $58 million in funding, with Yann LeCun, Balderton and Firstminute (Brent Hoberman&#8217;s VC) among the other investors.</p>
<p>On Ocado&#8217;s side, the company is hedging its bets with autonomous driving technology.</p>
<p>Earlier this year Ocado also invested a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/15/oxbotica-raises-13-8m-from-ocado-to-build-autonomous-vehicle-tech-for-the-online-grocers-logistics-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">similar amount of funding in Oxbotica</a>, which builds software to power these systems.</p>
<p>The two investments represent different approaches to solving the self-driving challenge.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">‚ÄúThey are othogonal solutions, like an Android and iPhone,&#8221; Alex Harvey, chief of advanced technology, Ocado Group, said in response to our questions about how the two might work together. &#8220;They don‚Äôt work together but for us they represent two different ways to solving this very complex challenge which Ocado is committed to solving for its OSP partners at the earliest possible time.‚Äù</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Given that both approaches are still some way away from full, real-world implementations, it&#8217;s important that we continue to see a variety of approaches at this stage to find the best and safest solutions (not just those that are the most cost-effective).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ocado is committed to being at the fore-front of solving one of the most complex technological challenges of our age &#8211; automating last-mile deliveries in congested, busy, unstructured urban environments. We recognize there may be many different technical ways to solve this challenge,&#8221; Harvey said. &#8220;Our investment portfolio in the self-driving space reflects this ambition, giving us an unrivalled platform upon which to accelerate the development of this capability for our OSP partners.‚Äù</p>
<p>Aside from exploring the potentials of the different technological approaches, one other significant incentive for investing in Wayve is the fact that the startup&#8217;s system would be significantly less expensive to implement than one based around Lidar and other sensors. (Wayve sells its approach as &#8220;AI software, lean hardware and fleet learning platform for AV 2.0&#8243;.)</p>
<p>Regardless which direction self-driving technology goes, this latest deal marks one more step for Ocado in building out its next generation of technology, and underscores how the company has placed autonomous systems at the heart of that strategy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOcado is on a journey to develop highly intelligent autonomous mobility systems to further transform the operational economics, and proposition, of the Ocado Smart Platform for our OSP retail partners,&#8221; said Harvey in a statement. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been impressed with Wayve‚Äôs approach to solving this most complex of challenges and are excited to accelerate our capabilities so that our retail partners globally can take advantage of them at the earliest opportunity.‚Äù</p>
<p><em>Updated with comment from Ocado re: its Oxbotica investment and autonomous technology in general.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there&#8217;s a sector that has seen the biggest uptick in the number of startups and venture capital in emerging markets since the start of last year, it has to be the digitization of mom and pop stores</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, a new activity takes us to Morocco, where YC-backed company <a href="https://chari.co/">Chari</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised a $5 million seed round at a valuation of $70million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Founded by <a href="https://ma.linkedin.com/in/sophia-alj-40333960">Sophia Alj</a> and <a href="https://ma.linkedin.com/in/belkhayat">Ismael Belkhayat</a> last year, Chari took part in the recent Y Combinator&#8217;s Summer batch that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/31/this-yc-summer-batch-features-the-largest-group-of-african-startups-yet/">concluded</a> two months ago. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.S seed-stage accelerator invested in this seed round, along with Plug and Play, Village Capital/MetLife Foundation, Orange Ventures, Airbnb executives, SPE Capital, Pincus Private Equity, The Chandaria family, Michael Lahyani and the management company of an American Ivy League university</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rocket Internet, Global Founders Capital and P1 Ventures co-led the round, which is the largest of its kind in Morocco at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chari wants to digitize informal retail stores in Morocco and provide credit to them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Belkhayat, ex-strategy consultant at Boston Consulting Group, and Alj, an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ex-strategy consultant from McKinsey, first got alerted to the shifts in Africa&#8217;s e-commerce landscape last year</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a mandatory trip from her former employer, Alj </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">was tasked</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to understand how FMCGs operated in sub-Saharan Africa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Belkhayat tagging along, the couple discovered the pain points small shops faced in the region when they had to get their products</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They never noticed such in Morocco </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">before</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that, but it became evident after going back to the North African country that local mom and pop stores needed such service</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With companies like TradeDepot, MaxAB and Sokowatch bringing shops online in other African markets, the couple launched a similar platform in Morocco</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chari operates as a mobile app allowing small retailers to order products from partnering FMCG multinationals and local manufacturers and get them in less than 24 hours</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August, Chari received fresh competition when regional player <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/05/maxab-the-egyptian-b2b-food-and-grocery-delivery-startup-raises-40m-for-expansion/">MaxAB</a>, who, after raising $55 million, moved into the country by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/25/maxab-gets-an-extra-15m-acquires-yc-backed-moroccan-startup-waystocap/">acquiring another YC-backed company, WaystoCap</a>, for an undisclosed sum</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in an identical but seemingly unrelated move, <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2021/morocco-ecommerce-startup-chari-ma-acquires-mobile-credit-book-app/">Chari </a></span><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2021/morocco-ecommerce-startup-chari-ma-acquires-mobile-credit-book-app/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">acquired</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2021/morocco-ecommerce-startup-chari-ma-acquires-mobile-credit-book-app/"> Karny.ma</a>, a Khatabook-esque application, the same month. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform provides credit and bookkeeping services to about 40,000 merchants and now serves as Chari&#8217;s strategy to provide payment facilities</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to CEO Belkhayat, the acquisition has enabled Chari to stand head to head with MaxAB in the country as it provides more merchants for the company to tap into</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He adds that the company&#8217;s &#8220;great relationship&#8221; with the suppliers also gives Chari an edge in the still-nascent industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We have exclusivity on some digital trades. For instance, P&amp;G works with Chari </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">exclusively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So in case any other player wants to sell P&amp;G products, either they have to go through Chari or they have to buy the goods from the supermarket,&#8221; he added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chari holds distribution contracts with these FMCG companies and takes a percentage (10-30%) from every sale it makes to shop owners. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The YC-backed company then employs suitable payment terms: it is not required to pay suppliers in 40 days but collects instant payments from local shops</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With an average of 15 days of stock, this system allows Chari to be cash-flow positive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The more we grow, the more we have funding. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main reason why we raised this money is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mainly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to be on the radar of investors and grow outside Morocco,&#8221; said the CEO alluding to the fact that Chari is on the cusp of achieving profitability</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike MaxAB, Chari doesn&#8217;t own assets; rather, it rents them. Asked if Chari will adopt an inventory-heavy model later, the CEO said it&#8217;s unlikely. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many warehouses available in Morocco to rent, and doing so allows the company to scale faster, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s the same process in Tunisia, its second market after Morocco. And on the logistics end, a total of 100 people work as delivery agents in both regions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Moroccan startup currently transacts about $2.5 million monthly, said Belkhayat. It has signed up 15,000 merchants and is growing 20% month-on-month, but </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> half of those use the platform regularly. When Karny is taken into account</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the total number of merchants using Chari&#8217;s products extends to over 50,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What lies ahead for Chari following this seed round is moving into Francophone Africa; Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Mauritania and Senegal top that list. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the company will use the funding to get licences to offer other financial services like remittances, bill payments, mobile top-up and buy now, pay later in Tunisia and Morocco</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A subtle and impressive bit of this announcement is that Chari chose to disclose its valuation which private African startups rarely do</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And for a startup from a North African country that isn&#8217;t Egypt to command such lofty valuation, it&#8217;s easy to see why investors are excited about its prospects regarding B2B e-commerce retail in the MENA region. Will it translate to more investments in Morocco and the Maghreb region? COO Alj hopes so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are happy to lead the way of the nascent Moroccan startup ecosystem,&#8221; said COO Alj. We hope that this seed round will be one the first of a long series of noticeable seed funding in Moroccan startups.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Andreessen Horowitz and Coinbase Ventures have minted a new unicorn in India: CoinSwitch Kuber. The two firms have co-led a $260 million investment in the Bangalore-based cryptocurrency trading startup, valuing the young firm at $1.9 billion, they said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>This is a16z‚Äôs first investment in India. TechCrunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/andreessen-horowitz-a16z-first-india-investment/">reported last month</a> &#8212; twice &#8212; that the two firms were in talks to back the Indian startup and had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/indian-crypto-exchange-coinswitch-kuber-in-talks-to-raise-funds-at-unicorn-valuation/">proposed a valuation of $1.9 billion</a>.</p>
<p>The four-year-old startup, which including Wednesday&#8217;s Series C round has raised about $300 million to date, was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/tiger-global-backs-indian-crypto-startup-coinswitch-kuber-at-over-500m-valuation/">valued at over $500 million in its Series B</a> financing in April this year.</p>
<p>Existing investors Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital India also participated in the new round, which is also the largest for a cryptocurrency startup in India. CoinSwitch is the 30th Indian startup to become a unicorn this year, and only the second in the crypto space. (B Capital-backed CoinDCX became the first Indian crypto unicorn in August.)</p>
<p><a href="https://coinswitch.co">CoinSwitch</a> is one of the handful of startups in India that allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. From the functionality and user interface standpoints, its offerings are much superior, according to dozens of users TechCrunch has spoken to in recent days.</p>
<p>The eponymous app offers users over 70 cryptocurrencies to choose from and the trading is instant, said Ashish Singhal, co-founder and chief executive of CoinSwitch Kuber, in an interview with TechCrunch. Users on the app can trade as little as 100 Indian rupees, or $1.3.</p>
<p>CoinSwitch has amassed over 10 million registered users, most of whom are young and first-time investors, he said. More than half of the startup‚Äôs user base is aged 28 or below, he said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2213032" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213032" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2213032 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/coinswitch-kuber-team.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/coinswitch-kuber-team.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/coinswitch-kuber-team.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/coinswitch-kuber-team.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/coinswitch-kuber-team.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/coinswitch-kuber-team.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/coinswitch-kuber-team.jpg?resize=1536,1025 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/coinswitch-kuber-team.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2213032" class="wp-caption-text">CoinSwitch Kuber founders, from left to right, Vimal Sagar, Govind Soni and Ashish Singhal (<strong>Image Credits:</strong> CoinSwitch Kuber)</p></div></p>
<p>The excitement around trading in cryptocurrency comes as India‚Äôs largely young population has reached the inflection point, he said. ‚ÄúYoungsters are increasingly looking at investments as an option,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>India‚Äôs Supreme Court overturning the nation‚Äôs central bank‚Äôs ban on cryptocurrency two years ago &#8212; which led to banks playing nice (somewhat) with trading app &#8212; also helped, he said. ‚ÄúWhen that happened, many youngsters who had been watching crypto trading in the western markets and had realized that they were sort of late to get into crypto, decided to explore investments,‚Äù he said.</p>
<p>But it hasn‚Äôt escaped the startup that most of its users are new to this investment world. To address this, CoinSwitch Kuber recently partnered with Indian news outlet NDTV to publish stories to explain cryptocurrencies, trading and the risks associated with them. It also hosts a podcast on this subject, he said.</p>
<h2>Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s first India investment</h2>
<p>‚ÄúWe are incredibly excited about the crypto market opportunity in India, and with its breakout growth, CoinSwitch has emerged as the leading retail platform in the country,‚Äù said David George, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, in a statement. ‚ÄúAshish and the team have demonstrated strong execution abilities and the ambition to deliver an investment platform for the masses in India.‚Äù</p>
<p>A16z‚Äôs arrival in India comes at a time when the startups in the world‚Äôs second-largest internet market are raising record amounts of capital. Several of the firm‚Äôs global peers &#8212; Tiger Global, Sequoia, Falcon Edge Capital, Lightspeed, Accel, Temasek and SoftBank &#8212; have increased their pace of investments in the country in recent quarters.</p>
<p>The firm has been exploring markets like India for years. In a talk at Stanford Graduate School of Business five years ago, a16z co-founder and general partner Marc Andreessen (pictured above) said it was &#8220;extremely tempting&#8221; to back startups in emerging markets. But it was also challenging for a venture fund to expand to more countries, he explained. Venture capital is a &#8220;very hands-on process of understanding the people you&#8217;re working with for both evaluating the company and work with the company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it continues to be a hands-on business like that then there is the problem of geographic remoteness, which is if I&#8217;m not present in another geography, do I really know those people to make the decisions. So what a bunch of firms have been trying to do is staff local teams. But then there&#8217;s the fundamental problem that if the local team is really good, then they can easily leave and run their own firms. If they are bad, they stay working for me&#8230;which has its own issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to people familiar with the matter, A16z has evaluated a handful of other startups in India in recent months.¬†The firm said it‚Äôs investing in CoinSwitch from both its crypto and growth funds.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are humbled by the trust shown in CoinSwitch Kuber by two of the biggest names in the global crypto investment arena with Andreessen Horowitz choosing us to be their first investment in India. Coinbase Ventures‚Äô investment is also testimony to the confidence they have in CoinSwitch Kuber‚Äôs business model and the tremendous potential India‚Äôs crypto space has to offer,‚Äù said Singhal.</p>
<h2>CoinSwitch Kuber&#8217;s future plans</h2>
<p>Singhal said the startup will deploy the fresh capital to add more asset classes for investment on its app. But he declined to reveal what those asset classes will be. Additionally, it&#8217;s also working to add support for institutional clients to use the app, he said. The startup, which aims to amass over 50 million users, says it&#8217;s also looking to hire for several roles at the firm, including many in leadership positions.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>
<p>One of the typical moves many of the Indian crypto trading startups have made in the past years is to expand outside of India. This is in part to offset any catastrophic regulatory changes in India. Singhal said CoinSwitch Kuber will continue to focus on users in India and has no plans to expand outside of the country.</p>
<p>In recent months, several Indian ministers have spoken negatively about the potential risks of cryptocurrencies and have suggested that they might ban cryptocurrency in the country. Singhal said the engagement he has had with lawmakers has been fruitful so far and by bringing so many high-profile and credible investors to the cryptocurrency space in India, he hopes CoinSwitch is able to make a case for its legitimacy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWill there be stringent regulation on cryptocurrency?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúThere should be because right now crypto is like the wild wild west.‚Äù</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Google today <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/sustainability-2021/">announced</a> that eco-friendly routes, a feature it first talked about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/google-promises-better-3d-maps/">earlier this year</a>, is now live for iOS and Android users in the U.S., with support in Europe launching in 2022. And while this new routing option, which gives drivers the choice between the fastest and most fuel-efficient route, is clearly the highlight of today&#8217;s release, Maps is also getting two other new features: a new &#8220;lite navigation&#8221; mode for cyclists who may want routing but don&#8217;t want turn-by-turn directions (launching in the coming months) and expanded bike and scooter share information for when you just want to jump on that <a href="https://www.donkey.bike/">Donkey Republic bike</a> for your sojourns through Berlin.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the eco-friendly routing feature, will always show you the fastest route &#8212; and now also the one that&#8217;s most fuel-efficient, if it doesn&#8217;t happen to also be the fastest,&#8221; Russell Dicker, the senior director of Transportation at <span class="il">Google</span>¬†<span class="il">Maps, told me.</span> &#8220;So with just a few taps, you can see the relative fuel savings between the different options, the ETA difference if there is one and choose the one that works best for you.&#8221; For those users who always want to see the fastest route, no matter what, Google Maps will have a setting that will also allow them to only see that.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2212978" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SWG_Speaker4_Sarah_Jayne_EcoFriendlyRoutes02_M_V03-1.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2212978" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2212978" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/SWG_Speaker4_Sarah_Jayne_EcoFriendlyRoutes02_M_V03-1.gif" alt="" width="800" height="450" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2212978" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Google</p></div></p>
<p>Google believes that this new routing option &#8220;has the potential&#8221; to allow Maps users to avoid over 1 million tons of carbon emissions per year &#8212; the same as removing 200,000 cars from the road. I tend to be a bit skeptical about numbers like that &#8212; at least until the feature has been in use for a while and we get some real-world data. I do believe, however, that a lot of users will opt for the slightly longer but more fuel-efficient route, not in the least because in Google Maps itself, the focus is on fuel efficiency, which saves users money, after all, and not carbon emissions, which still remain a bit of a nebulous concept to many.</p>
<p>By default, routing is a difficult problem, even without taking fuel efficiency into account. &#8220;You can either do things quickly, or you can do things accurately but very, very slowly,&#8221; Dicker noted. &#8220;What we&#8217;ve managed to do is build a number of techniques that allow us to get a lot of good options really, really quickly and at scale, because, of course, everything at Google is about scale.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dicker noted that the core variables that go into choosing a more fuel-efficient route are things like distance, time, elevation, speed and being able to stay at a consistent speed.</p>
<p>Lite navigation, as Google calls it, was born out of the rise in demand for biking directions in Google Maps over the past year, Dicker said. But many cyclists don&#8217;t have their phone in front of them while they ride and they don&#8217;t necessarily want turn-by-turn directions either. So the focus of the lite navigation mode is on providing information about your ETA and upcoming elevation changes, as well as seeing where you are on the map, of course.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>As for bike and scooter sharing, Google Maps now shows where you can find sharing stations in 300 cities around the world on Android and iOS, thanks to partnerships with Donkey Republic, Tier and Voi base in Europe, as well as Bird and Spin in the U.S.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Existing technologies for direct air capture technologies require a lot of heat to remove the CO2, after it&#8217;s been absorbed into filters. The process to date has been laborious and often highly energy inefficient. What‚Äôs often been missing in the process has been a more efficient way of capturing CO2 in the first place. The key to the whole thing is filters, and it is this aspect that more than one startup has been working on in the last few years.</p>
<p>Israel-based <a href="https://repair-carbon.com/">RepAir Carbon</a> has now came up with an approach drawn from the ideas behind fuel cell technology to do just that, and it‚Äôs now closed a $1.5m Seed funding round co-led by <a href="https://www.counteract.net/">Counteract</a> and <a href="https://esil.co.il/">ESIL</a>, with participation from Consensus Business Group, ImpactAssets and other investors. ESIL is a partnership of EDF Renewables, Johnson Matthey, and Bazan Group.</p>
<p>RepAir Carbon&#8217;s aim is to develop this ‚Äòcell‚Äô approach for what it describes as ‚Äúmodular Direct Air Capture‚Äù to capture or store greenhouse gases &#8220;at a gigaton scale&#8221;. The promise is much lower energy consumption and a less CapEx intensive, modular design based on electrochemistry.</p>
<p>RepAir says it uses an electrical current and a selective membrane to separate CO2 from the air, consuming ‚Äúup to 3 times less energy for each tonne of CO2 captured without the need for high temperature or significant pressure differentials.‚Äù</p>
<p>Amir Shiner, co-founder and CEO of RepAir said: ‚ÄúDirect Air Capture plays a key role in any scenario where global temperature rises less than 2¬∞C. However, today&#8217;s solutions are too expensive, energy-hungry, and resource-intensive. We‚Äôre working hard to develop a technology with a responsible energy footprint that can be deployed in many more settings. This investment will help us advance and optimize our TRL3 prototype.‚Äú</p>
<p>Alongside Shiner, the RepAir team includes co-founder and Chairman Yehuda Borenstein, CTO Ben Achrai, PhD, and Board Member Yushan Yan, PhD.</p>
<p>Andrew Shebbeare, Managing Partner at Counteract, said: ‚ÄúWe firmly believe in the part Direct Air Capture will play but are also convinced that today‚Äôs technology needs to evolve. With a promising platform and exceptional team, we are convinced RepAir is advancing the state of the art and will help pave the way for responsible and scalable DAC.‚Äù</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Eli Cymbalista, CEO of ESIL, said: ‚ÄúOur aim is to accelerate and commercialize start-ups delivering economically viable solutions that support the transition to a NetZero world. We believe RepAir fits that brief exactly and are excited to contribute the skills and resources of our partners‚Äô network to help accelerate their progress.‚Äù</p>
<p>In an interview with me, Shiner added: ‚ÄúWe will eventually have more blocks that can scale like Lego. We can scale in a modular nature. So we can place our device next to, say, a wind farm, where we get the energy to populate the device. We‚Äôre very flexible in terms of where we locate the device because we use air rather than the emitted pollution from a chimney.‚Äù</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The founders of <a href="https://www.tazahtech.com/">Tazah Technologies</a>, a B2B agriculture marketplace in Pakistan, met while serving leadership roles at Uber subsidiary <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/26/uber-is-paying-3-1bn-to-pick-up-middle-east-rival-careem/">Careem</a>. Abrar Bajwa and Mohsin Zaka bonded during long working hours as the platform dealt with COVID-19‚Äôs impact. Eventually, the two started talking about creating their own startup. When asked how they got from ride-hailing to agri-tech, Bajwa told TechCrunch that the two grew up in farming communities. ‚ÄúWe are from central Punjab and every family there has something to do with agriculture,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe had seen firsthand how farmers, or people who are involved in small holder farming, do not encounter social mobility based on how the deck is stacked against them.‚Äù</p>
<p>Agriculture is Pakistan‚Äôs biggest sector, contributing about 24% of its gross domestic product and employing half of its labor force, <a href="https://www.pbs.gov.pk/content/agriculture-statistics">according to government statistics</a>. But fragmented and complicated supply chains lead to inflated prices, food waste and low profits for farmers, all problems that Tazah wants to solve. The startup, which launched two months ago in Lahore, announced today it has raised a $2 million pre-seed round led by Global Founders Capital and Zayn Capital. Other participants included Ratio Ventures, Walled City Co, i2i Ventures, Suya Ventures, Globivest, Afropreneur Syndicate, +92 Ventures, Sunu Capital, Musha Investments and angel investors like senior executives from ride-hailing platforms Careem and Swvl, where Bajwa worked before launching Tazah.</p>
<p>There are currently about 300 small- to medium-sized sellers buying inventory through the platform and it moves multiple truckloads of produce per day. Right now it offers five main kinds of products: ginger, garlic, tomatoes, potatoes and onions. Tazah plans to expand into other vegetables and fruits, but wants to ensure that it can guarantee consistent supply and quality. For example, instead of just serving as a marketplace to connect farmer and buyers, Tazah also screens produce for quality, removing rotten produce. Then it sorts them into categories for specific types of buyers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2213191" style="width: 463px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2213191" loading="lazy" class="vertical size-large wp-image-2213191" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/5I6A5384.jpg?w=453" alt="Tazah Technologies founders Abrar Bajwa and Mohsin Zaka" width="453" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/5I6A5384.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/5I6A5384.jpg?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/5I6A5384.jpg?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/5I6A5384.jpg?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/5I6A5384.jpg?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/5I6A5384.jpg?resize=33,50 33w" sizes="(max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2213191" class="wp-caption-text">Tazah Technologies founders Abrar Bajwa and Mohsin Zaka</p></div></p>
<p>For example, potatoes are separated into ones for households, restaurants, small retailers, or to be made into French fries, based on what Bajwa and Zaka learned during market research. ‚ÄúWe have spent months in wholesale markets, we‚Äôve interviewed hundreds of retailers and we got to know that standardization of product is needed in Pakistan,‚Äù said Bajwa. ‚ÄúWe get into the bottom of operations, because retailers will know what exactly is in the sack.‚Äù This has resulted in a monthly retention rate of more than 80%, and most customers buy from the platform about four times a week.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not just a box-moving operation because in one sack of potatoes, there can be multiple rotten potatoes, so you don‚Äôt want to just buy from farmers and then give to retailers. That doesn‚Äôt add a lot of value,‚Äù said Zaka. Tazah is currently focused on small to medium-sized sellers who are overlooked by fast-moving consumer goods and grocery product inventory providers because they aren‚Äôt able to buy at sufficient bulk. It‚Äôs also started talking to other customer segments, including B2C marketplaces, grocery apps and stores.</p>
<h3>Increasing farmers&#8217; profits and reducing food waste</h3>
<p>Tazah‚Äôs founders say fragmented supply chains mean that about 30% to 40% of produce is wasted because they perish or are damaged each time they are unloaded, warehoused and reloaded onto a truck. The company wants to fix that by creating a shorter, more streamlined logistics infrastructure. It plans to keep costs down by working with third-party warehouse and trucking providers instead of owning its own facilities.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Nigerian agritech startup Releaf secures $4.2M to scale its food processing technology&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/nigerian-agritech-startup-releaf-secures-4-2m-to-scale-its-food-processing-technology/embed/#?secret=TOgbsuBoSK" data-secret="TOgbsuBoSK" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>‚ÄúThere is the traditional supply chain and we‚Äôre building a parallel customized supply chain that is a more efficient supply chain,‚Äù said Bajwa. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost like reinventing the wheel to build a supply chain that ensures products move as fast as possible from point of harvest to point of retail.‚Äù This means Tazah will make early investments as it works with its warehousing and trucking marketplaces for middle- and last-mile deliveries, establishing best practices for how to handle produce.</p>
<p>Since Tazah needs to make deliveries early in the morning, it operates small fulfillment centers in addition to warehouses to stay close to customers. Part of its new funding will be used to expand its fulfillment center network in Lahore, with the goal of being operational in the entire city by the middle of October, before expanding into new regions.</p>
<p>Over-harvesting also contributes to food waste, and one of Tazah‚Äôs goals is to build a data and analytics platform that will help farmers plan crops to make sure there is no oversupply in the markets they serve. Farmers typically sell their produce at markets, occasionally forming groups with other farmers. But they don‚Äôt have a lot of information about market places and supply/demand beyond their communities. They also often end up in debt to middlemen because they lack access to working capital.</p>
<p>While Tazah is currently focused on its supply chain work, it plans to eventually add financing options for farmers after doing research, like going through several more procurement cycles to understand what how much capital farmers need and how they are able to repay it. Some of the barriers they face include lack of formal credit histories or access to financial institutions that usually don‚Äôt open branches in rural areas. Sometimes they borrow working capital from intermediaries in the supply chain, or loan sharks who charge interest rates of more than 60%, creating cycles of indebtedness.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFinancing is something we are aggressively looking after because it‚Äôs a future play for us and we are working with farmers to know what they are doing, and how they are actually getting financing,‚Äù said Zaka.</p>
<p>Tazah‚Äôs founders hope to see more startups emerge to solve problems for Pakistan‚Äôs farmers. ‚ÄúAgriculture has been a mostly ignored sector in Pakistan from a technology perspective, and I think that as more people come into this, they‚Äôre going to help each other, as opposed to competing with each other,‚Äù said Bajwa. ‚ÄúWe feel that as more people come in, it will be better because it will accelerate the problem solving in this very difficult space.</p>
<p>He added, ‚Äúthis is such a large space in Pakistan and it‚Äôs so inefficient that if we are even able to make a small dent, it‚Äôs going to lead to social uplift for hundreds or possibly thousands of farmers, improve the availability of fresh produce, result in less food tasted and reduce food price inflation.‚Äù</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">While working as a software engineer in Japan, Singapore and San Francisco for the past 10 years, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/ryo-chikazawa">Ryo Chikazawa</a>, CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://autify.com/">Autify</a>, came to realize that there‚Äôs one common problem in the software development industry; software testing takes excessive time.</p>
<p>Chikazawa and co-founder Sam Yamashita started Autify in 2016 in San Francisco to develop software testing automation, enabling software developers to expedite the delivery of quality software to their customers in a rapidly changing marketplace.</p>
<p>Now, Autify‚Äôs software testing automation addresses the issues of a labor shortage as well as technical difficulty through its no-code platform.</p>
<p>Autify announced today it has secured a $10 million Series A round to support new product development, including <a href="https://autify.com/mobile">its launch of native app testing¬†for mobile</a> and global expansion.</p>
<p>The latest funding brings Autify‚Äôs total raised to $12.2 million, Chikazawa said. Autify, a fully remote company, has 30 employees globally.</p>
<p><a href="https://wilab.com/">World Innovation Lab</a> (WiL) led the Series A, with new investors <a href="https://uncorrelated.com/">Uncorrelated Ventures</a> and individual investor <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jonathan-siegel">Jonathan Siegel</a> also participating. Existing backers Archetype Ventures, Salesforce Ventures and Tably joined the round as well.</p>
<p>The majority of Autify&#8217;s global peers offer low-code test automation solutions, targeting these at enabling software developers with a range of coding skills to perform their work faster. But several countries, including Japan, still face a severe developer shortage issue the low-code approach cannot resolve, Masaya Kubota, partner of WiL said in an interview with TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>‚ÄúLow-code solutions may work for tech-savvy companies, but no-code is able to capture an even bigger mass market across the globe,‚Äù Kubota told TechCrunch.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="vSCYNGjMvF"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/dont-hate-on-low-code-and-no-code/">Don&#8217;t hate on low-code and no-code</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Don&#8217;t hate on low-code and no-code&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/dont-hate-on-low-code-and-no-code/embed/#?secret=vSCYNGjMvF" data-secret="vSCYNGjMvF" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>‚ÄúPreviously, software testing automation could be done only by people who could write code but Autify as a no-code solution is here to allow anyone to automate testing, which is beneficial for both developers and non-developers,‚Äù Chikazawa continued.</p>
<p>The three key features of Autify for web and mobile are cross-browser, multi-device testing in parallel; auto-repair with AI; and visual regression test. Autify&#8217;s AI detects any changes in the source code/UI and automatically corrects the test scenario at every run while its visual regression automatically detects and allows users to run tests without maintenance, based on its statement.</p>
<p>With remote work becoming a standard in many companies globally, software developers and QA teams are finding it increasingly difficult to prepare and manage mobile devices for manual testing. Autify‚Äôs no-code for mobile allows anyone to easily create, execute and automate software test scenarios without programming knowledge or automation skills, just by operating their mobile app on a web browser. It doesn‚Äôt need to prepare real mobile devices with different combinations of operating systems, screen sizes, network operators, and user scenarios, Chikazawa said.</p>
<p>Its newly launched ‚ÄúAutify for mobile‚Äù version improves the efficiency of testing mobile native applications, aiming to dramatically improve QA productivity by allowing users to manage testing for both web and mobile native applications on the same platform.</p>
<p><a href="https://autify.com/">Autify for web</a> launched in October 2019 and has a large number of B2C and B2B SaaS <a href="https://autify.com/why-autify">customers</a> including Unity, DeNA and ZOZO in Japan, the U.S., Singapore as well as Europe, according to Chikazawa.</p>
<p>The company is currently focusing on two markets, the U.S. and Japan, but plans to fuel further global expansion, Chikazawa said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Autify had that global vision right from the start, and it is backed by a well-thought-out go-to-market strategy. Instead of customizing their solution only to Japanese users which tend to be hard to scale globally, Autify decided to design their solution by global standards from day one,&#8221; Kubota told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>The software testing market is projected to increase by $60 billion by 2027, according to <a href="https://www.gminsights.com/pressrelease/software-testing-market">research by Global Market Insights.</a></p>
<p>‚ÄúWith 75% of global companies still manually performing software development tests, Autify is hoping to disrupt the $1.3 trillion global testing market by providing a no-code application for automated testing,‚Äù said Chikazawa. ‚ÄúAutify‚Äôs three-pronged approach to automation of testing &#8212; no-code, AI-powered and customer success &#8212; helps address the challenges that were plaguing the testing market for far too long, such as labor shortage, high maintenance cost and technical difficulty. The best part of all this is that Autify manages to address these issues without having to sacrifice product quality at any stage of the development.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAutify can win in the testing market because lack of developers is not a Japan-only issue. For example, <a href="https://www.daxx.com/blog/development-trends/software-developer-shortage-us#:~:text=The%20Bureau%20of%20Labor%20Statistics,the%20market%20by%20that%20time.">even in the U.S., the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that by 2026, the shortage of engineers will exceed 1.2 million</a>,‚Äù Kubota said.</p>
<p>Autify enables not just tech companies, but also companies across regions and industries that may not have enough technical staff to improve their software development, Kubota mentioned.</p>
<p>Global consumer spending in mobile apps has reached $111 billion in 2020, with an increasing 30% year on year in 2019, and the market continues to grow at a rapid pace, as per its statement citing <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/app-revenue-and-downloads-2020">Sensor Tower</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://smartryde.jp/">SmartRyde</a>, a Japanese online pre-booked airport transfers service platform, is a marketplace that connects travelers to local transportation operators/online travel agencies (OTAs).</p>
<p>Sota Kimura, co-founder and CEO of SmartRyde, founded SmartRyde in 2017 after he experienced trouble getting a taxi from the airport to the hotel when he traveled abroad, Kimura told TechCrunch.</p>
<p>SmartRyde, which currently operates its airport transfers services in 150 countries with 700 airports globally, has collaborated with approximately 650 taxi companies and more than 25 online travel agencies (OTAs) including Booking.com, Expedia, Trip.com, Indonesia‚Äôs Traveloka and Argentina‚Äôs Despegar, Kimura said.</p>
<p>Unlike similar services that already are offered by riding-hailing companies, SmartRide provides customers with a one-stop travel service, including sightseeing, in addition to booking airline tickets and hotels, Kimura said. That makes SmartRyde special and the company will continue to promote partnerships with online travel agencies, travel agencies and mobility companies, Kimura added.</p>
<p>SmartRyde announced today it has secured a $1.6 million Series A to strengthen its system integration with OTAs on the demand side, build a booking management system for transportation operators on the supply side and accelerate digital transformation in the pre-booking transportation industry. It will also use the funding for global expansion, Kimura said.</p>
<p>The latest round was led by Angel Bridge along with other investors, including SG Incubate, Yamaguchi Capital, SMBC Venture Capital, Hiroshima Venture Capital, Iyogin Capital, Inventum Ventures and Optima Ventures.</p>
<p>The company plans to expand further in major cities and tourist destinations, including Mexico, Spain, Thailand, Dominican Republic, the U.S. (Honolulu, Las Vegas, Miami) and Japan, Kimura said.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Since the pandemic outbreak in March 2020, SmartRyde has experienced a significant decrease. The number of reservations, however, has been increasing again, especially tourists from the U.S., since December 2020, as per its statement.</p>
<p>‚ÄúDue to the impact of COVID-19, there has been a change in the way people travel, such as avoiding congestion. Under such a trend, we believe that airport transfer services via OTAs, which are the starting point for travel bookings, will further expand,‚Äù Ryota Yamaguchi, manager at Yamaguchi Capital said.</p>
<p><a href="https://talixo.com/">Talixo</a>, <a href="https://www.holidaytaxis.com/en/">Holiday Taxis</a>, <a href="https://www.transferz.com/">Transferz</a>&#8216;s <a href="https://www.taxi2airport.com/en/">Taxi2Airport</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/huangbaoche">Huangbaoche</a> are its global peers, with a market size valued at about $10 billion, Kimura said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We invested in SmartRyde because we sympathize with its mission of &#8216;contributing to the sustainable development of local communities through transportation&#8217; and are attracted to its business model, which is collaborating with many global players,&#8221; said Daisuke Miyazaki, director of SG Incubate, the CVC of Saibu Gas Group.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Ride-hailing giant Uber is facing a legal challenge over its use of real-time facial recognition technology in a driver and courier identity check system that it uses in the UK.</p>
<p>The App Drivers &amp; Couriers Union (ADCU) <a href="https://www.adcu.org.uk/news-posts/adcu-initiates-legal-action-against-ubers-workplace-use-of-racially-discriminatory-facial-recognition-systems">announced the legal action</a> Tuesday, alleging that Uber&#8217;s biometric identity checks discriminate against people of color.</p>
<p>The union said¬†it&#8217;s taking the action after the unfair dismissal of a former Uber driver, Imran Javaid Raja, and a former Uber Eats courier, Pa Edrissa Manjang, following failed checks using the facial recognition technology.</p>
<p>Commenting in a statement, Yaseen Aslam, president of ADCU, said: &#8220;Last year Uber made a big claim that it was an anti-racist company and challenged all who tolerate racism to delete the app. But rather than root out racism Uber has bedded it into its systems and workers face discrimination daily as a result.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ADCU is launching a <a href="https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/challenge-ubers-facialrec/">crowdjustice campaign</a> to help fund the legal action &#8212; which it said is also being supported by the Equality &amp; Human Rights Commission and the not-for-profit Worker Info Exchange (WIE).</p>
<p>The latter was set up by former Uber driver, James Farrer &#8212; who is now general secretary of ADCU and director of the WIE &#8212; and whose name should be familiar as he successfully sued Uber over its employment classification of UK drivers, forcing the company into a U-turn <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/uber-says-it-will-treat-uk-drivers-as-workers-in-wake-of-supreme-court-ruling/">earlier this year</a> when it finally announced it would treat drivers as workers after years trying to overturn successive employment tribunal rulings.</p>
<p>Farrer&#8217;s next trick could be to bring a legal reckoning around the issue of algorithmic accountability in the so-called &#8216;gig economy&#8217;.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The action also looks timely as the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/09/uk-dials-up-the-spin-on-data-reform-claiming-simplified-rules-will-drive-responsible-data-sharing/">UK government is eyeing making changes</a> to the legal framework around data protection, which <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/519832b6-e22d-40bf-9971-1af3d3745821">could extend to removing current protections</a> that wrap certain types of AI-driven decisions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Workers are prompted to provide a real-time selfie and face dismissal if the system fails to match the selfie with a stored reference photo,&#8221; the ADCU writes in a <a href="https://www.adcu.org.uk/news-posts/adcu-initiates-legal-action-against-ubers-workplace-use-of-racially-discriminatory-facial-recognition-systems">press release</a> explaining how drivers experience Uber&#8217;s system. &#8220;In turn, private hire drivers who have been dismissed also faced automatic revocation of their private hire driver and vehicle licenses by Transport for London.&#8221;</p>
<p>The union says Uber&#8217;s real-time facial recognition checks, which incorporate Microsoft‚Äôs FACE API technology, have been in use by the ride hailing platform in the UK since March 2020.</p>
<p>Uber introduced the selfie identity checks ahead of another hearing over its licence renewal in London. That followed an earlier suspension by the city&#8217;s transport regulator, TfL, which has raised safety concerns over its operations for years &#8212; branding Uber ‚Äúnot fit and proper to hold a private hire operator licence‚Äù in a shock denial of its licence four years ago.</p>
<p>Despite losing its licence to operate in the UK capital all the way back in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/22/uber-loses-its-license-to-operate-in-london/">2017</a>, Uber has been able to operate in the city continuously as it has appealed the regulatory action.</p>
<p>It gained a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/26/uber-wins-appeal-and-gets-a-provisional-15-month-license-to-operate-in-london/">provisional 15-month licence in 2018 </a>&#8212; though not the full five year term. Later it got <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/09/24/uber-gets-temporary-two-month-license-reprieve-in-london/">a two-month licence in 2019</a>, with a laundry list of operational conditions from TfL &#8212; before once again being denied a full licence renewal in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/25/uber-has-again-been-denied-licence-renewal-in-london-over-safety-risks/">November 2019</a>.</p>
<p>Then in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/28/uber-wins-latest-london-licence-appeal/">September 2020</a> Uber was granted a licence renewal &#8212; but, again, only for 18 months. So to say Uber&#8217;s UK business has been under pressure over safety for years is putting it mildly.</p>
<p>The ADCU notes that in September 2020, when the Westminster Magistrates Court (most recently) renewed Uber‚Äôs license for London, it set a condition that the company must ‚Äúmaintain appropriate systems, processes and procedures to confirm that a driver using the app is an individual licensed by TfL and permitted by ULL to use the app‚Äù.</p>
<p>&#8220;This condition facilitated the introduction of harmful facial recognition systems,&#8221; the ADCU argues.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/19/uber-under-pressure-over-facial-recognition-checks-for-drivers/">Earlier this year¬†</a>the ADCU and the WIE called for Microsoft to suspend Uber&#8217;s use of its <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/">B2B facial recognition technology</a> &#8212; after finding multiple cases where drivers were mis-identified and went on to have their licence to operate revoked by TfL.</p>
<p>Now the union says its lawyers will argue that facial recognition systems, including those operated by Uber, are &#8220;inherently faulty and generate particularly poor accuracy results when used with people of color&#8221;.</p>
<p>Under the terms of Uber&#8217;s licence to operate in London the company reports failed driver identity checks to TfL &#8212; which can then revoke a driver&#8217;s licence, meaning he or she is unable to work as a private hire vehicle driver in the city.</p>
<p>The ride hailing giant also appears to use the same real-time facial verification identity check technology for both Uber drivers and Uber Eats couriers &#8212; even though the latter are delivering food, not ferrying passengers around. And in one letter seen by TechCrunch, in which TfL writes to an Uber driver to inform him that it is revoking his private hire licence, the regulator makes reference to information provided by Uber regarding the driver&#8217;s dismissal as an Uber Eats courier on account of a failed ID check carried out by Uber&#8217;s sister company.</p>
<p>That failed ID check as a food delivery courier then appears to be being used as grounds by TfL to justify revoking the same person&#8217;s private hire vehicle licence &#8212; on &#8220;public safety&#8221; grounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is recognized that the failed checks did not occur on a private hire operator&#8217;s booking platform or while undertaking any bookings. It is also the case that there does not appear to have been any evidence to suggest that this type of behavior has taken place on the booking platform of a licenced private hire vehicle operator. However, the information that has been provided indicates that you have been seen to fail identification checks that have been conducted,&#8221; writes TfL with some particularly tortuous logic.</p>
<p>&#8220;This type of activity being identified on any platform does suggest a propensity to behave in the manner that has been alleged,&#8221; it goes on, before adding: &#8220;When that is then considered in terms of a private hire driver, it does then have the potential to put the travelling public at risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>The letter concludes by informing the Uber driver that their licence is being revoked and providing deals of how they can appeal the decision.</p>
<p>Farrer told us that &#8220;several&#8221; of the Uber drivers the union is representing had their licences revoked by TfL after being dismissed by Uber for failing ID checks on Uber Eats which Uber then reported to TfL &#8212; which he called &#8220;disturbing&#8221;.</p>
<p>Commenting on the lawsuit in a statement, he added: &#8220;To secure renewal of their license in London, Uber introduced a flawed facial recognition technology which they knew would generate unacceptable failure rates when used against a workforce mainly composed of people of colour. Uber then doubled down on the problem by not implementing appropriate safeguards to ensure appropriate human review of algorithmic decision making.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ADCU&#8217;s legal representative, Paul Jennings, a partner at Bates Wells, described the cases as &#8220;enormously important&#8221; &#8212; and with AI &#8220;rapidly becoming prevalent in all aspects of employment&#8221; he suggested the challenge would establish &#8220;important principles&#8221;.</p>
<p>Reached for comment on the legal action, an Uber spokesperson claimed that the selfie ID check it uses features &#8220;robust human review&#8221; &#8212; telling us in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúOur Real-Time ID Check is designed to protect the safety and security of everyone who uses the Uber app by helping ensure the correct driver is behind the wheel. The system includes robust human review to make sure that this algorithm is not making decisions about someone&#8217;s livelihood in a vacuum, without oversight.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The company prefers to refer to the technology it uses for these real-time ID checks as &#8216;facial verification&#8217; (rather than facial recognition), while its claim of &#8220;robust&#8221; human review implies that no Uber or Uber Eats account is deactivated <em>solely</em> as a result of AI.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s important because under UK and EU law, individuals have a right not to be subject to solely automated decisions that have legal or similar effect on them. And algorithmic denial of employment would very likely meet that bar &#8212; hence Uber&#8217;s urging that its algorithmic identity checks do involve a human in the loop.</p>
<p>However the question of what constitutes &#8216;meaningful&#8217; human review in this context is key &#8212; and something that courts will have to wrestle with at some point.</p>
<p>Asked what steps Uber has taken to assess the accuracy of its facial verification technology, Uber would not provide a public comment. But we understand that an internal Fairness Research team has carried out an assessment to see whether the Real-Time ID Check system performs differently based on skin color.</p>
<p>However we have not seen this internal research so we are unable to confirm its quality. Nor can we verify an associated claim that an &#8220;initial assessment&#8221; did not reveal &#8220;meaningful differences&#8221;.</p>
<p>Additionally, we understand Uber is working with Microsoft on ongoing fairness testing of the facial verification system &#8212; with the aim of improving general performance and accuracy.</p>
<p>Farrer told TechCrunch that the union has won at least 10 appeals in the Magistrates court against driver dismissals by TfL that cite Uber&#8217;s real-time ID checks. &#8220;With Imran, Uber and TfL have already admitted they got it wrong. But he was out of work for three months. No apology. No compensation,&#8221; he also said.</p>
<p>In other cases, Farrer said appeals have focused on whether the driver in question was &#8216;fit and proper&#8217;, which is the test TfL applies. For these, he said the union made subject access requests to Uber ahead of each hearing &#8212; asking for the driver&#8217;s real-time ID data and an explanation for the failed check. But Uber never provided the requested data.</p>
<p>&#8220;In many of the cases we got our costs,&#8221; Farrer also told us, adding: &#8220;This is unusual because public bodies have protection to do their job.&#8221; He went on to suggest that the judges had taken a dim view on hearing that Uber had not given the ADCU the requested data, and that TfL also either didn&#8217;t get the data from Uber &#8212; or too belatedly asked for data.</p>
<p>&#8220;At one Crown Court hearing the judge actually adjourned and asked for TfL&#8217;s Counsel to phone TfL and ask why Uber had not given them the data and if they ever expected to get it,&#8221; he added. &#8220;As you can see we eventually did get pictures for Pa and they are displayed in the <a href="https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/challenge-ubers-facialrec/">Crowdjustice page</a> &#8212; but we still cannot tell which of these pictures failed [Uber&#8217;s real-time ID check].&#8221;</p>
<p>TechCrunch asked Uber for a copy of its Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for the Real-Time ID Check system &#8212; which should have considered the technology&#8217;s risks to individuals&#8217; rights &#8212; but the company did not respond to our question. (We have asked to see a copy of this before &#8212; and have never been sent one.)</p>
<p>We have also asked TfL for a copy of the DPIA. Farrer told us that the regulator refused to release the document despite the ADCU making a Freedom of Information request for it.</p>
<p>At the time of writing TfL was not available for comment.</p>
<p>Asked for his view on why the regulator is so keen on the facial recognition checks, Farrer suggested that by getting Uber to carry out this sort of &#8220;self enforcement&#8221; it sets a defacto regulatory standard without TfL having to define an actual standard &#8212; which would require it to carry out proper due diligence on key details such as equality impact assessment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Israeli shared multimodal mobility operator GoTo Global Mobility has acquired German shared electric scooter company emmy. The strategic deal will help GoTo Global, which offers customers access to shared cars, vans, mopeds, scooters and bikes, reach its goal of expanding to every major European city by 2025. GoTo Global would not share the financial terms of the deal.</p>
<p>Acquiring emmy, which has a fleet of over 3,000 shared electric step-through scooters (not kick scooters) across Berlin, Hamburg and Munich, gives GoTo a direct path to the German market. The company&#8217;s current footprint includes Spain, Malta and Israel.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Germany for us is a huge opportunity because emmy is a great company with five years under its belt, but they have only mopeds, and you cannot create user loyalty without creating mobility confidence, and this is what we try to do,&#8221; said Gil Laser, CEO of GoTo Global. &#8220;We try to give you with our app the same feeling that you have a solution to move, anytime, anywhere. We can take [emmy&#8217;s] user base of more than 300,000 people, and using GoTo technology, convert this company from a mono-vertical to a multimodal, and immediately start to offer them cars and other micromobility options, short trips and long trips.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of the acquisition, GoTo also takes on emmy&#8217;s debts. In April, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/wunder-mobilitys-new-lending-business-helps-micromobility-startups-finance-fleets/">shared mobility software company Wunder Mobility launched a lending service</a> and announced plans to help emmy finance 1,500 retrofitted Yadea scooters, which will now be GoTo&#8217;s responsibility to pay back. Laser said GoTo intends to maintain the relationship with Wunder in the future.</p>
<p>Emmy users won&#8217;t immediately notice a difference in branding until next year, when GoTo intends to fully integrate the service under its own brand umbrella and connect users to other forms of mobility. Laser said GoTo will bring other forms of mobility, like cars and e-bikes, to Germany starting Q1 of next year. The company also recently raised rounds totaling $22.5 million and is currently raising more to help it expand into Italy, Netherlands and Portugal in the next year, according to Laser.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to be the Netflix of mobility,&#8221; Laser told TechCrunch. &#8220;In the end users will pay us X amount of dollars and you get free rides on whichever vehicle you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>Until such a point, the company has to establish a presence and brand loyalty. Laser says multimodality that includes car rentals is the company&#8217;s secret sauce for success, part of a strategy that has led GoTo to be profitable and cashflow positive in its most mature market of Israel. The company hopes the strategy will also translate to an annual revenue that exceeds $116 million by the end of 2023.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s a balancing act between the cost of user acquisition and how much money you can generate from a user, says Laser. Shared micromobility companies have a low cost of acquisition because they just put their assets all over the streets, people see them, download the app and then they&#8217;re a customer. The problem is that the revenue per each user (RPU) is usually low, in large part because there&#8217;s no difference in service between companies, and therefore no loyalty, according to Laser.</p>
<p>Car rental companies have a different problem. They have a higher RPU because you can charge $20 to $30 per ride, but the marketing costs to acquire a user is really high.</p>
<p>&#8220;How we solve this problem is the multimodality philosophy,&#8221; said Laser. &#8220;We convert the user to use more and more services. Like you came to the supermarket to buy veggies but then you also end up buying meat and milk.&#8221;</p>
<p>One way the company does this is through a variety of promotion-type schemes. For example, Laser says GoTo charges ‚Ç¨3 for the first 15 minutes of any ride on any vehicle. If a new user comes on to book a ride on a scooter and adds ‚Ç¨3 to their wallet, they might automatically see ‚Ç¨9 in the wallet that can be used toward the purchase of a car ride. This alerts the user to other use cases and, hopefully, creates brand loyalty in a way that&#8217;s cheaper than spending hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising with Google and Facebook, says Laser.</p>
<p>The result so far has been 90% of B2C revenue comes from return users, and 41% of all customers are multimodal users. Part of this might also be due to the fact that GoTo also charges a membership, which can range from around $2 to $7, to use its service.</p>
<p>In order to achieve healthy unit economics, the company also combines owning and leasing assets.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the end our product is more efficient,&#8221; said Laser. &#8220;By not owning the assets, we enjoy the arbitrage from taking a car or moped and renting it for two years and renting it back to our users for two minutes, and by doing that we can gain a lot of profit.&#8221;</p>
<p>GoTo has MoUs with Renault, Toyota, Nio and Segway. It currently leases its cars and mopeds and owns its own smaller micromobility vehicles, but hopes to lease those, too, in the future. However, one of the main problems micromobility operators have faced has been the way shared assets depreciate very quickly, so it&#8217;s hard to imagine a scooter manufacturer wanting to own the asset and not generate rental revenue from it.</p>
<p>One way to make that scheme work would be to have really high utilization rates, which requires different types of demand that peaks at different hours. Aside from its main customer base of commuters, GoTo is actively targeting business customers through three different models. The first and second is to get companies to offer employees benefits in the form of either subscriptions or mobility wallets. The third is for companies to reserve dedicated fleets for their employees, usually between specific work hours like from 8am to 6pm. After 6pm, the fleets would go back to being available for communities, says Laser. Business customers currently make up 13% of GoTo&#8217;s revenue, but the goal is to boost that up to 50% by 2025.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We are today on course to register 100% year on year growth in 2021 and we know that GoTo‚Äôs multimodal mobility experience means we can hit right at the heart of the urban mobility problem,&#8221; said Laser. &#8220;Today we assume to be at least 30-36 months ahead of other platforms and offerings in the market.&#8221;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch‚Äôs biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for October 5, 2021. We warned you that a bunch of tech startups were going to go public in Q4. That‚Äôs coming true. But we also have video game news, crypto news and all sorts of goodies below. Let‚Äôs do it! ‚Äì <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/telegram-says-it-added-70m-users-while-facebook-and-whatsapp-were-down/"><strong>Facebook down, Telegram up:</strong></a><strong>¬†</strong>During Facebook‚Äôs pretty embarrassing outage yesterday, rival messaging service Telegram said that it picked up some 70 million new users. Recall that <em>all</em> Facebook services were down, which meant that WhatsApp also went kaput for a while there. In other Facebook news, a whistleblower from the company‚Äôs former employee ranks <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-testifies-before-the-senate/">testified today in front of the U.S. Senate</a>.</li>
<li><strong>IPO SZN: </strong>Get your boots on, everyone, we have some S-1 exploring to do. Yes, today TechCrunch dug <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/udemy-files-to-go-public-on-back-of-growing-b2b-incomes/">into IPO filings from Udemy</a></strong> (an edtech unicorn) <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/what-rent-the-runways-ipo-filing-says-about-the-business-of-loaner-garments/">and Rent the Runway</a></strong> (a DTC fashion rental unicorn). Udemy should help set the tone for edtech debuts ahead of Byju‚Äôs own, while Rent the Runway will represent the direct-to-consumer market to a lesser degree.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/sora-is-the-final-super-smash-bros-ultimate-fighter/"><strong>The final fighter in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is:</strong></a><strong>¬†</strong>Sora? Apparently? If you haven‚Äôt played the Kingdom Hearts franchise this will mean nothing to you. But according to TechCrunch analytics this was one hell of a big deal. So, here you go, by popular demand!</li>
</ul>
<p><em>And from the TechCrunch Experts crew, ‚Äú</em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/who-are-the-best-software-development-consultants-for-startups/"><em>we‚Äôre looking to profile great software development shops that work with startups</em></a><em>.‚Äù So if that is you, hit the link!</em></p>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<p>Kicking off our startup coverage today, two accelerator classes for your perusal. TechCrunch wrote up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/here-are-the-23-companies-pitching-at-alchemist-accelerators-demo-day-xxviii-today/">the 23 companies that are part of the latest Alchemist batch</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/meet-the-12-companies-launching-out-of-the-entrepreneurs-roundtable-accelerator/">the 14 companies that are launching from the Entrepreneurs Roundtable group</a>. We love an accelerator class here at the blog, mostly because they often provide an interesting perspective on where founders are finding company-worthy problems to solve.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/the-uae-aims-to-launch-a-probe-to-the-asteroid-belt-between-mars-and-jupiter-in-2028/"><strong>Launch outdated forms of government into space:</strong></a><strong>¬†</strong>That‚Äôs my takeaway from news that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) wants to launch a probe to the asteroid belt. I am in favor of any and all space launches, except perhaps those from countries with official religions and, well, monarchs.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/appsmith-raises-8m-to-take-on-the-internal-corporate-app-market-with-open-source-code/"><strong>Appsmith raises $8M for its OSS-focused internal app service:</strong></a><strong>¬†</strong>The market for building software that helps companies create internal apps is big &#8212; and competitive. And a newer player made waves this morning by announcing that it has raised fresh capital for its open source approach. Appsmith has yet to commercialize its project, but with fresh funds and notable pickup from the open source community, it‚Äôs a company to watch.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/podcastle-raises-7m-for-its-all-in-one-platform-for-podcast-production-and-publishing/">Podcastle raises $7M for all-in podcast service:</a> </strong>While it is very easy to create a <em>bad</em> podcast, it‚Äôs actually rather complicated and difficult to create a <em>good</em> podcast. Happily for all the folks out there who have yet to kick off their own episodic audiocast, Podcastle just raised lots of new capital for its all-in-one (‚Äúrecording, production and publishing,‚Äù per TechCrunch) podcasting service. So, now you have no excuse to have poor audio and lackluster editing.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/contrary-capitals-20m-fund-ii-is-all-about-community-first-investments/"><strong>Contrary Capital raises $20M for second fund:</strong></a><strong>¬†</strong>Our own Natasha Mascarenhas wrote about a new venture capital fund today, the second from Contrary Capital. She writes that founder Eric Tarczynski ‚Äúnoticed there was an absence of venture capital firms focused on entrepreneurs within universities.‚Äù So, Tarczynski went fishing in that particular pond. It must have gone pretty well, as Contrary is now back with a second installment of LP cash to invest.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/duality-nabs-30m-for-its-privacy-focused-data-collaboration-tools-built-using-homomorphic-encryption/">Duality raises $30M to help companies share data securely:</a> </strong>Cybersecurity isn‚Äôt just a big deal these days because VCs are investing in the space. It‚Äôs a big deal because the digital world is still full of holes, and attack vectors are more myriad than stars in the sky. Duality ‚Äî the startup, <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/UjUIKd-qQRM?t=42">not the excellent song</a></strong> ‚Äî wants to use homomorphic encryption to build tools that ‚Äúmake it easier for companies to share data and collaborate with each other without compromising sensitive information,‚Äù we reported.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Finding product-market fit, from the earliest stages through growth</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s no magic moment when a startup reaches product-market fit: no flashing lights, no siren, no balloons falling from the ceiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially for first-time founders, assessing product-market fit at a stage where it‚Äôs mostly anticipation can be as much art as science,&#8221; writes News Editor Darrell Etherington, who interviewed three VCs about the topic for TechCrunch Disrupt:</p>

<li>Heather Hartnett, Human Ventures</li>
<li>David Thacker, Greylock</li>
<li>Victoria Treyger, Felicis</li>

<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/co-streaming-rolls-out-to-all-creators-on-facebook-gaming/"><strong>Facebook rolls out co-streaming to all creators:</strong></a><strong>¬†</strong>While Facebook is largely in the news for, ahem, other reasons, the company is still building stuff. Including getting the groundwork in place to allow more streamers to cast in pairs.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/review-the-surface-pro-8-with-windows-11-is-fast-and-fresh/"><strong>TechCrunch likes the new Surface hardware:</strong></a><strong>¬†</strong>Story time! Back during my first stint at TechCrunch, I flew to Redmond to get an early look at some Surface hardware. I brought along a TechCrunch camera to snap some pics. And, in my infinite genius, took a million photos <em>of which I swear only two or three were not entirely blurry</em>. I nearly blacked out from panic when I got home and found out. The good news today is that my colleague Matthew Burns can actually take pictures. The better news is that he took many pictures of the new Surface Pro 8. And best news of all? He liked it, so there‚Äôs new competition out there for your computing needs.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/apple-launches-new-coding-guide-for-elementary-school-students/"><strong>Apple wants to teach kids to code:</strong></a><strong>¬†</strong>1-800-kode-for-kids is what I would have titled this piece. Aisha Malik has actually good sense, so she went with something a bit more sober. Regardless, Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄúEveryone Can Code Early Learners‚Äù program means that even tots can get a jump on learning how to forget where they put semicolons.</li>
<li><em>In other news, please welcome Aisha to the TechCrunch crew by <a href="https://twitter.com/AiishaMalik1">following her on Twitter</a>!</em></li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/robinhood-finally-brings-on-demand-phone-support-to-all-of-its-users/"><strong>And, to close us out, Robinhood has finally launched 24/7 phone support:</strong></a><strong>¬†</strong>Which is big news for the stocks-and-crypto trading company that captured the attention of both retail traders and regulators during its short, high-flying life.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://byteboard.dev/">Byteboard</a>, a service designed to replace the pre-onsite technical interview part of a company&#8217;s hiring process with a web-based alternative, will be spinning out of Google, TechCrunch learned and Google confirmed. The product was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/googles-area-120-launches-byteboard-to-improve-technical-interviews/">originally incubated</a> as part of the company&#8217;s internal R&amp;D lab known as Area 120, where it&#8217;s been led by CEO Sargun Kaur. With this move, Byteboard will be the first Area 120 project to exit Google and become its own standalone company. But Google notes this will be an exception, not the rule.</p>
<p>Google told us that the spinout will have no impact on any existing Area 120 teams or the group&#8217;s future strategy. Instead, its R&amp;D division will continue to focus on funding projects that are most likely to advance Google&#8217;s own opportunities, the company said.</p>
<p>In addition to the spinout, Byteboard has taken on new investment from Cowboy Ventures and others, in the $10 million-$15 million range. But we understand this is not a &#8220;buyout,&#8221; as Google will retain equity in the new company, which will continue to be led by co-founders Kaur and Nikke Hardson-Hurley.</p>
<p>&#8220;We‚Äôre thrilled to see the strides Byteboard has made over the past three years incubating within Google‚Äôs Area 120,&#8221; a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;Byteboard‚Äôs solution is equipping high-growth businesses with the tools they need to assess and hire top technical talent, with greater efficiency and fairness. We look forward to continuing our work with Sargun, Nikke and the rest of the Byteboard team,&#8221; they said.</p>
<p>Launched in 2019, Byteboard&#8217;s idea was to create a tool that would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/17/googles-area-120-launches-byteboard-to-improve-technical-interviews/">make the technical interview experience</a> less tedious and more effective. The team noted at the time that the current process for interviewing software engineers didn&#8217;t really work for measuring how well someone would do in a day-to-day engineering job. Instead, interviews often benefitted those who had the time and resources to prepare, as they would test more for memorization rather than the practical application of people&#8217;s skills.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_1856555" style="width: 5126px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1856555" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1856555 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/byteboard_interview_technical_spec_exercise.png" alt="byteboard interview technical spec exercise" width="5116" height="2864" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/byteboard_interview_technical_spec_exercise.png 5116w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/byteboard_interview_technical_spec_exercise.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/byteboard_interview_technical_spec_exercise.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/byteboard_interview_technical_spec_exercise.png?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/byteboard_interview_technical_spec_exercise.png?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/byteboard_interview_technical_spec_exercise.png?resize=1536,860 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/byteboard_interview_technical_spec_exercise.png?resize=2048,1146 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/byteboard_interview_technical_spec_exercise.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 5116px) 100vw, 5116px" /><p id="caption-attachment-1856555" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Byteboard</p></div></p>
<p>Byteboard flips this around by presenting job candidates with a real-world coding environment where they can select from supported languages like Java, Python, Ruby, C++, C#, JavaScript (node.js), Go and PHP.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The web-based interview is conducted in HTML, CSS and JavaScript while the mobile interview is offering in Swift (iOS) and Kotlin (Android), and the <span style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">data engineering interview is offered in Python and Java.</span></p>
<p>Its end-to-end service includes the interview platform, a bank of calibrated questions across 20+ essential software engineering skills and an assessment after the fact. A group of experienced engineers review and rate the interviews. And this evaluation is handled anonymously, with the aim of taking the bias out of the process.</p>
<p>The business took off following its 2019 debut. After a brief slump during the early days of COVID lockdowns, Byteboard picked up again in Q3 2020 as companies returned to hiring. According to <a href="https://byteboard.dev/case-studies">Byteboard&#8217;s website</a>, those using its service have included Lyft, Hulu, Figma, Imperfect Foods, PlayVS, Betterment, Robinhood, GoodRx, ETHOS, Ezoic and Glowforge.</p>
<p>In addition to the benefits of running the interview process through the web, instead of in-person (another concern in the COVID era), the quality of the data and assessment, and the less stressful environment for the candidates, Byteboard could also save companies money as they would no longer have to pay engineers to staff the interviews and measure the results.</p>
<p>However, the potential for Byteboard may have been limited as a Google-owned product.</p>
<p>Because engineers are a part of the human evaluation process with Byteboard, that would have made Google a part of the hiring group for other companies &#8212; including, in some cases, companies it directly competed with. That obviously raises ethical issues, as companies generally wouldn&#8217;t let competitors involve themselves in their hiring process. This is largely why Byteboard is moving forward as its own business, instead of a Google-owned project.</p>
<p>Of the half-dozen total team members at Byteboard, a few are joining the standalone company and a couple are choosing to stay at Google where they&#8217;ll move on to new projects, a source close to the matter told TechCrunch. Google didn&#8217;t confirm the details of this aspect of the deal, but noted Byteboard will continue to expand on its core product and operational focus, with more to share over the next few months.</p>
