										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">A year ago I accidentally turned my house into a smart home. What started out as an easy (and lazy, let&#8217;s be honest) way to switch off the radio in the kitchen without getting up from the couch quickly became an obsession to remotely control and automate as much of my house as possible.</p>
<p>What makes a smart home? In my house the lights, outlets and window blinds can be controlled from my phone, at home or anywhere in the world, but you can extend it to other things, like air conditioners, sprinklers and garage door openers. Or thermostats, speakers, security cameras and just about anything electrical. And by adding smart home tech that can detect temperature, humidity or motion, you can automate your house to turn the light up at sunset, set the sprinklers on when the weather is dry, turn on the air conditioning when it&#8217;s warm or alert you if the doors open when you&#8217;re not at home.</p>
<p>The novelty of switching your living room lights off and off from your phone might quickly wear off, but it can be reassuring knowing that you can get a sense of what&#8217;s going on at home even when you&#8217;re not there — or automatically adjust the climate and lighting when you are.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2234206" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>You&#8217;re probably thinking, <em>is this guy serious? Why would I want even more of my home connected to the internet? </em>The Internet of Things (IoT) doesn&#8217;t have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/02/smart-home-hub-flaws-unlock-doors/">the best reputation</a> historically with security, but modern smart home devices can be certified to the far higher standards set by the Big Tech giants like Apple, Amazon and Google. That said, no technology is ever perfectly secure, though efforts to create a common secure smart home standard is paying off with Matter, a protocol endorsed by some of the biggest tech companies and smart home device makers.</p>
<p>It helps to join a smart home ecosystem that you&#8217;re comfortable with. I use a Mac and an iPhone, so <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/19/anybody-can-now-make-homekit-accessories/">Apple&#8217;s HomeKit</a> makes the most sense for me. Apple does not collect a ton of data like other smart home ecosystems and is probably a better fit for the privacy minded. For this guide we&#8217;ll focus on HomeKit but much will broadly apply if you use another ecosystem. For Android users, Google Home would make more sense, or Amazon Alexa if you&#8217;re so inclined. Many modern devices are compatible with other smart home platforms anyway, including newer standards like Thread. But for best results, pick an ecosystem and make sure the add-ons you&#8217;re buying are compatible.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re after convenience or routine — or like in my case you just want to tinker — there&#8217;s a lot you can do with what you already have but a lot more you can do without breaking the bank.</p>

<h2>First, you need (or may already have) a HomeKit hub</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2234227" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2234227" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2234227 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homepod.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="729" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homepod.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homepod.jpg?resize=150,107 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homepod.jpg?resize=300,214 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homepod.jpg?resize=768,547 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homepod.jpg?resize=680,484 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homepod.jpg?resize=50,36 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2234227" class="wp-caption-text">A HomePod mini or Apple TV will work as a hub. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Brian Heater/TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>HomeKit devices rely on a hub to communicate with. It&#8217;s through this hub that your other smart home devices connect to the internet, letting you access your devices from your phone in the outside world. Good news if you have an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/20/the-new-apple-tv-4k-comes-with-a-new-siri-remote/">Apple TV</a> or a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/12/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-will-focus-on-mini/">HomePod</a> (or <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/12/apple-homepod-mini-review-remarkably-big-sound/">HomePod mini</a>) since these will serve as your HomeKit hub out of the box and generally don&#8217;t require any configuration. If you have more than one of these devices in your home, they can all serve as failover hubs if one becomes unavailable.</p>
<p>Some tech, like Philips Hue or Samsung SmartThings, will require their own separate hub (sometimes called a bridge) before they will appear in your smart home. Hubs often connect directly into the router, so keep available ports and wireless range in mind.</p>

<h2>Control your regular devices with smart plugs</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2236125" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236125" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2236125 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wemo-smart-plug.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="687" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wemo-smart-plug.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wemo-smart-plug.jpg?resize=150,101 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wemo-smart-plug.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wemo-smart-plug.jpg?resize=768,516 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wemo-smart-plug.jpg?resize=680,457 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/wemo-smart-plug.jpg?resize=50,34 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236125" class="wp-caption-text">Smart plugs can be used to control regular devices with physical power switches. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Smart plugs are a great way of connecting conventional electrical and appliances to your smart home. A smart plug fits between your regular appliance plug and the wall outlet and can be told to switch on and off at your command. It&#8217;s worth noting that smart plugs only work with devices and appliances with a physical power switch that stays in place and won&#8217;t work with devices with an auto-shutoff switch, like a kettle. (You probably shouldn&#8217;t rely on a smart plug for anything mission critical, like medical equipment or big household appliances.)</p>
<p>WeMo Wi-Fi Smart Plugs by Belkin have a small form factor compared to other, bulkier smart plugs and work reliably. There&#8217;s also a physical button on the side, in case you want or need to toggle it by hand. Eve Energy plugs are a little more expensive and also come with power management features in the Eve app but no physical button for backup.</p>

<h2>Smart bulbs will light your home the way you want it</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2236126" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236126" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2236126 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homekit-smart-bulbs.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="813" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homekit-smart-bulbs.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homekit-smart-bulbs.jpg?resize=150,119 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homekit-smart-bulbs.jpg?resize=300,238 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homekit-smart-bulbs.jpg?resize=768,610 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homekit-smart-bulbs.jpg?resize=680,540 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/homekit-smart-bulbs.jpg?resize=50,40 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236126" class="wp-caption-text">You may be better off finding smart bulbs that fit your existing fixtures, rather than the most recommended brand. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Just like regular bulbs, smart bulbs come in all shapes, sizes and colors so you&#8217;re likely going to need to find a brand that suits your lights and fixtures. You may also need to mix and match brands as you expand your smart home. Most bulbs are dimmable and some offer granular temperature controls to get the warmth of the room right. <a href="https://us-shop.nanoleaf.me/products/nanoleaf-essentials-lightstrips">Nanoleaf</a> also offers bulbs that connect to HomeKit over Wi-Fi. Philips Hue is a popular favorite but requires a separate hub to talk to your <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/02/apple-debuts-a-new-home-app-website-to-show-how-its-devices-work-in-a-smart-home/">Home app</a>. LIFX also has a <a href="https://www.lifx.com">broad range of bulbs</a> and an accompanying app offering a few more features. Furniture giant IKEA has a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/23/ikeas-smart-light-bulbs-will-work-with-amazon-alexa-apple-siri-and-google-assistant/">diverse range of smart bulbs</a>. A common criticism of smart bulbs is that they often aren&#8217;t as bright as regular filament or LED bulbs, so keep that in mind if your home is particularly prone to low light.</p>

<li><strong>LIFX Mini White | Price:</strong> $10 from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0865TRD5L/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tcgiftguide21-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B0865TRD5L&amp;linkId=c6afc8fd82e817daa16cbdd989c9fb2a">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lifx-a19-650-lumens-wi-fi-smart-led-bulbs-work-with-homekit-alexa-hey-google-and-more-2-pack-white/6424995.p">Best Buy</a></li>

<h2>Set the mood with smart strip lighting</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2236127" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2236127" loading="lazy" class="breakout wp-image-2236127 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/home-strip-lighting.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="685" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/home-strip-lighting.jpg 1500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/home-strip-lighting.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/home-strip-lighting.jpg?resize=300,201 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/home-strip-lighting.jpg?resize=768,514 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/home-strip-lighting.jpg?resize=680,455 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/home-strip-lighting.jpg?resize=50,33 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2236127" class="wp-caption-text">Strip lighting can be themed, colorful and animated. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Zack Whittaker/TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>Adding color light strips to your smart home can really brighten up a space. Smart light strips are like regular strip lighting for under cabinets and shelves, but they can be controlled from your phone. These adhesive-backed strips contain dozens or hundreds of LEDs that let you customize their color and brightness, and often also their patterns and animations to bring reactive light to your rooms. You&#8217;ll need to keep in mind that most will require a power source, more often than not a wall outlet if not USB — many modern television sets should have one spare. We like the Nanoleaf Essentials Lightstrip Starter Kit to start with, or LIFX&#8217;s Lightstrip also does a great job; there&#8217;s one in my living room.</p>

<h2>You can retrofit some of your older tech</h2>

<p>One of the best things about smart homes is how much you can do with your existing fittings. There are a handful of window blinds and shades made by well-known brands like <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/fyrtur-blackout-roller-blind-wireless-battery-operated-gray-30417460/">IKEA</a> (with a separate hub) or baked-in like Lutron&#8217;s <a href="https://www.serenashades.com/applehomekit/">Serena</a> that are natively compatible with HomeKit. Or if you have existing blinds, there are options to let you retrofit your existing window blinds with a HomeKit-enabled controller.</p>
<p>My house has vertical blinds with a tilt handle you have to rotate to close the blinds and so we rely on <a href="https://www.somasmarthome.com/">Soma</a>, an Estonia-based smart home device maker, which makes a number of blind controllers that fit into existing chains or tilt mechanisms. You hook them up to your blinds, remove the peel from the adhesive on the device, stick the box to the wall and you&#8217;re done — no skills required. These controllers run on battery or can be powered through the stick-on solar panel or plugged into an outlet. These controllers connect to HomeKit through a separate Raspberry Pi-like hub, the <a href="https://www.somasmarthome.com/products/soma-connect-blinds-control-for-amazon-alexa-apple-homekit-google-home">Soma Connect</a>. While my experience with Soma has been flawless, others at TechCrunch report having troubles with it — consider our reviews here &#8220;mixed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blinds are just one area that can be retrofitted to work with HomeKit. Other tech exists to connect garage doors, ceiling fans and even <a href="https://www.evehome.com/en-us/eve-thermo">radiators</a> to your smart home, too.</p>

<p>Now you have your lights and blinds hooked up to your Home app, you can start to add sensors to the mix. Sensors can let you automate your home by detecting light, movement, temperature, or if a window or door opens, and then turning on fans when it gets warm or setting the lights only when someone is home at sunset before it gets dark. Some might want to use these for security. They can be useful for power saving by shutting off lights when no motion is detected and adjusting the temperature when the weather changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ONVIS-Hygrometer-Thermometer-Temperature-Bluetooth/dp/B07KY6747N">Onvis Motion</a> is a great, cheap, entry-level motion detector that also packs in a thermostat and hygrometer, so you can instantly get the temperature and humidity of the room that it&#8217;s in. Weather stations are more expensive but pack in a lot more features. <a href="https://www.evehome.com/en-us/eve-door-window">Eve Door &amp; Window</a> are small stick-on battery-powered sensors that can trigger an alert or any other connected HomeKit device when a door or window is opened. And, if you&#8217;re after a privacy-friendly camera, Logitech&#8217;s Circle View <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/cameras/circle-view-security-camera.961-000489.html">works exclusively</a> on HomeKit&#8217;s end-to-end encrypted video and doesn&#8217;t rely on a third-party cloud, if that&#8217;s a deal breaker for the privacy-minded.</p>

<p>One of the benefits to picking one ecosystem and sticking with it: For the most part, the most important features of each device will be aggregated into one app. With HomeKit, that&#8217;s the Home app.</p>
<p>Your Home app consolidates your HomeKit-enabled smart home tech in one place and lets you connect your sensors to automate the rest of your home. With window sensors you can turn on all of your lights as soon as you open the door, and you can set your strip lighting to light up a hallway when a sensor detects motion between sunset and sunrise.</p>
<p>The Home app also packs in some automation features, like switching on fans or opening blinds at certain times of the day when you know it&#8217;s going to be bright outside or at a time you know you&#8217;ll want privacy. Most devices also come with a corresponding app, often with a lot more settings, features and the ability to update the device&#8217;s firmware.</p>
<p>And that is your starter HomeKit smart home!</p>
<h2>Some things to think about:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wi-Fi network range is critical to a functioning smart home. HomeKit works on the 2.4 GHz wireless connection because it has a longer range than 5 GHz. There&#8217;s a good chance your router allows you to use both, but make sure you&#8217;re on the right network when setting up your HomeKit devices. Network coverage might be fine in a one-bedroom apartment, but larger homes may require Wi-Fi range extenders or a mesh network.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you have a router that&#8217;s set up for self-organizing networking, which lets you move seamlessly between the different Wi-Fi bands, you might want to switch that setting off since it can interfere with your smart home. Some routers may have a dedicated Wi-Fi network for IoT devices built in.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes things will break and it&#8217;s not always clear why. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a moment of poor connectivity, sometimes in the more frustrating cases you might need to reset your devices. Each device comes with its own scannable QR code for getting set up. Keep these codes safe since you&#8217;ll need them if you ever have to reset a device and especially helpful when you can&#8217;t easily access or scan your HomeKit devices.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You can customize your Home screen and room backgrounds. <a href="https://homepaper.app/">HomePaper</a> is a simple app that does exactly that, and it&#8217;s designed to gradually fade the background so it&#8217;s not intrusive or make the device panels difficult to read. Home wallpapers don&#8217;t sync across your Apple devices, so you have to manually add wallpapers to each Home app.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Voyager Space Holdings is continuing its trend of snapping up space companies by moving to acquire a majority stake in <a href="https://www.spacemicro.com/">Space Micro</a>, a manufacturer of orbital communications and digital subsystems for satellites.</p>
<p>This is Voyager’s sixth acquisition since its founding in October 2019, as the company seeks to become a full-service space firm offering everything from robotics to launch support to communications tech.</p>
<p>Previous acquisitions include X.O. Markets, the parent of commercial space service venture <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/10/voyager-space-holdings-sets-it-sights-on-space-stations-with-majority-stake-in-nanoracks/">Nanoracks</a>; Pioneer Astronautics, a company that conducts research into supporting human life in outer space; robotics startup Altius Space Machines; and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/19/voyager-space-holdings-to-acquire-multi-launch-site-startup-the-launch-company/">The Launch Company</a>, a launch support company.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238132" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The acquisition strategy has turned Voyager Space into something of a powerhouse; despite being scarcely two years old, the company has already set its sights on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/voyager-nanoracks-and-lockheeds-starlab-is-the-latest-sign-that-the-low-earth-orbit-economy-is-coming/">launching a commercial space station in 2027</a>. The plans, which were announced as part of a joint project with Nanoracks and Lockheed Martin, position Voyager to oversee financing and capital allocation for the project.</p>
<p>Whether Space Micro’s tech will be used on that station isn’t clear, but the investment will no doubt provide support for the subsystems manufacturer to scale operations and its product output.</p>
<p>“Today marks a huge step in our growth trajectory,” Space Micro co-founder and chair David Strobel said in a statement. “The satellite constellation market stands at the tipping point of explosive expansion and now, with the Voyager team and operational functions by our side, we will be prepared to scale our technologies to meet these market needs.”</p>
<p>Space Micro has built out a large portfolio of customers since its founding in 2002, including NASA, the U.S. Space Force, the U.S. Air Force and the German Space Agency. The company currently has over 100 subsystems in orbit and has collectively racked up 2.7 million hour of spaceflight time.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company has provided tech for NASA’s Lunar Atmosphere Dust and Environment Explorer mission and it’s Transiting Explanet Survey Satellite. Space Micro also works with commercial companies, and was selected by Masten Space Systems earlier this year to provide transponders for the company’s XL-1 lunar lander.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Less than three months after announcing a $16 million seed round led by Founders Fund and Paradigm, NFT music rights startup <a href="https://royal.io/">Royal</a> has raised another major bout of funding, banking a $55 million Series A from Andreessen Horowitz&#8217;s crypto investment arm.</p>
<p>The startup partners with musicians and allows users to buy NFTs which represent collective ownership in works from those artists. The effort is helmed by Justin Blau, an EDM artist who performs under the name 3LAU, and JD Ross, a co-founder of home-buying startup Opendoor. Royal represents a very early, but promising foray into NFT functionality outside the spheres of visual art and gaming.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Last month, Blau gave away hundreds of NFTs through the platform which held 50% of the streaming rights to his latest song. The startup says that there have already been nearly $600,000 worth of secondary sales for those tokens, giving the new single an implied $6 million valuation. Crypto-friendly musicians like Blau have already banked millions from crypto holders looking to diversify their holding through NFTs while also backing projects that expand the market opportunity of the blockchain.</p>
<p>Boundary-pushing projects like Royal still have a delicate line to walk when it comes to advertising opportunities to grow alongside artists while staying compliant with securities laws.</p>
<p>This investment is notably being helmed by a16z Crypto co-lead Katie Haun who sits on the boards of Coinbase and NFT marketplace OpenSea. The firm already has a deep relationship with Royal&#8217;s executive team, having previously backed Ross&#8217;s last company Opendoor. Naithan Jones, a former Andreessen Horowitz partner who led the team&#8217;s Talent X Opportunity Fund, also joined Royal in September as the firm&#8217;s Head of Growth.</p>
<p>Joining the round alongside a16z Crypto are a number of musical artists including The Chainsmokers, Nas, Logic and Kygo. CAA and NEA’s Connect Ventures, Crush Music, Coinbase Ventures, Founders Fund and Paradigm also participated in the round.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://gruppe.schwarz/en">Schwarz Group</a>, an EU-based retail company, announced today that it has acquired Israeli security startup <a href="https://xmcyber.com/">XM Cyber</a> for $700 million. It may seem like a strange partnership, as Schwarz is best known as the owners of the Lidl and Kaufland supermarkets, but the company believes that extending into security will ultimately help benefit its retail business.</p>
<p>XM helps customers simulate what an attack could look like to expose flaws and openings in a company&#8217;s security posture with the goal of shutting down vulnerabilities before an actually cyber attack happens.</p>
<p>Christian Müller, chief information officer at Schwarz Group says that adding a security piece to the portfolio is essential, especially as more shopping moves online. &#8220;Finding and closing security gaps from an attacker’s perspective is a disruptive approach to the way organizations can proactively protect their networks. XM Cyber&#8217;s solution builds on our strong IT security to further protect our customers, partners and ourselves as a company,&#8221; Müller said in a statement.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238042" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Meanwhile XM Cyber CEO and co-founder Noam Erez sees the advantages of being part of a large corporation, even if it lacks a technology focus. &#8220;For XM Cyber customers, this means that with the financial backing of Schwarz, we will be able to accelerate product innovation, scale and extend our global reach. For Schwarz customers, with their continued investment in their digital product range, the ability to secure suppliers, consumers and businesses is a key enabler in delivering on the promise of digital transformation,&#8221; Erez said.</p>
<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, Schwarz intends to let XM continue to operate as an independent entity under the terms of the deal and all 110 employees will keep their jobs, meaning that existing customers should likely see little change in how things operate.</p>
<p>Perhaps they will get the advantage of XM being part of the larger company as Erez says, so long as the parent company doesn&#8217;t make any significant changes behind the scenes, but some customers may also be put off by the company being owned by a non-tech entity. Time will tell on that front.</p>
<p>XM Cyber was founded in 2016 and raised $49 million, according to Crunchbase data. The most recent deal was $17 million Series B in July led by Macquarie Capital.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

The cloud-focused startup&#8217;s investment was led by <a href="https://animo.vc/">Animo Ventures</a>, with participating checks from <a href="https://uncorrelated.com/">Uncorrelated Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.bcapgroup.com/">B Capital Group </a>and <a href="https://www.moxxie.vc/">Moxxie Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>AutoCloud is the commercial side of the <a href="https://www.cloudgraph.dev/">CloudGraph</a> open source project. The hybrid open source (OSS) and commercial combination is an increasingly popular startup method of attacking markets. Hashicorp <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/05/hashicorps-ipo-filing-reveals-a-growing-business-but-at-a-slower-pace/">recently went public</a> partially on the strength of its OSS core. This morning, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/22/jina-ai-raises-30m-for-its-for-its-neural-search-platform/">Jina.ai announced</a> a $30 million raise for its commercial and open source approach to neural search, for a more early-stage example.</p>
<p>CloudGraph is an OSS tool that ingests usage data from multiple cloud providers &#8212; think AWS, Azure, etc. &#8212; standardizes it, and makes it queryable using GraphQL (a technology that is itself seeing more use and positive opinion, per the <a href="https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/technologies/">State of Javascript 2020 report</a>).</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238041" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>AutoCloud sits atop CloudGraph, offering automated data ingestions, security compliance and cloud resource visualization. The company&#8217;s co-founder and CEO, <a href="https://twitter.com/tysonkunovsky">Tyson Kunovsky,</a> told TechCrunch that his company&#8217;s goal is akin to what Hashicorp and others have done, taking a piece of work that the large cloud platforms are doing poorly and improving the experience.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2238069" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2238069" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2238069 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AutoCloud_founders-1.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="221" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AutoCloud_founders-1.jpg 3586w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AutoCloud_founders-1.jpg?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AutoCloud_founders-1.jpg?resize=300,221 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AutoCloud_founders-1.jpg?resize=768,567 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AutoCloud_founders-1.jpg?resize=680,502 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AutoCloud_founders-1.jpg?resize=1536,1133 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AutoCloud_founders-1.jpg?resize=2048,1511 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AutoCloud_founders-1.jpg?resize=50,37 50w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2238069" class="wp-caption-text">The AutoCloud founding team. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> AutoCloud</p></div></p>
<p>As with all OSS projects that may succeed, its goal is to offer something useful to the market as open code and build a commercial business atop what&#8217;s generally available. In the case of AutoCloud, that&#8217;s a SaaS model that will feature pricing tiers based on the number of assets tracked.</p>
<p>The startup is early, so we don&#8217;t have traditional traction metrics to cite &#8212; revenue growth, net dollar retention, that sort of thing. Kunovsky told TechCrunch that his firm has been largely focused on CloudGraph itself, but that hundreds of users of the OSS service found AutoCloud via the project&#8217;s readme and have signed up for its waitlist.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>AutoCloud intends to turn on its paid product before the end of 2021, which is mere weeks away. So, the next time that we talk to the company, we can harangue it about revenue growth and related metrics.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Chicago-based AutoCloud is a standard startup of the day in that it has a team in multiple locations, including Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>Kunovsky has big aspirations for the company. AutoCloud, he explained, wants to take things from the cloud command line and term them into a graphical user interface, or GUI. That&#8217;s no small task.</p>
<p>Given that AutoCloud has a multi-cloud approach to the market, it doesn&#8217;t seem <em>too</em> likely that Amazon or Microsoft or the Google cloud team will attack its market directly. But perhaps another cloud infra provider might noodle into its space in time. At that point, how strong the CloudGraph project has become on its own will be a key deciding point in whether AutoCloud can or cannot compete with more incumbent tech companies.</p>
<p>Regardless, add the AutoCloud round to your OSS scorecard. More when it inevitably raises again in the next quarter or two.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Led by sales of cheddar and mozzarella, the U.S. cheese market alone was valued at $34.3 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/us-cheese-market">$45.5 billion</a> by 2027, growing at a compound annual growth rate of of 5.25%, according to Allied Research.</p>
<p>By comparison, the vegan cheese industry is tiny, measuring around $1.2 billion in size in 2019 and projected to reach <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/vegan-cheese-market-A07197">$4.4 billion</a> by 2027, per Allied&#8217;s findings.</p>
<p>That massive gap hasn&#8217;t stopped a syndicate of investors from plowing $25 million in seed funding into <a href="https://www.newculturefood.com/">New Culture</a>, a company that sells is selling &#8220;cow cheese, without the cow.&#8221; On the contrary, its investors think the three-year-old, Bay Area-based startup can grow the market meaningfully through an animal-free mozzarella that, according to investor Steve Jurvetson, tastes, smells and stretches like milk cheese, unlike most vegan cheese, which he describes as &#8220;quite disgusting to date.&#8221;</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237873" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The missing ingredient, says Jurvetson, has been the casein protein of milk, which, until now, could only be had from milk. Meanwhile, New Culture says through a precision fermentation process, it is producing large amounts of casein protein. As an <a href="https://vegnews.com/2021/6/vegan-dairy-identical-cheese">earlier report</a> in VegNews better describes it, New Culture, using giant fermentation tanks, is inserting DNA sequences into microbes that effectively instruct them to express the target proteins (alpha caseins, kappa caseins, and beta caseins) after feeding on a sugar solution.</p>
<p>The company then collects the casein &#8212; which it blends with water, plant-based fats, vitamins and minerals &#8212;  to make mozzarella.</p>
<p>The end product is healthier, says Jurvetson, noting that it&#8217;s both cholesterol and lactose-free. It&#8217;s also far better for the environment. Indeed, it requires an estimated <a href="https://www.watereducation.org/post/food-facts-how-much-water-does-it-take-produce">56 gallons of water</a> to produce just one ounce of dairy-based cheese. (New Culture will also require far less land use, obviously.)</p>
<p>Note that you won&#8217;t find New Culture&#8217;s mozzarella in your neighborhood grocery store &#8212; not yet anyway. The plan is to first distribute its cheese through pizzerias around the country beginning next year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Eventually, says New Cultures cofounder and CEO, Matt Gibson &#8212; a New Zealander who studied genetics and microbiology and who previously founded and sold an education review site &#8212; the company could well make yogurts, ice cream, and even milk, though he stressed that, for the foreseeable future, the focus is very much on mozzarella.</p>
<p>New Culture&#8217;s round was led by Ahren Innovation Capital and CPT Capital. Other new investors include ADM Ventures, Be8 Ventures, S2G Ventures, Marinya Capital, and Future Ventures, run by Jurvetson and partner Maryanna Saenko.</p>
<p>Earlier backers also participating in the financing, including SOSV, Bee Partners, Mayfield, Bluestein Ventures, and Evolv Ventures, which is the corporate venture arm of Kraft Heinz.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Amid a spectacle staged during the Golden State Warriors versus Toronto Raptors game on November 21, Riot Games&#8217; new esports president John Needham sent League of Legends T-shirts parachuting down onto a packed stadium of sports fans while a cinematic trailer announced the return of one of the world’s largest esports tournaments to North America.</p>
<p>It was the culmination of a day when dozens of the global press were gathered to tour the state-of-the-art Chase Center in San Francisco, the venue where the 2022 League of Legends World Championship finals will be held next November.</p>
<p>“We haven’t been in North America with major international events since 2016 and haven’t been able to come back the past few years due to travel restrictions around COVID,” Needham told TechCrunch. “We’re just very excited to be doing live events again and want fans to know that they can expect a thrilling production the likes of the Super Bowl halftime show.”</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238015" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>It’s been more than a decade since Riot held its first World Championships in 2011, known as Worlds. The multiplayer online battle game boasts more than 180 million monthly active players and 10 franchise League of Legends teams, each with NBA ownership ties. NBA all stars like <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2787665-stephen-curry-invests-in-esports-organization-tsm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steph Curry</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/25080676/michael-jordan-invests-team-liquid-parent-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson</a> are team investors, along with others from the Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Lakers, Houston Rockets, Cleveland Cavaliers, Milwaukee Bucks, Memphis Grizzlies, New York Knicks, Philadelphia 76ers, Washington Wizards and Charlotte Hornets.</p>
<p>With 73.8 million fans watching the Worlds finals in 2021, up from 46 million in 2020, according to Needham, League of Legends esports tournaments have become big business, drawing in major brands like Louis Vuitton, AXE by Unilever, Spotify, Bose, Mercedes-Benz, Red Bull, Coca-Cola and Fenty by Rihanna.</p>
<p>“We partner with brands to bring value to our fans and have found that when we do there is a joint brand lifting that often occurs. Brands get access to our valuable, hard to reach Gen Z demographic while we gain credibility being partnered with them,” said Needham. “When Louis Vuitton created its first <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/league-of-legends/true-damage-skins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">digital fashion line</a> for us, it added to our fans’ game experience<em>. </em>These types of skins are so popular that they are the foundation of our business model and generate, by far, the most revenue for us.”</p>
<p>Riot’s massive fan base has also proven to be an asset in the company’s pursuit to become a global entertainment powerhouse.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>On November 6, the trailer for Riot’s first Netflix series, Arcane, was played during the Worlds finals as nearly 74 million fans tuned in. It also did a promotion for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/league-of-legends-jinx-fortnite-skin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arcane in Fortnite</a>, a game with more than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249497/fortnite-350-million-registered-players-hours-played-april" target="_blank" rel="noopener">350 million registered players</a>, partially owned by Riot’s parent company, Tencent. Within days, Arcane shot to the top of Netflix charts, <a href="https://top10.netflix.com/tv/2021-11-14.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hitting the No. 2 spot</a> for the week of November 8, with more than 34 million viewers.</p>
<p>Having a bigger presence in Europe and Asia than in North America, Needham sees the 2022 Worlds tour as a way to create renewed interest in the game.</p>
<p>“We’ve had over 600 million players around the world who have enjoyed the League of Legends universe since inception. For those who have churned and are not currently playing the game, we hope to reactivate them as we canvas across North America, from Mexico City for the play-ins, to New York City for the quarter finals, to Toronto for the semifinals, to San Francisco for the finals.”</p>
<p>[gallery ids="2238019,2238020,2238021,2238022,2238023"]</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>Despite Riot’s interest in venturing onto new platforms, Needham says there are no plans to jump into the metaverse.</p>
<p>“We have a lot of partners who want to do NFTs with us that we’re analyzing right now, but there isn’t an NFT or blockchain strategy for us to talk about yet. Collectibles just haven’t been a big part of esports, not like traditional sports,” he said. “I want to see the NFT market mature a bit more before we dive in from an esports perspective.”</p>
<p>He added that Riot has no plans to partner with Netflix Gaming or Roblox, either.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The kids aren&#8217;t alright. According to the founders of <a href="https://www.wavelife.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wave</a>, 75% of Gen Z is struggling with their emotional well-being. To be clear &#8212; not all of them are meeting the criteria for diagnosable mental health illnesses, but they do need a bit more than a firm handshake and a &#8220;keep going, son.&#8221; That&#8217;s the market Wave is primarily going after with its digital platform, which is taking an inclusivity-first approach to making tools and techniques available to young adults.</p>
<p>The app is launching to a public test audience early next year, and with a broader launch to a wider group of consumers later in the year. The company&#8217;s founder is Dr. Sarah Adler, a Stanford Professor of Psychiatry and Clinical Psychologist. She is eager to tell the world about what the app will do, but is playing her cards a little guardedly until the app becomes available to the wider public. Adler has spent her career building innovative delivery models to increase access to care through user-centered design. She believes that data-informed, digital solutions paired with well-trained, lower-cost human capital, like health coaches, is the best way to deliver quality care at scale, especially for overlooked populations (think <a href="https://lgbta.wikia.org/wiki/GSRD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GSRM</a> and BIPOC) traditionally left out of the conversation.</p>
<p>I asked Dr. Adler to give an example of the type of exercises the app would be able to provide.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2236279" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;One of the things that we fundamentally believe is and this comes from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), which is an evidence-based treatment for anxiety and depression. We believe that a lot of the poor decisions that we make in life, or the decisions that don&#8217;t make us feel really good, we do because of a lack of clarity about what&#8217;s important to us. A values clarification exercise is an exercise that you might do with your therapist if you have one, and you can afford to pay $250 an hour to do that. What we&#8217;ve done is we designed one that is much more engaging. It&#8217;s a video game-like experience where you&#8217;re going through a values clarification exercise, and at the end of it, we&#8217;ve evoked the emotion that we want to evoke neurochemically in your brain, the same way that you would do if you were sitting with me in a therapy session,&#8221; explains Dr. Adler. &#8220;When you have clarity on your values, you can start to piece together how to make decisions. What are the actions that I want to take, that are aligned with my greater values? Do I want to go out and binge drink with my friends tonight? By knowing my longer-term goals and values, I can reconcile my behaviors. That helps me make decisions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company just announced it closed a $2 million pre-seed round late this summer. The round was led by <a href="https://www.hannahgrey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hannah Grey VC</a>, with participation from <a href="https://www.k50ventures.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K50 Ventures</a>, <a href="https://tribecap.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tribe Capital</a>, <a href="https://www.av.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alumni Venture Group</a>, <a href="https://verissimo.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Verissimo Ventures</a>, <a href="https://conscience.vc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conscience VC</a> and select strategic angels.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a ton of funding pouring into mental health, over $2.5 billion in 2020 alone, to build and scale products that aren’t backed in science, not deeply mired in inclusive user experience, and not showing repeatable outcomes,&#8221; says Dr. Adler. &#8220;At Wave we aren’t just interested in the business metrics: the downloads, sign-ups and pilots, we are building for tangible results, with measurable outcomes for people who traditionally can’t get care.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not fighting social media. We&#8217;re trying to integrate it with it. We believe that in order to address and engage these users, we need to meet them where they are &#8212; especially true for a generation that&#8217;s entirely tied to their phones. We call it our digital ecosystem and it integrates all of the best evidence-based content with immersive experiences that borrow from the best video game technology. I don&#8217;t mean token economies; what I mean is what the video game industry has learned about how to keep people engaged with things they have to learn,&#8221; explains Dr. Adler. &#8220;We create these immersive experiences and deliver them in a way that keeps people coming back to use it. Ultimately, that helps them get better.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">General Motors has taken a 25% stake in Seattle-based electric boating company <a href="https://www.purewatercraft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pure Watercraft</a>. GM&#8217;s move reflects a broadening interest in all things EV, including boats and other vehicles, and comes as part of the automaker’s commitment to invest $35 billion in electric and autonomous technology through 2025.</p>
<p>Pure Watercraft makes all-electric outboard motor systems, which it calls Pure Outboard, that can be used as a drop-in replacement for boats that would use a 25 to 50 horsepower gas-powered motor. The company has also partnered with major boat manufacturers to sell complete electric boats, including a pontoon barge, fishing boat and two rigid inflatable boats.</p>
<p>Pure Watercraft says its electric systems require zero maintenance compared to gas engines, in addition to eliminating fossil fuel pollution. The range is also likely to suit a pretty wide range of consumer use cases &#8212; the company notes on its website that Pure Outboard could support a nearly four-hour, 20-mile fishing trip with 15% charge to spare.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237997" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The company raised <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/22/pure-watercraft-ramps-up-its-electric-outboard-motors-with-a-23m-series-a/">a $23 million Series A</a> led by L37 last September to spin up production, nine years after the company was founded by CEO Andy Rebele. With this latest investment from GM, the two companies will co-develop and commercialize battery technology, “integrating GM technology into a variety of applications,” the automaker said in a statement.</p>
<p>This is just the latest signal that electric technologies are starting to move far beyond road vehicles or even aircraft, to transportation and mobility formats that have continued to be dominated by conventional gas propulsion. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/will-smith-kevin-durant-and-sean-diddy-combs-invest-in-electric-boat-startup-arc/">Ten-month-old electric watercraft startup Arc</a> has raised $7 million in total funding, including bringing on several new investors last month. Seattle startup <a href="https://www.zinboats.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zin Boats</a> is also developing an electric speedboat.</p>
<p>It’s also a noteworthy move for GM, which is already exploring ways to use its technology in other mobility industries, like rail and aerospace. Earlier this year, the company partnered with Wabtec to develop electric freight locomotives using hydrogen fuel and batteries. GM also announced a partnership with Liebherr-Aerospace to jointly develop a hydrogen fuel cell demonstration system for aircraft.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Analogue, the retro gaming hardware company behind the excellent Nt Mini, Super Nt, Mega Sg and more, has announced a shipping date for its much-anticipated <a href="https://www.analogue.co/pocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Analogue Pocket handheld</a>: December 13. The portable console, which has support for Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance cartridges out of the box, has been delayed due to COVID and supply constraints, but the company says all preorders will now ship out on December 13, with anticipated delivery dates between December 14 and December 30.</p>
<p>The Analogue Pocket looks to be a fantastic retro gaming experience, with a 3.5&#8243; LCD display that operates at a resolution of 1600&#215;1440, for a total display density of 615 PPI. In addition to supporting the range of Game Boy titles, it also works with adapters to support Game Gear, Neo Geo Pocket Color and Atari Lynx cartridges, too. On top of its gaming chops, the console has a built-in digital audio workstation called Nanoloop that acts as both synthesizer and sequencer for music creation.</p>
<p>Analogue&#8217;s major technical achievement, besides the hardware design, is the creation of FPGA chips that allow it to run natively the game cartridges it supports, just as they were originally intended &#8212; crucially not in emulation mode. This means it&#8217;s a reference quality gaming experience for purists, with screen modes to support replication of the original hardware experience for hardcore gamers.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2238016" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>On top of everything else, the $199.99 Analogue Pocket also supports accessories like the Analogue Dock, which provides 1080p output to a connected TV, as well as support for connecting up to 4 8BitDo controllers for local multiplayer via wired or wireless connections. The console itself also offers up to 10 hours of gameplay via its internal battery, and USB-C charging.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><!-- Output copied to clipboard! --></p>
<p>As teammates at buy now, pay later fintech Affirm, <a href="https://twitter.com/hellastellah" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stella Han</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/rlostrevino?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carlos Treviño</a> bonded over their shared background of growing up in real estate families. The mission of &#8220;pay at your own pace&#8221; at Affirm clashed with their firsthand experience of the taxing time commitment and high costs that comes with owning real estate; a contrast that eventually seeded the idea for Fractional.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fractional.app/">Fractional</a>, a San Francisco-based startup, wants to make real estate ownership more accessible. The platform, which participated in Y Combinator’s Winter 2021 batch, helps people co-own investment properties with friends and strangers. It takes out some of the logistical challenges of finding property, and also removes financial barriers by allowing people to put smaller checks into a collective that will then invest into a property.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237702" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The vision has brought over 400 users to its beta, who have gone on to co-invest across 95 properties. It’s also brought millions in early funding to the team: Fractional announced today that it has raised $5.5 million in total funding at a $30 million valuation. Fractional&#8217;s seed round is led by CRV, but includes Y Combinator, Will Smith, Kevin Durant, Goodwater Capital, Unusual Ventures, Global Founders Capital, On Deck, Contrary Capital and Soma Capital.</p>
<p>Fractional divides the home ownership process into three main parts. First, the startup either matches together co-owners or onboards a friend group to kickstart the underwriting process, which blends well with the co-founder’s experience at Affirm. Then, it helps facilitate the purchase through legal and financial software services. Finally, it partners with property management companies and other services to make sure the co-owned homes stay in good shape (without the time commitment from its new co-owners).</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="ppnjnZKqma"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/08/community-is-the-new-ai/">Community is the new AI</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Community is the new AI&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/08/community-is-the-new-ai/embed/#?secret=ppnjnZKqma" data-secret="ppnjnZKqma" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>While Fractional certainly alleviates some of the financial hurdles of real estate ownership, friends may stray away from getting into business with each other due to the sheer pressure it can put on a relationship. What if life circumstances cause one person to want to sell before others? Or another refuses to upgrade the kitchen?</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Despite their backgrounds, the co-founders know that scaling access as a service within real estate is uniquely complex. So, Han and Treviño pooled together cash and bought a plot of land in Mexico to more closely understand the process. Treviño’s family owns a construction business in Mexico, so the duo was able to find an off-market deal for a good price and eventually build a retail storefront on the property. But, as Han recalls, &#8220;the process wasn&#8217;t super smooth&#8221; and they had to pay a lawyer about $750 an hour to understand the mechanics of the process.</p>
<p>“We had to hire a lawyer because I just wanted to make sure we had a good model between the two of us on how we make decisions, how we resolve conflicts.”</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2237706" style="width: 369px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237706" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2237706" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fractional-cofounders.jpg" alt="" width="359" height="479" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fractional-cofounders.jpg 2448w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fractional-cofounders.jpg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fractional-cofounders.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fractional-cofounders.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fractional-cofounders.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fractional-cofounders.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fractional-cofounders.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/fractional-cofounders.jpg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2237706" class="wp-caption-text">Fractional co-founders Stella Han and Carlos Treviño. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Fractional</p></div></p>
<p>CRV general partner Saar Gur thinks that the social networking layer of Fractional, &#8220;where new and experienced investors participate in a symbiotic environment,&#8221; is one of its distinguishing factors, according to a statement. &#8220;This also lets Fractional drive constant engagement on the platform beyond raw transactions and fuel their growth through organic word of mouth instead of aggressive paid marketing,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The rise of alternative investing, from NFT ownership to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/02/step-aside-nfts-aqua-thinks-modern-investors-should-dive-into-private-equity/?tpcc=tcplustwitter">private equity funds,</a> may trigger more adoption. Consumers are getting comfortable with the idea of diversifying their portfolios away from traditional public equities, and Fractional is a platform that capitalizes on one of the better-known asset classes out there &#8212; real estate.</p>
<p>Not Boring Capital’s Packy McCormick, who is an angel investor in Fractional, thinks the startup brings a highly scalable, high-margin business to a typically hard-to-scale, low-margin business.</p>
<p>“What&#8217;s been most impressive to me,&#8221; the investor and writer told TechCrunch, &#8220;is that in an industry that&#8217;s been very asset heavy &#8212; you need to buy a house and do construction and then sell it, or buy an asset and then let people invest &#8212; they&#8217;ve taken a pure software approach that doesn&#8217;t compromise the ease of the process and still gives people the hands-on feel of owning a house.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Twitter&#8217;s e-commerce initiatives now include livestream shopping and Walmart will be the first retailer to test the new platform. Over the past year, Walmart has invested in live shopping by hosting events across social platforms like TikTok and YouTube, and soon it will debut Twitter&#8217;s first-ever shoppable livestream. On November 28, Walmart will kick off a Cyber Deals live event on Twitter, where users will be able to watch a live broadcast, shop the featured products and join the conversation around the event by posting tweets.</p>
<p>The livestream will begin at 7 PM ET on November 28, 2021, and will allow Walmart customers to shop from Twitter as well as a number of other platforms, including Walmart.com/live, and the retailer&#8217;s Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube accounts. Musician-turned-creator Jason Derulo will host the livestream, where he&#8217;ll introduce the audience to deals in electronics, home goods, apparel, seasonal décor and more during a 30-minute variety show. Surprise special guests will also drop in, says Walmart.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2237960" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237960" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2237960" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Walmart-Cyber-Deals-Shoppable-Livesteam.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="680" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Walmart-Cyber-Deals-Shoppable-Livesteam.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Walmart-Cyber-Deals-Shoppable-Livesteam.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Walmart-Cyber-Deals-Shoppable-Livesteam.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Walmart-Cyber-Deals-Shoppable-Livesteam.png?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Walmart-Cyber-Deals-Shoppable-Livesteam.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Walmart-Cyber-Deals-Shoppable-Livesteam.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Walmart-Cyber-Deals-Shoppable-Livesteam.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Walmart-Cyber-Deals-Shoppable-Livesteam.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Walmart-Cyber-Deals-Shoppable-Livesteam.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Walmart-Cyber-Deals-Shoppable-Livesteam.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2237960" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Walmart</p></div></p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237880" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Walmart has been broadening its support for livestream shopping throughout 2021. It hosted its first shoppable livestream last December when it worked with TikTok <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/17/walmart-to-pilot-test-live-streamed-video-shopping-on-tiktok/">on its Holiday Shop-Along Spectacular event,</a> shortly after its planned investment in the video app fell through. (Walmart was interested in a deal for TikTok following Trump&#8217;s executive order that would have forced a sale of TikTok&#8217;s U.S. operations. But Trump&#8217;s order was blocked by the courts.)</p>
<p>That first TikTok live event proved successful, Walmart said at the time, having delivered 7x more views than had been anticipated. It also helped Walmart grow its TikTok follower base by 25%. Though the retailer didn&#8217;t detail the sales revenue the event delivered, it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/walmart-to-host-a-new-live-stream-shopping-event-on-tiktok-following-successful-pilot/">ran a second TikTok livestream shopping event</a> just a few months later.</p>
<p>While Walmart&#8217;s bid for TikTok had signaled the retailer&#8217;s interest in live, social e-commerce, it saw potential outside of TikTok, as well. Over the past year, Walmart expanded livestream shopping tests to include other platforms. To date, Walmart has hosted more than 15 livestream events across five platforms, including its own website.</p>
<p>Those live commerce initiatives will now include Twitter, which is <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/watch--chat--shop--live-shopping-on-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">today revealing</a> its new livestream shopping platform to the public.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Twitter says the Walmart Cyber Deals livestream will serve as the initial test of Live Shopping on Twitter in the U.S.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2237959" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237959" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2237959" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2237959" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>This new platform expands upon Twitter&#8217;s existing shopping products and livestream capabilities.</p>
<p>It will include a live broadcast that streams at the top of a Live Event page, followed by a Shoppable Banner and Shop Tab where the products shown in the livestream are featured. Twitter users will be able to toggle back and forth between the &#8220;Latest&#8221; tab and the &#8220;Shop&#8221; tab during the event as they preview the products. When consumers want to make a purchase, they&#8217;re directed to the retailer&#8217;s website within an in-app browser where the livestream will continue to be broadcast. That way, users won&#8217;t miss anything during checkout, Twitter says.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the Live Event page, there&#8217;s also a text box where consumers can tweet about the livestream with a suggested hashtag.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are honored to have Walmart onboard as the first-ever brand to host a Live Shopping event on Twitter. Walmart is renowned for bringing customers an immersive look into their products and we are excited to bring this experience onto Twitter with them, while helping them reach their business objectives,&#8221; said Sarah Personette, chief customer officer at Twitter, in a statement. &#8220;This is just the first of many Live Shopping events we hope brands will be able to bring to market, and we can’t wait for people to watch, chat, and shop &#8212; all through Twitter,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2237958" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2237958" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-2237958" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping-2.png?w=680" alt="" width="680" height="383" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping-2.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping-2.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping-2.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping-2.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping-2.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping-2.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/twitter-live-shopping-2.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2237958" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Twitter</p></div></p>
<p>The livestream shopping platform builds on Twitter&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/28/twitter-launches-u-s-e-commerce-pilot-that-lets-users-shop-from-profiles/"> earlier tests of a Shop Module</a>, launched in July, that gave brands, businesses and retailers a way to showcase their products directly on their Twitter profiles. The test was meant to better understand if there was demand for shopping on Twitter, and had included a handful of pilot partners like gaming retailer <a href="https://twitter.com/GameStop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameStop</a> and travel brand <a href="https://twitter.com/ArdenCove" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arden Cove</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Walmart said it was interested in testing Twitter&#8217;s new capabilities because it consistently sees high returns across top- and middle-of-funnel content on Twitter&#8217;s platform, which makes it a natural next step for Walmart&#8217;s explorations into social commerce.</p>
<p>The new Twitter livestream event represents the start of a bigger push into live shopping over the 2021 holiday season for Walmart. The company says it has over 30 shoppable livestream events planned across eight social and media platforms, including BuyWith, BuzzFeed, Facebook, IGN, TalkShopLive, Tasty, Twitter and YouTube. (TikTok was not listed, but Walmart told us it&#8217;s working closely with the TikTok team on future shoppable livestreams.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Twitter continues to be an important platform for Walmart’s business and our customers,&#8221; said William White, chief marketing officer at Walmart U.S. &#8220;We’ve been focused on charting new territory in shoppable livestreams and are excited to celebrate an important milestone together with the first Livestream Shopping event on Twitter. We’re meeting customers where they are and making it easier to shop incredible deals and find inspiration through dynamic, interactive experiences. We look forward to continuing to bring engaging experiences to our customers that allow them to shop seamlessly while also being entertained,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Following the initial test of Live Shopping with Walmart, Twitter says it will start testing a new way to house merchant onboarding and product catalog management tools through an interface called the &#8220;Twitter Shopping Manager.&#8221; This will simplify the process of getting started with Shopping on Twitter, the company says. It also plans to make the <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/twitter-shopping--testing-shoppable-profiles-on-twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shop Module</a> available to more retailers over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Twitter told TechCrunch it doesn&#8217;t take a cut of the e-commerce revenues delivered through Live Shopping nor are brands paying to be included. But offering live shopping on Twitter could entice more users to join the platform, which has historically struggled with growing consumer adoption.</p>
<p>The live event will be available on Twitter on iOS and desktop in the U.S., starting on November 28th at 7 PM ET/4 PM PT.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">The way COVID-19 has changed the way we work comes up a lot &#8212; founders have had to pivot and innovate to build companies during lockdown, but the workplace restrictions seemed to spark inspiration for this week&#8217;s guest, Larry Gadea, founder and CEO of Envoy. Envoy started in 2013 as a guest sign-in platform to make offices safer and more efficient. Over the past 18 months, Envoy has created new products to solve for many of the new issues offices have as they adapt to the new and frequently changing office safety protocols. Larry talks about how remote work affected company culture, his work-life balance philosophy and how his leadership style has grown with the company.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Paytm's IPO price was simply too high compared to its recent financial results. Trailing results matter as well, and Paytm's were just too weak to support its IPO price.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If you weren&#8217;t paying close attention, you might have expected a different result from Paytm&#8217;s IPO. After all, the company is incredibly well funded <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/29/alibaba-increases-its-investment-in-indian-payments-and-commerce-firm-paytm/">by investors that you know by name</a>, and the Indian fintech giant has sufficiently scaled into a global brand.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>The Exchange explores startups, markets and money. </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Read it <a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange">every morning on TechCrunch+</a> or get <a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters">The Exchange newsletter</a> every Saturday.</em></strong></p>
<hr />
<p>And yet.</p>
<p>After debuting last Thursday, Paytm has notched two double-digit declines, measured in percentage terms, during its first two days of trading. As far as going public is concerned, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/17/india-paytm-makes-market-debut/">seeing your share price fall 27%</a> and then 13% is about as bad as it can go.</p>
<p>So, what happened? To understand the lackluster Paytm IPO &#8212; technically the public offering from One 97 Communications, Paytm&#8217;s parent company &#8212; we&#8217;re going back to the company&#8217;s IPO filing, which we&#8217;ll augment with a new filing that dropped today containing a few more data points concerning its performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/subscribe/?tpcc=theexchange"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-2220367 size-medium" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/exchange-banner-sq-grn-plus.jpg?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>What we want to know is whether we can spot in the numbers enough reason to understand the company&#8217;s awful post-IPO performance. Was Paytm simply mispriced in its public debut? If so, we don&#8217;t have to spend as much time wondering if the larger Indian stock market is less than welcoming toward tech unicorns.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/manish-singh/">TechCrunch&#8217;s Manish Singh</a>, we also have some analyst numbers to lean up against for support. Into the breach!</p>
<h2>Paytm&#8217;s IPO filing</h2>
<p>To avoid this post going on for more words than you want to read, we&#8217;ll skip a deep dive into what Paytm offers the market. Let it suffice to say that it offers payments, bill pay and loans to the Indian market, among other efforts.</p>
<p>So how good of a business is fintech in India? Let&#8217;s take a peek at <a href="https://www.axiscapital.co.in/uploads/equity_documents/20210716104312_one_97_communications_limited__drhp.pdf">the company&#8217;s IPO filing</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Web hosting giant GoDaddy has reported a data breach, and warns that data on 1.2 million customers may have been accessed.</p>
<p>In a filing <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1609711/000160971121000122/gddyblogpostnov222021.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the Securities and Exchange Commission</a>, GoDaddy&#8217;s chief information security officer Demetrius Comes said the company detected unauthorized access to its systems where it hosts and manages its customers&#8217; WordPress servers. WordPress is a web-based content management system used by millions to set up blogs or websites. GoDaddy lets customers host their own WordPress installs on their servers.</p>
<p>GoDaddy said the unauthorized person used a compromised password to get access to GoDaddy&#8217;s systems around September 6. GoDaddy said it discovered the breach last week on November 17. It&#8217;s not clear if the compromised password was protected with two-factor authentication.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237929" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>The filing said that the breach affects 1.2 million active and inactive managed WordPress users, who had their email addresses and customer numbers exposed. GoDaddy said this exposure could put users at greater risk of phishing attacks. The web host also said that the original WordPress admin password created when WordPress was first installed, which could be used to access a customer&#8217;s WordPress server, was also exposed.</p>
<p>The company said that active customers had their sFTP credentials (for file transfers), and the usernames and passwords for their WordPress databases, which store all the user&#8217;s content, exposed in the breach. In some cases, the customer&#8217;s SSL (HTTPS) private key was exposed, which if abused could allow an attacker to impersonate a customer&#8217;s website or services.</p>
<p>GoDaddy said it&#8217;s reset customer WordPress passwords and private keys, and is in the process of issuing new SSL certificates.</p>
<p>The web host has more than 20 million customers worldwide. A spokesperson for GoDaddy did not immediately comment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">SmarterSelect, a U.S.-based company that provides software for managing the application process for scholarships, exposed the personal data of thousands of applicants because of a misconfigured <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/google-cloud-storage/">Google Cloud Storage</a> bucket.</p>
<p>The data spill, <a href="https://www.upguard.com/breaches/smarterselect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered by cybersecurity company UpGuard</a>, contained 1.5 terabytes of data collected by a number of programs that offer financial support to students. The data included documents such as academic transcripts, resumes and invoices for approximately 1.2 million applications to funding programs, dated from November 2020 to September 21, 2021. SmarterSelect&#8217;s website says it has served <a href="https://www.smarterselect.com/blog/who-we-are-and-what-weve-done" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.6 million people</a> to date.</p>
<p>One folder hosted on the public bucket hosted 23,000 spreadsheets and 8,000 ZIP files, according to UpGuard’s analysis. For applicants, these files contained contact information like name, email address and phone number, as well as much more probing details such as their parents&#8217; education and income, the students’ performance at school, and personal experiences like living in a foster home or abusive situations.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237884" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Some files also contained longer documents such as letters of recommendation and personal essays detailing poverty, physical and sexual abuse, domestic violence and other personal information, UpGuard said.</p>
<p>Another directory, which contained some 2.79 million files, included even more sensitive data on applicants. This includes student photos where required for application, financial documents such as Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) forms that in some cases included full Social Security numbers, proof of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/covid-19/">COVID-19</a> vaccinations and descriptions of hardships.</p>
<p>UpGuard first notified SmarterSelect about the breach on September 15 and then again on September 27. The company acknowledged the warning on September 30, before revoking public access to the bucket on October 5. It&#8217;s not known whether any malicious actors accessed the data while it was exposed.</p>
<p>“The contents of the bucket also serve as a reminder of the risks of collecting and retaining sensitive data, particularly for populations like college students,” UpGuard said. “The process of applying to, attending, and securing funding for university education requires young people to provide detailed information about themselves to a complex institutional supply chain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even well-intentioned programs aiming to assist students who have been disadvantaged by circumstances beyond their control &#8212; in fact, especially those programs that seek to help those most in need &#8212; require a detailed accounting of the facts of one’s life.”</p>
<p>It’s not yet clear whether SmarterSelect has notified those affected by the breach, nor whether it has alerted the relevant state attorney general offices per data breach notification law. TechCrunch asked SmarterSelect for comment but did not immediately hear back.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">When you’re wearing multiple hats while managing your startup’s operations, there&#8217;s hardly any time to stop and think about what would happen if things were to go catastrophically wrong. You probably don’t consider the consequences if you were to die suddenly, leaving the venture you spent so much blood, sweat and tears building without a leader.</p>
<p>It’s even less often that we think about what happens <em>after</em> we pass away — when state courts hand the business to an unprepared family member or tie up business assets for months or years until your estate is settled.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, without an estate plan in place, these scenarios are entirely likely. I cannot stress enough how important it is for startup founders and business owners to have a plan. It doesn’t just protect your assets &#8212; it keeps your legacy intact.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237655" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>

		<blockquote>
			This may seem a bit bleak, but having an estate plan will put your mind at ease.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>We repeatedly hear about the very real consequences when business owners die without an estate plan that dictates their wishes legally. Just a year ago, the former CEO of Zappos, Tony Hsieh, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-zappos-ceo-tony-hsiehs-death-is-ruled-accident-by-medical-examiner-11606779833?mod=article_inline">died in a fire</a> at 46. Prior to this, he had retired with an estimated net worth of $840 million, but his family has since declared that he <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-death-of-zappos-tony-hsieh-a-spiral-of-alcohol-drugs-and-extreme-behavior-11607264719">died intestate</a>.</p>
<p>Now they are desperately trying to file for access to the former CEO’s accounts and assets but to no avail. And what makes the case even more tragic is that Hsieh had a plethora of charitable interests and would have undoubtedly wanted to donate some of his wealth upon his passing.</p>
<p>A recent survey from LegalZoom.com found that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/05/op-ed-more-people-are-creating-wills-amid-the-pandemic.html">62%</a> of Americans don’t have an estate plan in place. However, 32% of young people aged 18 to 34 say they have sorted out an estate scheme due to the pandemic. What’s more, 21% of that group said they created a plan specifically because they or someone they knew had COVID-19.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>We all want to build businesses that are timeless and are going to last for decades, so you should make sure your business is in good hands no matter what happens. With COVID-19 bringing estate planning into sharper focus, let’s look at what you can do to ensure stress-free planning.</p>
<h2>Get your documents in order</h2>
<p>For starters, any startup owner needs to look into the documents required for an estate plan to be put in place.</p>
<p>Every adult in America should have a medical and financial power of attorney and a will. The medical and financial power of attorney are documents that empower someone you trust to make decisions for you during your lifetime if you become incapable of leading your business. If none of that is organized and you become incapacitated or die, the state comes in and makes decisions for you, regardless of what you may have chosen.</p>
<p>Aside from the documents you need to have in place for an estate plan (the power of attorney, health proxy and a will), it is also worth considering creating a living trust with all your assets and a “pour-over will” associated with it. This means that in the event of an untimely death, the distribution of your assets to beneficiaries is a much smoother process because the courts don’t need to step in to grant executor authority.</p>
<p>In the case of a sole proprietorship, were you to pass away, the business could simply dissolve, depending on your state’s intestacy laws. Or, the courts may award the sole proprietorship to your spouse or other surviving family members, which presents additional issues.</p>
<p>For example, suppose a marriage was on the rocks to the point where one party was filing for divorce but also owned a very successful business and suddenly died. In that case, the spouse could inherit the company, which would certainly not be in the deceased’s interests.</p>
<p>Estate planning services can walk you through the different elements needed for each document. For example, this could refer to distributing assets to your beneficiaries or assigning a guardian for your children.</p>
<p>Once that is done, the documents will need to be notarized, and in the case of a will or power of attorney, you will need a witness to be present. The final step is uploading them to a digital portal — some companies can even offer 24/7 access.</p>
<h2>A constantly evolving situation</h2>
<p>An estate plan needs adjusting throughout your life, particularly if you own a burgeoning startup that might become a major player in your sector later down the line. Ideally, you would update an estate plan annually, around the time when tax returns are due, but the situation can be much more fluid depending on the state of your business.</p>
<p>It’s possible that your business assets rapidly gain value, or you decide that you want to take a different approach toward your succession planning (anyone who has seen the TV drama “Succession” knows just how complex this can be).</p>
<p>You must decide whom you trust to take over your company if something happens to you. It is not just about having an estate plan that expresses your wishes &#8212; it’s almost equally important to communicate it with a written succession plan.</p>
<p><a href="https://hbr.org/2021/05/the-high-cost-of-poor-succession-planning%C2%A0">HBR estimates that</a> company valuations and investor returns would be 20% to 25% higher with better succession planning, which must be coordinated with your will to avoid the possibility of conflicting rights to any of your assets. Ideally, you want to give this person as much notice as possible, so they are prepared for your death and don’t have to spend unnecessary time and money hiring a lawyer or filling out paperwork.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that when it comes to dividing the value of your assets, valuations can change, which is why updating your estate plan is crucial.</p>
<p>For example, you might decide to donate a percentage of your total estate to the church, but if the value of your estate increases over a few years, this sum could end up being far greater than you initially thought. Similarly, if you assign a significant cash value to a particular party, and your estate loses value, they could be receiving much more than you would be comfortable giving.</p>
<p>Although we have discussed estate planning from the status of high-net-worth individuals, and some startups may not consider themselves at this stage just yet, it has to be a consideration for the future. As of January 2022, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alangassman/2021/03/27/senate-estate-and-gift-tax-bill-will-reduce-exemption-to-3500000-and-take-away-many-opportunities/">up to $3.5 million</a> in net worth would not be taxed federally after you die.</p>
<p>However, any amount over that would be taxed at the federal estate tax rate up to 40%. Therefore, if a successful founder were to pass away without an estate plan in place, they could leave both legal difficulties for their family and their estate could lose a considerable amount to federal tax.</p>
<p>This may seem a bit bleak, but having an estate plan will put your mind at ease.</p>
<p>I don’t want to fear-monger; instead, I want to highlight the costly and damaging impact when something happens and you don’t have an estate plan in place. Startup owners can be forgiven for not considering estate planning previously, as leaders are often working nonstop to get their business off the ground, but not taking the time to get on top of it could cause many problems farther down the line.</p>
<p>Taking these steps and being wary of the cautions outlined above will save undue stress for you and your family should the worst ever happen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rocket startup-turned-public company Astra Space is flying high Monday morning, with stock prices increasing as much as 42% since markets opened thanks to the company’s first successful orbital flight late Saturday evening. But now the real work begins, as the company seeks to commence commercial operations and roll out new rocket versions for flight testing next year.</p>
<p>Rocket LV0007 (also called Rocket 3.3) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/20/astra-successfully-reaches-orbit-for-the-first-time-with-latest-rocket-launch/">launched from the Pacific Spaceport Complex</a> in Kodiak, Alaska, and successfully delivered a payload for the U.S. Space Force as part of the department’s Space Test Program. It’s a huge boost for Astra, which now joins a very small club of private companies that have managed to reach orbit.</p>
<p>“This is really hard and all it takes is one thing to go wrong,” CEO Chris Kemp told reporters during a press conference Monday.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237917" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>Astra’s taken an agile and iterative approach to testing, rapidly building out launch rockets (which have a serial number naming convention) and hosting test flights in relatively quick succession. As a result, the company’s experienced its share of failure &#8212; including the most recent <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/astras-first-commercial-launch-fails-to-reach-orbit/">flight test of LV0006</a>, during which an engine anomaly caused the rocket to drift sideways before reaching around 50 km. But the persistence has paid off.</p>
<p>“A lot of these things are very difficult to test unless you&#8217;re in flight conditions,” Kemp explained. “We did this at record pace because of this iterative approach and I don&#8217;t think we would have gotten there on this schedule any other way.”</p>
<p>Leading up to the launch, the company got a lot of useful data not from flight simulations but from the natural environment: the sub-zero temperatures in Kodiak, Alaska, where Astra has a launch facility, Astra’s chief engineer Benjamin Lyon said Monday.</p>
<p>“We’ve never operated in these freezing temperatures before,” Kemp added.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The two executives confirmed that the next Rocket 3.3, LV0008, was close to launch readiness, though they said more details on flight dates and where it might take off from would be released at some point in the future. But because the launch of LV0007 went so smoothly, the company will likely not pour too much effort into any changes to further 3.3 versions, Kemp said. Instead, the company is turning its focus to Rocket 4.0, a new variant that should be able to carry heavier payloads than Rocket 3.3’s 50-kilogram payload capacity. The company will begin test flights of Rocket 4.0 next year.</p>
<p>Astra’s vision is to <a href="https://astra.com/news/qa-with-dr-adam-london-astra-cto-and-co-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eventually conduct daily space launches</a> using its small rocket system. Whether it will ultimately reach that target remains to be seen, but Kemp said launch demand has only increased over time.</p>
<p>“Since Astra went public […] almost a dozen companies that I would call space tech companies have gone public,” he said. “This gives them the resources to do more development or iterative design of spacecraft and satellites. I could only imagine that the demand will continue to grow, as we&#8217;ve seen over the past couple of years, so I think Astra really is in a position to deliver a payload to precise orbit on a precise schedule.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://ericsson.com">Ericsson</a>, an international networking company, decided it needed a dose of modernization and this morning announced its intent to acquire cloud communications company <a href="http://vonage.com">Vonage</a> in a $6.2 billion deal.</p>
<p>With Vonage, Ericsson is getting a more modern approach to communications that includes a cloud contact center, communications APIs (like Twilio&#8217;s) and a voice over internet protocol (VoIP) solution. The company believes that it can build on its 4G and 5G networking technology by taking advantage of the key pieces of the Vonage family.</p>
<p>Börje Ekholm, Ericsson president and CEO, said that this is part of a strategy by the company to begin capturing more enterprise business.</p><div id="tc-target-mid-article-2237882" class="tc-target-mid-article ad-unit--size-auto"></div>
<p>&#8220;This provides the foundation to build an enterprise business. The acquisition of Vonage is the next step in delivering on that strategic priority. Vonage gives us a platform to help our customers monetize the investments in the network, benefiting developers and businesses,&#8221; he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Specifically, Ericsson is focused on Vonage&#8217;s communications APIs, which it believes will enable it to tap into a network of developers across the world building applications based on 4G and 5G technology.</p>
<p>Rory Read, CEO of Vonage, indicated it was a deal that was too good to turn down and sees combining forces with the much larger corporation as ultimately good for his company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe joining Ericsson is in the best interests of our shareholders and is a testament to Vonage’s leadership position in business cloud communications, our innovative product portfolio and outstanding team,&#8221; Read said in a statement.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>With Vonage, the company not only gets the technology portfolio &#8212; it gets a healthy business that generated $1.4 billion in the 12-month period ending September 30. It also gets access to 120,000 Vonage customers and more than 1 million registered developers, according to the company.</p>
<p>Vonage launched in 2001 with a VoIP product and raised almost $600 million, according to Crunchbase data, before going public in 2006. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/20/vonage-acquires-cloud-based-contact-center-startup-newvoicemedia-for-350m-in-cash/">It acquired cloud contact center</a> startup NewVoiceMedia in 2018 for $350 million.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s merger deal is subject to approval by the Vonage board and various regulatory bodies, but Ericsson still expects it to close sometime in the first half of next year.</p>
<p>Vonage stock is flying high this morning, up 25% on the news. Investors are less enamored with Ericsson, with stock down 4.89% as of publication.</p>
