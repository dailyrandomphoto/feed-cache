					<description><![CDATA[Foodtech company NotCo, making plant-based milk and meat replacements, wrapped up another funding round this year, a $235 million Series D round that gives it a $1.5 billion valuation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://notco.com/">NotCo</a>, a food technology company making plant-based milk and meat replacements, wrapped up another funding round this year, a $235 million Series D round that gives it a $1.5 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Tiger Global led the round and was joined by new investors, including DFJ Growth Fund, the social impact foundation, ZOMA Lab; athletes Lewis Hamilton and Roger Federer; and musician and DJ Questlove. Follow-on investors included Bezos Expeditions, Enlightened Hospitality Investments, Future Positive, L Catterton and Kaszek Ventures.</p>
<p>This funding round follows an <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210602005370/en/">undisclosed investment</a> in June from Shake Shack founder Danny Meyer through his firm EHI. In total, NotCo, with roots in both Chile and New York, has raised more than $350 million, founder and CEO Matias Muchnick told TechCrunch.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Currently, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/notco/">company</a> has four product lines: NotMilk, NotBurger and NotMeat, NoticeCream and NotMayo, which are available in the five countries of the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Colombia.</p>
<p>The company is operating in the middle of a trend toward eating healthier food, as more consumers also question how their food is made, resulting in demand for alternative proteins. In fact, the <a href="https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2021/the-benefits-of-plant-based-meats">market for alternative meat, eggs, dairy and seafood products</a> is predicted to reach $290 billion by 2035, according to research by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/boston-consulting-group">Boston Consulting Group</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blue-horizon-corporation">Blue Horizon Corp</a>.</p>
<p>NotCo’s proprietary artificial intelligence technology, Giuseppe, matches animal proteins to their ideal replacements among thousands of plant-based ingredients. It is working to crack the code in understanding the molecular components and food characteristics in the combination of two ingredients that could mimic milk, but in a more sustainable and resourceful way &#8212; and that also tastes good, which is the biggest barrier to adoption, Muchnick said.</p>
<p>“Our theory is that there is a crazy dynamic among people: 60% who are already eating plant-based are not happy with the taste, and 30% of those who drink cow’s milk are waiting to change if there is a similar taste,” he added. “Our technology is based in AI so that we can create a different food system, as well as products faster and better than others in the space. There are 300,000 plant species, and we still have no idea what 99% of them can do.”</p>
<p>In addition to a flow of investments this year, the company launched its NotMilk brand in the United States seven months ago and is on track to be in 8,000 locations across retailers like Whole Foods Market, Sprouts and Wegmans by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>Muchnick plans to allocate some of the new funding to establish markets in Mexico and Canada and add market share in the U.S. and Chile. He expects to have 50% of its business coming from the U.S. over the next three years. He is also eyeing an expansion into Asia and Europe in the next year.</p>
<p>NotCo also intends to add more products, like chicken and other white meats and seafood, and to invest in technology and R&amp;D. He expects to do that by doubling the company’s current headcount of 100 in the next two years. Muchnick also wants to establish more patents in food science — the company already has five — and to explore a potential intelligence side of the business.</p>
<p>Though NotCo reached unicorn status, Muchnick said the real prize is the brand awareness and subsequent sales boost, as well as opening doors for quick-service restaurant deals. NotBurger went into Burger King restaurants in Chile 11 months ago, and now has 5% of the market there, he added.</p>
<p>Sales overall have grown three times annually over the past four years, something Muchnick said was attractive to Tiger Global. He is equally happy to work with Tiger, especially as the company prepares to go public in the next two or three years. He said Tiger’s expertise will get NotCo there in a more prepared manner.</p>
<p>“NotCo has created world class plant-based food products that are rapidly gaining market share,” said Scott Shleifer, partner at Tiger Global, in a written statement. “We are excited to partner with Matias and his team. We expect continued product innovation and expansion into new geographies and food categories will fuel high and sustainable growth for years to come.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">If efforts<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/maines-facial-recognition-law-shows-bipartisan-support-for-protecting-privacy/"> by states</a> and<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/minneapolis-facial-recognition-ban/"> cities</a> to pass privacy regulations curbing the use of facial recognition are anything to go by, you might fear the worst for the companies building the technology. But a recent influx of investor cash suggests the facial recognition startup sector is thriving, not suffering.</p>
<p>Facial recognition is one of the most controversial and complex policy areas in play. The technology can be used to track where you go and what you do. It&#8217;s used by public authorities and in private businesses like stores. But facial recognition has been shown to be flawed and inaccurate, often <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/30/lawmakers-amazon-recognition-racially-biased-harm-free-expression/">misidentifies non-white faces</a>, and is disproportionately <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/facial-recognition-has-always-troubled-people-of-color-everyone-should-listen/">affects communities of color</a>. Its flawed algorithms have already been used to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html"> send innocent people to jail</a>, and privacy advocates have raised<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/22/amazon-facial-recognition-software-raises-privacy-concerns-with-the-aclu/"> countless concerns</a> about how this kind of biometric data is stored and used.</p>
<p>With the threat of federal legislation looming, some of the biggest facial recognition companies like Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/10/amazon-rekognition-moratorium/">announced they would stop selling their facial recognition technology</a> to police departments to try to appease angry investors, customers, and even their own employees who<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/13/tech-workers-demonstrate-in-downtown-san-francisco-against-trumps-immigration-plans/"> protested the deployment</a> of such technologies by the U.S. government and immigration authorities.</p>
<p>The pushback against facial recognition didn&#8217;t stop there. Since the start of the year,<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/massachusetts-votes-to-pass-statewide-police-ban-on-facial-recognition/"> Maine</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/01/massachusetts-votes-to-pass-statewide-police-ban-on-facial-recognition/">Massachusetts</a>, and the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/12/minneapolis-facial-recognition-ban/"> city of Minneapolis</a> have all passed legislation curbing or banning the use of facial recognition in some form, following in the steps of many other cities and states before them and setting the stage for others, like<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/09/new-york-city-biometrics-law/"> New York</a>, which are eyeing legislation of their own.</p>
<p>In those same six or so months, investors have funneled hundreds of millions into several facial recognition startups. A breakdown of<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/breakdown-venture-capital-floods-into-facial-recognition/"> Crunchbase data by FindBiometrics</a> shows a sharp rise in venture funding in facial recognition companies at well over $500 million in 2021 so far, compared to $622 million for all of 2020.</p>
<p>About half of that $500 million comes from one startup alone. Israel-based startup AnyVision<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/07/anyvision-the-controversial-facial-recognition-startup-has-raised-235m-led-by-softbank-and-eldridge/"> raised $235 million at Series C</a> earlier this month from SoftBank&#8217;s Vision Fund 2 for its facial recognition technology that&#8217;s used<a href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2021/07/06/this-manual-for-a-popular-facial-recognition-tool-shows-just-how-much-the-software-tracks-people"> in schools</a>, stadiums, casinos, and retail stores. Macy&#8217;s is<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/exclusive-why-us-hospital-oil-company-turned-facial-recognition-2021-04-20/"> a known customer</a>, and uses the face-scanning technology to identify shoplifters. It&#8217;s a steep funding round compared to a year earlier when Microsoft publicly<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/29/divesting-from-one-facial-recognition-startup-microsoft-ends-outside-investments-in-the-tech/"> pulled its investment</a> in AnyVision&#8217;s Series A<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/29/divesting-from-one-facial-recognition-startup-microsoft-ends-outside-investments-in-the-tech/"> following an investigation</a> by former U.S. attorney general Eric Holder into reports that the startup&#8217;s technology was being used by the Israeli government to surveil residents in the West Bank.</p>

<p>Paravision, the company<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/ever-once-accused-of-building-facial-recognition-tech-using-customer-data-shuts-down-consumer-app/"> marred by controversy</a> after it was accused of using facial recognition on its users without informing them, raised $23 million in a funding round led by J2 Ventures.</p>
<p>And last week, Clearview AI, the controversial facial recognition startup that is the subject of several government investigations and multiple class-action suits for allegedly scraping<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/27/clearview-facial-recognition-private-companies/"> billions of profile photos</a> from social media sites, confirmed to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/21/technology/clearview-ai-valuation.html"> The New York Times</a> it raised $30 million from investors who asked &#8220;not to be identified,&#8221; only that they are &#8220;institutional investors and private family offices.&#8221; That is to say, while investors are happy to see their money go towards building facial recognition systems, they too are all too aware of the risks and controversies associated with attaching their names to the technology.</p>
<p>Although the applications and customers of facial recognition wildly vary, there&#8217;s still a big market for the technology.</p>
<p>Many of the cities and towns with facial recognition bans also have carve outs that allow its use in some circumstances, or broad exemptions for private businesses that can freely buy and use the technology. The exclusion of many China-based facial recognition companies, like Hikvision and Dahua, which the government has<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/united-states-towns-hikvision-dahua-surveillance/"> linked to human rights abuses</a> against the Uighur Muslim minority in Xinjiang, as well as dozens of other startups<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/trump-us-blacklist-megvii-sensetime-yitu-xinjiang"> blacklisted</a> by the U.S. government, has helped push out some of the greatest competition from the most lucrative U.S. markets, like government customers</p>
<p>But as facial recognition continues to draw scrutiny, investors are urging companies to do more to make sure their technologies are not being misused.</p>
<p>In June, a group of 50 investors with more than $4.5 trillion in assets called on dozens of facial recognition companies, including Amazon, Facebook, Alibaba and Huawei, to build their technologies ethically.</p>
<p>&#8220;In some instances, new technologies such as facial recognition technology may also undermine our fundamental rights. Yet this technology is being designed and used in a largely unconstrained way, presenting risks to basic human rights,&#8221; the statement read.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just ethics, but also a matter of trying to future-proof the industry from inevitable further political headwinds. In April, the European Union&#8217;s top data protection watchdog called for an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/eus-top-data-protection-supervisor-urges-ban-on-facial-recognition-in-public/">end to facial recognition</a> in public spaces across the bloc.</p>
<p>&#8220;As mass surveillance expands, technological innovation is outpacing human rights protection. There are growing reports of bans, fines, and blacklistings of the use of facial recognition technology. There is a pressing need to consider these questions,&#8221; the statement added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">When you are a coffee lover, taste matters, and <a href="https://www.spinn.com/">Spinn</a> is brewing up some fresh funding in the way of a $20 million funding round, led by Spark Capital, to bring connected coffee to new customers through its hardware-enabled coffee marketplace.</p>
<p>Joining Spark in the round were Amazon’s Alexa Fund, Bar 9 Ventures and existing investors. It gives the Los Angeles-based company a total of $37 million in funding to date, CEO Roderick de Rode told TechCrunch. He isn’t defining this round, but said Spinn previously raised both Series A and B rounds.</p>
<p>“SPINN is doing for coffee what Dyson did for vacuums and what Nest did for homes, rethinking technology and connectivity for better results,” said Kevin Thau, general partner at Spark Capital, in a written statement. “Their approach, from machine design to roaster assortment, is elevating the entire industry and delivering what consumers seek today: delicious tasting coffee brewed to their personal preferences, with the smallest impact on the planet.”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Spinn debuted its centrifugal brewing method at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/09/spinns-unique-coffee-brewer-brings-third-wave-roasters-to-your-countertop/">TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield in 2016</a>. The connected coffee maker uses centrifugal force to spin, instead of press, coffee grounds. De Rode says this results in a cup of coffee tasting how it was intended by the roaster. The machines can be controlled via voice command from Amazon’s Alexa or a single tap on the machine or from a mobile app.</p>
<p>A survey released in April by National Coffee Association USA found that the global pandemic was the driver for <a href="https://www.ncausa.org/Newsroom/COVID-19-drives-record-at-home-coffee-drinking-on-the-go-ordering-2021-National-Coffee-Data-Trends-Report">85% of Americans drinking at least one cup of coffee at home</a>, up 8% from January 2020. Nearly 60% of Americans drink coffee every day, and one-quarter purchased a new home coffee machine over the past year.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Osma&#8217;s high-tech instant cold brew could change summertime coffee forever&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/osmas-high-tech-instant-cold-brew-could-change-summertime-coffee-forever/embed/#?secret=Nac1y8Cly2" data-secret="Nac1y8Cly2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>In addition to Spinn, other startups are coming out with machines aimed at making a better cup; for example, <a href="https://drinkosma.com/">Osma</a> is a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/osmas-high-tech-instant-cold-brew-could-change-summertime-coffee-forever/">new coffee-making technique</a> to make a strong espresso-like drink at any temperature, including icy cold.</p>
<p>Spinn itself has three coffee makers to choose from that retail for $479 to $799, according to its website. The machines don’t require any filters or coffee pods and make a variety of styles, including espresso, Americano, drip and cold brew.</p>
<p>The marketplace offers over 1,500 different kinds of coffee from more than 500 artisan roasters around the world. Customers add their coffee choices to a playlist of sorts, which can be specifically curated to ship or scheduled randomly, de Rode said. Drinkers can leave reviews and get recommendations, as well as take a quiz to match with various coffees.</p>
<p>He plans to use the new funding to further grow and develop its patented brewing technologies, and complete delivery of outstanding pre-orders.</p>
<p>Though de Rode wouldn’t go into specifics about Spinn’s growth metrics, he said there has been triple-digit growth from home users. He aims to do for coffee what Vivino did with wine: provide educational content about the coffee options and the roasters themselves.</p>
<p>“The coffee industry is becoming a food thing just like wine,” de Rode said. “People want to understand the different kinds of beans to make more sophisticated choices. We try to bridge the gap between the coffee shop and home.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Olumide Soyombo is one of the well-known active angel investors in Nigeria tech startups and Africa at large</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Since he began angel investing in 2014, Soyombo has invested in 33 startups, including Stripe-owned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/">Paystack</a>, PiggyVest, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/teamapt-will-use-its-new-funding-round-to-provide-digital-bank-services-for-the-unbanked/">TeamApt</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the investor is announcing the launch of</span><a href="https://voltron.africa/index.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Voltron Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a Pan-African venture capital firm </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he co-founded with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abechoi">Abe Choi</a>, a U.S.-based entrepreneur and investor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voltron will be deploying capital to roughly 30 startups, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">mostly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in pre-seed and seed-stage across Africa, in a bid to &#8220;address the severe lack of access to early-stage funding for African tech companies.&#8221; The ticket sizes will range from $20,000 to $100,000, focusing on startups in Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and North Africa.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/olumide-soyombo">Soyombo</a> is one of the few founder-cum-investors on the continent, despite his company not being the traditional VC-backed startup the world has become accustomed to. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2008, he started <a href="http://bluechiptech.biz/">Bluechip Technologies</a> with a friend, Kazeem Tewogbade as an enterprise company that provides data warehousing solutions and enterprise applications to banks, telcos, insurance firms. Some of its biggest clients include OEMs like Oracle.</span></p>
<h2>Non-traditional startup founder to an angel investor</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Six years later, the pair decided to venture into tech, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">relatively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> nascent industry in Nigeria at the time</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and began investing in startups via <a href="http://leadpath.com.ng/index.html">LeadPath</a>, an early-stage firm they launched in Lagos, Nigeria. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea was to invest $25,000 and take the startups through a three-month</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> accelerator program culminating in a Demo Day</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The plan was to run LeadPath like Y Combinator but it didn&#8217;t take off as planned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;In 2014, three months after we found out that there was no investor to put them in front of. So you&#8217;d have to write another check yourself,&#8221; Soyombo said humorously over the phone. &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> saw that the accelerator model didn&#8217;t work, so we started investing </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">individually</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It&#8217;s funny how things have changed since then.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LeadPath became a special purpose vehicle (SPV) for the pair to carry out their angel investing deals</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And over the years, Soyombo has launched several SPVs for the same purpose. So, why do things </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">differently</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> now by creating a fund? </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soyombo walks me through one of the processes he has used to fund deals over the years to answer this question. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an influential figure in Nigeria&#8217;s tech ecosystem, Soyombo has access to almost any important deal in the market</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I get the privilege of seeing many deals before most people see them. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve built that network within the startup ecosystem and reputation as an angel always ready to help</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">obviously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, that helped me see many deals very </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">,&#8221; he said. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, his deal flows </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are filled with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">startups seeking six-figure pre-seed to seed investments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Say, for instance, a founder is looking to raise $300,000, Soyombo can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> invest $50,000 of his own money. And based on his perception of the startup&#8217;s growth prospects, he can choose to bring his friends and acquaintances on board to fill the round.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This informal approach is what Soyombo wants to make formal via a structured format where each individual or organisational LPs gets access to his deal flow simultaneously. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The investor believes companies will get capital quicker this way</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the interesting bit is that his work in corporate Nigeria has allowed him to access non-traditional capital which means some of the investors that use Soyombo&#8217;s deal flows are outside the typical Nigerian tech investing landscape. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He sees his job as someone bridging the gap of angel investing between his corporate friends and colleagues who have not </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">typically</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> invested in tech and startups that need their money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s a bit of FOMO now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;People, including high net worth individuals, tell me to carry them along anytime I&#8217;m investing, and then I have startups looking for capital as well. But then again, I&#8217;m not trying to get a full job by managing a full fund which is why we&#8217;ve structured it this way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyone familiar with the happenings in African tech these past few months knows the two events that have caused this FOMO: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/stripe-acquires-nigerias-paystack-for-200m-to-expand-into-the-african-continent/">Paystack&#8217;s exit to Stripe</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/">Flutterwave&#8217;s unicorn status</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Soyombo was an early investor in the former, marking his solitary primary exit alongside two secondaries within a portfolio that have cumulatively raised over $70 million. Thus, it&#8217;s not hard to see why Soyombo isn&#8217;t having a hard time convincing non-traditional investors, including</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> HNIs (who are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">notoriously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> risk-averse when it comes to tech investing), to write checks in startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a sudden, everyone </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is interested</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in what&#8217;s happening in the space. The HNIs that would&#8217;ve thrown money into real estate are looking for startups. We even see</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> older HNIs telling their children to invest on their behalf, so it&#8217;s an easier conversation to have</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of them want to diversify their portfolio by having a piece of that pie,&#8221; he said, pointing to Paystack and Flutterwave successes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><div id="attachment_2181782" style="width: 438px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2181782" loading="lazy" class="vertical  wp-image-2181782" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Abe-Choi_Voltron.jpeg?w=510" alt="" width="428" height="571" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Abe-Choi_Voltron.jpeg 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Abe-Choi_Voltron.jpeg?resize=113,150 113w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Abe-Choi_Voltron.jpeg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Abe-Choi_Voltron.jpeg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Abe-Choi_Voltron.jpeg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Abe-Choi_Voltron.jpeg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Abe-Choi_Voltron.jpeg?resize=38,50 38w" sizes="(max-width: 428px) 100vw, 428px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2181782" class="wp-caption-text">Abe Choi (Co-founder, Voltron)</p></div></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voltron Capital will </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be managed</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on AngelList. Its investors cut across HNIs and executives from banks, telcos, among other sectors, each investing a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">minimum</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of $10,000. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voltron is similar to a typical seven-figure fund targeting pre-seed and seed-stage startups in Africa, yet it&#8217;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">s quite different in the way it chooses to back founders. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fund remains an embodiment of Soyombo&#8217;s investment stance, which is &#8220;founders-first regardless of the industry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m going to continue backing interesting entrepreneurs. If Odunayo of PiggyVest was building a healthtech or edtech company, I&#8217;ll still back that company,&#8221; he said, referring to the $1 million investment he made three years ago <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/31/nigerias-piggybank-ng-raises-1-1m-announces-group-investment-product/">in one of Nigeria&#8217;s widely celebrated fintechs</a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the investability of sectors, for me, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is driven by</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quality entrepreneurs that are going to solve problems in that area</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2>Early-stage investing needs more work</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, African tech startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/04/did-african-startups-raise-496m-1b-or-2b-in-2019/">raised a record $2 billion</a>, according to Partech Africa. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They have <a href="https://technext.ng/2021/07/09/african-startups-raked-in-record-1-19bn-vc-funding-from-in-just-6-months-of-2021/">raised half that number</a> already this year, and some <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/25/venture-capital-investment-in-africa-predicted-to-reach-a-record-high-this-year/">publications predict</a> these startups will break 2019&#8217;s record</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A large chunk of these investments</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> goes into late-stage deals, which is typical of most tech ecosystems globally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Africa stands out because early-stage startups find it more difficult to raise investments compared to other regions. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, IFC reported that 82% of African tech startups cite access to seed funding and a lack of angel investors as major problems they face</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Without early-stage funding, many of the startups primed to drive this growth are missing out on vital capital to support their early operations and generate revenue, which is a key </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">requirement</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for securing later rounds of funding and a larger scale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voltron, in its little capacity, wants to fill this gap in the best way it can. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides listing local investors as LPs, Soyombo says startups will be able to access foreign capital too.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Choi is the key to making that happen. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Personally</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Choi has invested in 15 startups (exiting two); therefore, his experience and network in the U.S. will be crucial in sourcing foreign capital into the continent</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soyombo believes Stripe acquisition of Paystack has made foreign investors take notice of African startups. He </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">humorously</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> references Paul Graham&#8217;s tweet after the acquisition as another reason why foreign investors&#8217; interests have also piqued. The tweet from the Y Combinator co-founder read: &#8220;Investors who ignore Nigeria now have to ask themselves: What do I know that Patrick Collision doesn&#8217;t?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That said, the investor holds that the pace at which the African tech ecosystem is maturing should excite anyone</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> quality of founders on the continent is improving and will continue in that manner because there are more problems to solve, he continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Also, as our startups mature, we&#8217;ll see people leaving to set up theirs.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We want the next wave of African tech success stories to not only make an impact on the continent but to be </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">truly</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> global; through Abe’s strategic connections to the USA, we’re confident we can provide our portfolio with the best possible opportunities to achieve this through our US and global network.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Meet <a href="https://www.sproutl.com">Sproutl</a>, a marketplace for gardeners living in the U.K. The startup founded by former <a href="https://www.farfetch.com">Farfetch</a> executives has raised a $9 million seed round. It wants to make gardening more accessible by providing a curated list of items, relevant advice as well as inspiration.</p>
<p>Index Ventures is leading the round in the startup with Ada Ventures and several business angels also participating. The funding round originally closed in April of this year.</p>
<p>“A few years ago, we bought a flat in London with a tiny little garden. We were both working full time in quite intense jobs with young kids. I went online assuming that I would be able to sort out this garden space. And I didn’t know a lot about gardening. And I just didn’t find anything that spoke to me as a new gardener. It felt like what was available was more for more knowledgeable people,” co-founder and CEO Anni Noel-Johnson told me.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>If you’ve ever tried to search for gardening videos on YouTube, you may have end up on long-winded videos with instructions that don’t make any sense to you. Similarly, there are not a lot of e-commerce websites focused on gardening specifically.</p>
<p>And yet, the market opportunity is quite big. There are millions of gardeners in the U.K. There are also quite a few independent garden centers, nurseries and shops with a turnover of several millions of pounds per year. More importantly, they generate the vast majority of their sales in store. Some of them have never sold anything online.</p>
<p>Sproutl is teaming up with those businesses so that they can find new customers across the U.K. Those third-party sellers list their items on Sproutl while the startup takes care of logistics, packaging sourcing and delivery.</p>
<p>On the marketplace, customers can buy indoor and outdoor plants, pots, gardening essentials and outdoor living products. Partners currently include Rosebourne, Polhill, Millbrook, Middleton, Bellr, Fertile Fibre and Horticus.</p>
<p>Anni Noel-Johnson, the CEO of the company, was the VP of Trading and Strategy at Farfetch. Sproutl CTO Andy Done also worked at Farfetch at some point as Director of Data Engineering.</p>
<p>Hollie Newton is also going to be a key team member at Sproutl. She previously wrote a best-selling gardening book called ‘How to Grow’. She’s now the Chief Creative Officer at Sproutl.</p>
<p>This is key to understanding Sproutl’s growth strategy. The company plans to provide a ton of content on all things related to your garden — the startup has already released a <a href="https://www.sproutl.com/about/jargon-buster">jargon buster</a>. You might end up on Sproutl the next time you’re looking for gardening advice on Google.</p>
<p>And it’s also going to differentiate the platform from all-encompassing e-commerce platforms, such as Amazon. Other e-commerce companies focused on one vertical in particular, such as <a href="https://www.manomano.fr">ManoMano</a>, have been quite successful. With the right focus, Sproutl could quickly build a loyal customer base as well.</p>

</div><p id="speakable-summary">China’s e-commerce and industrial ecosystem is as different from the Western world as its culture. The country took decades to earn its reputation as the Factory of the World, but it now boasts a supply chain and manufacturing ability that few countries can match.</p>
<p>Creative use of the country’s networked manufacturing and logistics hubs make mass production both cheap and easy. Clothing, electronics, toys, automobiles, musical instruments, furniture — you name it and you’ll find a manufacturer in China who can turn your intangible concept into mass-manufacturable reality in mere days. And they’ll do it for cheaper than anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">

	</div>
	</p>
<p>China is also home to one of the world’s largest e-commerce and tech ecosystems. Hundreds of startups dot the landscape, and the amount of money being raised and spent on innovating around the country’s industrial heft is mind-boggling.</p>
<p>So it was just a matter of time until an intrepid Chinese entrepreneur with a tech background decided to take on Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. The tech revolution hasn’t yet affected the bottled beverage industry quite as much as it has others. Incumbent giants therefore could lose a sizable chunk of market share if a company could just manage to weave together China’s manufacturing proficiency and agility with the modern tech startup philosophy of “moving fast and breaking stuff.”</p>
<p>Genki Forest, a Chinese direct-to-consumer (D2C) bottled beverage startup, is one such contender. A philosophy centered around iteration informed by data, quick turnarounds and a laser focus on taking advantage of China’s huge e-commerce ecosystem has helped this company’s revenues rise rapidly since it started five years ago. Its sugar-free sodas, milk teas and energy drinks sell in 40 countries and <a href="https://www.36kr.com/p/1158922828825991">generated revenue of about $450 million</a> in 2020. The company aims to reach <a href="https://www.caixin.com/2021-04-09/101687956.html">$1.2 billion</a> this year.</p>
<p>If anything, Genki Forest’s valuation has shot up even faster. It recently completed its fourth VC round that values it at a whopping <a href="https://www.cathaycapital.com/press-room/cathay-capital-backed-sugar-free-beverage-leader-genki-forest-completes-a-new-round-of-financing-valuing-the-company-at-6-billion/">$6 billion</a>, triple the price it fetched a year earlier, and it has so far raised at least half a billion dollars.</p>
<p>It’s striking how closely Genki Forest’s operations resemble that of a tech startup. So we thought we should take a closer look and see what this company’s graph can tell us about the new wave of Chinese D2C entrepreneurship looking to take over the globe.</p>
<h2>Finding a bigger wave to ride</h2>
<p>The bottled beverage industry wasn’t what Genki Forest’s founder, Binsen Tang, initially set out to tackle. His first startup was a successful casual, mostly mobile gaming outfit known as ELEX Technology. It was nowhere near record-breaking, though — some 50 million users logged on to a few popular games in over 40 countries worldwide, including one of the first versions of Happy Farm, a predecessor to Zynga’s Farmville. But Tang wasn’t satisfied and eventually sold ELEX Technology to a publicly listed company for about $400 million in 2014.</p>
<p>Tang would walk away with a few important lessons. He’d learned by now that Chinese products were already competitive globally, whether people realized it or not, and that and geographic arbitrage was real, Happy Farm being the perfect example of this. Lastly, he now knew that it was far more important to choose the right “racetrack” (as Chinese investors and entrepreneurs like to put it) than to have a great product.</p>
<p>Picking the right race to win was perhaps the most important takeaway. It’s also an idea that sets Chinese entrepreneurs apart from their Western counterparts — the most worthwhile endeavors are in identifying the largest and most rewarding market at hand, regardless of one’s previous expertise. It was what led Zhang Yiming to create ByteDance, and Lei Jun to found Xiaomi.</p>
<p>That very philosophy led Tang to build Genki Forest. After selling ELEX Technology, Tang didn’t go back to the business that netted him his first pot of gold. As much as he had benefited from the rise of the mobile internet, he thought there was a far bigger opportunity building a consumer brand and applying the lessons he learned from programming to the manufacture of tangible products.</p>
<p>He soon set up his own investment fund, <a href="http://www.challenjers.com/">Challenjers Capital</a>, convinced that the next big tech opportunity in China was in tech’s application to everyday consumer products. He soon began to invest in everything from ramen and hotpots to bottled beverages.</p>
<p>China’s quickly expanding e-commerce ecosystem and the plethora of D2C businesses flourishing on Alibaba and JD.com would also influence his decision to sell directly to his target audience rather than take the traditional route. But to truly understand his motivations, we need to take a look at the extremely unique D2C environment in China and how it has changed over the years.</p>
<h2>What’s different about Chinese D2C?</h2>
<p>“China doesn’t need any more good platforms,” Tang <a href="https://finance.sina.com.cn/chanjing/gsnews/2021-06-16/doc-ikqciyzi9979513.shtml">told his team</a> in an internal email in 2015, “but it does need good products.” Tang was talking about how the age of building infrastructure for e-commerce in China was largely over; it was now time to create brands that could take advantage of the advanced distribution network that had been laid out.</p>
<p>Other investors noticed as well. Albus Yu, principal at China Growth Capital, told me that his fund had stopped making investments in independent consumer-facing platforms or marketplaces for a while. “2014 might have been the last year it was economically feasible to start such a business due to the soaring cost of acquiring customers and the strength of incumbents,” he said.</p>
<p>Indeed, 2015 was the year when CACs began to exceed or at least <a href="https://jingdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/WeChat-e-Commerce-What-You-Need-To-Know-Before-2019.pdf">rival ARPUs</a> for Alibaba and JD.com.</p>
<p>In China, that distribution network was present across the digital and physical worlds. Online, there was immense market power concentrated in the hands of just two players: Alibaba and JD.com, which used to have, and still maintain, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/e-commerce-businesses-benefit-as-traditional-retails-straggle-301116870.html">80% or above</a> in market share.</p>
<p>In fact, the dominance of Alibaba, in particular, was so overwhelming that for years, VCs invested not in D2C, but in “Taobao brands,” since that was the only channel one needed to conquer in order to make it.</p>
<p>Customer acquisition was therefore straightforward — throw everything into advertising on Alibaba’s Tmall platform, especially during its annual flagship shopping festival, Singles’ Day. Even today, garnering a top spot in one of the category leaderboards remains a surefire way to build brand awareness, investor interest, as well as sales records.</p>
<p>Physically, the Chinese market also differs greatly from much of the developed West. Years of heavy investment in logistics by the private sector, accelerated by government support and infrastructure buildout, means that delivery costs have come down significantly over the years, even dipping below <a href="http://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/csj/2021-03-05/doc-ikftssaq1399855.shtml">$0.40 per package</a> wholesale as of this year. Innovations such as <a href="https://www.oliverwyman.com/content/dam/oliver-wyman/global/en/2016/oct/OliverWyman_ChinaInsuretech.pdf">return insurance</a> have also sped up customer adoption.</p>
<p>By 2016, China was shipping <a href="http://jiangsu.china.com.cn/html/2017/hbnews_0105/8838939.html">30 billion packages a year</a>, already accounting for 44% of global shipments. That number has been doubling every three years and is expected to exceed 100 billion this year. And the low cost of delivery is one of the biggest reasons for China’s outsized e-commerce market — the largest globally and estimated to reach <a href="https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/global-ecommerce-statistics">$2.8 trillion</a> in 2021, more than triple that of the No. 2, the U.S.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2181659" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2181659" loading="lazy" class="breakout size-full wp-image-2181659" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GettyImages-1249019288.jpg" alt="Express parcels sit stacked at a logistic base of e-commerce giant Suning before the 618 Shopping Festival" width="1024" height="651" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GettyImages-1249019288.jpg 1024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GettyImages-1249019288.jpg?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GettyImages-1249019288.jpg?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GettyImages-1249019288.jpg?resize=768,488 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GettyImages-1249019288.jpg?resize=680,432 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GettyImages-1249019288.jpg?resize=50,32 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2181659" class="wp-caption-text">Express parcels sit stacked at a logistic base of e-commerce giant Suning before the 618 Shopping Festival. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> VCG</p></div></p>
<p>Present-day China also presents another edge: Proximity to an advanced, flexible manufacturing network and supply chain for the vast majority of consumer products, and the ability to outsource almost everything to them.</p>
<p>The original equipment manufacturers of years past have long since evolved into original design manufacturers. An expected consequence of being “the Factory of the World” for so many years, making goods for some of the best brands in the world, is that some of the knowledge was bound to transfer.</p>
<p>It may be difficult for outsiders to understand just how strong China’s networked manufacturing hubs are these days. What used to take weeks now takes mere days, the lead times shortened drastically by software, robots and other advancements. For example, Chinese cross-border ultra-fast-fashion company Shein has compressed design-to-ship timelines to as little as <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/383682221">seven days</a>.</p>
<p>And it’s definitely not just for making crop tops. The turnaround can be astonishingly fast even when manufacturing completely unfamiliar goods, such as when electric vehicle maker BYD turned its factory into the world’s largest face mask plant in just two weeks when the COVID-19 pandemic struck <a href="https://en.byd.com/news-posts/byd-opens-worlds-largest-face-mask-manufacturing-plant/#:~:text=Today%2C%20BYD%20is%20proud%20to,bottles%20of%20disinfectants%20per%20day.">last year</a>.</p>
<p>Companies leverage this manufacturing flexibility and agility for more than just speed. Chinese cosmetics upstart Perfect Diary uses it to launch <a href="https://www.techbuzzchina.com/episodes/episode-79-perfect-diary-yatsen-group-cosmetics-ecommerce-superstar-and-chinas-loreal-for-the-digital-age">twice as many SKUs</a> as foreign competitors. In addition, the quick turnaround allows agile brands to take advantage of that most ephemeral of IP, <em>memes</em>.</p>
<p>It’s not to say that the Chinese supply chain is inaccessible to foreign entrepreneurs. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-selling-mattress-low-price-2018-10">Best-selling</a> mattress maker Zinus, for example, is founded by a South Korean, but its products are manufactured <a href="https://support.zinus.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000223612-Where-are-Zinus-products-manufactured-">in China</a> and sold mostly on Amazon to U.S. customers.</p>
<p>It’s just that very few non-Chinese companies have figured out how to tap <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3138201/made-china-not-china-how-mysterious-fashion-retailer-has-emerged-take">as deeply</a> into the supply chain as this new crop of Chinese D2C brands, which can require years of working not just alongside but physically inside the factories, building trust and know-how. Shein, for example, watches carefully what other brands are making by staying close to the factories.</p>
<h2>The China opportunity</h2>
<p>Before global sensations such as TikTok weakened the mantra, “copy to China” used to be a dominant characterization of Chinese startups. In December 2015, when Tang registered the Genki Forest trademark, that was still very much a relevant strategy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">As college students at Berkeley, Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis created a successful open-source graphics program, GIMP, which got the attention of Google. The duo ultimately joined Google, and even personally got kudos from Sergey Brin and Larry Page. Kimball and Mattis quickly rose to prominence within the company, and then chose to leave it all behind to start what would eventually become CockroachDB. Years later, Cockroach Labs has over 250 employees and has received investments from the likes of Benchmark, GV, Index Ventures and Redpoint totaling more than $350 million, according to Crunchbase. The company is now on route to what some think is an “inevitable IPO.”</p>
<p>The story of CockroachDB, from its origin to its future, was told in a four-part series <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/15/cockroachdb-ec1/">in our latest EC-1: </a></p>

<p>This week on Equity, Alex and I interviewed Eliot Brown, who wrote &#8220;The Cult of We&#8221; along with Maureen Farrell. Our conversation riffed on some of the book’s eyebrow-raising details and anecdotes, but mainly focused on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/how-weworks-adam-neumann-made-a-pigeon-look-like-a-swan/"><strong>what </strong>WeWork’s rise and fall did to the state of startups and tech journalism more broadly.</a></p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>Not much has changed. Jokes aside, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/how-weworks-adam-neumann-made-a-pigeon-look-like-a-swan/">Brown shared his notes</a> on how the current boom in startup financings has a worrisome air of frenzy and fluff. He also chatted about how sometimes the most illuminating question can be a simple one: What makes you a tech company?</p>

<h2>TikTok what again?</h2>
<p><div id="attachment_2052047" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2052047" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2052047" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tiktok-glitch1.jpg" alt="tiktok glitch" width="1024" height="575" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tiktok-glitch1.jpg 1600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tiktok-glitch1.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tiktok-glitch1.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tiktok-glitch1.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tiktok-glitch1.jpg?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tiktok-glitch1.jpg?resize=1536,863 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tiktok-glitch1.jpg?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2052047" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> TechCrunch</p></div></p>
<p>TikTok kept popping up throughout the week. Index Ventures, for example, noted how the firm’s TikTok account has amassed an impressive following and is a channel to talk to the younger generations. Nothing like some short-form videos to stay hip and relatable while<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/index-ventures-trio-of-new-funds-leads-to-3-billion-and-more-tiktok/"> raising $3 billion in one go. </a></p>
<p><strong>Here’s what to know: </strong>While TikTok has certainly changed the world, I worry when I see the allure of bite-sized content get edtech’d. Bite-sized content can be a nifty way to spread content, but it isn&#8217;t one-size-fits-all. Duolingo, which priced its IPO this week, still struggles to show meaningful learning outcomes and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/duolingos-bellwether-ipo/">optimizes more for motivation than comprehension. </a>This tension is a key note for companies like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/numerade-lands-100m-valuation-for-short-form-stem-videos/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Numerade</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/sololearn-raises-24m-for-its-bite-sized-duolingo-like-mobile-first-coding-education-app/">Sololearn</a>, which both raised this week, to not overly TikTok learning materials.</p>

<p>It’s been awhile since I’ve used that acronym in Startups Weekly. That said, special purpose acquisition vehicles are still very much a thing and are still very much worth paying attention to.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter for your weekend enjoyment.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>Welcome back to The TechCrunch Exchange, a weekly startups-and-markets newsletter. It’s inspired by what the weekday </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/"><em>Exchange column</em></a><em> digs into, but free, and made for your weekend reading. </em><em>Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/newsletters"><em>here</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<p>Hello everyone, I hope you had a lovely week. I turned 32 after experiencing sleep-destroying heartburn. So, a little good and a little bad. But that didn’t stop the markets. Nope. Not a bit. Which means we have a lot to talk about, including falling insurtech stocks and what the situation might mean for startups, and a raft of IPOs. This will be fun!</p>
<p>Before we get into the nitty-gritty of our chats with newly public companies Kaltura, Couchbase and Enovix, let’s talk insurtech.</p>
<p>In the last year or so we’ve seen a number of insurtech startups go public, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/3-lessons-from-roots-ipo-pricing/">including Root</a> (auto insurance), <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/03/as-metromile-looks-to-go-public-insurtech-funding-is-on-the-rise/">Metromile</a> (car insurance), and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/02/lemonade-and-accolade-open-sharply-higher-as-public-markets-rally/">Lemonade</a> (rental insurance). Here’s a quick digest of how their performance looks today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Root: $7.72 per share, 71.4% down from its $27 per share IPO price.</li>
<li>Metromile: $7.26 per share, down 64.4% from its post-combination highs.</li>
<li>Lemonade: $86.97 per share, up 199.9% from its IPO price of $29 per share.</li>
</ul>
<p>Recall that Root and Metromile began to trade after Lemonade, so their declines are not over a longer time horizon, but a shorter interval. Which makes the situation all the more interesting.</p>
<p>What’s going on? Well, two of the three insurtech public offerings (SPACs, IPOs, etc.) are sharply underwater. That doesn’t bode incredibly well for Hippo, which is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/05/the-technology-selloff-is-getting-to-be-somewhat-material/">pursuing its own SPAC-led combination</a> that should be wrapping up in short order. The huge declines don’t seem bullish for insurtech startups, who will have to answer private-market investor doubts concerning their value.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;China&#8217;s expected edtech clampdown may chill a key startup sector&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/embed/#?secret=QPYXmW8or5" data-secret="QPYXmW8or5" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>Does Lemonade’s strong post-IPO performance allay concerns? It’s tricky. The company has been busy expanding into new markets, including auto insurance. The company did take a somewhat material hit from the Texas freeze earlier this year &#8212; <a href="https://s24.q4cdn.com/139015699/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Q1-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">per its most recent earnings report</a> &#8212; but past those two data points it’s not entirely clear what the company is doing that the other two are not. But investors are stoked about Lemonade, and not Root and Metromile. Figuring out why that’s the case, and why their startup is more Lemonade than the other two, is going to be key for the many insurtech startups still scaling toward their own IPOs.</p>
<h2>It’s IPO season</h2>
<p>The Exchange has been busy on the phones these last two weeks, talking to CEOs of companies going public to try and learn from their recent experiences. So, what follows are notes from calls with folks at Kaltura, Couchbase and Enovix. Enjoy!</p>
<h3>Kaltura</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reminder: Online-video-focused Kaltura <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/kaltura-files-to-go-public-on-the-back-of-accelerating-revenue-growth-rising-losses/">filed to go public earlier</a> this year before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/01/kaltura-puts-debut-on-hold-is-the-tech-ipo-window-closing/">delaying its IPO</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/q3-ipo-cycle-starts-strong-with-couchbase-pricing-and-kaltura-relisting/">taking another run at the funding event.</a></li>
<li>The Exchange spoke with Kaltura CEO Ron Yekutiel, who said that the company’s IPO’s timing was impacted by the early-2021 public market turmoil. That was not a surprise, but it was good to get confirmation regardless.</li>
<li>That freeze was partially caused by the Archegos implosion, per Yekutiel. That makes sense, but was news to us.</li>
<li>Yekutiel said that his company wasn’t thrilled about the delay &#8212; going public is the only fundraise that you pre-announce, he noted &#8212; but added that investors his company had already spoken to the first-time around were still enthused about Kaltura on its second run at an IPO.</li>
<li>Per the CEO, Kaltura’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/12/q3-ipo-cycle-starts-strong-with-couchbase-pricing-and-kaltura-relisting/">preliminary Q2 results</a> showed investors that what it was talking about earlier in the year was coming true. He also stressed uptake in new products as key to the company’s continued growth.</li>
<li>The CEO was happy with how his company priced and traded during its first day, snagging a flat 20% uptick in value upon trading. He noted that more would have been excessive, and less would have been un-good.</li>
<li>Regarding the lower valuation that Kaltura priced at compared to its March-era IPO price range, Yekutiel said that you don’t get a third chance to make a first impression and that his company wanted to get the offering done. So they did. Points for not getting lost in their own head.</li>
<li>Kaltura is up 17.5% from its $10 per-share IPO price as of the time of writing.</li>
</ul>
<p>One anecdote, if I may. Kaltura won an early TechCrunch40 &#8212; the precursor to the TechCrunch50 event, itself a predecessor to today’s TechCrunch Disrupt conference series &#8212; thanks to a single vote cast via physical token. Yekutiel still has that token, and showed it to us during our chat. Neat!</p>
<h3>Couchbase</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Exchange spoke with noSQL database company Couchbase’s CEO Matt Cain. Couchbase priced at $24 per share, above its $20 to $23 per-share IPO price range.</li>
<li>Today it’s worth $33.20, rising 9.2% in today’s trading as of the time of writing.</li>
<li>Cain was talking from a pretty strict script &#8212; a pretty standard situation amongst newly public CEOs worried about fucking up and going to jail &#8212; so we didn’t get the precise answers we were looking for. But we still managed to learn a few things, including that Couchbase was yet another company that found the meeting density made possible by remote roadshows to be accretive.</li>
<li>The CEO was focused on discussing the scale of the opportunity ahead of Couchbase, namely the world of operational databases. It’s hard to find a bigger market, he argued, which made investors excited about what his company might be able to accomplish. Our read here is that there’s probably plenty of surface area for startups in the database world, if the market is as big as Cain reckons it is.</li>
<li>We wanted to learn a bit more about how public-market investors view open-source powered companies, but didn’t get too much from him on the matter. Still, the company’s IPO is a pretty damn strong one, implying that being OSS-built isn’t exactly a detriment to a company hoping to exit.</li>
</ul>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="cAa2PHDexw"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/26/2170552/">Everyone wants to invest in open-source startups now</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Everyone wants to invest in open-source startups now&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/26/2170552/embed/#?secret=cAa2PHDexw" data-secret="cAa2PHDexw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<h3>Enovix</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Exchange wanted to chat with newly public company Enovix because it debuted via a SPAC. Why does that matter? Because there are other battery-focused companies looking to go public via SPACs. So, the chat was good background for later work.</li>
<li>And we love talking to public companies. Who doesn’t?</li>
<li>Asked if combination-and-trade-under-new-ticker-symbol day was like an IPO to his firm, Rust said that it was. Fair enough.</li>
<li>The company’s combination date for its SPAC slipped from Q2 to Q3, we noticed. Why was that? Some SEC changes regarding accounting, in short. Not a big deal was our impression from the chat, but one that did cause a slight delay to Enovix’s trading date.</li>
<li>Why go public via a SPAC? Cash, but also the particular sponsor of their combination, which Rust said was a key resource in terms of operational knowledge. The company has also hired from its SPAC sponsor’s network, which felt notable. (Hey look, actual investor value-add!)</li>
<li>Asked why his company is worth less than the <a href="https://www.autonews.com/suppliers/battery-supplier-ses-takes-spac-path-capital-deal-values-company-36b">impending SES SPAC</a>, another battery company that has yet to generate revenue, Rust said that the value of his company in its SPAC deal was a negotiation, and that if the company is successful, whether it was valued at $1.1 billion or $1.4 billion wouldn’t really matter.</li>
<li>What’s fun about Enovix is that it is not starting with its impending battery tech aimed at EVs. Instead, it’s targeting high-end electronics. Why? Quick cycles to get batteries into hardware and possible pricing power. It does intend to get into EVs in time, however.</li>
<li>The company is worth $17.33 per share, giving it what Yahoo Finance describes as a $2.5 billion valuation. That’s a good markup from what it expected and could bode well for SES’s own, future debut.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yo, that was a <em>lot</em>. Thanks for sticking with me. And thanks for reading The Exchange’s little newsletter. You can catch up <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/the-exchange/">on all our work here</a> if you want some long-form reads on the global venture capital market, edtech and other topics. Stay cool!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Hello and welcome back to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/china-roundup/">TechCrunch’s China Roundup</a>, a digest of recent events shaping the Chinese tech landscape and what they mean to people in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Despite the geopolitical headwinds for foreign tech firms to enter China, many companies, especially those that find a dependable partner, are still forging ahead. For this week&#8217;s roundup, I&#8217;m including a conversation I had with <a href="https://www.prophesee.ai/">Prophesee</a>, a French vision technology startup, which recently got funding from Kai-Fu Lee and Xiaomi, along with the usual news digest.</p>
<h2>Spotting opportunities in China</h2>
<p>Like many companies working on futuristic, cutting-edge tech in Europe, Prophesee was a spinout from university research labs. Previously, I covered two such companies from Sweden: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/26/imint-vidhance-profile/">Imint</a>, which improves smartphone video production through deep learning, and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/dirac-profile/">Dirac</a>, an expert in sound optimization.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The three companies have two things in common: They are all in niche fields, and they have all found eager customers in China.</p>
<p>For Prophesee, they are production lines, automakers and smartphone companies in China looking for breakthroughs in perception technology, which will in turn improve how their robots respond to the environment. So it&#8217;s unsurprising that Xiaomi and Chinese chip-focused investment firm Inno-Chip backed Prophesee in its latest funding round, which was led by Sinovation Venture.</p>
<p>The funding size was undisclosed but TechCrunch learned it was in the range of &#8220;tens of million USD.&#8221; It was also the first investment that Kai-Fu Lee has made through Sinovation in Europe. As Prophesee CEO Luca Verre recalled:</p>
<blockquote><p>I met Dr. Kai-Fu Lee three years ago during the World Economic Forum … and when I pitched to him about Prophesee, he got very intrigued. And then over the past three years, actually, we kept in touch and last year, given the growing traction we were having in China, particularly in the mobile and IoT industry, he decided to jump in. He said okay, it is now the right timing Prophesee becomes big.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Paris-based company wasn&#8217;t actively seeking funding, but it believed having Chinese strategic investors could help it gain greater access to the complex market.</p>
<p>Rather than sending information collected by sensors and cameras to computing platforms, Prophesee fits that process inside a chip (fabricated by Sony) that mimics the human eyes, a technology that is built upon neuromorphic engineering.</p>
<p>The old method snaps a collection of fixed images so when information grows in volume, a tremendous amount of computing power is needed. In contrast, Prophesee&#8217;s sensors, which it describes as &#8220;event-based,&#8221; only pick up changes in the environment just as the photoreceptors in our eyes and can process information continuously and quickly.</p>
<p>Europe has been pioneering neuromorphic computing, but in recent years, Verre saw a surge in research coming from Chinese universities and tech firms, which reaffirmed his confidence in the market&#8217;s appetite.</p>
<blockquote><p>We see Chinese OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), particularly Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo pushing the standard of quality of image quality to very, very high … They are very eager to adopt new technology to further differentiate in a way which is faster and more aggressive than Apple. Apple is a company with an attitude which to me looks more similar to Huawei. So maybe for some technology, it takes more time to see the technology mature and adopt, which is right very often but later. So I&#8217;m sure that Apple will come at certain point with some products integrating event-based technology. In fact, we see them moving. We see them filing patents in the space. I&#8217;m sure that will come, but maybe not the first.</p></blockquote>
<p>Though China is striving for technological independence, Verre believed Prophesee&#8217;s addressable market is large enough &#8212; $20 billion by his estimate. Nonetheless, he admitted he&#8217;d be &#8220;naive to believe Prophesee will be the only one to capture&#8221; this opportunity.</p>
<h2>WeRide bought a truck company</h2>
<p>One of China&#8217;s<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/22/weride-310-million-series-c/"> most valuable robotaxi startups</a> has just acquired an autonomous trucking company called MoonX. The size of the deal is undisclosed, but we know that MoonX raised &#8220;tens of millions RMB&#8221; 15 months ago in a Series A round.</p>
<p>While WeRide is focused on Level 4 self-driving technology, it is also finding new monetization avenues before its robotaxis can chauffeur people at scale. It&#8217;s done so by <a href="https://www.weride.ai/en/mini-robobus-en/">developing minibusses</a>, and the MoonX acqui-hire, which brings the company&#8217;s founder and over 50 engineers to WeRide, will likely help diversify its revenue pool.</p>
<p>WeRide and MoonX have deep-rooted relationships. Their respective founders, Tony Han and Yang Qingxiong, worked side by side at Jingchi, which was later rebranded to WeRide. Han co-founded Jingchi and<a href="https://www.qimingventures.com/en/node/2889"> took the helm as CEO </a>in March 2018 while Yang was assigned vice president of engineering. But Yang soon quit and started MoonX.</p>
<p>Han, a Baidu veteran, gave Yang a warm homecoming and put him in charge of the firm&#8217;s research institute and its new office in Shenzhen, home to MoonX. WeRide&#8217;s sprawling headquarters is just about an hour&#8217;s drive away in the adjacent city of Guangzhou.</p>
<h2>AI surveillance giant Cloudwalk nears IPO</h2>
<p>Cloudwalk belongs to a cohort of Chinese unicorns that flourished through the second half of the 2010s by selling computer vision technology to government agencies across China. Together, Cloudwalk and its rivals SenseTime, Megvii and Yitu were dubbed the &#8220;four AI dragons&#8221; for their fast ascending valuations and handsome funding rounds.</p>
<p>Of course, the term &#8220;AI dragon&#8221; is now a misnomer as AI application becomes so pervasive across industries. Investors soon realized these upstarts need to diversify revenue streams beyond smart city contracts, and they&#8217;ve been waiting anxiously for exits. Finally, here comes Cloudwalk, which will likely be the first in its cohort to go public.</p>
<p>Cloudwalk&#8217;s application to raise 3.75 billion yuan ($580 million) from an IPO on the Shanghai STAR board was approved this week, though it can still be months before it starts trading. The firm&#8217;s <a href="http://zqpdf.stcn.com/kcb/2020-12-03/sbg/7006bc6a4db241968762f823b292d0ca.pdf">financials</a> don&#8217;t look particularly rosy for investors, with net loss amounting to 720 million yuan in 2020.</p>
<h2>Also in the news</h2>
<ul>
<li>Speaking of the torrent of news in autonomous driving, vehicle vision provider <a href="https://www.calmcar.com/about.html">CalmCar</a> said this week that it <strong>has </strong><a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/uRh3WkllEPrI8hOGSrYowg">raised $150 million</a> <strong>in a Series C round. </strong>Founded by several overseas Chinese returnees in 2016, CalmCar uses deep learning to develop ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) used in automotive, industrial and surveillance scenarios. German auto parts maker ZF led the round.</li>
<li>Baby clothes direct-to-consumer brand <strong style="font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">PatPat said it has raised $510 million from Series C and D rounds. </strong>The D2C ecosystem leveraging China&#8217;s robust supply chains is increasingly gaining interest from venture capitalists. Brands like Shein, PatPat, Cider and Outer have all secured fundings from established VCs. Founded by three Carnegie Mellon grads, PatPat counts IDG Capital, General Atlantic, DST Global, GGV Capital, SIG China and Sequoia China among its investors.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Welcome back to This Week in Apps, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/this-week-in-apps/">the weekly TechCrunch series</a> that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.</p>
<p>The app industry continues to grow, with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a record</a> 218 billion downloads and $143 billion in global consumer spend in 2020. Consumers last year also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">spent</a> 3.5 trillion minutes using apps on Android devices alone. And in the U.S., app usage surged ahead of the time spent watching live TV. Currently, the average American <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">watches</a> 3.7 hours of live TV per day, but now spends four hours per day on their mobile devices.</p>
<p>Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours — they’re also a big business. In 2019, mobile-first companies had a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/15/app-stores-saw-record-204-billion-app-downloads-in-2019-consumer-spend-of-120-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined</a> $544 billion valuation, 6.5x higher than those without a mobile focus. In 2020, investors <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/13/app-stores-saw-record-218-billion-downloads-in-2020-consumer-spend-of-143-billion/">poured</a> $73 billion in capital into mobile companies — a figure that’s up 27% year-over-year</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps and games to try, too.</p>
<p><em><strong>This Week in Apps will finally be a newsletter! It will launch on August 7. Sign up here: <a href="http://techcrunch.com/newsletters">techcrunch.com/newsletters</a></strong></em></p>
<p><em>This Week in Apps took a little vacation this month, so we&#8217;re back this week with a big round-up of all the news we missed &#8212; and then some. And a super-sized section of apps getting funded, too! Let&#8217;s play some catch-up&#8230;</em></p>
<h1>Weekly News</h1>
<h3>Platforms: Apple</h3>
<p><strong>ATT isn&#8217;t killing mobile game performance.</strong> An <a href="https://blog.apptopia.com/app-tracking-transparency-ios-doesnt-impact-mobile-game-performance">Apptopia report found</a> that Apple&#8217;s launch of App Tracking Transparency has so far had no clear impact on mobile game download performance or monetization performance. The firm says this could be the result of any number of factors, including publishers using fingerprinting techniques (despite not being permitted), increased ad budgets on large networks like Facebook, increased spend on user acquisition, use of IDFV (vendor identifier) by larger publishers or higher than expected opt-in rates than was predicted.</p>

<p><strong>iOS 14.7 <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/19/ios-14-7-why-you-should-update">launched</a></strong>, adding support for Apple Card Family with combined credit limits, a Home app with support for multiple timers on HomePod, support for the MagSafe Battery Pack, Podcast app enhancements and more. iPadOS 14.7 also <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/21/apple-releases-ipados-14-7-to-the-public-with-home-app-upgrades-and-more">became available</a>, offering bug fixes, security updates, as well as the same Apple Card Family and HomePod support.</p>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, the iOS 15 beta 3</strong> <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/14/ios-15-and-watchos-8-beta-3-allow-you-to-install-system-updates-with-less-available-storage/">added the ability to update</a> your device using Software Update even if less than 500 MB of storage is available. This could be a big deal for getting users onto the most recent version of iOS, which has in the past been more difficult when users&#8217; phone storage is nearly full.</p>
<p><strong>Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=2bbbudbw">added the ability</a> to assign tax categories</strong> to apps and in-app purchases on App Store Connect. The categories are based on the app&#8217;s content &#8212; like videos, books, news, etc. &#8212; and allow Apple to administer taxes at the specific rates that apply to that type of application or purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/ultrawide-band-availability-expands">expanded</a> Ultra Wideband functionality in the Apple Watch Series 6, iPhone 11 and 12 to more countries,</strong> including Argentina, Pakistan, Paraguay and the Solomon Islands. Some countries don&#8217;t allow the technology still, and it must be disabled, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Nepal, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.</p>
<p><strong>Apple <a href="https://www.imore.com/apple-calls-judge-consider-ftc-vs-facebook-epic-games-decision">asked</a> Judge Gonzalez Rogers to consider three other antitrust cases</strong> that have since been decided since the start of Epic Games&#8217; antitrust lawsuit, which is now being deliberated. The cases include a recent decision by the courts to throw out the FTC lawsuit against Facebook.</p>
<h3>Platforms: Google</h3>
<p><strong>Android beta 3 came out. </strong>The <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/release-notes">new release</a> dropped a month after beta 2, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/14/android-12-beta-3-hands-on-top-new-features-video/">and includes features like</a> scrolling screenshots, face detect auto-rotate, more Material You theme options and new icons, the ability to disable Assistant corner swipe activation, tweaks to features like one-handed mode and internet toggles and changes to the camera, Chrome, toggles, launcher and more.</p>
<p><strong>Android phones&#8217; backup system <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/21/backup-by-google-one-android/">was upgraded </a>to &#8220;Backup by Google One,&#8221;</strong> an improvement that now backs up photos, videos and MMS messages with more granular control, in addition to the app data, SMS messages, call logs and device preferences the old system covered.</p>
<p><strong>Google won&#8217;t enforce the original September 30, 2021 deadline that would have required all Play Store apps to switch over to the Play Billing IAP system.</strong> The company will now allow developers <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/07/apply-more-time-play-payments-policy.html">to request an extension</a> for adopting the new policy, in the wake of the big antitrust <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/07/36-states-dc-sue-google-for-alleged-antitrust-violations-in-its-android-app-store-498622">lawsuit</a> filed by AGs across 36 U.S. states and D.C.</p>
<p><strong>Epic Games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22583467/epic-fortnite-google-play-store-lawsuit-amended-complaint-filed">filed an update in its antitrust lawsuit</a> against Google over its Play Store policies</strong>, but most of the information it contains has been redacted. From the visible tidbits, Epic discusses Google&#8217;s relationship with Apple and its agreement to pay between $8 and $12 billion to be the default search provider; as well as Epic&#8217;s plans to launch Fortnite on the Samsung Galaxy Store.</p>
<p><strong>Verizon joined AT&amp;T and T-Mobile in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584443/verizon-android-messages-rcs?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">preloading the Android Message app</a> as the default texting app</strong> on all Android phones it sells, meaning that now all three major U.S. carriers support RCS &#8212; the next-gen standard to replace SMS &#8212; as the default Android experience.</p>
<h3>E-commerce</h3>
<p><strong>Amazon got the recently launched app <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580611/fakespot-ios-app-apple-amazon-fake-reviews">Fakespot pulled from the App Store</a>.</strong> An extension of the fake review-spotting website, Fakespot app was taken down because it was wrapping the Amazon website without permission, which Amazon successfully argued could be exploited to steal customer data. Amazon also said Fakespot injected code into its website, which opened up an attack vector. Apple said it gave Fakespot time to correct its issues before the takedown.</p>
<h3>Augmented Reality</h3>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Snap called out its AR advances during its Q2 earnings where the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/snap-had-its-best-quarter-in-four-years/">posted</a> <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/snap-q2-2021-earnings-1235025874/">record</a> revenue and the largest user growth in four years</strong>. The company&#8217;s Cartoon 3D Style Lens went viral in the quarter on other social networks, including TikTok, generating <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/snap-q2-2021-earnings-1235025874/">2.8 billion impressions</a> on Snapchat alone. Snap also partnered with Disney on location-based Lenses for Walt Disney World&#8217;s 50th anniversary. The company is now working on shopping features that could potentially allow users to try on clothes using AR.</p>

<h3>Fintech</h3>
<p><strong>Popular investment app Robinhood is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/robinhood-targets-ipo-valuation-up-to-35b-amid-warning-that-crypto-incomes-are-slipping">targeting</a> its IPO valuation up to $35 billion</strong> in a filing released on the 19th. The company first <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/how-robinhoods-explosive-growth-rate-came-to-be/">filed</a> to go public in early July after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/01/robinhoods-long-weekend-brings-a-total-of-3-4-billion-to-its-balance-sheet/">raising</a> billions earlier in the year. The fintech giant expects to debut between $38 and $42 per share.</p>
<p><strong>Fintech giant Revolut <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/20/revolut-launches-travel-booking-feature-stays.html">launched</a> a travel booking feature called Stays,</strong> which allows users to book hotels and other accommodations in its app, in a move to become more of a &#8220;super app&#8221; that offers multiple services through one interface.</p>
<p><strong>Venmo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/20/venmo-removes-its-global-public-feed-in-a-significant-app-redesign">removed the app&#8217;s global, public feed</a> as part of its major redesign.</strong> The public feed put user privacy at risk, and follows a number of complaints about Venmo&#8217;s oversharing throughout the years. Recently, Venmo&#8217;s privacy leaks led BuzzFeed News to uncover President Biden&#8217;s Venmo account.</p>
<p><strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/2728.png" alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said bitcoin will be a &#8220;big part&#8221; of Twitter&#8217;s future.</strong> On the company&#8217;s earnings call, the exec spoke for the first time about how he envisions <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/jack-dorsey-says-bitcoin-will-be-a-big-part-of-twitters-future/">bitcoin can integrate with Twitter&#8217;s products</a>, including commerce, subscriptions and other new additions like the Twitter Tip Jar and Super Follows. The company <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/22/twitter-twtr-earnings-q2-2021.html">posted the fastest revenue growth</a> since 2014 in a pandemic rebound, but user growth slightly declined.</p>

<p><strong>Facebook launched a new tool available to U.S. Facebook Groups that allows users to ask for prayers.</strong> The prayer request tool could help drive engagement on the platform by turning into a product something users were already doing. Facebook&#8217;s head of faith partnerships <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-decided-faith-groups-are-good-business-now-it-wants-your-prayers-2021-07-22/">told Reuters</a> COVID gave new urgency to the building of the feature.</p>

					<description><![CDATA["Finding product-market fit is not a deterministic process. Most of the time, it requires iteration. It requires constant adaptation."]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Sequoia&#8217;s Mike Vernal has worn many hats. He was VP of product and engineering at Facebook for eight years before getting into investment. His portfolio includes Houseparty, Threads, Canvas, Citizen, PicsArt and more, and he continues to invest in companies across a broad spectrum of stages and verticals, including consumer, enterprise, marketplaces, fintech and more.</p>
<p>Vernal joined us at TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising earlier this month to discuss how founders should think about product-market fit, with a specific focus on tempo. He covered how to organize around the pace of iteration, how to design with customer feedback loops in mind and how Sequoia evaluates companies with regard to tempo.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Be explicit and be greedy at every single step along the way about getting feedback.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<h2>What is tempo?</h2>
<p>Vernal breaks down tempo into two separate ingredients: speed and consistency.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just about going fast (which can often lead to some recklessness). It&#8217;s about setting a pace and staying consistent with that pace.</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the very best compliments an angel can bestow on a founding team and include in an introduction to us is, &#8220;They&#8217;re just really fast,&#8221; or &#8220;She&#8217;s a machine.&#8221; What does that mean? It doesn&#8217;t mean fast in the kind of uncontrolled, reckless, crashing sense. It means fast in a sort of consistent, maniacal, get-a-little-bit-better-each-day kind of way. And it&#8217;s actually one of the top things that we look for, at least when evaluating a team: how consistently fast they move. <em><strong>(Timestamp: 2:26)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<p>Vernal went on to say that tempo is directly correlated to goals and objectives and key results (OKRs). Building a feedback loop into those OKRs and determining the tempo with which to attack them is critical, especially during the process of finding product-market fit.</p>
<blockquote><p>Finding product-market fit is not a deterministic process. Most of the time, it requires iteration. It requires constant adaptation. My mental model is that it&#8217;s actually just a turn-based game with an unknown number of steps, and sometimes either the clock or the money or both run out before you get to finish the game. It&#8217;s kind of like a game of chess. So what is your optimal strategy? <em><strong>(Timestamp: 4:25)</strong></em></p></blockquote>
<h2>Feedback is your friend</h2>
<p>As Vernal explained, finding product-market fit is all about feedback, and that must be an ongoing, built-in part of the process. He outlined how founders can go about designing with that in mind.</p>

<p>Extra Crunch Live is usually a combination of an interview with a founder/investor duo and an audience pitch-off. But as it’s summer, and Disrupt is right around the corner, we thought it would be fun to bring you even more pitches and even more feedback.</p>
<p>On August 4, our expert VC judges will be Edith Yeung from Race Capital and Laela Sturdy of CapitalG. <a href="https://hopin.com/events/extra-crunch-live-startup-alley-edition-w-edith-yeung-and-laela-sturdy?ref=8e6debd80dd4">Register here for free!</a></p>
<p>Edith Yeung started out as an investor at 500 Startups and is now a general partner at Race Capital. She&#8217;s an expert on both the China and Silicon Valley investment landscape and has made more than 50 investments, with a portfolio that includes 50 startups, including Lightyear/Stellar (valued $1.2 billion), Silk Labs (acquired by Apple), Chirp (acquired by Apple), Fleksy (acquired by Pinterest), Human (acquired by Mapbox), Solana, Oasis Labs, Nebulas, Hooked, DayDayCook, AISense and many more.</p>
<p>Laela Sturdy is a 10x unicorn operator-turned-investor whose investments are worth nearly $200 billion. She joined CapitalG, the investment arm of Alphabet, in 2013, and her portfolio includes Stripe, UiPath, Duolingo, Gusto, Webflow and Unqork, among many others.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello friends and welcome to Daily Crunch, bringing you the most important startup, tech and venture capital news in a single package.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><em>To get a roundup of TechCrunch’s biggest and most important stories delivered to your inbox every day at 3 p.m. PDT, <a href="http://link.techcrunch.com/join/134/signup-all-newsletters">subscribe here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Hello and welcome to Daily Crunch for July 23, 2021. It’s been an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-exchange-ftx-valued-at-18-billion-in-funding-round-11626800455?mod=djemalertNEWS">interesting week</a> for the crypto faithful. One eye-catching piece of news came from Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey, who said that bitcoin <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/jack-dorsey-says-bitcoin-will-be-a-big-part-of-twitters-future/">will be a “big part” of the company’s future</a>. In his view it’s the internet’s “native currency.” Kinda? I would have picked a more modern chain, but that’s just me. &#8212; <a href="http://twitter.com/alex">Alex</a></p>
<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/food-delivery-firm-zomato-surges-in-key-india-debut/">Indian IPOs are a go:</a> </strong>After much selling and waiting, the Zomato IPO took flight in India to great effect. Shares of the food delivery unicorn went up sharply, marking a successful flotation for the growth-oriented unicorn. For other richly valued Indian unicorns, it’s just about the best news that you could imagine. More, please.</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/snap-had-its-best-quarter-in-four-years/"><strong>Snap is very much not dead:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Lost amidst all the Facebook and TikTok brouhaha is the fact that Snap is still growing its user base (some) and revenue scale (more). The company still consumes cash and has huge share-based compensation costs, but it reported the sort of growth that delights investors. So, up went its shares.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/chinas-expected-edtech-clampdown-may-chill-a-key-startup-sector/">China cracks down on edtech:</a></strong> The changing climate for startups and tech giants in China took a new twist this week when news broke that the Chinese Communist Party may force tutoring companies in the country to go nonprofit. That hit a number of stocks, and, we presume, was a pretty bad day for the country’s larger edtech venture and startup ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Startups/VC</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/paystand-banks-50m-to-make-b2b-payments-cashless-and-with-no-fees/"><strong>Paystand is building Venmo for businesses:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Want to send a bloc of cash as a company? The process can suck. Happily Paystand just raised $50 million for its work on the matter. TechCrunch’s <a href="https://twitter.com/ChristineMHall">Christine Hall</a> told Daily Crunch that she picked up the round because the company is “not only taking on the business-to-business payment space, but is also utilizing blockchain technology as its engine.”</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/monarch-raises-4-8m/"><strong>Former Minter wants to be king:</strong></a><strong> </strong>That’s our first read of the startup Monarch, founded by Val Agostino, who was the first PM at Mint.com. What does Monarch do? Helps folks manage their financial futures. Sure, other companies do that, but most of them are garbage. Have you used the Fidelity website lately?</li>
<li><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/lucid-motors-spac-merger-approved-after-executives-issue-plea-to-shareholders-to-vote/"><strong>Lucid Motors discovers the weaknesses of demo</strong><strong>cracy: </strong></a>The EV company had to extend its voting deadline to approve its SPAC deal after not enough folks voted. Per TechCrunch, the “hiccup occurred on Thursday, when shareholders voted to approve all but one of the proposals as part of the merger.” That particular item required more votes. Regardless, it now has the votes and will go public.</li>
<li>And if you wanted to know <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/duolingos-bellwether-ipo/">what’s up with the Duolingo IPO</a></strong>, the Equity team has you covered.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Susan Su on how to approach growth as your startup raises each round</h2>
<p>If you are methodical in your approach to building a larger customer base, it is not difficult to foster steady growth.</p>
<p>Marketers who shift with whichever way the wind is blowing — or blindly follow someone else&#8217;s idea of best practices — are less likely to be successful.</p>
<p>&#8220;The not-so-secret secret here is that the key to great retention is really simple,&#8221; said growth expert Susan Su recently at TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is building a product that solves a real and especially persistent problem for people.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a conversation with Managing Editor Eric Eldon, Su delved into several issues, including tips for how founders should discuss growth with their investors and her methods for developing a sample qualitative growth model.</p>
<p>&#8220;I firmly believe that every founder should try their hand at growth,&#8221; said Su.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/gm-recalls-bolt-evs-once-again-over-fire-risks/">GM recalls the Bolt. Again:</a></strong> If you own a 2017-to-2019-era Bolt, it may catch fire. So you’ll want to take part in the current recall. The first to happen since November of 2020 we hasten to add. Still the news underscores that EV tech is coming to maturity, even if some earlier attempts at such vehicles are riding the struggle bus.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/after-going-public-via-a-spac-taboola-acquires-e-commerce-marketing-network-connexity-for-800m/">Taboola goes shopping:</a> </strong>Fresh off its SPAC combination, Taboola announced that it is buying “Connexity, a marketing technology company that operates a retail- and e-commerce-focused advertising network” for $800 million. You can do this more easily if you are public. Buy things, that is. Shares in the online effluent provider were up sharply in today’s trading.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/tumblr-community-lash-out-post-plus-subscription/">Folks still using Tumblr not stoked that Tumblr wants a future:</a> </strong>A few days back Daily Crunch was generally positive about Tumblr’s move to introduce paywalls for creators who wanted them. Why not position the venerable company toward the burgeoning creator economy and help folks make a few bucks? Well, users are pissed. It’s a somewhat standard internet mess, but that doesn’t make it any less befuddling.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[Battery joint ventures have become the hot must-have deal for automakers that have set ambitious targets to deliver millions of electric vehicles in the next few years.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Battery joint ventures have become the hot must-have deal for automakers that have set ambitious targets to deliver millions of electric vehicles in the next few years.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no longer just about securing a supply of cells. The string of partnerships and joint ventures show that automakers are taking a more active role in the development and even production of battery cells.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--right">
		<blockquote>
			Automakers are taking a more active role in the development and even production of battery cells.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	</p>
<p>And the deals don&#8217;t appear to be slowing down. Just this week, Mercedes-Benz announced its $47 billion plan to become an electric-only automaker by 2030. Securing its battery supply chain by expanding existing partnerships or locking in new ones to jointly develop and produce battery cells and modules is a critical piece of its plan.</p>
<p>Mercedes, like other automakers, is also focused on developing and deploying advanced battery technology. In addition to setting up eight new battery plants to supply its future EVs, the German automaker said it was partnering with Sila Nano, the Silicon Valley battery chemistry startup that it has previously invested in, to increase energy density, which should in turn improve range and allow for shorter charging times.</p>
<p>“This follows a trend that we&#8217;ve seen of automakers realizing how critical the battery is and taking more control of the production of the cells in order to ensure their own supply,” Sila Nano CEO Gene Berdichevsky said in a recent interview. “Like if you&#8217;re VW, and you say, &#8216;We&#8217;re going to go 50% electric by whatever year,&#8217; but then the batteries don&#8217;t show up, you&#8217;re bankrupt, you&#8217;re dead. Their scale is so big that even if their cell partners have promised them to deliver, automakers are scared that they won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tesla, BMW and Volkswagen were early adopters of the battery joint-venture strategy. In 2014,<a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/panasonic-and-tesla-sign-agreement-gigafactory">Tesla and Panasonic signed an agreement to build a large battery manufacturing plant</a>, or a gigafactory as everyone is now calling it, in the U.S. and have worked together since.<a href="https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1114390_bmw-partners-with-us-solid-state-battery-company"> BMW began working with Solid Power</a> in 2017 to create solid-state batteries for high-performance EVs that could potentially lower costs by requiring less safety features than lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<p>In addition to its partnership with Northvolt, VW is also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagen-seeks-partnerships-battery-materials-race-2021-06-15/">in talks with suppliers</a> to secure more direct access to supplies like semiconductors and lithium so it can keep its existing plants running at full speed.</p>
<p>Now the rest of the industry is moving to work <em>with</em> battery companies, to share knowledge and resources and essentially become the manufacturer.<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Getaround was fined nearly $1 million by the Washington, D.C. Office of the attorney general for operating without a license and other violations, part of a settlement of what the peer-to-peer car rental startup calls “politically motivated allegations.”</p>
<p>The AG’s office started investigating the company early last year, after it received reports of vehicle thefts of cars listed on the Getaround platform. The settlement, released Friday, requires the company to pay the city $950,000, in addition to implementing other changes, including paying restitution to customers whose vehicles were stolen or damaged while listed for rent on Getaround’s platform.</p>
<p>Getaround, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/video/getaround-startup-battlefield-finalist-presentation/">the winner</a> of TechCrunch&#8217;s Startup Battlefield at Disrupt NYC in 2011, lets individual car owners rent their vehicles by the hour or day via its website and app. The site, much like competitor Turo or home rental analog Airbnb, mediates this exchange (and takes a cut off the top). The company’s attracted a lot of interest from investors, most recently raising a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/getaround-raises-a-140-million-series-e-amid-rebound-in-short-distance-travel/">$140 million Series E</a> that brought its total venture funding to $600 million.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The settlement is what’s known as an “assurance of voluntary compliance,” and it’s not an admission of guilt. <a href="https://oag.dc.gov/sites/default/files/2021-07/Getaround-Inc.-DCOAG-Agreement-.pdf">The settlement document</a> makes clear that Getaround denies it violated any consumer protection or tax laws.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="KMj5ODFarp"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/getaround-raises-a-140-million-series-e-amid-rebound-in-short-distance-travel/">Getaround raises a $140 million Series E amid rebound in short-distance travel</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Getaround raises a $140 million Series E amid rebound in short-distance travel&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/getaround-raises-a-140-million-series-e-amid-rebound-in-short-distance-travel/embed/#?secret=KMj5ODFarp" data-secret="KMj5ODFarp" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>“Gig economy companies must abide by the same rules as their brick-and-mortar counterparts,” Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement. “They must provide clear and accurate information to consumers, especially about the safety of their services, and they must pay their fair share of taxes like everyone else does.”</p>
<p>The AG’s office claims that Getaround operated without a license in the district, misrepresented its service and made “untrue or misleading representations” about the safety of its car rental services. As part of the settlement, the company must create a written policy for user complaints regarding vehicle damage or theft, including a way for users to report any issues. It also must clearly disclose limitations of its safety features, such as its “Enhanced Security” software feature, which Getaround says on its website can immobilize your car when it’s not being used. Getaround must also more clearly state the terms and conditions for insurance coverage.</p>
<p>The AG’s office also claimed that Getaround misled consumers by creating fake owner profiles for vehicles that it owned and operated. The company must now disclose its fleet cars clearly in listings.</p>
<p>A Getaround spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company “categorically disagrees” with the AG’s allegations.</p>
<p>“With regard to safety and security, as the attorney general acknowledges, as soon as Getaround was notified of security issues affecting certain cars in the District, the company took immediate corrective action,” the spokesperson said. “As is its practice, Getaround will continue to compensate car owners who have filed valid claims for loss or damage. Finally, Getaround never disputed liability for the taxes it is paying pursuant to this settlement. Getaround will continue to pay applicable taxes to the District and in every jurisdiction in which it operates.”</p>
<p>The company spokesperson went on to say that &#8220;while the attorney general is focused on scoring political points, Getaround remains focused on connecting safe, convenient and affordable cars with District residents who need them to live and work.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA["The not-so-secret secret here is that the key to great retention is really simple," says growth expert Susan Su.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Early-stage startups tend to claim that their go-to-market strategy is fully operational. In reality, GTM is a stark numbers game, and even with a solid plan in place, it can be easily foiled by common problems like turf battles and poor communication.</p>
<p>Finding GTM fit is a milestone for any startup that includes everything from expanding the engineering team to launching your first media buy. But how do you know when you&#8217;ve reached that magic moment?</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to consider three metrics: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/these-simple-metrics-will-tell-you-if-your-startup-is-ready-to-scale/">gross churn rate, the magic number and gross margin</a>,&#8221; says Tae Hea Nahm, co-founder and managing director of Storm Ventures.</p>
<p>High churn means customers aren&#8217;t delighted, low gross margins mean poor unit economics, and that so-called magic number?</p>
<p>&#8220;You can calculate it by taking new ARR divided by your marketing and sales spending,&#8221; Nahm writes. &#8220;But keep in mind that the magic number is a lagging indicator, and it may take you a few quarters to see a positive result.&#8221;</p>

<p>If you are methodical in your approach to building a larger customer base, it is not difficult to foster steady growth.</p>
<p>Marketers who shift with whichever way the wind is blowing — or blindly follow someone else&#8217;s idea of best practices — are less likely to be successful.</p>
<p>&#8220;The not-so-secret secret here is that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/susan-su-on-how-to-approach-growth-as-your-startup-raises-each-round/">the key to great retention is really simple</a>,&#8221; said growth expert Susan Su recently at TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising. &#8220;It is building a product that solves a real and especially persistent problem for people.&#8221;</p>
<p>In conversation with Managing Editor Eric Eldon, Su delved into several issues, including tips on how founders should discuss growth with investors, and her methods for developing a sample qualitative growth model.</p>
<p>&#8220;I firmly believe that every founder should try their hand at growth,&#8221; said Su.</p>

<p>Few startups go to market with the exact product their founders first envisioned.</p>
<p>Today, Tractable is known for developing tech that allows drivers to upload photos of their vehicles after a collision so its AI can assess the damage. Its first paying customer, however, used Tractable to inspect plastic pipe welds.</p>
<p>And as fate would have it, that customer also fired them just as the founders were raising their first round.</p>
<p>&#8220;We struck gold with car insurance,&#8221; says co-founder Alex Dalyac, as it was &#8220;a huge and inefficient market in desperate need of modernization.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an Extra Crunch guest post, he shares several takeaways from the last six years spent scaling a unicorn that have value for founders of all stripes. Step one?</p>
<p>&#8220;Search for complementary co-founders who will become your best friends,&#8221; advises Dalyac.</p>

<p>Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim continued their exploration of the scorching global VC market, this time taking a look at Europe.</p>
<p>For perspective, they analyzed data from Dealroom and spoke to four VCs about the continent&#8217;s investment climate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diana Koziarska, SMOK Ventures</li>
<li>Vinoth Jayakumar, Draper Esprit</li>
<li>Simon Schmincke, Creandum</li>
<li>Javier Santiso, Mundi Ventures</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;There’s little indication that what we’ve seen thus far from Europe in 2021 will slow in Q3 or Q4,&#8221; Alex and Anna write.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though Europe has a reputation for lengthy summer vacations, investors don’t expect much — if any — slowdown to come in Europe during this sun-drenched quarter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Amid the chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic and the murky path to profitability for shared electric micromobility, an increasing number of companies have turned to subscriptions,&#8221; Rebecca Bellan writes in a roundup about the future of micromobility.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a business model that some founders and investors argue hits the profit center sweet spot — an approach that appeals to customers who are wary of sharing as well as paying upfront to own a scooter or e-bike, all while minimizing overhead costs and depreciation of assets.&#8221;</p>

<p>After noting that Robinhood anticipates a decline in revenue in the third quarter as a result of slowing crypto trading, Alex Wilhelm got to thinking about what that forecast means for Coinbase.</p>
<p>&#8220;The now-public unicorn has lived through crypto ups and crypto downs,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;A decline in consumer interest in the next few months or quarters is not a huge deal, assuming one keeps a long enough perspective and the crypto-infused future that its fans expect comes to pass.&#8221;</p>
<p>But will it?</p>

<p><strong>Dear Sophie,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I handle people ops as a consultant at several different tech startups. Many have employees on OPT or STEM OPT who didn’t get selected in this year’s H-1B lottery.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The companies want to retain these individuals, but they’re running out of options. Some companies will try again in next year’s H-1B lottery, even though they face long odds, particularly if the H-1B lottery becomes a wage-based selection process next year.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Others are looking into O-1A visas, but find that many employees don’t yet have the experience to meet the qualifications. Should we look at Canada?</strong></p>

<p>For The Exchange, Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim looked at Canada’s VC market in the first half of 2021, and if you’ve been reading their work, you know what’s coming.</p>
<p>Canada, like the rest of the globe, was absolutely scorching in the first half.</p>
<p>&#8220;Canada’s venture capital results now rival those of the entire Latin American region, with exits and mega-deals coming in roughly on par in the second quarter, and a similar number of total venture capital rounds in the period,&#8221; they write.</p>
<p>&#8220;That caught our attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>With more venture funding flowing into the startup ecosystem than ever before, there’s never been a better time to be a growth expert.</p>
<p>At TechCrunch Early Stage: Marketing and Fundraising earlier this month, Greylock Partners’ Mike Duboe dug into a number of lessons and pieces of wisdom he’s picked up leading growth at a number of high-growth startups, including StitchFix. His advice spanned hiring, structure and analysis, with plenty of recommendations for where growth teams should be focusing their attention and resources.</p>

<p>Thanks to sprawling fulfillment centers, seamless logistics networks and ubiquitous internet access, consumers in many regions can now order groceries and a new set of cookware during breakfast and reasonably expect everything to arrive in time for dinner.</p>
<p>In Latin America, a lack of technology infrastructure makes delivery operations complex, and these supply chains are often managed with spreadsheets, paper and pen.</p>
<p>Algorithms that manage delivery routes or automatically dispatch drivers &#8220;are almost unheard of in the Latin America retail logistics sector,&#8221; says Bob Ma, an investor at WIND Ventures.</p>
<p>But thanks to growing consumer demand and expanding investment in last-mile delivery startups, Ma says the region is at a turning point.</p>
<p>Since Latin America&#8217;s middle class has grown 50% in the last decade and e-commerce constitutes just 6% of all retail, several unicorns have emerged in recent years, with more waiting in the wings.</p>

<p>China&#8217;s edtech industry is estimated to be worth $100 billion, but its leaders are reportedly considering a plan that would require these firms to operate as non-profits.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it comes to control, the Chinese government doesn’t mind wiping out a few dozen billion dollars in market cap here and there,&#8221; writes Alex Wilhelm in this morning&#8217;s edition of The Exchange.</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s not a great system.&#8221;</p>

	</div>
</div><p id="speakable-summary">Here at memoryOS, we have a saying we repeat often: “Most of the Kickstarter happens before the actual Kickstarter.”</p>
<p>Preparation is the key. But even if you understand that most of the work is done in advance, you should still prepare yourself for some sleepless nights after the launch date. The usual startup mantra will apply to your crowdfunding campaign just as well: Measure, analyze and adjust along the way.</p>
<p>As you may know, crowdfunding fits some B2C products better than it does others. So to give you our product context here, <a href="https://memoryos.com/">memoryOS</a> is a gamified app that teaches memorization skills with the help of virtual <a href="https://memoryos.com/mind-palace-virtual-implant">mind palaces</a> and interactive microlessons taught by our co-founder, two-time World Memory Champion, Jonas von Essen.</p>

<p>Before becoming the most funded app on Kickstarter and getting it 6,400% funded (and carrying it further to the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/memoryos-greatly-improve-your-memory-the-fun-way#/">Indiegogo</a> platform right after), we spent countless hours researching down the rabbit hole of crowdfunding tips and tricks. We also had calls with several top-tier crowdfunding project creators who were kind enough to answer our questions and share bits of knowledge from their experience.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re sharing our approach (and secrets) to building a successful crowdfunding campaign because we know just how tough it can be to launch your own product. So here is a complete 10-step guide:</p>
<h2>Find a unique idea</h2>
<p>You should have a unique idea for a product that would solve at least one problem for your target audience. The proven approach is to set two major hypotheses right at the start and then work on getting them tested:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">Does your product work and solve the problem as intended, and is it better than what’s out there? This is usually referred to as the &#8220;proof of concept&#8221; stage.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Are there enough people who are willing to pay for your product for you to build a sustainable business?</li>
</ol>
<p>You will need to build a base prototype to test the first hypothesis and, if it works, you can then work on turning it into an MVP or a short demo version for your future commercial product. You can then get people to test it for free and prepay for the full version.</p>
<p>	<div class="article-block block--pullout block--left">
		<blockquote>
			Getting people to actually back their interest with their wallet means you already have customers, not merely enthusiasts, and it significantly increases the chances of a successful project.					</blockquote>
	</div>
	<br />
Yes, it’s important that you get people to pay a minimum reservation deposit at this point and receive their commitment to pay the remaining amount for the full product later on. Getting people to actually back their interest with their wallet means you already have customers, not merely enthusiasts, and it significantly increases the chances of a successful project.</p>
<h2>Get user feedback</h2>
<p>As soon as you have something to test, conduct short surveys to better understand your customers by gathering and analyzing the reasons why and for what purpose(s) they would want your product.</p>
<p>Here at memoryOS, we called the first couple thousand of our leads and had many insightful conversations to help us connect to our audience on a more personal and emotional level.</p>
<p>Once you have a demo or prototype for the users to test, make sure to add a feedback form right at the end of their experience (or gather feedback using Google Forms for surveys, or via email inquiries).<div class="extra-crunch-offer-container"></div>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Rivian announced Friday that it has closed a $2.5 billion private funding round led by Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, D1 Capital Partners, Ford Motor and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates Inc.</p>
<p>Third Point, Fidelity Management and Research Company, Dragoneer Investment Group and Coatue also participated in the round, according to Rivian.</p>
<p>&#8220;As we near the start of vehicle production, it’s vital that we keep looking forward and pushing through to Rivian’s next phase of growth,&#8221; Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement. &#8220;This infusion of funds from trusted partners allows Rivian to scale new vehicle programs, expand our domestic facility footprint, and fuel international product rollout.&#8221;</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>D1 Capital Partners founder Dan Sundheim said the firm is excited to increase its &#8220;investment in Rivian as it reaches an inflection point in its commercialization and delivers what we believe will be exceptional products for customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rivian has raised roughly $10.5 billion to date. The company did not share a post-money valuation.</p>
<p>The electric automaker, which now employs 7,000 and is preparing to deliver its R1T pickup truck in September, last raised funds in January. That round brought in $2.65 billion from existing investors T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., Fidelity Management and Research Company, Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, Coatue and D1 Capital Partners. New investors also participated in that round, which pushed <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/rivian-raises-2-65-billion-in-new-capital-as-it-pushes-towards-production-of-its-electric-pickup/">Rivian&#8217;s valuation to $27.6 billion</a>, a source familiar with the investment round told TechCrunch at the time.</p>
<p>The news comes just a day after Rivian confirmed it plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/rivian-is-planning-a-second-u-s-factory/">open a second U.S. factory</a>. It also follows Rivian&#8217;s decision to delay deliveries of its R1T truck and R1S SUV from this summer to September due to delays in production caused by “cascading impacts of the pandemic,” particularly the ongoing global shortage of semiconductor chips.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">It takes a really specific consumer to buy an Android phone, yet use Apple Music. But the small overlap in that Venn diagram may be getting bigger. Last month at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/WWDC-2021/">WWDC</a>, Apple unveiled a free <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/apple-music-launches-spatial-audio-and-lossless-audio-adds-spatial-audio-playlists/">update for Apple Music subscribers</a> that added lossless audio streaming and spatial audio with support for Dolby Atmos. Now, Android users can access these features too.</p>
<p>Last year, Google <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/google-play-music-to-shut-down-starting-in-september-will-disappear-by-december/">shut down</a> its Google Play Music app (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/11/rip-google-music-one-of-the-companys-last-examples-of-generosity/">RIP</a>) with the intent for users to migrate to YouTube Music. Some longtime Android fans are still unpleased about that decision and don&#8217;t feel that YouTube Music is up to par &#8212; but for audiophiles, these Apple Music updates might be what it takes to get them to switch. However, not all Android devices <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590148/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-lossless-android">support Atmos yet</a>.</p>
<p>Apple Music isn&#8217;t the only streaming platform ramping up its audio quality. On the same day that Apple announced its upgraded audio features at WWDC, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/amazon-makes-its-its-lossless-music-streaming-service-a-free-upgrade/">Amazon Music</a> also announced that it would support lossless streaming and spatial audio with Atmos functionality. Like Apple, Amazon offers these enhancements at no extra cost for subscribers. Spotify plans to launch a lossless audio feature as well, called <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/spotify-to-launch-a-new-high-end-subscription-spotify-hifi/">HiFi</a>, but it will be a premium add-on, rather than a free upgrade like Apple Music or Amazon Music. YouTube Music doesn&#8217;t yet offer a comparable feature.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Currently, Spotify leads the streaming industry with <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-28/spotify-reports-first-quarter-2021-earnings/">158 million paid subscribers</a>. For comparison, Apple Music had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/27/apple-music-surpasses-60-million-subscribers/">60 million subscribers</a> in June 2019, and Amazon Music had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/22/amazon-music-passes-55m-customers-across-its-free-and-paid-tiers-but-still-lags-behind-spotify-and-apple/">55 million</a> in January 2020, but both companies haven&#8217;t shared updated numbers since then; YouTube Music has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/07/youtube-premium-subscribers-get-a-new-perk-with-launch-of-testing-program/">at least 20 million</a> paid users. Even on consumer-grade headphones, you can hear the difference between a lossless FLAC file and a compressed mp3 &#8212; but if you&#8217;re such a keen audiophile that you need to listen to master-quality audio, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/daily-crunch-square-acquires-tidal/">just get Tidal</a>.</p>
