										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">For the first time, Pinduoduo has surpassed Alibaba in annual active users, marking the Chinese e-commerce upstart&#8217;s meteoric rise over the course of five years.</p>
<p>The milestone also indicates Pinduoduo has overcome the early stereotype that it was an app for users in China&#8217;s less developed, low-tier cities. Pinduoduo made its name by removing intermediary distributors and selling cheap fruits and daily items, but it has gradually diversified its offerings to be all-encompassing, like heavily discounted iPhones.</p>
<p>The company went <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/05/pinduoduo-is-raising-over-1-billion/">public on NASDAQ</a> in 2018 and counts Tencent as a major shareholder and partner. It recorded 788 million annual active users in 2020, according to its Q4 earnings report that just came out. Alibaba lagged slightly behind at <a href="https://www.alibabagroup.com/en/news/press_pdf/p210202.pdf">779 million</a> active users through the year.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In terms of monthly active users, though, Alibaba enjoyed a great lead at 902 million in December. Pinduoduo&#8217;s MAU of the month was 720 million.</p>
<p>Both companies still have room to grow as China had 989 million internet users as of 2020, according to a <a href="http://www.cac.gov.cn/pdf/web/viewer.html?file=http://www.cac.gov.cn/rootimages/uploadimg/1613923424818332/1613923424818332.pdf?filepath=ZBWvETi1XzcBKtOIkqelkJJ4Vn5uw9ZthCXJtWLSr0nQACMKH6Ejiw/UpdBYAwmsV5if6BYGd60xaZUMhKPZmjEjTcORl73kmCTdYOvdSjs=&amp;fText=%E7%AC%AC47%E6%AC%A1%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E4%BA%92%E8%81%94%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C%E5%8F%91%E5%B1%95%E7%8A%B6%E5%86%B5%E7%BB%9F%E8%AE%A1%E6%8A%A5%E5%91%8A-0203%EF%BC%88%E6%89%93%E5%8D%B0%E7%94%9F%E6%88%90%EF%BC%89">report</a> from the country&#8217;s top cyberspace authority.</p>
<p>Alibaba, founded 21 years ago, was ahead of Pinduoduo in revenue by a wide margin, partly because of a larger transaction volume and a thriving cloud computing business. Alibaba ended the December quarter with 221 billion yuan or $33.88 billion in revenue, compared to Pinduoduo&#8217;s 26.55 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Farm produce remains at the core of Pinduoduo, which was founded by ex-Googler Colin Huang. Huang today stepped down as chairman of the company and will devote his time to research in the food and life sciences, which Pinduoduo believes could drive future growth of its &#8220;agriculture platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pinduoduo doesn&#8217;t just want to bring produce from farmers to urban consumers. In recent years, it has also thrown itself into agri-tech by piloting <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/pinduoduo-agritech/">AI-powered farms</a> and training farmers to be savvy online vendors. These strategies are in line with Beijing&#8217;s push to boost China&#8217;s rural economy, which affects the lives of hundreds of millions.</p>

<p>The e-commerce upstart has a big goal: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/pinduoduo-145-billion-farm-produce-2025/">selling $145 billion</a> worth of agricultural products annually by 2025. It seems to be on track. The firm&#8217;s gross merchant volume, an e-commerce metric for transactions, from agricultural products doubled to more than 270 billion yuan or $41.5 billion in 2020. Its marketplace boasted 12 million farmers selling directly to consumers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pinduoduo started with agricultural products,&#8221; says Chen Lei, current chairman and CEO at Pinduoduo, in a statement. &#8220;[W]e hope that Pinduoduo can one day become the largest grocer in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>While selling grocery isn&#8217;t as lucrative as, say, electronics, it could be an effective way for user acquisition as the cost of trying out fruits sold on Pinduoduo is relatively low.</p>
<p>As the firm pursues its agricultural dream, it has yet to turn profitable. Pinduoduo&#8217;s net loss shrank to 1.38 billion yuan or $210.9 million in the quarter, compared with 1.75 billion yuan in the same quarter of 2019.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Back in December, <a href="http://www.swellenergy.com">Swell Energy</a> said it would be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/10/residential-renewable-energy-developer-swell-is-raising-450-million-for-distributed-power-projects-in-three-states/">raising $450 million to support the development of distributed power projects in three states</a>. Now, with the announcement of a deal between the venture-backed startup and New York City&#8217;s utility, ConEd, industry watchers can get a glimpse of what those projects may look like.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles-based company has a new residential solar plus energy storage program for homeowners in Queens that&#8217;s going to be rolled out in partnership with ConEd.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a project that will create solar-powered home batteries for eligible ConEd customers.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>New York is actually targeting the rollout of 3 gigawatts of installed energy storage capacity by 2030 with a goal of moving the entire state&#8217;s electricity grid to zero emissions by 2040.</p>
<p>With the ConEd project, the city is hoping to create backup power for customers in Queens that they can tap independently of the energy grid&#8217;s own resources, which should free up power for customers that don&#8217;t have the energy storage tech.</p>
<div>Homeowners that participate in the project may qualify for incentives that lower the cost of the systems, <a href="http://www.swellenergy.com/Queens">which are initially being offered</a> to residents of Forest Park, Glendale, Hunters Point, Long Island City, Maspeth, Middle Village, Ridgewood, Sunnyside, and parts of adjacent neighborhoods in Queens.</div>
<div></div>

<p>The New York virtual power plant differs from other initiatives from Swell in that it provides available capacity to specific distribution circuits on the grid to reduce customer demand on circuits during network overload periods, according to a Swell spokesperson.</p>
<p>With the virtual power plant, ConEd won&#8217;t need to build out new transmission and distribution infrastructure, but can still ensure network reliability. It&#8217;s what&#8217;s called a &#8220;non-wires solution&#8221; to the demand problem, Swell&#8217;s spokesperson said.</p>
<p>By contrast, the company&#8217;s Hawaii projects provide system-level capacity and frequency regulation and the California program with Southern California Edison, provide demand-response capacity for baseload energy management and overall load growth in the area where they&#8217;re operating.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Unagi, the startup behind the portable, design-centric electric scooters, is launching its subscription service to six more U.S. cities in an expansion fueled by $10.5 million in funding.</p>
<p>The startup, launched in late 2018 by former Beats Music CEO <span style="font-weight: 400;">David Hyman and Mog co-founder, said Wednesday it is bringing its subscription service to Austin, Miami, Nashville, Phoenix, San Francisco and Seattle. Unagi will also be expanding its service in New York and L.A. metropolitan regions, including all five NYC boroughs, Long Island, Westchester and Northern New Jersey, as well as the Westside, Southeast L.A., the San Fernando Valley and Orange County. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All together, these areas represent a market of about 30 million potential consumers. The Series A funding round is led by the Ecosystem Integrity Fund with participation from Menlo Ventures, Broadway Angels and Gaingels, among others. </span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The expansion comes just six months after the <span style="font-weight: 400;">commercial scooter company and </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/unagi-the-iphone-of-scooters-now-has-a-subscription-service/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">piloted its “All-Access” subscription service in New York City and Los Angeles</span></a>.</p>
<p>Unagi might not be the only scooter company to ever offer a subscription service. It is quickly becoming the best known and the one with the biggest reach in the United States. <a href="https://rent.bird.co/">Bird</a> launched a similar offering in 2019, but has gone quiet about it.</p>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/01/unagi-scooter/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dubbed by TechCrunch as the “iPhone of scooters”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a couple of years ago, Unagi is offering its Model One electric scooter with a dual motor for $49 per month. The aim is to make the scooters accessible to a wider populace that might not want to shell out the $990 to own one outright. Sales of the sleek, sturdy and incredibly lightweight scooters have skewed heavily towards men over 35 years of age, according to Hyman. Unagi’s subscription service, on the other hand, caters more towards the Millennial yuppie who likes nice things but doesn’t like commitment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our market is purely urban, and our internal corporate mantra is: If you can’t carry our scooter up a three-story walk up, then it’s not something we want to do,” Hyman told TechCrunch. “I think there’s a generation of consumers that prefer access over ownership and don’t want the responsibility and the maintenance concerns.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the same generation that grew up on kick scooters and thus intuitively know how to ride the scooters they’re seeing on the street, which partially explains some of the mighty success e-scooters have seen in recent years, said Hyman. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The global electric scooter market is expected to grow around 8% per year over the next decade, </span><a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/electric-scooters-market#:~:text=b.-,The%20global%20electric%20scooters%20market%20size%20was%20estimated%20at%20USD,USD%2020.0%20billion%20in%202020.&amp;text=The%20global%20electric%20scooters%20market%20is%20expected%20to%20grow%20at,USD%2042.0%20billion%20by%202030."><span style="font-weight: 400;">reaching $42 billion by 2030</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Based on </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/case-electric-scooter-ownership-unagi-manifesto-david-hyman/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">research conducted by Unagi and Berkeley Haas School of Business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Hyman predicts sharing will account for a third of the total e-scooter market, with ownership and subscription taking up the remainder. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> said the subscription model is more attractive than the shared model because it doesn’t entail hunting for an available scooter, or wondering if the last rider coughed Rona germs all over it once you do find it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unagi&#8217;s pitch is to create a hassle-free experience with upfront pricing and the ability to cancel a subscription anytime. The monthly fee covers the cost of maintenance and insurance for lost, stolen or damaged scooters. There are some stipulations though. Customers are locked into a three-month minimum and have to pay a $50 set up fee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyman said he thinks it’ll take some time for the subscription model to ramp up, but once it does, it will be Unagi’s primary revenue driver. From 2019 to 2020, Unagi grew 450% with demand for subscription scooters in the pilot cities going “off the charts,” according to Hyman, but he declined to provide numbers for scaling those charts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I actually think the pandemic only hurt us because one of the primary use cases for our product is commuting,” said Hyman in response to a query about an eventual plateau of e-scooter craze if a vaccinated populace gets back to its regular commuting styles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In a city, the vast majority of people’s rides are under three miles, and having a portable electric scooter just kills everything,” he said. “It’s so much easier to carry around and you don’t have to worry about locking it up outside, don’t have to worry about theft or carrying it up to your apartment or on the subways.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The scooters weigh about 26 pounds and can balance on either wheel when folded. On a single charge, they can take you eight to 15 miles, depending on your weight and whether you’re cruising on one motor or blasting past the clunky ride-share scooters with both motors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The subscription model here works well alongside e-scooter sales because it allows for scooters to be repurposed. Subscribers aren’t guaranteed new scooters. They’re more likely to get one that’s certified pre-owned. And because Unagi is committed to building with high-end materials, the company says regular maintenance keeps scooters alive for an expected three to five years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hyman, who has a track record of creating subscription business models, like the MOG music subscription that eventually turned into Apple Music, has personal reasons for offering Hardware as a Service in the form of electric scooters. He lived in Amsterdam for three years, where biking is far more commonplace than driving. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Considering how many commutes are under three miles, the fact that there are so many cars in cities is ridiculous,” said Hyman. “We are hell-bent on getting cars out of cities.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://octoml.ai/">OctoML</a>, a Seattle-based startup that offers a machine learning acceleration platform build on top of the open-source <a href="https://tvm.apache.org/">Apache TVM compiler framework project</a>, today announced that it has raised a $28 million Series B funding round led by Addition Captial. Previous investors <span style="font-weight: 400;">Madrona Venture Group and Amplify Partners also participated in this round, which brings the company&#8217;s total funding to $47 million. The company last raised in April 2020, when it announced its $15 million <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/03/octoml-raises-15m-to-make-optimizing-ml-models-easier/">Series A round led by Amplify</a>. </span></p>
<p>The promise of OctoML is that developers can bring their models to its platform and the service will automatically optimize that model&#8217;s performance for any given cloud or edge device. The founding team created the TVM project, which</p>
<p>As Brazil-born OctoML co-founder and CEO Luis Ceze told me, since raising its Series A round, the company started onboarding some early adopters to its &#8216;Octomizer&#8217; SaaS platform.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2126083" style="width: 373px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/octomizer.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2126083" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2126083" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/octomizer.png?w=680" alt="" width="363" height="363" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/octomizer.png 738w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/octomizer.png?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/octomizer.png?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/octomizer.png?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/octomizer.png?resize=32,32 32w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/octomizer.png?resize=50,50 50w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/octomizer.png?resize=64,64 64w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/octomizer.png?resize=96,96 96w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/octomizer.png?resize=128,128 128w" sizes="(max-width: 363px) 100vw, 363px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2126083" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> OctoML</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s still in early access, but we are we have close to 1,000 early access sign-ups on the waitlist,&#8221; Ceze said. &#8220;That was a pretty strong signal for us to end up taking this [funding]. The Series B was pre-emptive. We were planning on starting to raise money right about now. We had barely started spending our Series A money &#8212; we still had a lot of that left. But since we saw this growth and we had more paying customers than we anticipated, there were a lot of signals like, &#8216;hey, now we can accelerate the go-to-market machinery, build a customer success team and continue expanding the engineering team to build new features.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ceze tells me that the team also saw strong growth signals in the overall community around the TVM project (with about 1,000 people attending its virtual conference <a href="https://tvmconf.org/">last year</a>). As for its customer base (and companies on its waitlist), Ceze says it represents a wide range of verticals that range from defense contractors to financial services and life science companies, automotive firms and startups in a variety of fields.</p>
<p>Recently, OctoML also launched support for the Apple M1 chip &#8212; and saw <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/16/2146436/0/en/OctoML-Announces-Faster-Machine-Learning-Model-Inferencing-on-Apple-s-New-M1-Than-Apple-s-Core-ML-4-Provides.html">very good performance from that</a>.</p>
<p>The company has also formed partnerships with industry heavyweights like Microsoft (which is also a customer), Qualcomm, AMD and Sony to build out the open-source components and optimize its service for an even wider range of models (and larger ones, too).</p>
<p>On the engineering side, Ceze tells me that the team is looking at not just optimizing and tuning models but also the training process. Training ML models can quickly become costly and any service that can speed up that process leads to direct savings for its users &#8212; which in turn makes OctoML an easier sell. The plan here, Ceze tells me, is to offer an end-to-end solution where people can optimize their ML training and the resulting models and then push their models out to their preferred platform. Right now, its users still have to take the artifact that the Octomizer creates and deploy that themselves, but deployment support is on OctoML&#8217;s roadmap.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When we first met Luis and the OctoML team, we knew they were poised to transform the way ML teams deploy their machine learning models,&#8221; said Lee Fixel, founder of Addition. &#8220;They have the vision, the talent and the technology to drive ML transformation across every major enterprise. They launched Octomizer six months ago and it’s already becoming the go-to solution developers and data scientists use to maximize ML model performance. We look forward to supporting the company’s continued growth.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">In recent years, the publicly traded observability service New Relic started adding more machine learning-based tools to its platform for AI-assisted incident response when things don&#8217;t quite go as planned. Today, it is expanding this feature set with the launch of a number of new capabilities for what it calls its &#8220;New Relic Applied Intelligence Service.&#8221;</p>
<p>This expansion includes an anomaly detection service that is even available for free users, the ability to group alerts from multiple tools when the models think it&#8217;s a single issue that is triggering all of these alerts and new ML-based root cause analysis to help eliminate some of the guesswork when problems occur. Also new (and in public beta) is New Relic&#8217;s ability to detect patterns and outliers in log data that is stored in the company&#8217;s data platform.</p>
<p>The main idea here, New Relic&#8217;s director of product marketing Michael Olson told me, is to make it easier for companies of all sizes to reap the benefits of AI-enhanced ops.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><div id="attachment_2125954" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/anomaly-detection-featured.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125954" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2125954" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/anomaly-detection-featured.png" alt="" width="1024" height="503" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/anomaly-detection-featured.png 3360w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/anomaly-detection-featured.png?resize=150,74 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/anomaly-detection-featured.png?resize=300,148 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/anomaly-detection-featured.png?resize=768,378 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/anomaly-detection-featured.png?resize=680,334 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/anomaly-detection-featured.png?resize=1536,755 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/anomaly-detection-featured.png?resize=2048,1007 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/anomaly-detection-featured.png?resize=50,25 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2125954" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> New Relic</p></div></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been about a year since we introduced our first set of AIops capabilities with New Relic Applied Intelligence to the market,&#8221; he said. &#8220;During that time, we&#8217;ve seen significant growth in adoption of AIops capabilities through New Relic. But one of the things that we&#8217;ve heard from organizations that have yet to foray into adopting AIops capabilities as part of their incident response practice is that they often find that things like steep learning curves and long implementation and training times &#8212; and sometimes lack of confidence, or knowledge of AI and machine learning &#8212; often stand in the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new platform should be able to detect emerging problems in real time &#8212; without the team having to pre-configure alerts. And when it does so, it&#8217;ll smartly group all of the alerts from New Relic and other tools together to cut down on the alert noise and let engineers focus on the incident.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of an alert storm when a problem occurs across multiple tools, engineers get one actionable issue with alerts automatically grouped based on things like time and frequency, based on the context that they can read in the alert messages. And then now with this launch, we&#8217;re also able to look at relationship data across your systems to intelligently group and correlate alerts,&#8221; Olson explained.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125955" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/alert-noise-reduction-featured.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125955" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2125955" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/alert-noise-reduction-featured.png" alt="" width="1024" height="716" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/alert-noise-reduction-featured.png 3486w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/alert-noise-reduction-featured.png?resize=150,105 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/alert-noise-reduction-featured.png?resize=300,210 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/alert-noise-reduction-featured.png?resize=768,537 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/alert-noise-reduction-featured.png?resize=680,475 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/alert-noise-reduction-featured.png?resize=1536,1073 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/alert-noise-reduction-featured.png?resize=2048,1431 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/alert-noise-reduction-featured.png?resize=50,35 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2125955" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> New Relic</p></div></p>
<p>Maybe the highlight for the ops teams that will use these new features, though, is New Relic&#8217;s ability to pinpoint the probable root cause of a problem. As Guy Fighel, the general manager of applied intelligence and vice president of product engineering at New Relic, told me, the idea here is not to replace humans but to augment teams.</p>
<p>&#8220;We provide a non-black-box experience for teams to craft the decisions and correlation and logic based on their own knowledge and infuse the system with their own knowledge,&#8221; Fighel noted. &#8220;So you can get very specific based on your environment and needs. And so because of that and because we see a lot of data coming from different tools &#8212; all going into New Relic One as the data platform &#8212; our probable root cause is very accurate. Having said that, it is still a <em>probable</em> root cause. So although we are opinionated about it, we will never tell you, &#8216;hey, go fix that, because we&#8217;re 100% sure that&#8217;s the case.&#8217; You&#8217;re the human, you&#8217;re in control.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="UIIEyx9oeM"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/31/amid-shift-to-remote-work-application-performance-monitoring-is-its-big-moment/">Amid shift to remote work, application performance monitoring is IT&#8217;s big moment</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The AI system also asks users for feedback, so that the model gets refined with every new incident, too.</p>
<p>Fighel tells me that New Relic&#8217;s tools rely on a variety of statistical analysis methods and machine learning models. Some of those are unique to individual users while others are used across the company&#8217;s user base. He also stressed that all of the engineers who worked on this project have a background in site reliability engineering &#8212; so they are intimately familiar with the problems in this space.</p>
<p>With today&#8217;s launch, New Relic is also adding a new integration with PagerDuty and other incident management tools so that the state of a given issue can be synchronized bi-directionally between them.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to meet our customers where they are and really be data source agnostic and enable customers to pull in data from any source, where we can then enrich that data, reduce noise and ultimately help our customers solve problems faster,&#8221; said Olson.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="http://www.digitail.io">Digitail</a>, a cloud service for veterinary surgeries and customers, has raised $2.5M in a Seed round led by <a href="https://byfounders.vc/">byFounders</a> and Gradient Ventures (Google’s AI fund), joined by Partech and a series of angels including as Dr. Ivan Zakharenkov (Smartflow). The startup was already backed (pre-seed round in 2019) by Fast Track Malmo. Digitail is currently used by 2,000 veterinarians in 16 countries.</p>
<p>Digitail  says its “all-in-one” practice management system for animal hospitals and veterinary practices “helps vets simplify their workflow, drive automation, and engage with pet parents, even when they are not at the practice.”</p>
<p>For pet owners Digital had a <a href="http://pet.digitail.io/">Health Card for pets</a>, a customer app that is directly connected to the PIMS and acts as a digital ID for the pets. This holds the pet&#8217;s medical history, and allows the owner to communicate with the vet through the in-app chat, book their next appointment, and store any other important information about their pet.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The founders are Sebastian Gabor (CEO and co-founder), Ruxandra Pui (CPO and co-founder). They are joined by Alexandru Gheorghita, DVM, in-house veterinarian specialist.</p>
<p>Gabor said in a statement: “Pet care is still being run like in the 90s. Because of the lack of a holistic vision and approach, there is no data unification and no collaboration between the key players of the industry. As a result, vets still need to rely on outdated tools while collaboration and innovation is stopped.”</p>
<p>Competitors include <a href="http://Rhapsody.vet">Rhapsody.vet</a> which has raised an $8M Series A, <a href="http://ezyvet.com">Ezyvet</a>, and <a href="http://hippomanager.com">Hippo Manager</a>, among others. But Digitail says its all-in-one approach has an edge on the others.</p>
<p>According to some estimates, some 39% of pet owners in the United States are millennials. Digitail is thus finding business among veterinarians surfing a new generation of customers who expect to be able to make bookings and arrangements with their vet via an app. Just as with apps aimed at doctor’s surgeries, Digitail’s platform handles that incoming customer data and also allows the surgery to run. The pet care industry is predicted to reach a value of $200 billion by 2025.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Tel Aviv-based <a href="https://vulcan.io/">Vulcan Cyber</a>, a cybersecurity startup that helps businesses prioritize and fix security vulnerabilities, today announced that it has raised a $21 million Series B funding round led by Dawn Capital. Wipro Ventures and existing investors YL Ventures and Ten Eleven Ventures also participated in this round. The company says it will use the new funding to roll out new remediation solutions and launch a free risk-based vulnerability management platform under the <a href="https://vulcan.io/lp/vulcan-free">Vulcan Free</a> monicker.</p>
<p>With this new round, Vulcan Cyber&#8217;s total funding to date is now $35 million. The company says it saw 500% growth in annual recurring revenue and new customer account metrics in 2020, with each user typically having between 10 and 100 users on the platform.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125900" style="width: 308px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/LOGO_MAIN.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125900" loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-2125900" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/LOGO_MAIN.png" alt="" width="298" height="97" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/LOGO_MAIN.png 461w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/LOGO_MAIN.png?resize=150,49 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/LOGO_MAIN.png?resize=300,98 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/LOGO_MAIN.png?resize=50,16 50w" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2125900" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Vulcan Cyber</p></div></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company&#8217;s emphasis has always been on not just warning its customers about potential vulnerabilities but also helping them prioritize them based on the severity of the risk and the threat to a company&#8217;s business assets. Security teams, after all, are often overwhelmed by alerts and not every vulnerability a scanner represents is a high-priority risk for a business. The promise of Vulcan Cyber&#8217;s platform is that it helps these teams figure out where to best focus their resources.</p>
<p>While the funding is the headline news today, Vulcan&#8217;s new free offering is also worth a closer look.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="il">Cyber</span>security pros have used open-source vulnerability scanners like Nessus for almost two decades. More recently, vulnerability management programs have used risk-based vulnerability management tools to prioritize scan results to determine specific risk to the business and focus the remediation effort. <u></u><u></u>The scan and prioritize functions are fundamental, necessary elements of any mature remediation program,&#8221; Yaniv Bar-Dayan, <span class="il">Vulcan</span> <span class="il">Cyber&#8217;s</span> CEO and co-founder said about the new free offering. &#8220;But now the industry has a free vulnerability prioritization engine to complement the scanners. This round of funding allows us to provide the <span class="il">Vulcan</span> Free service to the <span class="il">cyber</span>security industry to help businesses achieve <span class="il">cyber</span> hygiene. This move shifts the economics of our market and will push CISOs and CIOs to dedicate more budget and resources not just on simple scan and prioritize paper pushing, but on driving actual remediation outcomes. We hope this will help the industry get fix done more effectively.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this new free offering, Vulcan&#8217;s freemium portfolio now includes Vulcan Free, which provides some of the company&#8217;s core prioritization and vulnerability management features, and its existing free vulnerability intelligence database.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Existing remote desktop solutions like LogMeIn and TeamViewer can be complicated to set up and use, and can feel dated. A new startup called <a href="https://cohere.so/">Cohere</a>, now backed by $3.1 million in seed funding, aims to improve on the remote desktop and screen-sharing experience. With Cohere&#8217;s technology, businesses can help customers in seconds by taking instant control of their screen without any downloads or setup on the customer&#8217;s end.</p>
<p>That ease-of-use has already gained the startup over 50 paying customers for its product, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/and-the-winner-of-startup-battlefield-at-disrupt-2020-is-canix/">TechCrunch Disrupt 2020 winner Canix</a>, CopyAI, Ramp and others. It also signed its first enterprise client with Podium.</p>
<p>Cohere&#8217;s three co-founders, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yunyu-lin/">Yunyu Lin</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-hf-wang/">Jason Wang</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahul-gs/">Rahul Sengottuvelu</a>, first met while attending Duke University. Lin later left to work for <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/a-new-corporate-card-ramp-secures-30m-for-money-saving-company-credit-programs/">corporate card startup Ramp,</a> but the others graduated during the pandemic.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;And the winner of Startup Battlefield at Disrupt 2020 is… Canix&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/and-the-winner-of-startup-battlefield-at-disrupt-2020-is-canix/embed/#?secret=bXqrVwm1aw" data-secret="bXqrVwm1aw" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>The idea for Cohere actually emerged during the pandemic, during a hackathon focused on remote work. The team won the event and decided to take their project to Y Combinator for further development.</p>
<p>Essentially, Cohere is designed to make it easier for teams, whether small founders or large enterprises, to help solve their customers&#8217; issues. Instead of requiring a software download or complicated install process, customers can just click a button on a website to allow remote control of their screen. This can save time, as the support person on the other end doesn&#8217;t have to ask a million questions about which screen the customer is on or what they see, or direct them where to click &#8212; they can just take over.</p>
<p>&#8220;It lets you see what people are seeing just like that, with no setup,&#8221; says Sengottuvelu. &#8220;You can just show them &#8212; just like you&#8217;re sitting next to them.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125882" style="width: 1802px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125882" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2125882 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Multiplayer-Control.png" alt="" width="1792" height="1003" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Multiplayer-Control.png 1792w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Multiplayer-Control.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Multiplayer-Control.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Multiplayer-Control.png?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Multiplayer-Control.png?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Multiplayer-Control.png?resize=1536,860 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Multiplayer-Control.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1792px) 100vw, 1792px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2125882" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cohere</p></div></p>
<p>But what makes Cohere different is it&#8217;s not a full remote desktop solution where the person on the other end is taking over someone&#8217;s computer &#8212; the service instead only forwards the contents of the individual web page the person is currently viewing. The application developer, that is, can only view what a user is doing on their own website. They can&#8217;t switch tabs or minimize the browser to poke around in the user&#8217;s PC more broadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t operate on the pixel level, like a normal screen share does, where they take a picture of your screen 60 times a second and try to send it over the wire,&#8221; explains Lin.</p>
<p>The startup&#8217;s technology itself is based on capturing the web page&#8217;s state &#8212; a picture of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction">DOM</a>, so to speak, for those who understand the terminology. It then leverages things like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver">MutationObservers</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/WebSockets">WebSockets</a> to make it possible to quickly see changes to the web pages in real time. Cohere also spent time to make sure it works with a range of web technologies and frameworks, including React, Iframe, Canvas, Vue, Angular and others. In time, it wants to expand support to more platforms and technologies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We capture the content of the page,&#8221; Lin says. &#8220;So, we are able to selectively filter out sensitive information like credit card info, passwords or Social Security numbers &#8212; any personally identifiable information,&#8221; he adds.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125881" style="width: 1802px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125881" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2125881 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cohere-Grid-View.png" alt="" width="1792" height="1004" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cohere-Grid-View.png 1792w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cohere-Grid-View.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cohere-Grid-View.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cohere-Grid-View.png?resize=768,430 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cohere-Grid-View.png?resize=680,381 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cohere-Grid-View.png?resize=1536,861 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Cohere-Grid-View.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1792px) 100vw, 1792px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2125881" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cohere</p></div></p>
<p>The remote viewer also can&#8217;t take control until the user accepts, and then the user can boot them at any time with a click of an &#8220;X&#8221; button at the top of the screen.</p>
<p>In addition to <a href="https://cohere.so/security">these security controls</a>, Cohere is SOC 2 Type 1, GDPR and CCPA compliant.</p>
<p>At present, Cohere works on both desktop and mobile browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari. And it&#8217;s designed to be integrated with a business&#8217;s existing tools, like Zendesk, Slack, Salesforce and Intercom, with more to come.</p>
<p>While the product to some extent competes with older remote desktop apps, its newer Cohere Replay feature allows businesses to go back in time to view their customer sessions retroactively.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_2125884" style="width: 1802px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2125884" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2125884 size-full" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Replay.png" alt="" width="1792" height="1002" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Replay.png 1792w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Replay.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Replay.png?resize=300,168 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Replay.png?resize=768,429 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Replay.png?resize=680,380 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Replay.png?resize=1536,859 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Replay.png?resize=50,28 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1792px) 100vw, 1792px" /><p id="caption-attachment-2125884" class="wp-caption-text"><strong>Image Credits:</strong> Cohere</p></div></p>
<p>Because the product is limited to web apps and is not a full remote desktop solution it tends to be used primarily for things like customer support and user onboarding. Early-stage startups have also used it as they give tours to their first customers and learn from how the customers use the product in real time.</p>
<p>The paid service begins at $49 per user per month and is $39 for larger teams.</p>
<p>Cohere first launched around seven months ago, during its Y Combinator batch.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s now raised $3.1 million in seed funding, led by Initialized Capital. Other investors in the round include Y Combinator, BoxGroup, Soma Capital, Shrug Capital, Chapter One and various angels like Zach Perret, Elad Gil, Naval Ravikant, Eric Wu, Prasanna Sankaranarayanan, Eric Glyman, Jack Altman, Todd Goldberg, Rahul Vohra, Karim Atiyeh, Vivek Sodera, Dan Romero, Shrav Mehta and Oscar Hong.</p>
<p>New York-based Cohere, currently consisting only of the three co-founders, will use the additional funds to hire in sales, engineering and product. It will also devote some capital to building out the enterprise sales process, and expand its integrations and use cases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">French startup <a href="https://payfit.com/en/">PayFit</a> has raised a $107 million series D funding round (€90 million). Eurazeo Growth and Bpifrance’s Large Venture fund are leading today’s round. Existing investors Accel, Frst and Xavier Niel are participating once again.</p>
<p>PayFit has been building a payroll and HR software-as-a-service platform. It lets you manage your payroll from a web browser and automate as many steps as possible. For instance, you can configure automate payslip generation, export your payroll data to your accounting software and get a list of payments you need to make when it comes to pensions, health insurance, etc.</p>
<p>Given that it’s a software-as-a-service platform, everything remains up to date. For instance, if there are some regulatory changes that require some adjustments, PayFit can update its platform so that you remain compliant from day one without having to think about it.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Over time, the startup has expanded beyond payroll to tackle a bigger chunk of the HR stack. Each employee gets its own PayFit login to access their payslips. But the company doesn’t stop there as you can request time off and enter how much time you’ve worked this week if you’re paid on an hourly basis. PayFit automatically notifies the manager for approval.</p>
<p>PayFit can also become your central repository for expenses and receipts. The company already has everyone’s bank information, which makes it easier to transfer money back to an employee for a cash expense.</p>
<p>Employees can also view the company’s directory and management chain from PayFit. The HR department can set up an onboarding flow in PayFit so that employees can request a computer, a badge, and enter personal information as soon as they join the company.</p>
<p>If you work for a big company that uses something like Workday, all of this probably sounds familiar. But PayFit targets small and medium companies that don’t want to sign expensive contracts with enterprise companies. It has attracted 5,000 clients that employ 100,000 employees overall — that’s an average of 20 employees per company. Some of the biggest clients include Revolut, Starling Bank and Treatwell.</p>
<p>The company is currently live in France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the U.K. It currently has 550 employees and it plans to hire another 250 employees in 2021 to support its growth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Many of us are working in distributed environments these days, and in the best scenarios, it might actually have improved rather than impeded our productivity. Today, a company that has built technology that taps into that concept as it applies to computing is announcing a large round of funding to boost its growth after a strong year of business.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.incredibuild.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Incredibuild</a>, an Israeli startup that provides a way for organizations to implement distributed computing architecture to speed up the processing needed for intensive tasks like software development by tapping into a company&#8217;s network of idle CPUs, has picked up $140 million in funding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Startup&#8221; might be overstating what Incredibuild is: yes it&#8217;s a privately backed tech company, but it has been around since 2000, and although it counts substantial companies like gaming giants Epic (the company behind Fortnite), Microsoft and Nintendo, as well as Amazon, Citibank, Adobe, Disney, Intel and Samsung among its 800 customers, it&#8217;s been somewhat quiet and under the radar.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>The company will be using the funding to continue building out its technology and its business model to apply to a wider range of enterprises and use cases.</p>
<p>CEO Tami Mazel Shachar said in an interview that the key concept that Incredibuild created was an efficient way of tapping CPU power in a network of computers regardless of whether they are on-premises or in the cloud. That technology is priced on a per-use basis but implementing it, Shachar said, brings down a company&#8217;s overall computing and equipment costs, and can speed up builds by 8X.</p>
<p>As you can see <a href="https://www.incredibuild.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, you Incredibuild not available to punters in easy-to-understand tiers: you need to get in touch with the company to sign up. The plan will be to device and list new pricing tiers, including a freemium tier to bring in more and smaller developer teams.</p>
<p>This round of financing is the first substantial outside investment made in the company since it was picked up by private equity firm Fortissimo in 2018. It comes from a single backer, Insight Partners, and represents a partial spinning out of the business, effectively back into startup mode. From what we understand, Incredibuild was already generating a lot of cash &#8212; hence no big fundraising history &#8212; and while it is not disclosing its valuation now, we understand from reliable sources that it is between $300 million and $400 million.</p>
<p>Incredibuild was started by two engineers, Uri Mishol and Uri Shaham, who first thought of the concept of speeding up software development processing through a distributed model when they were still in the Israeli army, working in the special forces and finding the processing times for their work to be much too slow, even on the most advanced machines (both are no longer actively involved in the company although both support it, Shachar said).</p>
<p>The company found early traction with games companies, whose heavy use of media required lots of code processing; longer term other companies that deal in with graphics, AR, VR, artificial intelligence and other work-intensive loads came to the company as well.</p>
<p>Of course, there are a number of other solutions being built to speed up workloads, from improving processors on devices, through to other devops and workload plays such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/07/continuous-delivery-pioneer-circleci-scores-100m-series-e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CircleCI</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/27/cloudbees-raises-62m-for-its-devops-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CloudBees</a>, and many more. Nor is distributed computing a new concept: it&#8217;s the basis of a lot of peer-to-peer architectures such as those devised early on by the likes of BitTorrent, and it&#8217;s equally something that has been taken up by the blockchain community.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Shachar told me that Incredibuild itself does not own any patents on what it has built.</p>
<p>&#8220;The barriers are in the technology itself,&#8221; she said. &#8220;At the end of the day, the IP is in how good we do what we do. It would take many years to try to copy what we have built and we are building on those hooks more now.&#8221; It&#8217;s also adding in more integrations to improve and expand on all of the use cases for its technology.</p>
<p>For now, the basic idea is predicated on networks of computers that are idle within a specific team of users, and there are no plans for bringing that concept into a wider network of users as you might find in P2P networking models. The privacy issues, for one thing, are a non-starter, Shachar noted.</p>
<p>But, she hinted that there are some concepts in the works to improve processing power using its technology for some of its current partners&#8217; customers. It&#8217;s interesting to remember that Microsoft, owner of Azure, and Amazon, owner of AWS, are both in Incredibuild&#8217;s client list. Watch this space.</p>
<p>Insight is notable for its other investments in DevOps &#8212; its portfolio includes both containerization leader Docker and JFrog &#8212; and so it will also be interesting to see whether we see more alignment with these.</p>
<p>“We firmly believe that Incredibuild has built a crucial technology for any business that wants to develop better software, radically faster,” said Teddie Wardi, MD at Insight Partners, in a statement. “With our long history of investing in the development ecosystem, we are confident that Incredibuild will continue to innovate and build upon their recent momentum.”  Both Wardi and MD Lonne Jaffe as well as senior associate Brad Fiedler are joining Incredibuild’s board.</p>
<p>Fortissimo is staying on as a shareholder in the company.</p>
<p>“Fortissimo bought Incredibuild in 2018 with belief in the enormous potential of distributed processing,” said Yoav Hineman, Partner at Fortissimo Capital and board member of Incredibuild, in a statement. “The investment by Insight Partners is a great milestone in delivering unparalleled acceleration for software developers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.dijanow.com/">Dija</a>, the London-based grocery delivery startup backed by Blossom Capital, Creandum and Index Ventures, has acquired Cambridge, U.K.-based Genie, in what looks in part like an acqui-hire.</p>
<p>The deal, for which terms remain undisclosed, will see Genie founders Tim Chan and Callum MacBeth join the Dija team and also includes company assets. Having launched Genie in Cambridge, a U.K. city known for its university, they&#8217;ll be tasked with supporting Dija&#8217;s growth outside of London.</p>
<p>Founded by Alberto Menolascina and Yusuf Saban, who both spent a number of years at Deliveroo in senior positions, Dija launched in London earlier this month and is just one of a host of European startups that promise to deliver grocery and other convenience store items on-demand. They do this by building out their own hyper-local, delivery-only fulfilment centres — so-called “dark stores” — and recruiting their own delivery personnel. This full-stack or vertical approach and the visibility it provides is then supposed to produce enough supply chain and logistics efficiency to make the unit economics work, although that part is far from proven.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Other dark store operators include Berlin’s Flink, which has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/02/flink/">raised $52 million in seed financing</a> in a mixture of equity and debt, and Berlin HQ’d <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/11/gorillas/">Gorillas</a>, which has raised $44 million in Series A funding and recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/turkey-getir-int-idUSKBN29O1E7">expanded to London</a> in addition to Germany and Netherlands. Also operating in London are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/05/london-based-weezy-raises-seed/">Weezy</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/turkey-getir-int-idUSKBN29O1E7">Getir</a>, and <a href="https://tryzapp.com/">Zapp</a>, with Jiffy <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/jiffy-grocery/">expected to launch soon</a>. The U.S. unicorn goPuff is also reportedly looking to expand into Europe and has held<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/15/go-fancy/"> talks to acquire or invest in the U.K.’s Fancy</a>.</p>
<p>Dija currently has four warehouse hubs operating in South Kensington, Fulham, Islington and Hackney that deliver groceries and other convenience products within a claimed 10 minutes. It plans to open 20 further hubs, covering central London and Zone 2, by the summer. Each hub carries around 2,000 products, claiming to be sold at “recommended retail prices”. A flat delivery fee of £1.99 is charged per order.</p>
<p>In a statement, Dija co-founder and CEO Alberto Menolascina said: “Our ambitions aren’t limited to inside the M25. I’m delighted that Tim and Callum are joining the Dija family to ensure more people can access this reliable and efficient service across the UK and Europe.”</p>
<p>Adds Genie co-founder and CEO Tim Chan: &#8220;We&#8217;re excited to join forces with the team at Dija and continue our shared mission to bring everyday items to your door in a matter of minutes. For our existing customer base this deal means access to more products, better prices and even faster delivery times. We&#8217;ve had a tremendous response in Cambridge so far, and look forward to bringing Dija to many more regions across the U.K. in the coming months.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Zoom, Microsoft and Google all rocketed to the top of the charts in the virtual meetings stakes during the pandemic but a plucky startup from Norway had others ideas. Video meeting startup <a href="https://whereby.com/">Whereby</a> has now raised $12 million from German VC <a href="https://www.pointnine.com/">Point Nine</a>, SaaStr fund and a group of more than 20 angel investors.</p>
<p>Angels investors include Josh Buckley(CEO, Producthunt), Elizabeth Yin (Hustlefund) and Jason M. Lemkin (founder of Saastr).</p>
<p>Øyvind Reed, CEO at Whereby said in a statement: “The past year has led many of us to question the future of work, with video meetings set to remain a big part of our lives. More than ever, the tools we use to connect have to enable effective and enjoyable meetings, providing focus, collaboration and wellbeing. .”</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Whereby’s platform has three pricing plans (including free) and allows users to embed tools like Google Docs, Trello and Miro directly in their meetings, unlike other video platforms.</p>
<p>Whereby was demonstrated to me by co-founder Ingrid Ødegaard on a coffee table during 2016’s Oslo Innovation Week. I immediately set-up my username, which has existed even as the startup changed it name from Appear.in. Ingrid told me during an interview that they &#8220;tried to be much more human-centric and really focus on some of the human problems that come with collaborating remotely. One of the big mistakes that a lot of people making is just replicating the behavior that they had in the office… whereas we think that you actually need to work in a fundamentally different way. We want to help people do that and by making it really easy to jump in and have a meeting when you need to. But our goal is not to push people to have more meetings, quite the opposite.”</p>
<p>The startup’s secret weapon is enterprise integrations. If you had a video meeting with a UK GP over video in the last year it was probably over Whereby (indeed, mine was!). Whereby won a contract with the NHS for its remote video patient consultations during the pandemic. Competitors for this include Jitsi and AccurX. The company claims it saw a 450% increase in users across 150 countries last year.</p>
<p>“Last year we saw the mass adoption of video meetings,” said Christoph Janz, Partner at Point Nine. “Now it’s about taking the user experience to the next level and Whereby will be leading that charge. It’s amazing to see a Scandinavian startup playing in the same league as the tech giants.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Video streaming platforms have signed up more subscribers during Covid-19 lockdowns, and that <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-video-streaming-market">growth is expected to continue after the pandemic</a>, showcasing more international content. When subtitles are well done, they don’t take audiences out of the immersive experience of a good show or movie. This means as content providers tackle worldwide expansion, demand for localization services, including translated subtitles, is also growing.<a href="https://www.iyunomg.com/"> Iyuno Media Group</a> is one of the largest media localization companies, and works with clients including Netflix, Apple iTunes, DreamWorks, HBO and Entertainment One.</p>
<p>A lot has changed since Iyuno was started in 2002 by executive chairman David Lee while he was an undergraduate in Seoul. Back then it provided mainly English to Korean subtitles for television networks. &#8220;I started the business in my last year of university and, of course, back then we didn’t have any video streaming services,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our client base was mostly local and some regional broadcasters.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Iyuno, whose investors include SoftBank Ventures Asia, provides localization services for about 600,000 hours of content on an annual basis, including translation, subtitling, dubbing, accessibility features and compliance with local content regulations, in more than 80 languages. It operates 35 facilities across 30 countries in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East. Iyuno also<a href="https://www.iyunomg.com/news/press-releases/iyuno-media-group-enters-agreement-to-acquire-sdi-media"> announced in January</a> that it has entered into an agreement with Imagica Group to acquire SDI Media, another localization provider.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>In order to make the current scale of its services possible, Iyuno built its own cloud-based enterprise resource planning software. The platform enables uploading of files from content providers, and includes features for time coding, translation, content and technical quality control, and distribution back to Iyuno&#8217;s clients. It onboards, trains and assesses new freelancers, and gives teams working on the same project a central base.</p>
<p>Iyuno also built its own neural machine translation engines, which are trained on data from specific genres (for example, drama, animation, comedies, horror and documentary), and help its teams work more accurately and quickly.</p>
<h3>Localizing entertainment in a more connected world</h3>
<p>Being able to guarantee consistent results with fast turnaround times is especially important now that OTT services are erasing international and cultural barriers between audiences, and the shows and movies they watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good shows, even in non-English languages, perform well in other countries,&#8221; said Lee. &#8220;Because of Covid, productions have been majorly affected. OTT providers need fresh content to keep subscribers and are licensing non-U.S. content in countries where it hadn’t been licensed a lot in the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>Parrot Analytics <a href="https://www.axios.com/americans-consuming-foreign-entertainment-content-8b793e14-f493-4c13-ba4f-e4bddd7a96e1.html">recently told Axios</a> that non-American shows accounted for nearly 30% of demand in the United States during the third-quarter of 2020. That trend began before the pandemic, but production shutdowns meant many networks and streaming services began showing more international content to meet audience demands.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="TgVpIOXJJ2"><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/pandemic-accelerated-cord-cutting-making-2020-the-worst-ever-year-for-pay-tv/">Pandemic accelerated cord cutting, making 2020 the worst-ever year for pay TV</a></p></blockquote>
<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" title="&#8220;Pandemic accelerated cord cutting, making 2020 the worst-ever year for pay TV&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch" src="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/21/pandemic-accelerated-cord-cutting-making-2020-the-worst-ever-year-for-pay-tv/embed/#?secret=TgVpIOXJJ2" data-secret="TgVpIOXJJ2" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means localization services are not only working with more shows and movies that were originally filmed in non-English languages, but also translating it into a wider array of languages, which involves a lot of teamwork.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a single language for a single hour of video running time, it usually takes around five or six different steps, and four or five different individuals,&#8221; including translators and quality control checkers, said Lee.</p>
<p>For content that is translated into a single other language, Iyuno hires people who can listen to the show and translate at the same time, without having to use a script. Files from Iyuno&#8217;s clients are uploaded onto its platform and proxy files are generated with watermarks and other security measures. Then the translator gets a link to the video. After they are done adding their translation, the subtitled content goes through a preset quality control process, and then is formatted and delivered back to the client.</p>
<p>The process for translating content into several different languages follows a similar procedure, except the original language is first transcribed into a script, and then sent to translators so they can work as a team. Then subtitled content is sent to a central quality control team to make sure it is consistent before being delivered to the client.</p>
<p>For some content, like live broadcasts or episodes of television dramas that are edited shortly before airing, Iyuno can provide very quick turnaround times, typically 24 hours, but sometimes as little as one or two hours. In those scenarios, Iyuno begins recording when the show starts airing. Then it divides the footage into 10-minute segments that are sent to teams of three people: a time coder, translator and quality control checker, who usually work from home and are logged into Iyuno&#8217;s ERP platform. It takes about an hour to translate each 10-minute section, so that means six teams are usually involved at the same time during an hour-long process.</p>
<h3>Preserving an immersive experience</h3>
<p>Quality control includes ensuring subtitles and other localization features for a show maintain consistent quality across languages, and also checking technical factors, since there are more than 100 subtitle formats. Iyuno&#8217;s quality checkers make sure subtitles are placed unobtrusively on the screen, don’t obscure important details and avoid overlapping between dialogue from different characters or scenes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We like to have buffers because reading speed is usually slower than hearing speed,&#8221; said Lee. Iyuno&#8217;s platform has scene detection tools, which analyzes video and automatically organizes subtitles so they don&#8217;t roll over into another scene.</p>
<p>Creating accessibility features currently accounts for about 5% to 10% of Iyuno&#8217;s business and is growing. That includes audio descriptions for people with visual impairments, which means adding narration that describes what is happening on screen, and closed captions with descriptions of all the sounds that are happening in a show.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a growing demand and it’s very important for clients, who are keen to serve those audiences,&#8221; said Lee.</p>
<p>One of the things translators need to do when working on shows is to keep the original intent of the creator in languages with different colloquialisms or cultural nuances.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a subtitler, and it’s usually not a very dry job of translating the foreign language into ours, or the other way around,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;It’s really immersing yourself into the content, so at times you forget to translate because you’re watching the show and understanding the feeling, laughs, sadness or character dynamics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iyuno&#8217;s machine translation engines are able to help with the process by performing the initial translation, so human translators can focus more on a show’s creative aspects.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s more a subjective and qualitative thing. It’s hard to put into technical words, but we try to find efficiencies to reinforce that creativity,&#8221; Lee added. &#8220;At the same time, most of our translators had that learning and experience before they came to the company, so they’re aware that those are aspects they need to deal with and, in many cases, I think that’s where a machine can never substitute a human.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">This Friday, the European Commission will be launching a ‘legislative instrument’ called the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/startup-europe">EU Startup Nations Standard</a> (SNS) at its annual <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/events/digital-day-2021">Digital Day</a>. Now, before you think I&#8217;m about to bore you to death, you might like to know that the SNS is a <em>huge political initiative</em>. It will aim to make the European Union the most attractive place to create a startup, in comparison with obvious global leaders like the US. Therefore, its significance is not to be underestimated.</p>
<p>The idea is for EU Member States to implement a set of ‘best practice’ policies for startups (many of which already exist in parts of the EU), ranging from startup visas to better implementation of stock options in company law. If EU member states all sign up to the EU’s ideas, the hope is that startups get better conditions, stay in the EU rather than leaving for the US (or, now, the UK&#8230;) and the SNS will mean more peer-pressure between Member States to get all these conditions right.</p>
<p>Sources close to the European Commission tell me that the &#8211; yet unreleased &#8211; SNS will be wide-ranging and call on EU member states to implement several startup-friendly policies, launched during the Portuguese Presidency of the EU, a country where startups are now <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/07/lisbons-startup-scene-rises-as-portugal-gears-up-to-be-a-european-tech-tiger/">flourishing</a>. Member States which become signatories of the Standard will be expected to deliver on a number of policy areas.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>I have seen leaked drafts of the SNS and it clearly includes some big proposals, assuming they are all contained in the final, published draft. They include the expectation that signatories will need to change national rules around stock options to ensure employee share ownership is not subject to capital gains tax until the moment of cash receipt. They will also need to allow startups to issue stock options with non-voting rights; fast-track the process of creating a new company to within one day for 100 EUR; accelerate visa processing for tech talent from outside the EU, and incentivize the return of EU tech-talent. There is also an exhortation to leverage the €750bn of Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) to support startups, and reduce regulatory red tape and the create regulatory sandboxes. For many EU countries, it should be relatively easy, for others, there will be some legislative hurdles to leap. But most observers say these provisions are over-due and necessary.</p>
<p>EU-based campaign groups are, generally speaking, wildly in favor of the SNS. <a href="https://alliedforstartups.org/">Allied For Startups</a> tells me they are “enthusiastic about the potential of the instrument”. They say the provisions are a collection of best practices that already exist, challenge member states to do more, and set ‘binary challenges’ that states can either fulfill or not (like launch a startup online in a day). But that depends if all the things they hope for come to pass. They are waiting with bated breath to find out if the provisions have been watered down or how many Member States sign up to it all.</p>
<p>There are other groups that are enthusiastic but also concerned. <a href="https://www.notoptional.eu">Not Optional</a>, a policy initiative funded by Index Ventures, has, this week, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jwXuER105ZW8PtK5vZk9G0ryUwcSUwA9kU25TYm0udI/edit">published an open letter</a> signed by many of Europe’s leading investors, startup associations and entrepreneurs including those who founded Stripe, Personio, Klarna, Wise, Trustpilot, UiPath and Alan.</p>
<p>The letter welcomes the EU’s Startup Nations Standard, in particular its specific recommendations to Member States on “changes to stock options rules designed to help startups attract talent, speed up tech visas targeting and procurement.”</p>
<p>However, the group is also urging EU Member States to turn the recommendations into actual national legislation, and not just stay on the books at the EU Commission.</p>
<p>Not Optional points out that its own <a href="https://www.notoptional.eu/en/country-ranking">ranking</a> of European nations’ stock options policies showed dramatically stark differences around how EU members states treat the issues, with, for instance, Latvia, Estonia and France ranking highly, while founders in Germany, Spain, and Belgium still face barriers when they try to use stock options to incentivize staff and attract talent.</p>
<p>But we are not out of the woods yet.</p>
<p>While there is enthusiasm emanating from the corridors of Brussels, my sources tell me that some countries, such as Germany, may be looking to water the SNS down in some aspects. In particular, Germany has been kicking up a fuss about the startup-in-a-day provision, on the grounds that identity checks may take longer. Given the UK, an EU member until only recently, has had this capability for at least 10 years, Germany&#8217;s protestations seem somewhat over-egged.</p>
<p>All eyes will be on the announcement on Friday.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://techpoint.africa/2019/09/19/crowdyvest-holding-launches-bus-hailing-service-plentywaka/">Plentywaka</a>, a Nigerian bus-booking platform, today announced that it has </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been accepted</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> into the <a href="https://www.techstars.com/accelerators/toronto">Techstars Toronto</a> accelerator program</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will join nine other startups in the class of 2021 and secure funding from the accelerator as it sets its sights on global expansion</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Lagos-based company, founded by <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/onyekaakumah">Onyeka Akumah</a>, <a href="https://ng.linkedin.com/in/johnny-enagwolor-99b83766">Johnny Ena</a>, John Shaibu and Afolabi Oluseyi, operates an &#8216;Uber-for-buses&#8217; model connecting commuters with buses via an app</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plentywaka launched in September 2019, and in the first two months, moved an average of six people daily, according to CEO Akumah. By its sixth month, this number increased to about 1,500 daily, and the company completed more than 100,000 rides within that timeframe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then in March 2020, the pandemic-induced lockdown hit businesses across Lagos and other states within Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the nature of its business, Plentywaka had to make a slight pivot and began transporting essential services across Lagos, especially food items</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It also opened a logistics service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the lockdown eased across the city and commuting resumed, the company moved 60% capacity while the operational cost remained the same</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Although g</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">rowth was steady and picking up, the company started seeking external investment. It</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> received $300,000 <a href="https://techpoint.africa/2020/08/04/bus-booking-platform-plentywaka-raises-300k-pre-seed-funding-as-it-expands-to-abuja/">pre-seed</a> from its parent company, EMFATO and other early-stage investors like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/25/early-stage-african-vc-firm-microtraction-reports-portfolio-boom-despite-the-weight-of-covid-19/">Microtraction</a> and Niche Capital in August</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Backed with the new funding, Plentywaka has since doubled down on its core offering &#8212; transporting people via buses</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The logistics arm that it launched, as well as a car service, have since </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">been shuttered</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akumah says the focus on a primary offering has paid a dividend. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company has expanded its intrastate services into two other cities in Nigeria including the country&#8217;s capital city, Abuja and has moved about 300,000 people</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following this announcement though, there are immediate plans to launch an interstate service across different cities in Nigeria</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This service will see Plentywaka partner with some major bus travel companies, which </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">collectively</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have more than 2000 buses and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ply</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over 100 routes in the country</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plentywaka acts as an aggregator, and commuters can see options of various transport companies, compare fares, and book on its platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Plentywaka is getting to a point where we&#8217;re now becoming more like an aggregator as we onboard transportation companies on our platform</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Interstate travel in Nigeria is data insufficient, and we want to be the first company to solve this.&#8221; Ena, co-founder and president of Plentywaka, said to TechCrunch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to this and the new capital from Techstars, Plentywaka is looking to scale its platform across Africa and North America</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Akumah says this global expansion plan will start with a city in Canada, most likely Toronto, on or before Q4 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://ca.linkedin.com/in/sunilsharmats">Sunil Sharma</a>, the managing director of Techstars Toronto, confirmed this to TechCrunch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Sharma, Techstars is backing the Nigerian mobility startup because it&#8217;s solving a massive problem in Nigeria that can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be likened</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to urban transportation challenges in other populated cities worldwide</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We know that Western cities have legacy transportation systems. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">However</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there are many transportation challenges, even in a city like Toronto,&#8221; he said</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">we think </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">that Plentywaka&#8217;s technology and approach in improving the lives of citizens and their daily commute needs can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">be brought</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over to cities in the West </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">just</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as they are in Africa</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plentywaka plans to launch its intracity service first after engaging the country&#8217;s necessary stakeholders before introducing the intercity model</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharma thinks that most cities in Canada aren&#8217;t well serviced by buses, leading to a broken intercity transit infrastructure. Plentywaka&#8217;s presence will bring the much-needed option the city deserves, he says</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Cities and towns here should have bus connectivity, but they quite </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">simply</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> don&#8217;t have it, and my view is that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the arrival of Plentywaka will be an immediate option to the status quo. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will also resonate with people as a way to supplement existing transportation options,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; he said.</span></p>
<p>Techstars&#8217; relationship with Akumah also proved crucial in Plentywaka&#8217;s acceptance into the accelerator<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A second-time Techstars-backed founder, Akumah co-founded Farmcrowdy, a Nigerian digital agriculture platform in 2016</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having gone through the accelerator&#8217;s Atlanta program four years ago with the agritech startup, Akumah is doing the same with Plentywaka. He doubles as CEO at both companies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The serial founder said the relationship with Techstars is one reason the company is expanding to Canada instead of neighbouring African countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;If the opportunity we have in Toronto right now to expand was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">similar to</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> what we had in Ghana or South Africa, of course we&#8217;ll be having those conversations already</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when we have the support system from Techstars, Sunil, and regulators in Toronto without even putting feet on the ground, I mean that makes it exciting for us to expand to Canada,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8221; the CEO remarked.</span></p>
<p>Nigerian or African startups, in general, rarely make their way into Canada. Plentywaka is on the verge of doing so, and <span style="font-weight: 400;">it will be looking to close a seed round from investors to carry out these expansion plans and further improve its technology</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">About four years ago, social impact organization <a href="https://www.norrsken.org/">Norrsken Foundation</a> launched a small program investing around €30 million in capital it had received from its wealthy patron, Klarna co-founder Niklas Adalberth.</p>
<p>Now, that initiative has become its own impact investment firm, <a href="https://www.norrsken.vc/">Norrsken VC</a> and, according to people familiar with the firm, is about to close on its first independent investment vehicle &#8212; a €125 million ($149) fund focused on investing in startups that are, as its website suggests, &#8220;solving the world&#8217;s biggest problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>Norrsken VC did not respond for a request for comment about the firm&#8217;s fundraising plans.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Already, the young firm has invested in companies that would be standouts among any venture capital portfolio. Norrsken VC is one of the early backers behind Northvolt, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/swedish-battery-manufacturer-northvolt-receives-a-14-billion-order-from-vw/">which just received a $14 billion order for its batteries</a> for electric vehicles from Volkswagen.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>Electrification is actually a big theme for the early-stage firm, which counts the electric plane technology developer, <a href="https://heartaerospace.com/">Heart Aerospace</a>, and autonomous electric vehicle developer <a href="https://www.einride.tech/">Einride</a>, and the battery monitoring and data management startup, <a href="https://www.nortical.com/">Nortical</a>, among its other portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Einride scored another huge coup recently. TechCrunch reported that the company was close to closing on $75 million in new funding <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/08/while-eyeing-a-spac-swedish-autonomous-ev-company-einride-nears-75-million-in-new-funding/">even as it explored a potential SPAC for its business</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, Norrsken Foundation&#8217;s work in investing presaged a surge in climate and sustainability-focused activity from both venture investors, public markets and entrepreneurs looking at how to aid in the transition from fossil fuels to renewable resources and other zero carbon sources of energy.</p>
<p>That thesis on energy consumption extends to other areas of the firm&#8217;s portfolio, including companies like the energy efficient data center designer and technology developer, <a href="https://submer.com/">Submer</a>.</p>
<div class="embed breakout">

<p>If electrification and efficiency are one area of focus in the climate fight, Norrsken has also made moves to combat waste and improve efficiency in the food chain, as well. It&#8217;s probably the largest area of focus for the firm&#8217;s current portfolio outside of electrification, and there appear to be some early winners emerging in that category.</p>
<p>Those range from startups focused on agriculture like WeFarm and Ignitia, to consumer waste in the food industry through investments in Olio, Matsmart and Whywaste.</p>
<p>Taken together the climate and sustainability thesis has been the largest and most opportune investment target, but healthcare and wellness are also within the firm&#8217;s investment mandate. Startups like <a href="https://winningtemp.com/">Winningtemp</a> are an interesting indication of the firm&#8217;s thesis. That startup provides ways to monitor and support employees&#8217; mental health.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p id="speakable-summary">Uber said Tuesday that drivers in the UK who use its ride-hailing app will be treated as workers, a designation that will give them some benefits such as holiday pay. However, even as Uber seemingly concedes to a Supreme Court ruling last month, a new fight could already be brewing over the company&#8217;s decision to calculate working time from the point a trip commences &#8212; rather than when drivers log on to the app.</p>
<p>Uber said that beginning Wednesday all drivers in the UK will be paid holiday time based on 12.07% of their earnings, which will be paid out every two weeks. Drivers will also be paid at least the minimum wage (called the National Living Wage) after accepting a trip request and after expenses, Uber said in a statement. Eligible drivers in the UK will automatically be enrolled into a pension plan with contributions from Uber. These contributions will represent approximately 3% of a driver&#8217;s earnings.</p>
<p>In the UK, there are three designations: self-employed, employed and worker. The &#8220;workers&#8221; designation doesn&#8217;t make them employees, but it is still entitles them to the minimum wage, holiday pay, and, if eligible, a pension.</p><div class="piano-inline-promo"></div>
<p>Uber said Tuesday that based on current expectations, the company is not changing its previously announced expectations for Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter or for 2021.</p>
<p>Uber has been entangled in fight over worker classification in the UK <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/28/uber-loses-employment-tribunal-in-the-uk/">since 2016</a>. Last month, the UK&#8217;s Supreme Court dismissed Uber&#8217;s appeal, which reaffirmed earlier rulings that drivers using the app are workers and not independent contractors. With no place to turn, Uber has conceded — sort of. Uber will only guarantee that drivers&#8217; working time and other benefits will accrue once they accept a trip and not based on when they have signed into the app to begin working. That already has labor activists fuming.</p>
<p>&#8220;While we welcome Uber’s decision to finally commit to paying minimum wage, holiday pay and pensions we observe that they have arrived to the table with this offer a day late and a dollar short, literally,&#8221; according to a statement from the App Drivers &amp; Couriers Union and signed by James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam, the two drivers who brought a case against Uber. &#8220;The Supreme Court ruled that drivers are to be recognized as workers with entitlements to the minimum wage and holiday pay to accrue on working time from log on to log off whereas Uber is committing only to these entitlements to accrue from time of trip acceptance to drop off. This means that Uber drivers will be still short-changed to the tune of 40-50%. Also, it is not acceptable for Uber to unilaterally decide the driver expense base in calculating minimum wage. This must be subject to collective agreement.</p>
<p>While Uber undoubtedly has made progress here, we cannot accept anything less than full compliance with legal minimums. We would also expect to see Uber make progress towards trade union recognition, a fair dismissals appeals process and a data access agreement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Farrar told TechCrunch that the issue has not been resolved. The next step will be to go back to the Employment Tribunal to ensure that drivers are paid what they are legally entitled to,</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;">Even as Uber deals with continued labor issues in the UK, the company will likely turn much of its attention to cases are still playing out in courts in other European countries — decisions which could put pressure on Uber&#8217;s bottom line. Meanwhile, EU lawmakers are also consulting on how to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/24/europe-kicks-off-bid-to-find-a-route-to-better-gig-work/">improve conditions for gig workers</a> so Uber&#8217;s concession in the UK is likely feed into pan-EU negotiations.</span></p>
